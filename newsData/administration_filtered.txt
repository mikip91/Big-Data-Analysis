Mueller reaching determination leaves door open Barr come say Mueller make determination issue obstruction collusion going look facts And makes determination case made issues The problem though perception Mueller independent investigator inquiry free politics made call central question But Barr president appointee months making decision question fix Why Mueller come answer attorney general

view executive power Democrats made famous wrote memo appointed attorney general arguing certain acts president construed obstruction justice They part executive powers And looked mean make decision

associates feel essentially work misrepresentative give full picture believe damaging president attorney general letter lets Now saying every member Mueller team frustrated know Bob Mueller thinks remains one black boxes center investigation But members team involved decision making around issues talking watched disappointed angry characterized michael barbaroAnd focus disappointment degree understand nicholas fandosSo read Bill Barr concise four page letter frustrated drawn work And fact discovered reporting piece prepared summaries work part report handed Justice Department couple weeks ago felt material easily drawn Barr handed made decision whether president obstructed justice criminal sense concurrent put evidence analysis fill public picture The Justice Department says summaries sensitive information classified information secretive grand jury information become public ultimately use michael schmidtSo Mueller folks essentially saying hey wrote summaries going say

anything wrong michael schmidtDonald Trump come days Barr declaration Mueller report beautiful And completely exonerates investigator spent last two years looking Donald Trump think lot questionable behavior something going irritate mightily michael barbaroI mean either think Mueller people legitimate point classic case pride authorship They wanted see work public summary nicholas fandosI think fully know What seems clear reporting specific communication agreement Mueller team Barr team use things things They seem intention And certainly regret But know interaction actual decision making process happened weekend two weeks ago michael barbaroWell think Barr chose include summaries especially negative material four page summary michael schmidtI think one big broad reason another contemporary reason broad reason Barr many Justice Department officials many years prosecutors believe decide charge someone fruits investigation thrown public enemies person investigated michael barbaroDirty laundry aired subject dirty laundry charged crime michael schmidtIf meet incredibly high bar bringing federal prosecution mean get take trash throw street let public rummage michael barbaroAnd Mike contemporary example referred assuming talking James Comey michael schmidtI talking July 2016 press conference James Comey held right heat presidential election stands says done investigation Hillary Clinton use private email account think case made But found questionable behavior handled sensitive national security secrets The press conference seen damaging Clinton even though case never made michael barbaroAnd saying Barr view going one replicate drawing Mueller team summaries putting public sphere michael schmidtCorrect use criminal investigations find damaging things may crimes simply release public used someone nicholas fandosThe problem never normal average criminal investigation broad national security implications And implications almost every decision made highest levels government michael schmidtThis pathway deal president conduct And appears Mueller side saying look president United States There conduct think public Congress see And Justice Department may criminal But president And needs examined thoroughly political process Congress pathway dealing president nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr seem disagree fundamentally throughout wants make much report public possible But think absolves Justice Department role saying whether president campaign broke law And grappling Justice Department aversion talk individuals saying broke law But yet knows public Congress probably owed information happen And kind operating somewhere middle two things michael schmidtThe difference investigation Justice Department determined break law process really needs dealt Maybe company needs decide whether get fired conduct instance another issue president president break law But maybe president things power public know Congress know need closely examined Because maybe breaking law conducted president And Congress need deal And starting see Mueller side frustration hey think bad stuff happened But Barr coming disclosing saying president break law casting die public later look president conduct say several weeks finished report thing Bill Barr saying president break law president turning around saying fully exonerated And saying hey America think process needs play michael barbaroRight michael schmidtSo comes vexing question investigate sitting president And done way public utmost confidence And tension much independence investigator Nixon pendulum swung far president direction Starr investigation Clinton went way The investigator much power And Mueller Barr teams fighting fight different understandings dealt And issue looking years latest episode michael barbaroSo inside one presidential investigation two teams embodying tensions basically present since Watergate nicholas fandosCorrect michael schmidtIt much tell public apparent misconduct president dealt And clear pathway whatever Barr viewed one side political laying brakes president Whatever Mueller viewed president enemies trying get And confidence process erodes And messy And hard figure What real facts What really happened michael barbaroBut point talking summary Bill Barr sent Congress still waiting full report tension describing eventually less resolved learn much information ultimately access nicholas fandosIt may And may see different set facts end day But think question sets narrative intervening period time may end month see fuller version
