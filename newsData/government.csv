And while Israel has a strategy for addressing the first threat, it has no strategy for addressing the second. One reason it doesn’t — in my view — is because of a third existential threat to Israel. And that threat is from America — particularly from President Trump, but also from pro-Israel lawmakers in Congress and from Aipac, the main Israel lobbying organization.","Everyone is getting what they want, at the expense of the Jewish state.","23","The New York Times","2019-03-25T10:00:04+0000","article","OpEd","Opinion",NA,"Op-Ed","5c998be640d36ff0709cfac6",1497,"nyt://article/7772db00-ae09-5f75-b2f9-351afaeaf57c","Trump and Congress: Loving Israel to Death",NA,NA,"America Risks Loving Israel to Death",NA,NA,NA,"By Thomas L.

In recent years, Africa Command has acknowledged using unmanned MQ-9 Reaper drones, which are mainly armed with Hellfire missiles and 500-pound guided bombs. But as far back as November 2017, the Pentagon deployed Air Force variants of C-130 Hercules cargo planes with dispensers called common launch tubes, or C.L.T.s, to launch a new kind of guided weapon at Somali targets, according to a report released by Amnesty International on March 20. While Africa Command would not confirm to The Times its use of ground-attack aircraft in the region, Amnesty International found photographs of an American airstrike site that showed the remains of a GBU-69 Small Glide Munition, a bomb that can be dropped only using a C.L.T., which in this instance was fitted to an AC-130 gunship.","The United States has been dropping munitions on Shabab insurgents in Somalia using a dispenser called the common launch tube, which could enable the Pentagon to turn virtually any aircraft into a high-tech gunship.",NA,"The New York Times","2019-03-27T09:00:01+0000","article","Magazine","Magazine",NA,"News","5c9c2b8040d36ff0709d011a",1230,"nyt://article/bfa1fa38-072a-50d0-b9cf-23d92a685349","This New Generation of Weapons Could Mean More Covert Airstrikes Around the World","at War",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"By John Ismay",NA

In “Get Out,” a young black man meets a group of white people who buy — at auction — younger, healthier black bodies. What makes “Get Out” so powerful is how Peele marshals a classic tale of unwilling bodily possession into a resonant, unsettling metaphor for the sweep of black and white relations in the United States — the U.S., or us.","The director of “Get Out” returns with a horror movie about a family terrorized by weird doubles.
