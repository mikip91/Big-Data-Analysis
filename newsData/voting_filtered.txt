Trump plan replace Obamacare promised unveil immediately 2020 elections But recently endorsed several proposals provide clues Over last two weeks sought emphasize health care issue set bruising legislative defeats 2017 directed Justice Department defend Affordable Care Act legal challenge And issued statements tweets calling Republicans become party health care moment many party leaders hoped focus different issues began reprising various promises future plan repeal replace parts Affordable Care Act might achieve The plan short specifics come far lower premiums costs deductibles week series tweets promised Republican health plan protect Americans pre existing health conditions major concern voters Democrats effectively exploited 2018 midterm elections After election President Trump made similar promises saying Republican proposal far less expensive far better Obamacare The legislation came later earned endorsement made insurance less expensive certain groups young high income healthy Americans The bills eliminated coverage millions people scaling back Medicaid made harder pre existing illnesses older low incomes find meaningful affordable options get insurance work The three senators chosen lead effort Bill Cassidy Louisiana John Barrasso Wyoming Rick Scott Florida far declined point many specifics When asked Obamacare replacement week mentioned modest bills reduce health care costs emergency room drugstore fourth senator president mentioned majority leader Mitch McConnell Kentucky even clear little interest pursuing comprehensive health care legislation One clue Trump thinking choice Cassidy Along Senator Lindsey Graham South Carolina author legislative plan received scrutiny 2017 never came vote Another hint found president budget released reinvigorated health care push third draft proposal developed group conservative Washington policy groups The Graham Cassidy billThe president spoken fondly several times proposal enough support Congress advance vote eliminate current programs funding Obamacare Medicaid expansion covers working poor insurance subsidies helping low middle income Americans buy insurance Instead money grouped together parceled states use service health care programs favor The legislation attaches rules money used must toward health care example main goal provide states maximum flexibility develop local innovative solutions Some experts worry states struggle develop plans bill abbreviated timetable That flexibility allow states chose waive Obamacare rules plans must cover standard set medical benefits insurers must charge prices customers different health histories easy states circumvent current protections Americans pre existing conditions That ability odds president recent promises protect rules The bill restructure Medicaid program even populations enrolled program Obamacare The bill formula allocating money among states lead big redistributions generally taking money away states expanded Medicaid toward restrict growth block grants time Those funding formulas technical make big difference impact program result substantial funding shortfalls several large states nearly immediately leave nearly every state funding crunch long term The budgetBecause 2020 White House budget developed published White House perhaps useful clue president imagines world without Obamacare Like Graham Cassidy proposal includes block grants states replace Obamacare coverage expansion replaces remainder Medicaid set fixed payments states But rate different grants grow time even smaller legislation make system efficient The budget vague sorts insurance regulations allowed note tenth funds need set aside people pre existing conditions sign states allowed exclude people mainstream insurance markets The conservative coalition proposalA group conservative health policy experts including Heritage Foundation developed health care proposal shares basic structure two systems described hand states blocks money rules encourage develop health care systems The rules conservative plan differ bit Graham Cassidy The plan require government subsidized systems offer every American choice private health plan requirement probably foreclose liberal state enacting single payer program might require restructuring state run Medicaid programs The plan shies away specifying funding formulas say block money divvied among states though says states low income residents get bigger share specify precisely quickly pot money grow time Like budget proposal nods concerns Americans pre existing conditions encouraging states develop special programs high risk pools insure people expensive health needs But encourages insurance strategies discounts young customers stripped benefit plans tend make mainstream insurance less useful people serious health needs The proposal leaves legacy Medicaid program That choice neutralizes one possible political line attack But substantially diminishes program possible cost savings The court case Affordable Care Act decided judiciary timetable clear long White House may develop replacement plan But since certainly least months time develop new proposal aligned president recent promises Doing easy however Health care United States expensive means health plans cover everyone low deductibles likely costly The block grant plans president admired reduce rather increase current federal spending health care Looser rules health insurance likely increase costs customers unfortunate enough need care That makes block grant approach troublesome fit president stated desire system Americans find far less expensive much usable Obamacare

Across decade preceded Donald Trump election American politicians parties consistently tried pass big sweeping immigration bills legalize country illegal population increase immigration overall These
