WASHINGTON   The Trump administration s surprise decision to press for a court ordered demolition of the Affordable Care Act came after a heated meeting in the Oval Office on Monday  where the president s acting chief of staff and others convinced him that he could do through the courts what he could not do through Congress  repeal his predecessor s signature achievement Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff and former South Carolina congressman  had spent years in the House saying that the health law should be repealed  and his handpicked head of the Domestic Policy Council  Joe Grogan  supported the idea of joining a Republican attorneys general lawsuit to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act That suit  and the Justice Department  initially pressed to nullify only the part of the law that forces insurance companies to cover people with pre existing medical conditions as well as a suite of health benefits deemed  essential   such as pregnancy and maternal health  mental health and prescription drugs But a district judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was rendered unconstitutional when President Trump s tax law brought the tax penalty for not having health insurance to zero  and the administration faced a choice  stick with its more limited intervention or back the judge s decision Mr  Trump has declared that he has kept his promises  Mr  Mulvaney and Mr  Grogan argued  and as a candidate he campaigned on repealing the health law  His base of voters would love it  Besides  they argued  Democrats have been campaigning successfully on health care  and Republicans should try to claim the issue for themselves  This could force the matter Among those with concerns was Pat Cipollone  the White House counsel  who shared that the new attorney general  William P  Barr  opposed such a move  Vice President Mike Pence was worried about the political ramifications of moving ahead without a strategy or a plan to handle the millions who could be left suddenly uninsured if the suit succeeded The health and human services secretary  Alex M  Azar II  was on speakerphone during the meeting and also voiced concern about the move  people familiar with the call said  And Marc Short  Mr  Pence s chief of staff  suggested that it was risky for Mr  Trump s administration to be at odds with so many Republican attorneys general on such a key issue But Mr  Trump had been sold  and on Monday night  the Justice Department issued a letter saying it supported the Texas judge s decision The blowback has been severe  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the House Republican leader  who is close with Mr  Trump  had privately warned the president not to interrupt the  victory lap  he should be taking after the delivery of the report by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  Mr  Mueller  according to a letter by Mr  Barr  found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government The reaction was even more intense in the Senate  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  had planned to use the week to publicize his floor vote to force Democrats to take a stand on progressives  Green New Deal   an important party building exercise for Republicans after Mr  Trump s decision to declare an emergency at the border sparked an insurrection in their ranks this month Members of Mr  McConnell s leadership team were incensed at Mr  Mulvaney and allies like the acting White House budget director  Russell Vought  for rekindling a fight that served Democrats so well in 2018 and could harm vulnerable incumbents in 2020  according to two senior aides with direct knowledge of the situation  The maneuver may make it much less likely that Mr  Vought  the chief of staff s handpicked successor to head the Office of Management and Budget  will be confirmed by the Senate  the aides said And Democrats pressed their advantage  The equivalent of a nuclear bomb fell on our country when the president said what he said this week   Representative Anna G  Eshoo  Democrat of California  said Wednesday as her House subcommittee began pushing through health care legislation   This is deadly serious  But Mr  Trump doubled down while talking to reporters in the Oval Office  He predicted that the Texas decision would be upheld by the appeals court  then go to the Supreme Court  If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out  we ll have a plan that is far better than Obamacare   he said  What happens if Obamacare is struck down  Read more  White House press aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment  And one official  who asked for anonymity to speak about the meetings  insisted that Mr  Mulvaney had simply been convening people with various views so that the president could make his own decision  But Mr  Mulvaney was described as leading the charge to back the suit  in an account of the two meetings that was described by a half dozen people with knowledge of what took place Politico first reported that Mr  Mulvaney pushed Mr  Trump to get involved in the suit Mr  Barr did not favor the move but did not object to the White House decision once it had been made  people familiar with what took place said  And one White House official said the administration faced a deadline imposed by the court if it wanted to support the suit But the decision to thrust Mr  Trump s administration so directly into the lawsuit caught several people inside the White House by surprise  and took the focus off what was arguably the best weekend of the Trump presidency Mr  Trump did not seem to care about shifting the political focus toward an issue that Democrats far preferred to the aftermath of the Mueller report  He charged ahead at a Senate Republican luncheon  telling reporters as he went in   Let me just tell you exactly what my message is  The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care  You watch  But Republicans in Congress have no obvious road forward on legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act that could pass the Democrat controlled House  And House leaders have little political incentive to bow to Republican wishes on health care  an issue that they believe delivered their House majority and that they are eager to campaign on in 2020 The Trump administration has tried to minimize and contain the Affordable Care Act over time  The president has been in favor of previous efforts to end the law  And Mr  Mulvaney has over time built up his internal political capital  and grown his team of loyalists Mr  Mulvaney is the first ideological purist who has served as Mr  Trump s chief of staff  His critics inside the West Wing say he has tilted the voices Mr  Trump hears in favor of those who will back his own views As Republicans pointed fingers  House Democrats began moving legislation on Wednesday to ensure safeguards for people with pre existing conditions and to hold down the costs of health insurance and prescription drugs  Ms  Eshoo  the chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health  said the bills were needed to counter what she described as  a monstrous attack  on the health law by the Trump administration Several Republicans on the panel distanced themselves from the administration s position  I m not with the president on eliminating pre existing conditions   said Representative John Shimkus  Republican of Illinois  Republicans  he said  believe in protecting people with pre existing conditions The subcommittee approved a bill that would provide  100 million a year for insurance counselors known as navigators who help consumers enroll in health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act The Trump administration  has slashed  practically eliminated  funding for the navigators   said Representative Kathy Castor  Democrat of Florida Several Republicans said insurance agents and brokers were enrolling more people at a lower cost than the navigators  so the additional money was not needed The panel also approved bills to outlaw two practices that have been used by brand name drug companies to stifle competition and delay the sale of lower cost generic medications One measure would prohibit makers of brand name drugs from paying off generic companies to delay sale of the less expensive products  Banning such  pay for delay  arrangements could save consumers billions of dollars over a decade  economists say Another bill approved by the House panel would require brand name drug companies to provide samples of their products to generic drug makers Generic drug developers need samples of brand name drugs to show that a generic copy is equivalent to the original  Dr  Scott Gottlieb  the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration  has called on the industry to  end the shenanigans  that prevent consumers from getting access to low cost generic drugs The House panel also approved on a party line vote a bill to provide federal money to states to help pay the largest health insurance claims  Democrats said such  reinsurance  programs would lower premiums  as shown by the experience of Minnesota  Alaska  Maryland and several other states  Republicans said they worried that federal funds would go to health plans that covered abortion  

WASHINGTON   President Trump undercut his own Treasury Department on Friday with a sudden announcement that he had rolled back newly imposed North Korea sanctions  appearing to overrule national security experts as a favor to Kim Jong un  the North Korean leader The move  announced on Twitter  was a remarkable display of dissension within the Trump administration  It created confusion at the highest levels of the federal government  just as the president s aides were seeking to pressure North Korea into returning to negotiations over dismantling its nuclear weapons program  It was announced today by the U S  Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea   Mr  Trump tweeted   I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions  The Treasury Department announced new sanctions on Friday against Iran and Venezuela  but not North Korea However  economic penalties were imposed on Thursday on two Chinese shipping companies suspected of helping North Korea evade international sanctions  Those penalties  announced with news releases and a White House briefing  were the first imposed against North Korea since late last year and came less than a month after a summit meeting between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kim collapsed in Hanoi  Vietnam  without a deal It was initially believed that Mr  Trump had confused the day that the North Korea sanctions were announced  and officials said they were caught off guard by the president s tweet  Asked for clarification  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  declined to give specifics  President Trump likes Chairman Kim  and he doesn t think these sanctions will be necessary   she said Hours later  two officials familiar with Mr  Trump s thinking said the president was actually referring to additional North Korea sanctions that are under consideration but not yet formally issued That statement sought to soften the blow that Mr  Trump s tweet had dealt to his most loyal aides  Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  personally signed off on the sanctions that were issued on Thursday and hailed the decision in an accompanying statement  The United States and our like minded partners remain committed to achieving the final  fully verified denuclearization of North Korea   Mr  Mnuchin said in the statement  He described the sanctions as part of an international campaign against North Korea that  is crucial to a successful outcome  Sanctions are one of America s most powerful tools for pressuring rogue nations  Mr  Mnuchin has taken great pride in bolstering Treasury s sanctions capacity and often says that he spends half of his time working on sanctions matters Tony Sayegh  a Treasury Department spokesman  referred questions about Friday s sanctions confusion to the White House John R  Bolton  the president s national security adviser  had also hailed the earlier action against North Korea in a tweet on Thursday   Everyone should take notice and review their own activities to ensure they are not involved in North Korea s sanctions evasion  Mr  Trump has been eager to strike a deal for North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons arsenal and  in turn  hand him a signature foreign policy achievement that has eluded his predecessors  Hawks in the administration  such as Mr  Bolton  have been wary of trusting Mr  Kim despite Mr  Trump s professed strong personal connection to the North Korean leader Last month  Mr  Trump was criticized for defending Mr  Kim over the death of Otto F  Warmbier  an American college student who died in 2017 after being imprisoned in North Korea  Mr  Trump said he believed Mr  Kim s claim that he was not aware of Mr  Warmbier s medical condition But in recent weeks there have been increasing signs that the thawing relations between the two countries could again turn frosty This month  a vice foreign minister of North Korea  Choe Son hui  accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr  Bolton of creating an  atmosphere of hostility and mistrust  despite the chemistry between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kim In another sign of hardening on Friday  North Korea withdrew its staff from the joint liaison office it has operated with South Korea since September  The office was viewed as a potential first step toward the Koreas establishing diplomatic missions in each other s capitals  But North Korea has expressed frustration with how South Korea has been handling its role as a mediator with the United States The talks between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kim broke down because North Korea wanted the United States to roll back some of its most economically painful sanctions without the North immediately dismantling its nuclear program As the linchpin of the global financial system  the United States relies on sanctions as one of its most powerful tools for international diplomacy  Officials at the Treasury and State Departments  including career staff members and political appointees  spend months carefully drafting sanctions based on intensive intelligence gathering and legal research The North Korea sanctions were no different  and the White House held a formal briefing on Thursday afternoon to explain the rationale behind the actions During the briefing  senior administration officials pushed back on the idea that the sanctions sought to increase pressure on North Korea  Instead  they said  the new measures were meant to maintain the strength of existing sanctions But one of the senior administration officials strongly rebutted any suggestion that the administration would ease some sanctions as confidence building  or in return for smaller steps by North Korea  It would be a mistake to interpret the policy as being one of a step by step approach  where we release some sanctions in return for piecemeal steps toward denuclearization  said the administration official  who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity   That is not a winning formula and it is not the president s strategy  While it is not unusual for the White House to have comment and even final approval of major sanctions  both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have expressed doubts about Mr  Trump s ability to execute sanctions policy responsibly In 2017  Congress passed legislation imposing sanctions on Russia and limiting the president s authority to lift them  Under pressure from his own party  Mr  Trump reluctantly signed the bill The reversal on the North Korea sanctions drew swift condemnation on Friday from Democrats  who accused the president of being reckless with national security  Career experts at the Treasury Department undertake a painstaking process before imposing sanctions   said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the top Democrat on the Finance Committee   For Donald Trump to overturn their decision via tweet because he has an inexplicable fondness for one of the world s most brutal dictators is appalling  He added   Without a well conceived diplomatic strategy  Trump is simply undermining our national security by making clear that the United States is not a trusted foreign policy partner  Some Republicans also pushed back against the president  with Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado saying that North Korea sanctions should be imposed   Strategic Patience failed   he tweeted   Don t repeat it  Mr  Trump s decision stunned current and former Treasury Department officials  some of whom wondered if the move was planned in advance as a gesture to Mr  Kim  Others feared that America s vaunted sanctions regime had been compromised  For an administration that continues to surprise  this is another first   the president of the United States undercutting his own sanctions agency for imposing sanctions on Chinese actors supporting North Korea   said John E  Smith  the former director of the Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control  who left the department last year   It s a win for North Korea and China and a loss for U S  credibility  Sarah Bloom Raskin  who was deputy Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama  said the sudden backtracking on a decision that would normally be made with comment from intelligence agencies and the National Security Council was perplexing  Reversing sanctions decisions within hours of making the announcement that you would impose them in the first place is a head spinner   she said   This reversal signals the injection of some peripheral consideration or factor that only the president seems to know about and that may have nothing to do with national security  The Trump administration did issue some new sanctions on Friday  The Treasury Department announced sanctions against Iran  targeting a research and development unit that it believes could be used to restart the country s nuclear weapons program  It also imposed sanctions on Bandes  Venezuela s national development bank  and its subsidiaries  as part of its effort to topple the government of President Nicolás Maduro

a deep look into their often turbulent relationship   which is now under investigation by prosecutors and Congress Deutsche Bank courted Mr  Trump when no one else would  He had already gone bankrupt  and no Wall Street lender would back him  But bankers at Deutsche like Mike Offit and Justin Kennedy  the son of Justice Anthony Kennedy  lent him millions  Mr  Trump rewarded some bankers  after some prompting  with a trip to his Mar a Lago resort It issued loans despite finding financial discrepancies  Deutsche Bank officials concluded that Mr  Trump was worth about  788 million  not his self proclaimed  3 billion  And a senior banking executive told Mr  Enrich that he had told others that Mr  Trump had worked with people in the construction industry who were tied to organized crime Only when Mr  Trump sued Deutsche Bank did its investment banking arm drop him as a client  But its private wealth arm  hungry for business  eventually took him back and lent him millions more After the 2016 election  Deutsche Bank executives admitted to problems  They concluded that their colleagues had ignored many warning signs about Mr  Trump  including from internal  exposure reports   Salesmen

before he posts them  the S E C  said he hadn t done so even once Mr  Musk had argued that the S E C  s objection was to one tweet  which mentioned previously undisclosed production forecasts  But the

American goods and services over six years    China has offered to buy  30 billion of U S  chips over six years  industry officials said  essentially doubling U S  semiconductor exports to China     For Beijing to guarantee the sales would require it to put together a kind of quota system  industry officials argued  and that mechanism could later be used to dole out contracts to Chinese firms  But their investors have priced in extra orders from China  Shares in companies like Intel and AMD have jumped in value by as much as 20 percent so far this year as hopes of a trade deal with Beijing have risen  All that could go away if the talks break down So what to do  Chip makers have asked the Trump administration  not to include them  in any agreement over boosted trade quotas  according to

company  was  concerned Mr  Bezos would sue  forcing debt laden American Media to expend resources to defend itself for a story executives believed was unlikely to sell well on newsstands    He was also advised that publishing the story might make the Enquirer look like it was doing the bidding of President Trump  who has publicly criticized Mr  Bezos   Ultimately  of course  the story was published  But American Media s financial backers  Chatham Asset Management   conveyed their displeasure  about the fallout and  pressured Mr  Pecker to resolve the matter  Warner Bros   chief leaves

College presidents don t want President Trump stepping into campus affairs and making threatening orders about speech   or so they say  After the president previewed an executive order on campus speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference this month  Robert Zimmer  president of the University of Chicago  warned that it would make the government   with all its power and authority  a party to defining the very nature of discussion on campus   and lead to the  inevitable establishment of a bureaucracy to enforce any governmental position  The order itself  which the president signed on Thursday  has softer language  stating that federal officials shall  ensure institutions that receive federal research or education grants promote free inquiry  including through compliance with all applicable federal laws  regulations and policies   President Trump s remarks at the signing ceremony  however  were harsher  He called universities  anti First Amendment institutions   he denounced  ideological intolerance   and he stated that the  35 billion per year that schools receive in research funding  is now at stake   The case would seem a perfect occasion for school leaders to rebuke a politician whom they despise  and do so on principled apolitical grounds  Even a conservative should object to this federal intrusion into academic affairs But consider the actual pressures and burdens on the president of a research university that takes in grants by the millions every year  The college presidents won t say so  but in light of their daily duties  this  speech  aspect of the executive order may look to them like a godsend The order originates in specific incidents  a student harassed by school officials for her anti abortion messaging  the creation of illiberal speech codes  and the shout downs that conservative speakers like Heather Mac Donald and Charles Murray have endured during their campus visits  College leaders aren t happy with this  They prefer that a student manning a table for the group Turning Point USA be left alone  and that Ben Shapiro have his say on Wednesday and leave on Thursday  They favor free speech even as they openly disagree with the conservative s opinions But that s not enough for some students  who object to the very presence of an outspoken conservative on campus  They have forced administrators to draw a line on impermissible speech that the administrators don t wish to draw  Administrators want open inquiry and lively debate  but the students often have a historically disadvantaged identity that the college leaders feel they must respect   African Americans against racism  women against rape culture This is a dilemma that outsiders don t appreciate  They see 19 year olds chanting  No more racism   while everyone else in the lecture hall  including the conservative speaker and the security guards  stand in silence  and they wonder why nobody makes them stop  Conservative critics put it up to liberal bias  but that s not really the problem  It has to do with the relationship the administration has formed with undergraduates from the beginning  especially with those from underrepresented populations Selective schools are in a fierce competition to attract applicants and build a properly diverse and elite freshman class  They have recruited these students with glowing promises and triumphant predictions   You will prosper here   this is the very best place you can be   the brochures tell them  Recruiters phone and text underserved groups with exciting accounts of graduates  success  Students arrive full of hope and happiness  The last thing deans want is for these youths to become upset and angry  It brings bad publicity and makes the campus look like a place of turmoil  not joy  These students intimidate the highest officials in a university more than outsiders can imagine  A student at Yale yelling at the professor who tried to reason with her did tremendous damage to Yale s brand  but the administration couldn t come down on her without compromising its pledges of inclusivity and anti discrimination and sensitivity This is why  even if they won t say it publicly  many university administrators most likely welcome the federal government s heavy hand  President Trump has taken the burden of free speech off their shoulders  Administrators now must stop the illiberalism of the activists as a matter of federal policy  That means canceling speech codes and punishing disrupters  Schools can t lose federal funding  they need it to function  Now  they have an answer to the students crowding their offices and storming the lecture hall   Yes  you must be quiet or you will be disciplined  I have no choice   it s the law  RelatedTrump Signs Executive

list of controversial things Trump has said or done Reading through items like  put kids in cages    gave security clearance to his son in law    repeatedly humped flag  and  all that birther stuff   Colbert eventually found his way to  colluded with Russia   and erased it  A list with dozens of other items remained Then he flipped the board over  revealing another list on the opposite side   I really want to be fair to him  I should also cross off  Mueller  from the list of Trump investigations   Colbert said  now revealing a list of the 17 legal investigations into Trump by New York s attorney general  various House committees and other government bodies Colbert erased the Mueller investigation from this list   Sir  it s gone   he announced to Trump   That must be 1 17th of a weight off your shoulders  The report  which has not been released but was summarized in a four page document by the attorney general  found no evidence that President Trump colluded directly with Russia during the presidential campaign  But on the question of whether Trump obstructed justice  Mueller came to no conclusion  stating   While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  Trump seemed not to have read the second part of that sentence  Speaking to reporters on Sunday about the report  he declared   It was a complete and total exoneration   Colbert couldn t countenance that  Trump does not understand the simplest of concepts   You know  I just tried some I Can t Believe It s Not Butter  It s total and complete butter

When President Trump signed a large package of tax cuts into law in 2017  the Internal Revenue Service moved to make sure the savings showed up quickly in paychecks  Doing so probably lifted consumer spending last year  but it may have hurt Republicans politically  new polling suggests Administration officials  it appears  underestimated Americans  love of tax refunds Nearly four in five people say they would rather overpay their federal income taxes and get a refund every spring   effectively making an interest free loan to the government   than underpay and owe money come tax season  according to a poll for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey  That preference appears to be influencing how Americans view Mr  Trump s signature cuts  Among people who have already filed their tax returns  those who said they received a bigger refund  this year are far more likely than others to approve of the law  But many people are reporting that their tax refunds are smaller this tax season  or that they owe money  In addition to being more likely than other Americans to say they oppose the law  those people feel worse about the economy over all  They are also significantly more likely to disapprove of Mr  Trump s performance in office The findings suggest that the administration s decisions on withholding may have hurt the law politically  I was hopeful that the rhetoric for once was going to match expectations and it did not   said Tony Mendes  a 61 year old federal employee in Denver   I got back less than I would have anticipated  Bigger paychecks for most   but smaller refunds for someIndependent analyses consistently show that the 2017 law gave most Americans a tax cut  and few families will end up paying more than under the previous rules Federal officials faced a choice about how to pass those savings on to taxpayers  One option would have been to make most people wait until they filed tax returns this spring  delivering a tax season windfall but essentially delaying the cut by a year  Instead  the I R S  chose to begin withholding less from workers  paychecks early last year  That put more money in workers  pockets right away  but made the effects of the tax cut harder to see  since the savings amounted to just a few dollars per pay period for many people The new law made numerous changes to the tax code   eliminating and capping some deductions and credits while increasing others   and the revised withholding rules did not account for every situation  As a result  government auditors warned last year that the withholding changes would reduce refunds for several million Americans Treasury officials acknowledged on Friday that some people had struggled to navigate the new withholding setup  leading them to underpay their taxes  The department will not charge a penalty to those who paid at least 80 percent of their total tax liability during the year  the officials said  Previously  the penalty threshold was 85 percent As of last week  I R S  statistics showed that the average refund had not changed for those who had filed  But total filings were down  and the share of returns producing a refund had declined by 0 5 percentage points  or about 300 000 filers   Experts caution against reading too much into tax statistics before the April filing deadline   You can see people potentially being frustrated if the tax season isn t playing out the way they expected   said Michelle Meyer  chief United States economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch   Other people might be quite pleased  It is quite split how people are being impacted by the tax cut  Democrats have accused the Trump administration of political gamesmanship  The Treasury Department under withheld taxes from millions of families  paychecks to make the benefits of the tax law appear greater before the 2018 election  and the bill is now coming due   Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the top Democrat on the Finance Committee  said in an emailed statement   Families who depend on annual tax refunds to pay down debt  cover medical expenses and afford car repairs are discovering their refunds are smaller or they owe money  More on refunds and the tax lawWhy People Are Outraged at Lower Tax Refunds  but Probably Shouldn t Be Feb  27  2019Why a Tax Cut Might Not Mean a Bigger RefundFeb  22  2019As Refunds Shrink  Treasury Dept  Reminds Workers of Bigger PaychecksFeb  14  2019Smaller Tax Refunds Surprise Those Expecting More ReliefFeb  12  2019Smaller refunds could be hurting supportAmong people who have already filed tax returns  32 percent said their refunds had shrunk from a year ago  compared with 22 percent who said their refunds had grown  according to the Times survey  Another 11 percent said they owed money this year Tax refunds reflect the difference between what taxpayers had withheld during the year and what they actually owed  They reveal next to nothing about whether a given household got a tax cut under the 2017 law Still  it is not always easy for taxpayers to figure out how they are affected by policy changes  and many people may draw conclusions based on the size of their refunds Among survey respondents who said their refunds were smaller or that they owed money  just 35 percent believed they had gotten a tax cut as a result of the law  Among those whose refunds grew or stayed the same  on the other hand  49 percent said they had gotten a tax cut Cause and effect is not always straightforward in public opinion surveys  It is possible that people who already approved of Mr  Trump and his policies are more likely to believe their refunds had grown  or are at least more likely to report that to pollsters  Surveys in recent years have revealed growing partisan splits on views of the economy and other issues Laura Wronski  a researcher for SurveyMonkey  noted that Republicans were more likely to say their refunds had gotten bigger   It s just unlikely that it aligns that perfectly along partisan lines   she said   It s more likely that people are going to stick to the side they re on  Still  partisanship is not the whole story  Even among Republicans  those who said their refunds had shrunk were significantly less likely to believe they had received a tax cut Will this year s spending be affected By adjusting workers  paychecks right away  the I R S  may have helped pump up economic growth last year  People are more likely to spend small  incremental increases to their paychecks  economists said  whereas they often try to save larger  lump sums  Consumer spending surged in the middle of last year  helping the economy to one of its best years of the past decade The uncertainty over tax refunds could now be dragging spending down  Low income consumers  in particular  often rely on tax refunds to finance major purchases  Data from Bank of America showed a dip in spending among low income households in February  which could reflect a delay in tax refunds  If you re used to getting a nice refund and then you discover you owe  that s a big shock   Ms  Meyer said Low earners are not the only ones affected  Alan Abraham  who works in medical research in Pittsburgh  said he used his tax refund every year to buy season tickets to the Penguins  This year his refund was much smaller  and he has not decided whether to renew Mr  Abraham said he paid more under the new tax law because of its cap on the deduction for state and local taxes  which hit him particularly hard because he owns two homes  A political independent who supports a flat tax  Mr  Abraham said he mistrusted politicians of both parties and did not vote in 2016  But he said the tax law had made him less likely to support Mr  Trump  whom he did not vote for in 2016  next year  At the beginning I was  like   Well  let s see how he does    Mr  Abraham said   Based on the fact that my tax bill has gone up  I actually wouldn t vote for him   The tax law has gotten more popularDespite the skepticism of people like Mr  Abraham  the tax law has gained support in recent months  Half of the survey s respondents said they approved of the law  up from 45 percent in September and the highest share since February 2018   The Times has not asked about the tax law every month  There are signs that as more people file returns  they are discovering that they benefited from the law  Among those who had filed before completing the survey  43 percent said they definitely or probably received a tax cut  compared with 35 percent of those who had not yet filed   It seems like people are realizing as they re going through the process of doing their taxes that   Oh  things did improve for me  and I wasn t expecting that    Ms  Wronski  the SurveyMonkey researcher  said About the survey  The data in this article came from an online survey of 10 046 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from March 4 to March 10  The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day  Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States  The survey has a modeled error estimate  similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll  of plus or minus 1 5 percentage points  so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant

When President Trump fired James Comey  the director of the F B I   on May 9  2017  many Americans were justifiably worried that investigators would never be permitted to get to the bottom of Russia s attack on our 2016 election and any potential involvement of Mr  Trump s associates  Despite continued attempts by the president to impede the investigation  Robert Mueller  the special counsel  has  in under two years  indicted dozens of Russians and Americans and submitted a report for review to Attorney General William Barr Now that Mr  Mueller s investigation is complete  or nearly complete   the Department of Justice must formally reveal its findings to Congress and the American people  which have separate and enormously consequential responsibilities of their own  These responsibilities cannot be carried out fully without direct access to the material that is in the report  Understanding this  the House of Representatives has already unanimously passed a resolution calling for the report s release  and in recent polling vast majorities of Americans have agreed with this approach The report that Mr  Mueller submitted to Mr  Barr for review should be viewed in combination with the remarkable assertions and conclusions that the special counsel has already reached in the form of indictments and guilty pleas of Trump associates and Russian nationals and organizations  Mr  Mueller and his team have already established that the Russian government engaged in a multipronged attack on our democracy  To review  Russian military intelligence officers hacked computers  networks and email accounts associated with the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party  and then released hacked material via WikiLeaks  Separately  Russians used fraudulent social media accounts to directly influence American opinions about the 2016 election  As the nation s intelligence agencies and the Senate Intelligence Committee have separately concluded  these efforts were calculated to help Mr  Trump s candidacy for president and to denigrate his opponent s For another viewOpinion   Caroline FredricksonWe Don t Need to Read the Mueller ReportMarch 22  2019We also know that senior members of the Trump campaign  including the president s son  son in law and campaign chairman  met with Russians who promised  dirt  on Mrs  Clinton  If there was in fact  no collusion   as the president so often claims  it apparently was not for lack of trying  The special counsel has secured guilty pleas on serious federal felony charges from Trump associates  including Mr  Trump s campaign chairman  Paul Manafort  the deputy campaign chairman  Rick Gates  a former national security adviser  Michael Flynn  a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser  George Papadopoulos  and Mr  Trump s former personal lawyer  Michael Cohen What do all these men have in common  They lied to investigators about the nature of their relationships with foreign powers  and they worked for the Trump campaign  And that s before we even start talking about Roger Stone Regardless of whether efforts by Trump associates to coordinate with or benefit from interference by Russia or WikiLeaks were criminal  the fact that Mr  Trump and his campaign strategists sought to benefit from a foreign adversary s efforts to undermine our democracy is one of the greatest breaches of public trust our country has ever witnessed  If Mr  Mueller ultimately determined that indicting the president s associates for this conduct was not appropriate  that does not mean that there should not be consequences for this outrageous breach of trust Though these and other findings have already been made public  many key questions remain  Chief among these is whether the special counsel found evidence that Mr  Trump obstructed justice by engaging in a pattern of conduct calculated to impede investigations of his campaign and his administration  including by firing Mr  Comey  attempting to force out the previous attorney general  Jeff Sessions  and pushing Mr  Sessions to reverse his recusal from the Russia inquiry  and potentially by dangling pardons to key defendants  Congress and the American people deserve to know the truth about the facts and circumstances of the president s possibly obstructive acts  Obstruction of an investigation is not only  criminal conduct  but also an affront to our system of government and the faith that the American people have in it Equally important the report should begin to answer the crucial question that hangs over the entire Trump presidency  What did the president know and when did he know it  It is possible  for example  that Mr  Mueller may have uncovered evidence that Mr  Trump knew in advance of the numerous interactions between high level campaign officials and Russian operatives  or that he knew of the plan to disseminate the hacked emails at strategically important times  This type of explosive revelation could indicate that the president was intentionally helping a malicious foreign power undermine our democracy  If the president knew about this conduct   and continued to protect and reward high level intermediaries like Mr  Flynn and Mr  Manafort when he assumed office   the public could rightfully question his fitness to continue to serve as president The report may also shed light on why the special counsel has apparently declined to indict Mr  Trump  That it is Department of Justice policy not to indict a sitting president is well known  Given that  Mr  Mueller may have decided that some of Mr  Trump s conduct  while deeply concerning  unacceptable or even potentially illegal  did not rise to the level of a chargeable offense in the presidential context  In such circumstances  the Justice Department is functionally deferring to Congress s primary jurisdiction over presidential accountability and should transmit to Congress whatever materials are relevant  particularly to potential abuses of power That is precisely why the entire report must be made available not only to the public s representatives in Congress  but also to the public as a whole  The responsibility for holding to account any bad actors identified in the report  President Trump included  now falls on the American people and Congress  Without direct access to Mr  Mueller s full report  Congress cannot responsibly decide whether to exercise its powers of oversight or impeachment  and the American people will be unable to make a fully informed decision about whether Mr  Trump can be trusted with the high office he occupies The report  and the findings and evidence supporting it  must be released Related Opinion   The Editorial BoardThe Meaning of the Mueller ReportMarch 22  2019Mueller Delivers

that it was canceling plans to build a major campus in Queens  the company did not directly blame any one person or group But others have Governor Cuomo  who with Mayor de Blasio helped negotiate the deal largely in private  blamed the State Senate  where crucial leaders opposed the plan Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  who opposed the campus  blamed Amazon for seeking  3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that she said should have been spent elsewhere Now a poll is offering insight into how the public feels about the deal s collapse  Over a third of New Yorkers point the finger at Ms  Ocasio Cortez  according to a Siena College Research Institute survey of 700 voters Here s what else you need to know about the poll  which was released yesterday The deal was popular across the state  Two thirds of voters said Amazon s withdrawal was bad for New York Sixty three percent of Democrats and 56 percent of self identified liberals said the cancellation was bad for New York Sixty four percent of New York City voters agreed with them Blame fell on Ms  Ocasio Cortez  Thirty eight percent of voters faulted the congresswoman for the deal s demise  identifying her as a  villain    Local activists in Queens  were labeled villains by 34 percent of voters In the New York City suburbs  50 percent of voters blamed Ms  Ocasio Cortez  Upstate  the number was 40 percent  in the five

fewer than 30 percent of voters What about Amazon  The company was blamed by 26 percent of voters The takeaways   The progressive base that cheered Ms  Ocasio Cortez as she railed against the deal was not representative of most voters  Those closest to a project don t necessarily reflect the views of a wider audience   said Steven Greenberg  a pollster with Siena College   I asked Mr  Greenberg if by  closest  he meant physical proximity  and he replied   Yes      Local activists in Queens  were blamed more often for the plan s demise than the State Senate was  In the suburbs  39 percent of voters labeled the activists as villains  but only 23 percent labeled the Senate as such This matters in part because Democrats need to retain suburban seats to hold on to their Senate majority The

And finally  A New York conversation about Julius and Ethel RosenbergImageCreditAssociated PressJulius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953 for being Soviet spies  It s a case that some people are still debating and that others have never heard of And it s  a New York story   Richard H  Weisberg  a professor at Cardozo School of Law  said The couple were tried in the Southern District of New York and buried on Long Island  New Yorkers  had connections to the case   parents  uncles  aunts  grandparents   Professor Weisberg said  It s a story of how a couple that owns a ma and pa electronic fix it store becomes swept up in the web of an investigation   Professor Weisberg said   And there are so many unresolved issues  even the guilt and innocence of both Julius and Ethel   who should be seen separately  really in a way   is unclear at the moment  The case is more than 60 years old  but some at Cardozo say it shouldn t be forgotten  Today at 4 p m   the law school will screen a movie about the Rosenbergs called  Daniel   which the executive producers have described as  inspired  by the case At 6 30 p m   an actress in the film  Lindsay Crouse  will participate in a discussion with one of the Rosenbergs  sons  Robert Meeropol  The discussion will be moderated by Professor Weisberg Ms  Crouse said the case was long overdue for a re examination  One of the reasons I think it s important for students to know what went on in the Rosenberg case is that this country has almost shunned the case   she said in an interview   It s very upsetting on many levels  and we need to look at it square in the face to learn its lessons  Barbara Kolson  the co director of the Fashion  Arts  Media and Entertainment Center at Cardozo  who helped organize the event  said the school s students  did not know who the Rosenbergs were   They also did not know who Roy Cohn was   she said  referring to one of the prosecutors who was instrumental in the convictions Mr  Cohn  who died in 1986  had mentored a cadre of influential people  including President Trump and Roger Stone It s Tuesday   learn about New York history Metropolitan Diary  Discouraging dayImageDear Diary I was walking down York Avenue after a discouraging second day at my first job  Feeling overwhelmed  I was holding back tears as I trudged home through the rain A few blocks from my apartment  I slowed to a stop in front of a fruit cart  I pretended to scan the contents as I replayed the previous eight hours in my head The vendor tried to tempt me with cherries and tangerines  but I was lost in my own thoughts I heard a voice whispering from behind me   Get the grapes  I turned to face a woman with gentle features and streaks of gray hair  her body wrapped tightly in a fur coat  They re sweet and delicious   she said   And you can put them in your pocket and eat them on your way home  So I did  And they were   Michael HarmonMetropolitan Diary  Swinging to the musicImage Metropolitan Diary was inadvertently left out of the Monday edition of New York Today  so we are publishing two today Dear Diary We were apart for seven months  He was in Alabama  at Fort Rucker  and I was at Columbia  We spent three days together while he was on leave The day before he left  we were on the No  1  In the twitching subway light  a band swung into our car and seasoned the tight air  One musician kneaded a metallic accordion  and another sang He smiled   there is a slight gap between his front teeth   and we danced  In the music  the moment felt infinite  I didn t think about saying goodbye  about the distance from Alabama to New York  I just thought about him  on the No  1  with me  swinging to the music The next day he boarded his train at Penn Station  I walked to Times Square  crying and cold  and I caught the No  1  After two stops  a band swung into the car  It was the one from the day before  I couldn t help but smile and swing my hips to the music   Emma O LearyNew York Today
