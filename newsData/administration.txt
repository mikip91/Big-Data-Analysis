Serious train and bus accidents are rare  But when they happen  passengers and their bags have almost none of the protections considered standard on planes and cars The National Transportation Safety Board has long recommended a variety of measures to improve passenger safety  including installing lap shoulder seatbelts  requiring riders to buckle up and improving window safety and overhead baggage restraints  Current safety standards for locomotive cabs and rail passenger cars are inadequate   the N T S B  said in February when it unveiled its  most wanted  list of safety improvements for trains   Protecting passengers and crews from injury requires keeping rail car windows intact and maintaining their structural integrity during an accident  and includes occupant restraint systems  such as seatbelts  to mitigate the severity of passenger injuries  But regulators of Amtrak  Greyhound and a host of national and regional transportation carriers have generally not adopted the recommendations In 2017  44 people died in bus crashes  according to the safety board  The Federal Railroad Administration s office of safety analysis said 21 passengers and employees were killed in Amtrak and commuter train accidents in 2017 and 2018  While the number of bus and rail fatalities is relatively small  thousands of people were injured in accidents in recent years on Amtrak  Long Island Rail Road  New Jersey Transit and other commuter trains  as well as on Greyhound and other interstate bus companies  according to federal regulators  Those 44 people could have been saved   said T  Bella Dinh Zarr  a recently retired member of the safety board who helped lead major bus and train crash investigations   In some cases  just simply wearing their seatbelt would have saved them from being severely injured and then dying from those injuries  or being ejected and killed  or suffering traumatic brain injury  ImageRudolf Wetzel at home in Kirkland  Wash  He was ejected from an Amtrak train that derailed in Washington in 2017 CreditJenny Riffle for The New York TimesThe safety board s call for regulators to evaluate installing seatbelts in rail cars and  securing potential projectiles  resonates in the case of Rudolf Wetzel  He dozed off in his seat on an Amtrak train just outside Tacoma  Wash   as the train made its first run on a new service route south on Dec  18  2017  I woke up when all hell broke loose   he said  The train had derailed on an overpass  sending the locomotive  the power car and two rail cars tumbling onto Interstate 5   I didn t know what was going on   Thrown from his seat and seriously injured  he lay underneath the train  where he could see wheels turning and hear the engine roaring The N T S B  s preliminary investigation determined that excessive speed caused the train to derail as it rounded a curve at 78 miles per hour in a 30 m p h  zone  Three passengers were killed  and 62 passengers  crew members and motorists were injured  Mr  Wetzel  82  was hospitalized for three days with a broken back as well as internal and cognitive injuries On its most wanted list  the N T S B  said  compartmentalization    a design in which closely spaced  well padded and high backed train seats absorb energy during accidents   remains a problem because it  may not protect passengers during derailments and overturns  In a derailment  passengers often collide with one another  In these instances  Ms  Dinh Zarr said  Amtrak s seats don t offer much protection from other passengers or from flying luggage  The overhead baggage racks on most Amtrak trains have only a shallow edge and railing  There are no other restraints or compartments that close with a door and a latch akin to the overhead storage in commercial airplanes  except on Acela Express  according to Amtrak ImageA truck carrying one of the wrecked rail cars from the Amtrak derailment in Washington State  A preliminary investigation found that excessive speed caused the train to derail CreditRuth Fremson The New York TimesJames Vucinovich  a lawyer who is representing Mr  Wetzel and others in lawsuits against Amtrak  said the interior of Amtrak train cabins leaves people vulnerable when accidents occur   You re going to be like a Ping Pong ball inside of a can  In January last year  Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee was among the dozens of Republican lawmakers traveling to a retreat in Virginia on a chartered Amtrak train when it struck a garbage truck  Mr  Roe  a physician  assessed injuries inside and outside the train with a group of other doctors Does he support putting seatbelts on Amtrak   If you wanted to move safety to another level  the answer would be yes   Mr  Roe said He added that he is a mountaineer and not risk averse   But I always harness up  and I m always on the rope   he said   So if I m sitting on an Amtrak and there s a safety belt there  I m going to put it on  If trains have an Achilles  heel  it is their windows  The safety board issued a recommendation 47 years ago about  the problem of ejection of passengers through large side windows   Ms  Dinh Zarr said Amtrak s windows  which are secured by rubber grommets  remain a problem because they can pop out in a crash or derailment  She was on the scene in Philadelphia in May 2015  she said  when eight passengers were killed and 185 were taken to hospitals after a locomotive and seven passenger cars derailed  The N T S B  found that if the passenger car windows had remained intact and secured in the cars  some passengers would not have been ejected and would likely have survived the accident   the board s report on the accident said   Further  the passengers were not protected from serious injuries resulting from being thrown from their seats when the cars overturned  Kimberly Woods  a spokeswoman for Amtrak  said in an email   Amtrak will continue to work with industry experts to explore the enhancement of occupant protection systems on our trains   Amtrak s windows  she said   comply with federal requirements for impact resistance and emergency release  When asked why Amtrak had not installed seatbelts  she said international research on the matter has shown  inconclusive results regarding any improvements to safety  ImageRiding Amtrak s Lake Shore Limited train between New York and Cleveland  The Federal Railroad Administration asserts that seatbelts can bring a higher risk of injury CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York TimesIn a 2017 letter  the Federal Railroad Administration responded to the safety board s seatbelt recommendation   Current research indicates that unlike in the automobile and air transportation modes  adding seatbelts in passenger rail cars is not the most effective way to increase safety  Warren Flatau  a spokesman for the agency  added that the railroad administration s own  extensive research  on the subject  has revealed that the use of seatbelts could actually increase the risk and severity of injuries   He said the agency s focus on  occupant protection and accident survivability  has led to  redesigned tables and seats that contain and cushion passengers   as well as  enhanced emergency egress features  including windows  lighting and  structural crashworthiness  Commercial buses manufactured after 2016 are required to have seatbelts  But after a Greyhound accident in San Jose  Calif   in 2016 in which two passengers were thrown from the bus and killed  State Senator Jerry Hill looked into why everyone on board wasn t wearing a seatbelt  He found that travelers did not have to wear the belts  What s the point of a seatbelt if passengers and drivers aren t required to wear them   he asked  So Mr  Hill introduced legislation  which took effect last summer  making California the first state with a law requiring bus passengers to wear seatbelts in any bus that has them and requiring operators to inform passengers before departure that they must buckle up or face a fine The N T S B  supported California s law  And on its most wanted list  it recommends that every state enact a law that requires all vehicle occupants to use seatbelts and allow law enforcement officers to give tickets to anyone who has not buckled up  The agency said it was concerned about  the limited availability and use of seatbelts in commercial vehicles  including motor coaches  school buses and medium size buses ImageThe National Transportation Safety Board has identified train windows as being particularly problematic

passengers died and 39 were injured in the crash Reid Valentine  a passenger on the bus  said he was not wearing his seatbelt  He said he was thrown into the seat in front of him so hard that it broke   Glass shattered  and I watched the front of the bus just basically crumple all the way up to the front axle  Mr  Valentine said passengers did not receive a safety briefing  so opening emergency windows proved difficult   We were fighting to keep them open so that we could get out of the bus and start getting people out   he recalled  The heavy bus windows don t just pop off  he said   You have to hold them up like on camper awnings  Crystal Booker  a spokeswoman for Greyhound  said in an email   We are constantly reviewing safety features on our buses to look for ways to improve passengers  safety   She added that all buses  undergo thorough inspections  and that  all Greyhound drivers nationwide are trained on safety announcements   including evacuation procedures She said the back of Greyhound s seats help to  cushion passengers and mitigate injury   even for passengers who don t wear a seatbelt ImageAn accident last year in New Mexico in which a truck collided with a Greyhound bus killed seven people and injured dozens CreditBrandon N  Sanchez Gallup Independent  via Associated PressWhen asked why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had not issued federal regulations to improve bus emergency exit windows  Kathryn Henry  a spokeswoman  said the agency was still analyzing emergency evacuation research it completed in 2011  to inform possible means of improving the emergency exits  She added   The agency believes that bus window exits must not only enable adequate evacuation in emergencies  but also should not pop out too readily in a crash  Crash survivors  meanwhile  often have to contend with a range of lingering physical and psychological effects  After physical therapy  Mr  Wetzel   who survived being thrown from an Amtrak train   said he was functioning at just 60 percent of his abilities And Mr  Valentine said he avoided all bus travel  I m still at the point where I barely sleep at night   he said   It s something I ve constantly got to think of and it s always on my mind   

The attorney general of the United States has concerns about illegal government spying  At a Senate hearing on Wednesday  William Barr confirmed that he will look into whether the Trump campaign was subject to unlawful surveillance in the run up to the 2016 election  The Justice Department s inspector general  Michael Horowitz  is already investigating the matter  and Mr  Barr says the review is nearly done  But instead of letting his watchdog finish his work  Mr  Barr would rather look into the matter himself   Yes  I think spying did occur   Mr  Barr said early in the hearing  later amending the record to clarify that he was  not saying that improper surveillance occurred   I am saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it  That is all   he added Before day s end  Fox News was amplifying the attorney general s worries  which the president then shared on Twitter Whatever comes of Mr  Barr s review and the conspiracy theories that ensue  he would be wise to reflect on his own history with government surveillance that stretched the limits of the law  Just last month  Mr  Horowitz s office concluded that the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration  failed to conduct a comprehensive legal analysis  when the two agencies undertook a secret surveillance program in the 1990s that swept up records of Americans  phone calls   the kind of bulk collection that the National Security Agency later engaged in after 9 11 The D E A  program dates back to 1992  when Mr  Barr first led the Justice Department under President George H W  Bush  Relying on so called administrative subpoenas  the D E A  would go on fishing expeditions  vacuuming up metadata from billions of phone calls to more than 100 countries  according to a 2015 USA Today investigation The inspector general s office found it  troubling  that the government s collection entailed a  uniquely expansive  reading of the law  under the program  officials would issue subpoenas for records without first determining that they were  relevant or material  to a specific investigation  as the law requires  The inspector general also suggested that the D E A  abused its authority because the records were then shared with other federal agencies that had nothing to do with drug enforcement One thing the inspector general report makes clear  Mr  Barr was in charge as this program came into being and  provided approval  for its deployment without appropriate legal review  In the future  if Mr  Barr wants to move forward with a similar bulk collection program   the Department should conduct a rigorous  objective legal analysis  memorialized in writing  in advance of initiating such a program   the report said Words to ponder as the attorney general  now in his second tour leading the Justice Department  expresses concern over the reach of government surveillance RelatedMore on government surveillanceBarr Asserts Intelligence Agencies Spied on the Trump CampaignApril 10  2019D E A  Secretly Collected Bulk Records of Money Counter PurchasesMarch 30  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

SAN FRANCISCO   In one of the murals  George Washington points westward over the dead body of a Native American  Another depicts Washington s slaves  hunched over  working in the fields of Mount Vernon  These images aren t in a museum exhibition but on the walls of a public high school In this famously left of center city  liberals are battling liberals over these Depression era frescoes that have offended some groups In the debate over the 13 murals that make up  The Life of Washington   at George Washington High School  one side  which includes art historians and school alumni  sees an immersive history lesson  the other  which includes many African Americans and Native Americans  sees a hostile environment Sometime this spring  the school board will make a decision about the future of the massive frescoes that extend from the school s entryway through its lobby  confronting students as they climb the stairs to their classrooms The works were created in the mid 1930s by Victor Arnautoff  a social realist  for the Works Progress Administration  an agency created under Franklin D  Roosevelt s New Deal that provided public works jobs for the unemployed during the Great Depression Arnautoff  who was born in Russia and taught at Stanford  was a Communist who embedded messages critical of the founding father in his murals  He depicted Washington  accurately  at a time when that was rarely acknowledged  as a slave owner and the leader of the nation that annihilated Native Americans  There are no cherry trees ImageA detail from one of the panels  which shows Washington s slaves working in the fields of Mount Vernon CreditJim Wilson The New York TimesBut to Amy Anderson  a member of the Ahkaamaymowin band of Métis who has been a catalyst in the campaign to remove the murals  they represent  American history from the colonizers  perspective  Around the country in recent years  people have been questioning historical representations in public art  Confederate statues and monuments have been dismantled  And in September  San Francisco city workers removed a statue symbolizing the Catholic Church s mission era subjugation of Native Americans  But the Washington High frescoes present a different issue  What they symbolize is open to interpretation  Some see a subversive message about Washington s failings  others see his glorification When the frescoes were painted  critics praised Arnautoff s work  But by the late 1960s  his art aroused anger  The school district responded by adding contemporary murals by the African American artist Dewey Crumpler in 1974  The additional artwork did not satisfy Ms  Anderson and others opposed to the murals Stevon Cook  president of the San Francisco Board of Education  wants the paintings covered or removed   The history we tell is very one sided   he said  An African American  he supports teaching this history in classrooms  but opposes  violent images that are offensive to certain communities   he said ImageOne of the most controversial murals depicts a dead Native American CreditJim Wilson The New York TimesVirginia Marshall  president of the San Francisco Alliance of Black School Educators said Arnautoff s paintings remind her of  my great great grandfather and great great grandmother who were beaten and hung from trees and told they were less than human  Paloma Flores  a member of the Pit River Nation and coordinator of the school s Indian Education Program  said Arnautoff s  intent no longer matters   The murals  glorify the white man s role and dismiss the humanity of other people who are still alive   she said Joely Proudfit  director of the California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center in San Marcos  said it is not worth saving the art if one native student  is triggered by that  Of the 2 004 students at Washington High  most are Asian American  89 are African American and four are Native American  One of them is Ms  Anderson s son  who  she said   keeps his head down when he passes the murals  But scholars see something else in the murals  history  Robert W  Cherny  an emeritus professor of history at San Francisco State University and the author of  Victor Arnautoff and the Politics of Art   points to the artist s critique of Washington   Arnautoff was a major artist  an artist on the left who was being very critical of Washington for owning slaves  and he was critical of the genocide of Native Americans  Gray Brechin  project scholar of the Living New Deal at the University of California  Berkeley  said   It s not a matter of erasing art  it s erasing history itself   He also spoke about the importance of preserving memories of atrocities   The Jews never want what happened to them to be forgotten   he said   That s why they have so many memorials  ImageThe Russian American artist Victor Arnautoff embedded messages critical of the founding father in his murals for the Works Progress Administration CreditJim Wilson The New York TimesWashington High School has one of the largest collections of W P A  art on the West Coast  but it s still a high school  Sharing space with Arnautoff s panels are student drawn signs for  Walk Against Rape  and  2019 ELECTION   which lists requirements including   2 0 GPA   GOOD LUCK  Mikayla  a sophomore who was raising money for student government  said   It s not necessary to hide the truth   She had inadvertently taped her sign reading   2 Spam musubi  over the chest of Arnautoff s dead Native American Matt Haney  a member of the board of supervisors and a former board of education member  said   If you re a Native American student and you walk into the lobby and see your ancestors being murdered in art  that feels dehumanizing   He also has suggested renaming the school in honor of Maya Angelou  who studied there Late last year the school district organized a group called the Reflections and Action Committee to consider options for the artwork Some art historians and Washington High School teachers who spoke to the committee in favor of the frescoes said they felt uncomfortable expressing their views   There was a feeling of animosity in the air   John M  Strain  an English teacher and graduate of Washington High  said  His students  he said   feel bad about offending people but they almost universally don t think the answer is to erase it  Marianne Philipp  the school librarian  also spoke because  she said   It s my job to champion intellectual freedom  It s disturbing to me that this is under discussion  After hearing from both sides  the committee issued a statement that said the artwork  glorifies slavery  genocide  colonization  Manifest Destiny  white supremacy  oppression  etc   and does not represent the San Francisco school s  values of social justice  ImageWhen the frescoes were painted  critics praised Arnautoff s work  By the late 1960s  his art aroused anger CreditJim Wilson The New York TimesIn February  eight committee members voted to recommend that the school district remove Arnautoff s frescoes  two were undecided and one voted to save them  To remove them would be to destroy them because moving them would be too costly  The committee said the frescoes could be archived digitally Lope Yap Jr   vice president of the Washington High School Alumni Association  cast the sole vote to save the frescoes   There are not many people whose politics are left of me   Mr  Yap  a filmmaker  said   If they succeed  this would be book burning in Germany in the 1930s  Mark Berger  a Washington High alumnus and a sound engineer  said digitizing the frescoes  is not an acceptable solution   The thing about murals is that they re out there for anyone to see who walks by  It catches your attention  It may cause you to think about things you wouldn t think about  It s the artist reaching out to you rather than you seeking out the message   he said Barbara A  Brewer  an English teacher at the school  assigned 49 freshmen to write essays about the frescoes  Only four favored removal  One student wrote   The fresco shows us exactly how brutal colonization and genocide really were and are  The fresco is a warning and reminder of the fallibility of our hallowed leaders  The school board will take up the issue in the coming months  If it votes to destroy the murals  Mr  Yap said the alumni association would file a lawsuit to stop it This week  Ms  Anderson recalled a discussion she had had with her son about attending the school with the murals   He told me   Don t worry Mom  that s not going to be up there forever    

Checking your official Social Security statement is important to make sure your future retirement benefits reflect what you ve earned over your working life  Yet a new report suggests that many Americans aren t doing that In recent years  the Social Security Administration has greatly curtailed the number of statements it mails  encouraging workers to check the information online instead But fewer than half the 39 million people registered for electronic  my Social Security  accounts as of Sept  30 had checked their earnings statements in the previous 12 months  according to a recent audit report from the agency s inspector general Linda Sherry  director of national priorities for Consumer Action  an advocacy group  said the findings suggested that the shift to digital statements had left many people without  meaningful access  to their earnings history and that the government was falling short of its obligation under the Social Security Act to keep workers informed That s a problem  she said  because the statements are a crucial retirement planning tool for many Americans  She said she would prefer that the agency gave people the option of receiving paper statements periodically  as it did in the past  rather than force them online The administration s policy on mailing statements has varied over time Two decades ago  most workers 25 or older received a paper statement each year around their birthday  The document provides a summary of annual earnings  It also shows the size of the check to expect each month in retirement  and how the amount may vary depending on what year the recipient decides to stop working Under current policy  adopted in 2017  the administration automatically mails statements only to people over age 60 who aren t yet getting benefits and who haven t set up digital accounts   Paper statements are still available to anyone on request  by submitting a special form  More than 139 000 people got statements that way in the 2018 fiscal year  the report said  The move away from mailing statements has saved the government money  the report noted  Last fiscal year  the agency spent less than  8 million to print and mail statements  down from  65 million eight years earlier The agency mailed just under 15 million statements last fiscal year  which ended on Sept  30  the report said  When that total is combined with the number of people who checked their statements online  it appears that fewer than 35 million people saw their earnings statements Back in the 2010 fiscal year  the agency automatically mailed out 155 million statements  the report noted  That s a huge discrepancy   Ms  Sherry said Asked whether the report raised concerns  a spokesman for the Social Security Administration  Darren Lutz  said in an email that the shift to online statements was rooted in tighter agency budgets  along with an increasing preference by the public for doing business online  Currently  he said  42 million people have  instant  access to statements through their online accounts The agency encourages everyone to create an online account  Mr  Lutz said  and suggests that people review their statements annually to verify that earnings posted are correct  to make sure their benefit estimates are accurate There s also a reason besides retirement planning to review your Social Security statements  to check for signs of identity theft  Doing so is good  identity hygiene   like checking your credit reports  said Charity Lacey  a spokeswoman for the Identity Theft Resource Center If  for instance  your reported earnings are much higher than your own records  it may be a red flag that someone is fraudulently using your Social Security number  said Paul Stephens  director of policy and advocacy with the nonprofit group Privacy Rights Clearinghouse Here are some questions and answers about checking your Social Security statement How do I create a  my Social Security  account You can register on the Social Security Administration website  You ll be asked to enter your Social Security number and birth date  and you ll also be asked a series of questions   similar to those asked when you check your credit report online   to help confirm your identity  Then you ll receive a code by either email or text  which you enter online to complete the process  If  for some reason  you can t set up the account online  you can visit a Social Security office  After you establish an account  you ll get an annual email reminder to log on and review your statement If you have a security freeze on your credit report to help ward off fraud  you must lift it temporarily to set up your online Social Security account  Specifically  you ll need to thaw the freeze at Equifax  the company the administration currently uses to help verify users  identities If I can get paper statements  why should I get an online Social Security account Creating a digital account is a good idea  if only to prevent someone else from fraudulently creating one first and using it to steal benefit payments in the future  said Mike Litt  consumer campaign director with the United States Public Interest Research Groups  Given the number of security breaches in recent years  it s possible someone may be able to illegally obtain your sensitive personal information  like your Social Security number  and use it to set up an account in your name Mr  Litt said it was wise to establish an account and then check it periodically for anything that looked suspicious   You should sign up for your online Social Security account   he said   before fraudsters try to claim it and redirect your benefits to their bank account  Mr  Litt also recommends adding optional extra security  like getting a code sent in a letter via the mail  If you prefer  you can also block all electronic access to your account What if information on my statement seems incorrect Contact the agency at 1 800 772 1213  and have your tax return or W 2 income form handy  

Rite Aid  one of the country s biggest pharmacy chains  will stop selling e cigarettes and vaping products because of concern that they are fueling tobacco use among middle and high school students across the United States Rite Aid said Thursday that it would remove the products from its more than 2 400 stores over the next 90 days  The chain will continue to sell regular tobacco products  a decision that some public health advocates criticized  We re concerned about some of the alarming statistics regarding the use of e cigarettes and vaping products by children and teens   Bryan Everett  the chain s chief operating officer  said on an earnings call  He added that  while many feel these products are beneficial to those of legal age who are trying to quit the use of tobacco   the company had decided to stop selling them because of their growing popularity with young people The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the use of tobacco products  a category that includes e cigarettes and vaping products  jumped 38 percent last year among high school students and 29 percent among middle school students  The surge  driven by the growth of e cigarettes  countered the declining use of such products among young people in previous years  the C D C  found Public health experts warn that while teenage smoking remains at record lows  that could be reversed if vaping and e cigarettes end up leading a new generation to traditional tobacco products Last month  the Food and Drug Administration moved to restrict the sales of flavored e cigarettes  which are particularly attractive to young people  The F D A  has directed retailers to place e cigarette products in areas that are not accessible to people under age 18 The agency identified Walgreens stores this year as a top violator of restrictions against selling tobacco products to minors  The F D A  has sought a meeting with the company s leadership to address the problem Walgreens said in an emailed statement on Friday that it would  welcome the opportunity to meet with the commissioner of food and drugs to discuss all of the steps we are taking regarding this important issue   The chain said it prohibited the sale of tobacco products to minors and immediately fired employees who violated the ban The F D A  also issued letters this month to a dozen retailers  including Walmart and Family Dollar  asking them to submit plans within 30 days that described how they planned to address and mitigate sales of tobacco products to minors  Rite Aid and Walgreens were not sent letters Despite the latest move by Rite Aid  public health advocates were not pleased to hear the chain would continue to sell traditional tobacco products  They said the company should follow the example set by CVS  which stopped selling tobacco altogether in 2014 and subsequently branded itself as a health care giant  CVS was the first major pharmacy chain to stop selling tobacco  which had brought in  2 billion in sales a year  There is a fundamental conflict between their stated mission of improving health and wellness and selling tobacco products  which are the leading cause of preventable death   said Vince Willmore  a spokesman for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids   Pharmacies cannot have it both ways  Other drugstores should follow CVS s lead and end tobacco sales once and for all  Rite Aid said in a statement that many of its customers still wanted to be able to buy traditional tobacco products  but that it had decreased the visibility of those items in its stores in recent years  The company added that it had also expanded its offering of smoking cessation products and trained its pharmacists in a program that can help customers quit smoking  

While designing its newest jet  Boeing decided to make two significant changes to an automated system now suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes of the plane Despite the added risks  the Federal Aviation Administration did not conduct another safety review of the anti stall system  since the changes didn t affect what it considered a critical phase of flight  namely high speed maneuvers The omission involving Boeing s 737 Max exposes a glaring regulatory gap  with the agency s bureaucratic process proving insufficient for the increasing complexity of airplane design  The more we know  the more we realize what we don t know   said John Cox  an aviation safety consultant and a former 737 pilot The F A A  has a reputation as the gold standard in global aviation regulation  with the toughest and most stringent rules for certifying planes  But the March crash in Ethiopia and an earlier one in Indonesia have broadly raised concerns about the agency s ability to push back against the industry or root out flaws In both crashes  the authorities suspect that faulty sensor data triggered the anti stall system  revealing a single point of failure on the plane  Pilots weren t informed about the system until after the Lion Air crash in Indonesia  and even then  Boeing didn t fully explain or understand the risks  The government outsourced much of the certification to Boeing employees  creating a cozy relationship between the company and its regulator After the agency s initial safety review  Boeing decided to quadruple the power of the anti stall system  which could push down the plane s nose  The company also expanded the use of the software  known as MCAS  to activate in more situations Although officials were aware of the changes  none were fully examined by the F A A   according to three people with knowledge of the process The Dangerous Flaws in Boeing s Automated SystemHere s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months A new review would have required F A A  officials to take a closer look at the system s effect on the overall safety of the plane  as well as to consider the potential consequences of a malfunction  Instead  the agency relied on an earlier assessment of the system  which was less powerful and activated in more limited circumstances  Boeing s 737 Max  1960s design  1990s power and paper manuals  While it is unclear which officials were involved in the review of the anti stall system  they followed a set of bureaucratic procedures  rather than taking a proactive approach  The result is that officials didn t fully understand the risks of the more robust anti stall system  which could cause a crash in less than a minute The F A A  defended its certification process  saying it has consistently produced safe aircraft  An F A A  spokesman said agency employees had collectively spent more than 110 000 hours reviewing the Max  including 297 test flights The spokesman said F A A  employees were following agency rules when they didn t review the change   The change to MCAS didn t trigger an additional safety assessment because it did not affect the most critical phase of flight  considered to be higher cruise speeds   an agency spokesman said   At lower speeds  greater control movements are often necessary  Speaking in Dallas on Thursday  Boeing s chief executive  Dennis A  Muilenburg  described MCAS as  one link in a longer chain of events  that contributed to the crashes   We know we can break this chain link   he said   And it s our responsibility to eliminate this risk  A spokesman for Boeing said   The F A A  considered the final configuration and operating parameters of MCAS during Max certification  and concluded that it met all certification and regulatory requirements   737 Max won t fly until the F A A  is satisfied  transportation secretary tells Congress  Some of the details of the evolving design of MCAS were earlier reported by The Seattle Times MCAS was created to help make the 737 Max handle like its predecessors  part of Boeing s strategy to get the plane done more quickly and cheaply Boeing 737 Max  What s Happened After the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air CrashesBoeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months The system was initially designed to engage only in rare circumstances  namely high speed maneuvers  in order to make the plane handle more smoothly and predictably for pilots used to flying older 737s  according to two former Boeing employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the open investigations For those situations  MCAS was limited to moving the stabilizer   the part of the plane that changes the vertical direction of the jet   about 0 6 degrees in about 10 seconds It was around that design stage that the F A A  reviewed the initial MCAS design  The planes hadn t yet gone through their first test flights After the test flights began in early 2016  Boeing pilots found that just before a stall at various speeds  the Max handled less predictably than they wanted  So they suggested using MCAS in those instances  too  according to one former employee with direct knowledge of the conversations But the system needed more power to work in a broader range of situations At higher speeds  flight controls are more sensitive and less movement is needed to steer the plane  Consider the effect of turning a car s steering wheel at 70 miles an hour versus 30 miles an hour To prevent stalls at lower speeds  Boeing engineers decided that MCAS needed to move the stabilizer faster and by a larger amount  So Boeing engineers quadrupled the amount it could move the stabilizer in one cycle  to 2 5 degrees in less than 10 seconds  That s a huge difference   said Dennis Tajer  a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots  union  who has flown 737s for a decade   That s the difference between controlled flight or not  Speed was a defining characteristic for the F A A  The agency s rules require an additional review only if the changes affect how the plane operates in riskier phases of flight  at high speeds and altitudes  Because the changes to the anti stall system affected how it operated at lower speeds and altitudes  F A A  employees didn t need to take a closer look at them VideoBoeing introduced the 737 Max as a reliable fuel  and cost efficient solution to air travel in the 21st century  After two fatal Max crashes  all of the Max aircraft in the world are believed to have been grounded CreditCreditChang W  Lee The New York TimesThe overall system represented a major departure from Boeing s design philosophy  Boeing has traditionally favored giving pilots control over their planes  rather than automated flight systems  In creating MCAS  they violated a longstanding principle at Boeing to always have pilots ultimately in control of the aircraft   said Chesley B  Sullenberger III  the retired pilot who landed a jet in the Hudson River   In mitigating one risk  they created another  greater risk  The missed risks  by the F A A  and Boeing  flowed to other decisions  A deep explanation of the system wasn t included in the plane manual  The F A A  didn t require training on it  Even Boeing test pilots weren t fully briefed on MCAS  Therein lies the issue with the design change  Those pitch rates were never articulated to us   said one test pilot  Matthew Menza Mr  Menza said he looked at documentation he still had and did not see mention of the rate of movement on MCAS   So they certainly didn t mention anything about pitch rates to us   he said   and I certainly would ve loved to have known  The system s increased power was also compounded by its design  The software engaged repeatedly if the sensor suggested it was necessary to avoid a stall  In the Lion Air crash  data showed that the pilots  who weren t aware of MCAS  fought for control of the plane  as it pushed the nose back down each time they pulled it up Few truly understood just how powerful the system would prove  It wasn t fully disclosed until after the Lion Air disaster  killing all 189 people on board  On the Ethiopian Airlines flight  the pilots struggled to regain control after MCAS engaged at least three times Last month  during flight simulations recreating the problems with the Lion Air flight  American pilots were surprised at how strong MCAS was  They essentially had less than 40 seconds to manually override a system malfunction before a crash Updates to the software by Boeing  which will require F A A  approval  will address some of the concerns with the anti stall system  The changes will limit the system to engaging just once in most cases  And they will prevent MCAS from pushing the plane s nose down more than a pilot could counteract by pulling up on the controls Boeing had hoped to deliver the software fix to the F A A  by now  but it was delayed by several weeks  As a result  the grounding of the jet is expected to drag on  Southwest Airlines has changed its schedule through early August and American Airlines cancellations stretch into June  

WASHINGTON   The United States will not clear Boeing 737 Max jets for flight again until federal officials are satisfied that Boeing has fixed its flawed flight control system  Transportation Secretary Elaine L  Chao said in testimony on Wednesday Ms  Chao  appearing before House subcommittee hearings concerning her department s budget  offered no timeline for the plane to return to service after the Federal Aviation Administration s decision to ground the jets on March 13 But she said Boeing appeared close to completing a software upgrade on a crucial sensor believed to have played a role in the crashes of two Max jets  An Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa on March 10  killing 157  and a Lion Air 737 Max crashed last October  killing all 189 people on board  The F A A  will not approve Boeing s proposed changes until the F A A  is satisfied it is safe   said Ms  Chao  who has come under fire for her department s actions after the Lion Air disaster Ms  Chao  reading from prepared answers at times  defended the F A A  s decision not to follow the lead of 40 other countries by immediately grounding the fleet  despite the possibility that the Ethiopia crash might have resulted from a flaw in a plane whose basic design dates to the 1960s The F A A   which Ms  Chao oversees  waited three days to ground the fleet and was one of the last major regulators worldwide to do so  She flew back to Washington from a festival in Texas on March 12 on a 737 Max  in what seemed to be an endorsement of the plane s safety  Less than a day later the F A A  uncovered evidence that suggested the planes were not fit to fly  The F A A  saw no basis upon which to ground these planes   she said   It is a very technical organization  It is very data driven  They saw no data until the morning of Wednesday the 13th  It was at that time  she added  that F A A  investigators discovered  new information on the first three minutes of the Ethiopian  flight that revealed  parallel conditions  involving the two accidents But in an interview after the hearing  Ms  Chao made it clear that the decision to ground the jets was the F A A  s   not her own   and said that she had no legal say  then or now  in deciding when the planes fly F A A  officials  are very careful about jumping to conclusions  having gone through other tragedies   she said   They are very careful about rushing to action  Ms  Chao s critics have argued that she could have exerted greater pressure on F A A  officials and avoided the appearance that she was endorsing the aircraft s airworthiness When asked  after the hearing  about her 737 flight from Texas  Mr  Chao said   I flew down on the 737 and I flew back on the 737  Those are the flights that were chosen  so I went on it  I didn t really have any concern about the safety  but that is irrelevant now  At the hearing  Representative David Price  Democrat of North Carolina and the chairman of the House Appropriations transportation subcommittee  asked a pointed question   Were there any lessons learned   He added   Should or could the F A A  have taken a different approach  Mr  Price also pressed Ms  Chao on whether the review process for new aircraft designs gives Boeing and other manufacturers too much latitude in overseeing their own designs and upgrades  a process critics have likened to self certification Ms  Chao said she did not yet  have answers  but said she had taken two steps   prompting an inquiry into the crashes by the department s inspector general and convening a special panel to look into the issue  We always need to improve   she said  

Leigh syndrome is a terrible disease  In the worst cases  it emerges shortly after birth and claims one major organ after another  Movement becomes difficult  and then impossible  A tracheotomy and feeding tube are often necessary by toddlerhood  and as the disease progresses  lungs frequently have to be suctioned manually  Most children with the condition die by the age of 5 or 6 Leigh syndrome is one of hundreds of so called mitochondrial diseases  which are caused by defects in the specialized cellular compartments   called mitochondria   that produce 90 percent of the body s energy  These disorders are rare  about 1 000 to 4 000 babies in the United States are born with one every year  But they are devastating  They can result in grave impairment of nearly any bodily system  They are largely untreatable  uniformly incurable and very difficult to screen for Some might also be preventable  Scientists have devised a procedure called mitochondrial replacement therapy  M R T   that involves transplanting the nucleus of an affected egg   mitochondrial diseases are passed down from the mother s side   into an unaffected one whose nucleus has been removed   The procedure is sometimes called  three parent I V F     in vitro fertilization   because mitochondria contain a minuscule amount of DNA  any resulting embryo would have mitochondrial DNA from the donor egg and nuclear DNA from each of its parents  After decades of careful study in petri dishes  flies  rodents and primates  M R T  is finally being tested in human clinical trials by doctors in Britain   Officials there have yet to confirm any births   In the United States  however  the procedure is effectively illegal  In 2015  members of Congress quietly attached a two sentence rider to an enormous appropriations bill  prohibiting the clinical use of any technology that would produce a genetically modified baby  Just two months later  a report from the National Academies of Science  Engineering and Medicine concluded that human trials of M R T  would be ethically permissible as long as several key safeguards were in place On Wednesday  the Petrie Flom Center at Harvard Law School will host a round table discussion  during which the scientists  ethicists and families at the center of this issue will make the first significant attempt to reconcile the federal ban with the federally commissioned report The participants will have much to discuss  For starters  proponents of M R T  have long held that the procedure should be exempted from the current prohibition  in part because it does not involve altering any genetic code  Defective mitochondria are swapped out for healthy ones  but mitochondrial DNA governs only a handful of basic cellular functions  It is separate from nuclear DNA  which helps determine individual traits like physical appearance  intelligence and personality  That means M R T  cannot be used to produce the genetically enhanced  designer babies  that so many people are concerned about  That s not to say that the procedure is risk free  There s no way to know how safe or effective M R T  is until doctors test it in humans  Clinical trials and the American regulatory apparatus were designed for exactly this purpose  to minimize risk without forgoing medical progress  But opponents of mitochondrial replacement therapy say that in this case  to proceed with such trials would be to subject future humans to an experiment that they are powerless to oppose   What will making babies be like in the future  Huge pools of health data may allow you to pick many of your child s genetic traits  Is that a good thing  Though that s true  the same might be said of any birth  whether it s assisted by technology or not  New life is always a risky proposition in which the life itself has no say  And parents have always tried to tip the odds toward success with deliberate actions   from prenatal nutrition to choice of school district   that can echo down through generations Some members of Congress have indicated that the 2015 clinical ban could be lifted   or amended to exclude M R T    once such ethical questions are resolved  But they ve already reauthorized it three times without any further public discussion They might look to their British counterparts for a template on moving forward  Before officials in the United Kingdom approved mitochondrial replacement therapy  they held multiple parliamentary debates on the issue  They also hosted public workshops and conducted in person interviews and surveys that thousands of citizens participated in  When it became clear that there was broad support for moving forward  the British government established protocols for licensing clinics that wanted to try the procedure  and for monitoring the health of any resulting children There s no telling how things will play out in the United States  When the Food and Drug Administration held a forum on M R T  in 2014  the agency received hundreds of letters opposing the idea  but a good portion of those letters were form emails  and many of them indicated a poor understanding of mitochondrial DNA and of the replacement therapies in question  Surveys have consistently shown that most Americans support the use of technology that modifies the human genome  as long as it s to eliminate diseases The coming round table offers a good start to a long overdue public dialogue  The group s conclusions about if  when and how to proceed with human trials of M R T  are not foregone  But one hopes that as they talk  the nation s leaders will listen Related More on mitochondrial replacement therapyGenetically Modified People Are Walking Among UsDec  1  2018Birth of Baby With Three Parents  DNA Marks Success for Banned

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved an osteoporosis drug that represents the first new treatment approach in nearly two decades   a strategy based on a rare gene mutation in people with bones so dense that they never break About 10 million people in the United States have osteoporosis  Worldwide  about 200 million people have brittle bones  one in three women  and one in five men  will suffer a fracture because of osteoporosis  often of the hip or spine  For many  the break leads to a downward spiral of disability  Standard treatments  drugs called bisphosphonates  stop the loss of bone but do not build it  The alternatives  parathyroid hormone and a derivative  build bone but also break it down  limiting the therapeutic effect  The new drug  romosozumab  brand name Evenity   developed by Amgen in collaboration with the Belgian drug company UCB  restores bone without breaking it down  according to the findings of two large clinical trials   Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  It was approved only for postmenopausal women with a high risk of fracture  and will carry a warning on its label that it may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke  the F D A  said   This is an extraordinarily important drug   said Dr  Richard Bockman  chief of the endocrine service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York   It s a true bone building drug that takes advantage of the underlying biology of bone   In large clinical trials  patients taking the drug saw increases in bone density in their spines on the order of 15 percent   a huge figure  similar to the amount of bone made in early adolescence  said Dr  Clifford J  Rosen  an osteoporosis expert at Maine Medical Center Research Institute and member of an F D A  panel that evaluated the data  Merely a 6 percent increase in bone density can translate into a doubling of bone strength  Dr  Bockman said  In the trials  patients taking the drugs saw a reduction in breaks  both in the spine and  clinical  fractures   broken bones that a patient notices  rather than  say  a collapsed vertebra discovered only in X rays In one study  spinal fractures occurred in 127 of 2 046 patients taking the new drug  compared with 243 of 2 047 taking alendronate  an older drug   It s a tremendous advance   said Dr  Dolores Shoback  a professor of medicine and an osteoporosis expert at the University of California  San Francisco But there also was a small  unexpected increase in heart attacks  strokes and sudden deaths in that study   50 of 2 040 patients  or 2 5 percent  taking Evenity  compared with 38 of 2 014  or 1 9 percent  taking alendronate  The effect was seen in one of the two large clinical trials  but not the other  The F D A  said it was requiring the boxed warning on the drug s label saying the drug should not be used by people who had a heart attack or stroke in the past year  Doctors should also consider whether to prescribe the drug to patients at high risk for heart attacks and strokes  Patients who have a heart attack or stroke while taking Evenity should stop taking the drug Side effects can include joint pain and headaches and irritation at the injection site The agency is requiring the company to conduct a post marketing study of cardiovascular risks  It is hard to know what to make of the possible risk  said Dr  Bart Clarke  a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic and president of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research   Maybe there is something unique about those patients   he said Amgen would not disclose the price at the time of approval  saying it would be disclosed next week  Evenity will be given as a monthly injection  Parathyroid hormone is given as a daily injection  while the drugs in the other major treatment class  the bisphosphonates  are taken as pills The new drug has a striking back story In 1964  researchers began studying an unusual group of Afrikaner patients in South Africa  They were tall and heavy  but not fat  Instead  their bones were large and dense  Their bones grew so profusely that their heads became distorted  Their jaws were large  and an overgrowth of bone in their skulls impinged upon nerves  often causing deafness or facial palsy  Many had terrible headaches  In some  the index and middle fingers fused together  In 2001  scientists reported that all these effects resulted from a single gene mutation  The finding led researchers to understand how the body controls the building of bone  Bones are in a state of constant flux  built up and broken down by the body  In osteoporosis  the balance is disrupted   more bone is broken down than is made  Bone cells make a protein called sclerostin that halts the production of bone and increases its breakdown  The gene mutation in the Afrikaner patients stops the production of sclerostin  so their bodies keep building bone without brakes  Scientists reasoned that if they could mimic the mutation by blocking sclerostin with an antibody  people with osteoporosis should build more bone  Once bone density increased  patients could stop taking the sclerostin blocking drug and switch to an older drug to maintain the new bone  Animal studies were successful  as were clinical trials  culminating in two large studies involving more than 10 000 postmenopausal women  In one trial  Evenity was compared to a placebo  in the other  it was compared to a bisphosphonate  In both studies  women taking Evenity ended up with more bone and fewer fractures In January  Evenity was reviewed by an advisory committee to the F D A   which voted 18 to 1 for approval   but called for Amgen to do more research to understand the possible cardiovascular side effects  There is a tremendous need for this medication  and there is an amazing amount of morbidity and mortality with this disease   said Dr  Frederick G  Kushner  a cardiologist at the Heart Clinic of Louisiana and a panel member  who voted to approve the drug The next step  Dr  Bockman said  is for companies to develop pills to block sclerostin so patients do not have to have monthly injections It may not be easy to convince patients to take the new drug  Experts anticipate that it will be offered to patients at highest risk  those who have had a serious fracture  or who have taken bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone  and did not respond or experienced serious side effects All too often  however  high risk patients are afraid to take drugs to prevent fractures  They remember stories of the rare patients who took bisphosphonates and had an unusual fractures or deterioration of the bones in their jaws  They don t remember the good   that fractures are being prevented   Dr  Shoback said   They remember some pivotal terrible thing that someone told them   Dr  Bockman has seen these patients  too  but hopes they can be convinced at least to try Evenity  This is a very important  great new drug   he said   And it is something we really need   

Boeing dismissed concerns about a powerful new anti stall system on the 737 Max for months  insisting that pilots could deal with any problems by following a checklist of emergency procedures Now  the preliminary findings from the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 have cast doubt on whether those instructions were sufficient  adding to the scrutiny over Boeing s and federal regulators  response to two deadly crashes involving the same jet model The findings  released Thursday in Ethiopia  suggest that the pilots on the Ethiopian Airlines flight initially followed the prescribed procedures after the anti stall system malfunctioned  They shut off the electricity that allows the automated software to push the plane s nose down and took manual control of the jet  They then tried to right the plane  with the captain telling his co pilot three times to  pull up  But they could not regain control  About four minutes after the system initially activated  the plane hit the ground at colossal speed  killing all 157 people on board  The captain was not able to recover the aircraft with the procedures he was trained on and told by Boeing   said Dennis Tajer  a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots union and a 737 pilot  who read the report The findings laid out a timeline of the March 10 flight based on analysis from 18 Ethiopian and international investigators and information from the jet s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder  While the findings are not yet final  the initial evidence has raised new concerns about whether Boeing and federal regulators provided sufficient guidance for pilots  The report and other evidence suggest that Boeing s procedures may not have worked well when a plane was flying at a high speed The pilots had a short window to react before going into an irrecoverable nose dive  Tests of the 737 Max have shown that once faulty data triggered the system  pilots had little time to save the aircraft  The system  according to the investigators  findings  appears to have forced the nose of the plane down several times in less than three minutes A Faulty SensorMoments after takeoff  one of two crucial sensors that measure the plane s angle of attack diverged wildly  eventually triggering an automated system that pushed down the nose of the plane        g ethiopia aoa box  g artboard     margin 0 auto

underestimated the power of the new software  known as the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system  or MCAS  It was too aggressive   he said   They left the pilot with no ability to gain control of the aircraft if it went to the full limit  The preliminary findings add to Boeing s woes  which have mounted after the Ethiopian Airlines disaster and the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max less than five months earlier in Indonesia  The company said this week that it needed more time to finish a software update and training  which will be necessary before the planes can fly again Lawmakers and regulators are scrutinizing Boeing and the process for certifying the 737 Max  The families of passengers and crew killed in the two crashes have hired lawyers to pursue claims against Boeing  Read more about obstacles to information sharing in the months between the Indonesian and Ethiopian crashes   Boeing has made good aircraft over the years  but this is a radical departure from that   said Chesley B  Sullenberger III  the aviation expert and retired pilot who landed a jet in the Hudson River   This never should have happened  Dennis A  Muilenburg  Boeing s chief executive  acknowledged the role of the software in the accident   As pilots have told us  erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment   he said in a statement on Thursday   It s our responsibility to eliminate this risk  We own it  and we know how to do it  The Federal Aviation Administration said   We continue to work toward a full understanding of all aspects of this accident  As we learn more about the accident and findings become available  we will take appropriate action  Boeing 737 Max  What s Happened After the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air CrashesBoeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months VideoDennis A  Muilenburg  Boeing s chief executive  said on Thursday that Boeing s software did play a role in the crashes of both Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 CreditCreditBen Stansall Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesAt a news conference on Thursday  Dagmawit Moges  Ethiopia s minister of transportation  said the flight crew had  performed all the procedures  repeatedly  provided by the manufacturer  but were not able to control the aircraft  The report  which could change in the coming months when it s completed  doesn t rule out the potential for pilot error in the Ethiopian crash  And some pilots in the United States raised doubts about whether the problems on board had been properly handled  They did not follow the Boeing procedures   said Hart Langer  a former Pan Am pilot and United Airlines executive  If the pilots had used the electric controls to pull the nose up more  he said  they would have been able to recover the plane  Had they done that  it would have cut out the MCAS input   he said  Here s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes  and what Boeing has been doing since  When Boeing outlined the emergency process in November after the Lion Air disaster  many pilots were confident that the new instructions were enough to avoid a crash  However  pilots didn t test the updated procedures in flight simulators  because few airlines had them for the 737 Max The problems with the Ethiopian Airlines flight started almost immediately after takeoff  according to the report  amplifying the pressure for pilots to act  About two minutes after takeoff  a safety system warned   Don t sink   multiple times A sensor that measures the angle at which the plane is flying began producing erroneous readings  suggesting that the plane was about to stall  There are two so called angle of attack sensors on the plane  and the one on the left began giving readings nearly 60 degrees different from the one on the right  The faulty data activated the software that automatically pushed down the nose of the plane The Dangerous Flaws in Boeing s Automated SystemHere s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months Once the system kicked in  the report said  the pilots appear to have followed the steps in the checklist that Boeing issued after the crash of Lion Air Flight 302 in October  First  they used electrical switches on their control wheels to bring the nose back up About five seconds later  the anti stall software activated again  pushing the plane toward the ground  according to the report  The pilots again used the switches to pull up the plane  And then  as prescribed by the emergency checklist  they disabled the electrical system that powered the software that pushed the plane down That move forced the crew to manually control the stabilizers  which help right the plane  by turning a wheel next to their seats that helps manually pull the plane s nose up  Soon after that  the first officer said the manual method was  not working   the report detailed The plane s speed appears to have complicated pilot s efforts to regain control  At high speeds  the force on the plane may make it nearly impossible for pilots to turn the wheel that controls the tail There is no indication that the Ethiopian pilots tried to slow the jet down  according to data from the flight recorder  What needs to be understood and explained is why the airspeed basically increased throughout the flight and the throttles did not move   said Jon Weaks  the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association When the manual process didn t work for the Ethiopian Airlines pilots  they appear to have turned back on the electricity to the flight control system in a last ditch effort at recovery  But the software activated one last time  sending the plane into a deadly nose dive  

Mother s little helpers  Wine o clock  Sleeping pills  Parents have long relied on a variety of chemicals to help them get through the day  But modern day expectations   along with the pressures of balancing work and home   are breeding guilt and anxiety  leading some moms and dads to look for new ways to relax without the woolly headed side effects of alcohol or medication  Enter cannabidiol  or CBD  a chemical found in hemp and marijuana  Although the science is far from conclusive  it has been marketed as a cure all for problems as varied as anxiety  chronic pain  inflammation and sleep disturbances  But unlike THC  another chemical found in cannabis  it doesn t make users high and  according to the World Health Organization  it does not appear to be addictive   It definitely helps when your kid punches you in the face   said Fritz Hubig  45  a real estate broker in Washington  D C   and the father of a 2 year old   If I did not embrace meditation and CBD  I m not sure where I d be  About nine months ago  Mr  Hubig started experimenting with CBD oil at the encouragement of his brother  who has been in the cannabis industry for more than two decades  After a month or so  Mr  Hubig figured out which dosage felt right  and now estimates that his stress level has been reduced by at least half  Being high strung and nervous and then having a kid  it s like   holy smokes   said Mr  Hubig  who works up to 80 hours a week   I was just so worried about everything   Enjoying this article  Sign up for the NYT Parenting newsletter here to get real stories like this  evidence based guidance and more in your inbox every Wednesday  CBD use is growing among all adults in the United States  not just parents  The Brightfield Group  a cannabis market research firm  says CBD sales are expected to reach  22 billion by 2022  But is it safe to use  So far  the Food and Drug Administration has approved only one drug containing CBD  Epidiolex  which is used to reduce seizures associated with two rare forms of epilepsy  The agency recently announced that it is holding a public hearing at the end of May to gather information about the safety  manufacturing  product quality and marketing of cannabis or cannabis derived compounds  including CBD The chemical is making headlines in part because of a new law  The 2018 farm bill legalized the production of hemp  which it defined as cannabis containing less than 0 3 percent THC  a move that is expected to help CBD vendors  But the F D A  said on its website that it does not permit CBD to be sold as dietary supplements or in food that crosses state lines  and has sent warning letters to several companies marketing products containing CBD Despite the need for more scientific information about CBD and its long term effects on the body  CBD products are everywhere  including coffee  cocktails and ice cream  It also appears in oils  salves  powder  bath bombs  gummies   even sexual lubricants   It s important for people to know that there s been no research at all on the CBD products that are sold online or in stores   said Dr  Esther Blessing  an assistant professor of psychiatry at N Y U  Langone Health who has been studying CBD for about five years   There s no safety net here  While some companies selling CBD products perform third party lab testing and tout rigorous protocols to ensure purity  there isn t central regulatory oversight to ensure high standards  which means there s plenty of snake oil  A 2017 study analyzing 84 CBD products from 31 different companies found that the amount of CBD on the label was often inaccurate  Perhaps most concerning  THC was detected in 18 of the 84 samples  Some of the products had levels of THC roughly equivalent to  a few deep puffs  on a joint  according to Dr  Brian F  Thomas  one of the authors of the study and a senior research scientist at RTI International  a nonprofit research institute But the inadequate oversight of these products hasn t stopped people from buying them  In fact  some users swear by their CBD products  and say it has become a balm for the pressures of parenting  Jen Bernstein  38  the mother of a 3 year old  uses CBD to help her sleep and decompress  I m less likely to scream and freak out that there s  you know  hot pink Play Doh smushed into the carpet   she said   It kind of washes away the day s stress  So instead of having a glass of wine  at the end of the day Ms  Bernstein prefers to eat CBD gummies   Eating a gummy it s just kind of like  you know what  She s 3  I don t have to take it personally that she s not eating my food  She s just picky right now   she said of her daughter  adding   I don t have to sweat the small stuff  Last year Ms  Bernstein co founded Women s Cannabis Club in New York City  which holds events for women interested in cannabis  art  culture and science  A recent workshop  headlined by a urologist  explored how CBD can enhance one s sex life  So far the club has more than 500 followers on Instagram and an active membership of about 50 women  many of them mothers  Ms  Bernstein said  She and her co founders are planning to create a similar club in Boston this year  Ellie Zitsman  the mother of a 3 year old  joined the New York club last year  She takes CBD oil a few times a week to help her sleep better  and as an antidote to  having to be on all the time as a parent    I have a pretty high stress job   said Ms  Zitsman  33  who is the head of research and development at Van Leeuwen Ice Cream in Brooklyn   a company that debuted a CBD ice cream flavor before New York City cracked down on CBD edibles   I have a hard time with my mind kind of settling at the end of the day  Families in the United States face anxiety provoking challenges  especially when juggling home life and work  researchers say  There is no federally mandated paid parental leave  no universal child care  no universal health care   the list goes on  That makes parenting hard in  a new  novel and increasingly frightening way   said Caitlyn Collins  an assistant professor of sociology at Washington University in St  Louis and author of the book  Making Motherhood Work  How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving   Exhaustion  chronic stress  little exercise and free time   these have public health consequences   Parents today also tend to spend more time working  said Dr  Elizabeth M  Fitelson  a perinatal psychiatrist and director of the Women s Program at the Columbia University Medical Center s department of psychiatry In addition  she said  it can sometimes seem as though  there are a million and one ways to do parenting wrong and there are plenty of people willing to tell you so  Over the last year  she added  some of her patients have asked about CBD oil and its effectiveness for anxiety or insomnia   If someone tells me they re using it and it s helpful for them and it doesn t appear to be causing side effects  I m not judgmental about it   she said   But because we just don t know enough about it  it certainly wouldn t be anything I would recommend   Tara Lynn Bailey  25  a student and the mother of two young children in Proctor  Okla   has been taking CBD oil to help calm her anxiety for about a year   I feel like it s just made my life easier   she said   I don t want to call it magical   she added  but she feels  1 000 times better  when she uses it  Dr  Blessing  who is studying the effects of CBD on PTSD  said the results of her clinical trials won t be available for years  Until more clinical trials are performed  there is only preliminary evidence to show that purified CBD can reduce anxiety  she added  When it comes to CBD   there are worse things  for sure   said Dr  Lucy Hutner  a reproductive psychiatrist in New York City  But  she added  if parents are feeling anxious  that can also be an opportunity to model mindful and effective ways to cope with stress for their children as an alternative to using a substance  In any case  parents need to be kind to themselves   We re all doing parenting in the way we do best   she said   Nobody does it perfectly  CBD Is Everywhere  but Scientists Still Don t Know Much

What Mr  Trump Said President Obama had child separation  Take a look  The press knows it  You know it  We all know it  I didn t have   I m the one that stopped it    But President Obama had the law  We changed the law  and I think the press should accurately report it  But of course they won t  False Mr  Trump has escalated a misleading defense of his administration s practice of breaking up families to outright revisionist history  There is no law that mandates family separation  let alone a law enacted under Mr  Obama  The practice is the result of a policy enacted by the Trump administration  and ended by Mr  Trump last June Last year  as the Trump administration faced backlash over its policy  top officials countered that Mr  Trump s predecessors had also separated families at the border  That was misleading  While previous administrations did break up families  it was rare   for example  in cases where there was doubt about the familial relationship between a child and an accompanying adult  according to former officials and immigration experts Neither former Presidents George W  Bush nor Barack Obama had a policy that had the effect of widespread family separation  Sarah Pierce of the Migration Policy Institute told The Times last June   Nothing like what the Trump administration is doing has occurred before   she said The Bush administration introduced a program in 2005 that also referred for prosecution immigrants illegally crossing the border  but it made an exception for parents with children  The Obama administration in 2014 detained families together  drawing its own criticisms and lawsuits Under Mr  Trump  the Justice Department announced its  zero tolerance policy  for illegally entering the United States in April 2018  describing it as  new  and in response to an increase in unauthorized border crossings that spring  The policy called for the criminal prosecution of everyone who enters the country illegally  As a result  nearly 3 000 children were forcibly separated from adult family members who were detained under the new policy that multiple top Trump officials have characterized as a deterrent After widespread condemnation from lawmakers in both parties  immigration activists and the United Nations  Mr  Trump signed an executive order in June that attempted to end the practice of family separation  It did not rescind the  zero tolerance  approach toward prosecuting migrants  but said it is now the policy of the Trump administration to keep families together At the White House on Tuesday  Mr  Trump said that his administration would not revive family separation as a practice  but he added   When you don t do it  it brings a lot more people to the border   Curious about the accuracy of a claim  Email factcheck nytimes com  

In the slaughterhouses where pigs are reduced to their constituent parts  the disassembly lines carry about 1 100 pigs per hour   a new carcass every three seconds  For decades  the federal government has sought to prevent food borne illnesses by stationing inspectors along the slaughter lines to eyeball the passing pigs for signs of disease and decay The Trump administration plans to overhaul this system  slashing the number of inspectors who work the lines and shifting some responsibility for food safety to the slaughterhouses The shift toward self regulation of slaughterhouses is part of a broader trend  The Trump administration also has proposed letting oil companies assume greater responsibility for the safety of offshore drilling platforms  and it is considering letting employees of nuclear power plants conduct some safety inspections in the place of federal regulators The system of slaughterhouse regulation is out of date  The industry has succeeded over time in sharply reducing the kinds of problems visible from the slaughterhouse floor   the government says its health inspectors increasingly are policing aesthetic issues   but the incidence of some illnesses caused by pork consumption has stopped falling  According to  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates   pork consumption causes more than 80 deaths a year and sickens more than half a million Americans  Unfortunately  there is no evidence that the Trump administration has a better plan The Clinton administration agreed in 1997 to let five hog plants adopt the inspection system that the Trump administration wants to embrace for the whole industry  In 2013  the Agriculture Department s inspector general reported that the pilot program had not demonstrably improved food safety  In response  the government defended the new system as no worse than the old one But there is some evidence of increased risk  Last year  the nonprofit Food   Water Watch used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain more recent inspection records for the plants in the pilot program  It found 22 instances between 2012 and 2016 in which companies were cited by the remaining federal inspectors for failing to identify and remove from the slaughter line a hog carcass that could cause food poisoning Using a pilot program is an excellent way to test a proposed change in regulation  But the point is to reach a clear conclusion  In this case  the government   rather astonishingly   has maintained the pilot program for two decades without proving that it works The Trump administration now says that expanding the pilot program to include a vast majority of the industry would significantly reduce episodes of salmonella poisoning  But outside experts point out that the administration simply assumes the testing methods that haven t worked in the pilot program will begin to yield better results The Trump administration also foresees considerable financial benefits   The government would save  6 4 million a year  while the industry s profits would rise by  47 3 million a year because slaughterhouses would be allowed to move hogs down the line at even higher speeds  But that would make life more difficult for the people who work the slaughter lines  The Agriculture Department insists it is not responsible for the safety of workers  and this is narrowly true  That job belongs to a different agency  But the White House is responsible for taking a broader view of proposed regulations  The government s tabulation of the costs and benefits needs to weigh the consequences for the people who work in the plants against the benefits for the people who own the plants In other cases  too  the administration is allowing self regulation contrary to evidence and experience  It is seeking to roll back some of the stringencies imposed on offshore oil drilling after the Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010  Before the blowout  which caused the largest maritime oil spill in American history  the government allowed oil companies to inspect and certify the safety of their own equipment  In the aftermath  the Obama administration required the use of third party inspectors approved by the government  The proposed rule would let companies choose their inspectors Similarly  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted this year to reverse some safeguards imposed on nuclear power plants following the March 2011 tsunami that caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan  And Annie Caputo  a member of the commission  told industry executives last month that she was open to letting plants  assume responsibility for some safety inspections The administration says it is reducing the cost of regulation without compromising public safety  But an administration that has acquired a reputation for indifference to scientific evidence needs to prove its changes are for the better RelatedWashington Rolls Back Safety Rules Inspired by Deepwater

WASHINGTON   The Latest on the Trump administration s stance on Iran  all times local  10 15 a m President Donald Trump says the U S  has designated Iran s Revolutionary Guard a  foreign terrorist organization  as part of an effort to increase international pressure on the country It s an unprecedented move because the U S  has never before used the designation for an entire foreign government entity Trump said in a statement Monday that the move  recognizes the reality  that Iran is a state sponsored supporter of terrorism and that the Guard is an active participant Administration officials have said the step will further isolate Iran and make clear that the U S  won t tolerate Iran s continued support for rebel groups and others that destabilize the Middle East But the designation may also have widespread implications for American personnel and policy in the region and elsewhere as Iran has threatened to retaliate    1 20 a m The Trump administration is planning to designate Iran s Revolutionary Guard a  foreign terrorist organization  in an unprecedented step to ramp up pressure on Tehran U S  officials say an announcement could come as early as Monday and the move could have widespread implications for U S  personnel and policy in the Middle East and elsewhere The Trump administration has escalated rhetoric against Iran for months  but this will mark the first such designation by any American administration of an entire foreign government entity Two U S  officials and a congressional aide confirmed the planned move and spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly The designation comes with sanctions  including freezes on some assets and a ban on Americans doing business with the group  

WASHINGTON   The White House moved to exert greater control over the federal regulatory process on Thursday by imposing additional scrutiny over independent government agencies when they establish new policies  guidelines or rules that affect large swaths of the economy The new policy was laid out in a memorandum written by Russell T  Vought  the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget  It broadens the scope of rules that would be subject to White House review and scrutiny by Congress through the Congressional Review Act The additional oversight would apply to agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission  the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Reserve  The White House review would not apply to the Fed s authority to set monetary policy but would affect its regulatory arm  including rules on the banking system  The move comes as President Trump  frustrated by the Fed s interest rate increases last year  has moved to install loyal allies on the Fed s seven member board Heightened scrutiny of federal rule making has been a longtime cause of Republicans  who view it as a way to limit government  The Trump administration has also been wary in some cases of independent agencies  which are often managed by both Republicans and Democrats Mr  Trump has made deregulation a pillar of his economic agenda and has instructed his officials to scale back rule making   and in some cases enforcement of existing rules   that he maintains will unleash business  The president has also signed numerous executive orders directing agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency to speed up projects and relax certain rules that businesses said were a hindrance Senator Patrick J  Toomey  Republican of Pennsylvania  applauded the move in a statement  saying  it appears that for those who want a government more accountable to the people  this announcement is a very positive development  But some consumer watchdog groups met the action with skepticism  This is a naked power grab on the part of the Trump administration   said Lisa Gilbert  the vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen   It puts agencies that are necessarily independent and intentionally kept firewalled from the administration right in the cross hairs and newly subject to undue influence  She added   The administration s thumb should not be on the scale for regulations that must be kept free from conflict  like financial regulations  campaign finance regulations and more  A senior administration official played down the scope of the memorandum  saying that it simply provided clarification that guidance documents were covered by Congressional Review Act statutes and needed to be reviewed to determine their economic effects According to the memorandum  proposals that have an effect of  100 million or more annually on the economy would be considered  major  and would require a review by Congress The administration official said Obama era guidance on joint employment and independent contractors that the Trump administration reversed in 2017 was an example of the type of policy that would be submitted for such a review That guidance had increased the likelihood that companies could be held responsible for labor violations committed by contractors and franchisees  

As baseless public health scares go  the one about police officers and nurses purportedly overdosing from passive fentanyl exposure should have been easy to dispel  Emergency workers across the country have reported dozens of such incidents in recent years  but their symptoms are often inconsistent with opioid poisoning  In some cases  officers have administered the overdose reversal drug Narcan to themselves   a feat that would be impossible in the midst of an actual overdose  In 2017  the nation s two leading toxicological societies published a joint statement explaining that for emergency medical workers  the risk of accidental opioid ingestion is  extremely low   Gloves almost always provide enough protection  masks are necessary only in exceptional cases Fentanyl is indeed one of the most powerful opioids ever created  It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  And it s true that even very small doses can be fatal  But merely touching the substance is not dangerous  Opioids have to enter the bloodstream to exert an effect  and not even the strongest ones can penetrate the skin quickly enough or in sufficient quantity for that to happen   if they could  people who are addicted to opioids would have no use for needles  As several journalists have pointed out  it took many years and many millions of dollars for scientists to develop patches capable of delivering pain medications through the skin  and those patches are still very slow and inefficient  The risk of accidental inhalation is only slightly more plausible  Fentanyl can enter the bloodstream through the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth  but it is not easily aerosolized  According to the toxicologists  joint statement  at the highest airborne concentrations found in industrial production facilities  an unprotected worker would need more than two hours to passively ingest even a medical dose of fentanyl  let alone a toxic one But so far  those facts have not stemmed the growing panic  Several states are planning to spend tens of millions of dollars on protective gear and screening equipment that most toxicologists say are unnecessary  As The Times has reported  prosecutors are pursuing charges ranging from reckless conduct to assault against people who expose police officers or emergency medical technicians to opioid powder  And addiction specialists are worried that health care providers will hesitate or outright refuse to treat people who are overdosing  just as doctors and dentists denied care to H I V  positive patients during the early days of the AIDS epidemic  That concern seems valid  given the stigma and vitriol that health care providers  law enforcement and the general public tend to heap on people who struggle with addiction It has not helped that federal agencies seem divided over   or perhaps confused by   the issue  The Drug Enforcement Administration has repeatedly warned that any contact with fentanyl can put an officer s life in danger  But safety recommendations published by an interagency committee  of which the D E A  was a part  echo toxicologists  assurances that such incidental exposure poses only a minimal risk  And videos produced by several federal entities contain conflicting accounts of what can and cannot happen to police officers who respond to opioid related calls As these mixed messages persist  so do reports of passive fentanyl toxicity  In the past six months alone  police officers in California  Iowa  Missouri  Massachusetts and Vermont have been hospitalized or reported feeling gravely ill after encountering opioids in the course of their work  many of them were given Narcan in response  even when their symptoms were more consistent with a panic attack than with an opioid overdose  Doctors and toxicologists who have studied the issue say that most of the cases reported so far are best explained by the so called nocebo effect  a phenomenon whereby people who believe they have encountered a toxic substance experience the expected symptoms of that exposure Misinformation is itself a hazardous substance  If care is delayed as a result of irrational fear  or stigma exacerbated  or resources diverted from needed treatments to unnecessary hazmat responses  more lives will be lost  Some 130 Americans already die every day from opioid overdoses  No part of this crisis needs to be exaggerated  It s already dire enough Related coverageMore on fentanyl China Bans All Types of Fentanyl  Cutting Supply of Deadly

WASHINGTON   The state of California filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to force two federal agencies to provide data they used to justify rolling back landmark Obama era vehicle emission standards  accusing the Trump administration of  willfully withholding  information In a lawsuit filed in U S  District Court in Washington  D C   California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Environmental Protection Agency failed to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request seeking data and analysis backing their proposal to freeze federal vehicle emission standards at 2020 levels through 2026 In addition to weaker fuel efficiency standards  the Trump administration proposal would strip California of the ability to impose stricter rules  which a dozen other states have adopted In 2011  California had agreed to harmonize its emissions with the Obama administration s vehicle emissions requirements through 2025  This lawsuit will break down their silence and secrecy   said Mary Nichols  chair of the California Air Resources Board   The public has a right to see all the facts and analysis used to support a rollback that increases oil consumption  hurts consumers  and pumps more air pollution and hundreds of million tons of climate changing gases into the atmosphere  The two federal agencies did not immediately comment The Obama era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46 7 miles per gallon by 2026  compared with 37 mpg under the Trump administration s preferred option  The lawsuit is the latest escalation in the feud between California and the Trump administration over vehicle emission standards In February  the White House ended negotiations with California over the plans to freeze fuel rules and pressured automakers to back their efforts California and 19 other states demanded the Trump administration abandon its proposal  States sued last year over the EPA s decision to revisit its January 2017 determination the 2025 rules were feasible  Automakers like General Motors Co  Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp oppose a freeze but want requirements reduced to account for changes in oil prices and consumer demand The EPA is on track to release final emissions rules by  spring or early summer   Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters on Thursday  Wheeler hopes California will not sue EPA once it releases final requirements  but if it does he suggested California do it quickly  to ensure regulatory certainty  Deputy NHTSA Administrator Heidi King said on Friday that dramatically higher fuel efficiency rules can  hinder safety  by raising the price of new  safer vehicles   Reporting by David Shepardson  Editing by Leslie Adler

There s never been a study like it before  and there probably never will be again Starting in March 2015  astronaut Scott Kelly spent 340 days aboard the International Space Station  A team of scientists tracked his body s responses to long term spaceflight in painstaking detail  They simultaneously tracked his identical twin brother  Mark  on Earth On Thursday  the scientists began publishing the huge trove of results from the so called NASA Twins Study   90 pages  all told  and that s just the first installment  Here s a guide to what they ve found   so far  Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar  Space travel changes the body Scientists tracked a huge range of measurements in the NASA Twins Study  from Mr  Kelly s performance on cognition tests to levels of gene activity in his cells  Many of the molecular tests had never been carried out on astronauts before  The exams required Mr  Kelly to draw his own blood and to send fresh samples back to Earth in a Soyuz supply craft  Within 48 hours  researchers were analyzing the samples at NASA labs In one test  researchers broke open Mr  Kelly s white blood cells and searched for molecular signals from each of his genes to see whether they were active  The scientists identified thousands of genes that ramped up their pace  By looking at what those genes do  the team gleaned some clues as to why they became active in Mr  Kelly  Some are known to be triggered by stress  so it was no surprise to find that Mr  Kelly s immune system also was on high alert In another test  the researchers scrutinized molecular caps on the ends of Mr  Kelly s chromosomes  called telomeres  Telomeres shorten with age  and stress can shorten them further  But Mr  Kelly s telomeres actually grew longer on average during his time in space Scott Kelly Spent a Year Taking Photos in Space  They re Beautiful In orbit aboard the International Space Station  the astronaut wasn t just gathering data for NASA s Twins Study  He also produced some  well  stellar images April 12  2019But it s not clear what the changes mean Human biology is complicated and mysterious  even here on Earth  So documenting changes that Mr  Kelly experienced in space won t automatically help scientists understand the causes For example  why did his telomeres get longer  The Twins Study researchers are still trying to figure it out  It might have something to do with Mr  Kelly s carefully designed  nutrient rich diet   or perhaps the stress of space travel triggered stem cells to wake up and start multiplying Another mystery lies in the very design of the experiment  NASA only examined a single astronaut in space  comparing his responses to his genetically identical brother  It s hard to know if all astronauts would experience the same changes   or if some of those changes are flukes of his own experience and genetic makeup The most worrisome findings  genetic mutations and lower scores on cognition tests Radiation can trigger certain mutations that may increase a person s risk of developing cancer  And there s more radiation in Earth orbit than on the surface of the planet  In his 340 days aboard the space station  Mr  Kelly was exposed to an estimated 48 times more radiation than he would have been subjected to had he spent a year on the planet Scientists were able to observe the appearance of radiation induced mutations in Mr  Kelly s cells  The mutations were still present in Mr  Kelly months after his return  suggesting that he ll carry them forward in his life  possibly causing a modest increase in his risk of cancer   Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  So it s a bit worrying that a long term trip to Mars would expose astronauts to eight times more radiation than Mr  Kelly received In addition  Mr  Kelly did worse on cognition tests even six months after landing  making more mistakes and responding more slowly  It s possible that the physical demands of spaceflight were to blame  or that unconsciously his motivation had decreased  These unexpected declines led some researchers to worry about how ready astronauts would be for a challenging landing on Mars after many months in deep space If we attempt a trip to Mars  we ll need to prepare NASA understands that long duration spaceflight could pose serious challenges to astronauts  By studying those challenges aboard the space station  the agency has been trying to quantify those risks  And on Earth  scientists have been investigating potential countermeasures Take radiation  On the space station  Mr  Kelly s cells switched on genes known to help repair DNA  It s possible that his cells actually undid a lot of mutations right after they arose  Researchers are investigating a variety of compounds that might spur the cells of astronauts to repair even more damage But such drugs might not be enough to handle  say  an unexpected solar flare  which would spray vast amounts of radiation  Some experts have speculated that spaceships would need a shielded room where astronauts could hide until flares were over  Although that might protect astronauts in theory  it would also add a lot of extra weight to a mission to Mars  And that s just one of the biological risks that scientists will have to plan for ImageScott Kelly

earthbound twin  Mark  The results hint at what humans will have to endure on long journeys through space April 11  2019 

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is preparing to designate Iran s Revolutionary Guards Corps as a  foreign terrorist organization    an unprecedented move that could have widespread implications for U S  personnel and policy U S  officials say an announcement could come as early as Monday  after a monthslong escalation in the administration s rhetoric against Iran The move would be the first such designation by any U S  administration of an entire foreign government entity  although portions of the Guard Corps have been targeted before Two U S  officials and a congressional aide are confirming the move  They re not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and are speaking on condition of anonymity The designation comes with sanctions  including freezes on some assets and a ban on Americans doing business with the group  

NEW YORK   A second federal judge has blocked the Department of Homeland Security from forcing tens of thousands of Haitians to return to their native country U S  District Judge William F  Kuntz in New York issued a nationwide injunction Thursday preventing the department from terminating Temporary Protected Status for Haitians Kuntz ruled on a lawsuit filed by Haitians in Florida and New York that challenged the Trump administration s decision to end the status granted to Haiti after its 2010 earthquake The trial in federal court in Brooklyn stemmed from one of seven lawsuits filed by immigrants and advocates over the 2017 move to end the program  The program has allowed about 300 000 people from Haiti  El Salvador  Nicaragua  Sudan and other countries to stay in the U S  for years following natural disasters or violence in their home countries In October  a California judge hearing another of the lawsuits temporarily blocked the changes covering people from those four countries  forcing the administration to maintain their protected status for now But the Brooklyn case  which covered only Haitians  was the first time the administration s move to end the program had been put on trial Kuntz said the plaintiffs offered persuasive evidence that the policy change was motivated by  a discriminatory purpose of removing non white immigrants to the country  His 145 page ruling cited evidence that officials from Homeland Security and other federal agencies  reverse engineered the TPS review process to achieve the desired political outcome  the termination of Haiti s TPS  A spokesperson for Homeland Security said in an email the department is  complying with intervening orders  but additional change is needed  What is often not reported is that the Trump Administration has forcefully advocated for Congressional action to provide legal status for long standing TPS beneficiaries in good standing  a change to the law is needed  not judicial intervention   the spokesperson The government is expected to appeal the ruling In response to the ruling in California  the Justice Department denied the administration had done anything improper and said the ruling  usurps the role of the executive branch  An attorney for the plaintiffs  Per Sejal Zota of the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild  said the ruling  vindicates the brave struggle of Haitian TPS holders who challenged Trump  because the law was on their side   

President Trump  reversing an agreement negotiated by the Obama administration  abruptly ended a deal between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that had eased the path for players to compete in the United States without defecting from their country The Trump administration said that the deal constituted a violation of trade laws because the Cuban federation was part of the government in Havana   a departure from the previous administration s stance In a letter to M L B  s outside counsel  which was obtained by The New York Times  Nikole Thomas  the acting assistant director for licensing at the Office of Foreign Assets Control  outlined the U S  government s opposition to the deal  which stipulated that the Cuban federation would receive 25 percent of a player s signing bonus for a minor league player and between 15 and 25 percent for a major league player The letter said that the O F A C  had  determined that M L B  s payments to the Cuban Baseball Federation are not authorized  because  a payment to the Cuban Baseball Federation is a payment to the Cuban government  News of the administration s rejection of M L B  s plan was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and ESPN Cuban sports entities  including its baseball federation and Olympic committee  have argued they are independent of the central government  but the Trump administration rejected that assessment  The U S  does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society   said Garrett Marquis  a spokesman for the National Security Council   The administration looks forward to working with M L B  to identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents  and not as property of the Cuban state  In a statement  M L B  said   We stand by the goal of the agreement  which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba  One M L B  official  who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter  said the league had requested a face to face meeting with U S  government agencies but were not granted one  M L B  was prepared to base its argument on the fact that the Obama administration had given it a license in 2016 to do business with the Cuban baseball federation  and that a Trump era national security presidential memorandum published on June 16  2017 promised the agreement would be grandfathered in  The memorandum stated that any new regulations  will not affect existing contracts and licenses  Several U S  business entities  including travel and telecommunications companies  do business in Cuba  But M L B  officials worried that  as a high profile organization  its deal would be challenged by hard liners in the government John Bolton  the national security adviser  seemed to foreshadow the move on Sunday when he tweeted   Cuba wants to use baseball players as economic pawns   selling their rights to Major League Baseball  America s national pastime should not enable the Cuban regime s support for Maduro in Venezuela  Cuba has produced some of the best players currently in the major leagues  including Aroldis Chapman of the Yankees  Yoenis Cespedes of the Mets and Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox  They and most other Cuban players in M L B  left their country illegally  in some cases smuggled out by disreputable agents and human traffickers on speedboats and rafts over dangerous waters  It s bad in the sense that they can t come anymore in the formal  legal way that was planned   Chapman said on Monday For some players  the dangers continued after they arrived because they were at the mercy of the smugglers  To this date  I am still harassed   Abreu  who has played for the Chicago White Sox since 2014  said in a statement issued at the time the deal was announced in December M L B  and its players union sought to eliminate that dangerous process by creating a posting system similar to the one used with players from Japan and South Korea  Under the plan  a major league team seeking to sign a Cuban player would pay a posting fee to the Cuban federation  which would in turn allow the player to leave the country and return home at will  Just days ago  the Cuban federation released the names of 34 players it said were eligible to sign with M L B  The objective of the agreement  which is the product of years of negotiations with the F C B   is to end the dangerous trafficking of Cuban baseball players who desire to play professional baseball in the United States   M L B  s lawyers said in their petition to the Treasury Department in January M L B  and the Cuban baseball federation commenced talks after the United States and Cuba began a thaw in relations under the Obama administration in 2014  Soon after that  baseball s commissioner s office secured a license from the Treasury Department to legally begin negotiations with the Cubans After announcing its agreement in December  M L B  quietly sought to convince administration officials   who immediately criticized the plan publicly   that it fit within the guidelines for an exemption to the trade laws  At the same time  M L B  officials were also resigned to the political opposition to the deal and the possibility of returning to the old method of signing Cuban players  

WASHINGTON   National security adviser John Bolton said Friday that he will travel to Miami next week to outline steps the administration is taking to confront what he says are threats from the  troika of tyranny   Cuba  Venezuela and Nicaragua John Bolton said in a tweet that he is delivering a speech on Wednesday  the 58th anniversary of the United States  failed attempt to overthrow the Cuban government in the 1961  Bay of Pigs  invasion  His speech will be at the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association  which endorsed Trump for president Miami is home to thousands of exiles from Cuba  Venezuela and Nicaragua In a speech there last year  Bolton discussed newly released sanctions against Venezuela and Cuba and promised additional penalties against Nicaragua as he laid out the administration s hardline policy toward the three countries  Bolton called them the  troika of tyranny  and said they represented destructive forces of  oppression  socialism and totalitarianism  Also on Wednesday  the administration is expected to announce its decision on whether to allow lawsuits against companies that profit from U S  linked properties confiscated after Cuba s 1959 socialist revolution The Helms Burton Act lets Americans use U S  courts to sue non American companies that use property that was seized after Fidel Castro s revolution  Every president has suspended the law since it was passed in 1996  But in a move against Cuba  the Trump administration announced last month that such suits could be filed It was seen as a largely symbolic move  The announcement limited lawsuits to about 200 Cuban businesses and government agencies that are already subject to U S  sanctions because of their ties to Cuban military and intelligence ministries

WILMINGTON  Del    The U S  government can continue at least temporarily to send asylum seekers back to Mexico after President Donald Trump scored a rare ruling in his favor on Friday from the U S  9th Circuit Court of Appeals The asylum program was set to be shut down at 8 p m  EDT  midnight GMT  by an order issued on Monday by U S  District Court Judge Richard Seeborg  but the Trump administration had asked for the Court of Appeals in San Francisco to intervene The Court of Appeals issued a two paragraph order saying the lower court injunction was temporarily stayed while the parties prepare to submit arguments next week on the government s request for a longer stay that would remain in place for the months long appeals process The government told the Court of Appeals in papers filed late Thursday that the United States faced  a humanitarian and security crisis  at the southern border and needed to the policy to deal with surging number of refugees Seeborg had ruled on Monday the policy was contrary to U S  immigration law and ordered a nationwide injunction to halt the program  but delayed implementation of his order to allow the government to appeal  This is an interim step while the court considers the government s stay request   said a statement from Judy Rabinovitz  a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who represented plaintiffs in the case and who opposed the stay Since January  the administration has sent more than 1 000 asylum seekers  mostly from Central America  back to Mexico to wait the months or years it can take to process claims through an overloaded immigration system  Although it is appealing and the lower court order had yet to take effect  Reuters reporters confirmed that the Trump administration was allowing some asylum seekers from Mexico to return to the United States Trump has bristled at limits on his administration s ability to detain asylum seekers while they fight deportation  and the administration was in the midst of expanding the program when Seeborg blocked it The 9th Circuit Court has been a frequent target for Trump s criticisms of the judicial system  which has blocked his immigration policies on numerous occasions After Seeborg ruled on Monday  Trump tweeted   A 9th Circuit Judge just ruled that Mexico is too dangerous for migrants  So unfair to the U S  OUT OF CONTROL    Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington  Delaware  Editing by Tom Brown  

Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines   and the power brokers who shape them           Aircraft manufacturers like Boeing rarely face a criminal investigation resulting from plane crashes  But last fall a grand jury in Washington  D C   issued a subpoena for records after the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max plane  In the wake of the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash involving similar circumstances  the F B I  has joined that investigation The New York Times described Boeing s push to develop the 737 Max as  frenetic  and reported that prosecutors and regulators are investigating whether that led Boeing  to miss crucial safety risks and to underplay the need for pilot training  But what federal criminal laws are the investigators looking at as they pore over Boeing s records  Both the Justice Department and Boeing have declined to comment on the criminal inquiry One statute they may consider is the federal false statements law  The broad statute is used when a company provides information to a federal agency like the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the safety of a plane and makes it a crime to provide an agency with  any materially false  fictitious  or fraudulent statement or representation  about a matter that comes within its jurisdiction Investigators will examine whether Boeing made any false statements regarding a new software system added to avoid stalls in Boeing s 737 Max series  Investigators suspect that faulty data from sensors on both planes may have caused the system  known as MCAS  to malfunction  Boeing s chief executive has said that the automated flight system played a role in the two crashes Boeing also charged extra for two safety features on its 737 Max jets that might have helped the pilots detect erroneous sensor readings to avoid problems with the software Investigators likely will examine whether Boeing made any misstatements about the upgrades or if the company failed to disclose possible safety problems to the F A A  without those upgrades  The false statement law covers not only outright lies  but also submissions in which a person  falsifies  conceals  or covers up  information submitted to a federal agency  There have been a number of prosecutions involving false statements to the F A A  under the statute  Most of those cases  though  involve pilots who fail to disclose information that might result in the agency revoking or refusing to renew a license The challenge to bringing a false statement charge is that the government must show they were made  knowingly and willfully   That means negligence by Boeing would not be enough to prove a violation The criminal investigation may also examine whether Boeing violated a law adopted in 2000  The statute makes it a crime to  knowingly and with intent to defraud  to falsify or conceal a material fact about an aircraft part  or to make  any materially fraudulent representation  about a part  It can be applied to conduct outside the United States so long as the company is organized under the laws of this country  which  as a Delaware corporation  Boeing is The aircraft fraud parts law carries stiff penalties  including a fine of  10 million for each violation by a company and a sentence of up to life in prison for individuals charged if the part involved was the  proximate cause  of a malfunction that resulted in death  A conviction also could result in a criminal forfeiture of  any property constituting  or derived from  any proceeds that the person obtained  directly or indirectly  as a result of the offense  If there is evidence of fraud and not just false statements  the Justice Department could also pursue a wire fraud case  Prosecutors used that law against General Motors for the failure of ignition switches in certain models that caused a number of deaths  along with a charge under the false statement law  In addition  the auto parts maker Takata pleaded guilty to a wire fraud charge for installing faulty airbag inflaters Federal prosecutors have a number of options if there is evidence that Boeing intentionally provided false or misleading information to the F A A  The investigation is still in a preliminary stage  and there is no guarantee that a criminal case will emerge  For the company  there is danger in any criminal investigation because even the hint of possible misconduct could have significant consequences as it tries to deal with the fallout from crashes of its best selling aircraft  

A federal appeals court said Friday that the Trump administration could temporarily continue to force migrants seeking asylum in the United States to wait in Mexico while their cases are decided A three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a stay of a lower court ruling four days earlier that blocked the administration s protocol  The appeals court will consider next week whether to extend that stay   and allow the Trump administration policy to remain in effect for longer The administration in December  announced its new policy  called the migration protection protocols  arguing that it would help stop people from using the asylum process to enter the country and remain there illegally  President Trump has long been angered by so called catch and release policies  under which asylum seekers are temporarily allowed in the United States while they wait for their court hearings On Monday  Judge Richard Seeborg of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued an injunction against Mr  Trump s new protocols  saying that the president did not have the power to enforce them and that they violated immigration laws Judge Seeborg said in his ruling that the protocols did not include  sufficient safeguards  to comply with the Department of Homeland Security s obligation against returning migrants to places where their  life or freedom would be threatened  On Friday  as Judge Seeborg s injunction was set to go into effect  a three judge panel for the Ninth Circuit issued the temporary stay In a tweet late Friday night  President Trump wrote   Finally  great news at the Border   He has previously criticized the Ninth Circuit  which is based in San Francisco  saying that the court always ruled against him  While that is not always true  the administration s track record in the circuit has been poor The Justice Department  which appealed Judge Seeborg s decision  argued that the injunction would  impose immediate  substantial harm on the United States  including by diminishing the executive branch s ability to work effectively with Mexico to manage the crisis on our shared border  The Ninth Circuit will consider next week whether to keep the stay   and Mr  Trump s protocols   in place during the appeal Judy Rabinovitz  the deputy director of the Immigrants  Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union  who argued the case  said she expected that decision to come next week  The question will be  can the government continue to implement the policy while it appeals it to the Ninth Circuit   she said   Obviously  we don t think it should be able to  She called the policy unlawful and cruel  We think it should be stopped   she said Lawyers for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment The appeals court s decision comes as the nation s immigration system may have reached a breaking point as migrants increasingly arrive at the country s southwestern border with Mexico The flow of migrant families has reached record levels  with February totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year  Many are seeking asylum  in which they have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or testimony that establishes the  well founded  fear that they would face danger if they return home The Trump administration s migration protection protocols were an attempt to deter migrants  Mexico s government reluctantly agreed to house the migrants in December

As President Trump continues his mad purge of the Department of Homeland Security  a sinister figure is emerging as the driving force behind all the chaos  Stephen Miller  the president s top immigration adviser A fierce restrictionist  Mr  Miller seems to have rarely met an immigrant he didn t want to deport  He is among the hardest of hard liners  known for spurring his boss to pursue ever more draconian measures Not that Mr  Trump needs much encouragement  He did  after all  ascend to the White House on an immigrant bashing  ethnonationalist platform as dishonest as it was divisive  Many of the administration s uglier policy ideas have been a result of Mr  Trump s failure to deliver on his signature campaign promise of a  big  beautiful  border wall  Small wonder Mr  Miller has emerged as his favorite consigliere on such matters  Mr  Miller s preferred approach to immigration and border security is straight out of Ann Coulter s fever dreams  He was a chief architect of the travel ban on citizens from Muslim majority countries  He favors the building of tent cities at the border for warehousing asylum seekers  He s agitating to end the 20 day limit on detaining migrant children  And he wants to reinstate the practice of snatching migrant children from their families   though this time he d like to give parents a  binary choice  of having their kids taken from them or held with them in detention indefinitely Mr  Miller is being credited with the blood bath at the Department of Homeland Security  Since Friday  a handful of top leaders have been  or are soon to be  shown the door  including the head of the Secret Service  the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  who was never quite ruthless enough for the president s or Mr  Miller s taste  More firings are expected as Mr  Miller moves to remake the department in his image Bottom line  Stephen Miller is a man whose anti immigration zeal remains unfettered by concern for the law  international norms or basic humanity And yet  The portrait of the 33 year old policy adviser as a figure of singular evil is both overly simplistic and counterproductive  Sure  the guy is a force for darkness  easing the president ever further into nativism  But no matter how much of the administration s immigration agenda Mr  Miller has been responsible for  it s taken a village to make that vision a reality  Giving too much credit to any one person builds up Mr  Miller  undeservedly  as a Machiavellian genius and lets many other folks off the hook A society does not fall because of a small coterie of bad actors  Widespread rot requires legions of enablers  many of whom are driven by varying blends of personal ambition  ideological expedience and the self aggrandizing delusion that  through their invaluable counsel  they can save the state from total destruction Expect increasingly to hear this last rationalization from former administration officials starting redemption tours as they resume life outside the Trump bubble Advisers like Kellyanne Conway  lawmakers like Senator Lindsey Graham and the former House Speaker Paul Ryan  party apparatchiks like the Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel and a whole host of Trump friendly media personalities may not personally share the president s views or policy aims  But their willingness to swallow some of the administration s cruelest acts renders them complicit  Neither their reputations nor their consciences should be wiped clean Take Ms  Nielsen  Since her departure was announced  she s enjoyed some sympathy for having behaved less viciously than some in the White House desired  Throughout her tenure  stories bubbled up about how she incurred Mr  Trump s wrath by dragging her feet on policies that would have run afoul of the law or thrown the nation into chaos  But she still carried out and aggressively enforced her share of atrocities Now  defenders are portraying the woman who was in charge of caging migrant children as a hapless victim of the administration s more unhinged forces  The so called immigration hard liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration  giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems   Thad Bingel  a homeland security official under President George W  Bush and former aide to Ms  Nielsen  told The Times   They apparently don t want anyone like a Secretary Nielsen or Secretary Kelly  who deals in reality  to tell them or the president any of this  No doubt  Ms  Nielsen had a difficult  perhaps impossible  job  But it was no profile in courage for her to cling to her morally untenable position until Mr

WASHINGTON   President Trump s purge of the nation s top homeland security officials is a sign that he is preparing to unleash an even fiercer assault on immigration  including a possible return of his controversial decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents  current and former administration officials said Monday Mr  Trump shook up the ranks of his top immigration officials after spending months demanding that they take tougher action to stop the surge in migrant families at the border and seething about what he considers their overly legalistic refusals to do what he has said was necessary That anger was underscored on Monday when a judge blocked Mr  Trump s efforts to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases proceed   a practice that immigration advocates called inhumane and illegal  Judge Richard Seeborg of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that existing law did not give Mr  Trump the power to enforce the policy  known as  migrant protection protocols  The immediate targets of the president s growing fury about the situation at the border were the officials who he saw as insufficiently steely minded  Kirstjen Nielsen  who resigned  Sunday as the secretary of homeland security  and Ron Vitiello  whose nomination to permanently lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement was pulled after Mr  Trump remarked that  we want to go in a tougher direction  But the longer term effect of the eruption of Oval Office frustration is likely to be a burst of hard line policies that stand out even in an administration that has pursued an unprecedented series of executive actions and rules changes aimed at reducing legal and illegal immigration into the United States In addition to urging Mr  Trump to revisit the idea of family separation  several of the president s closest immigration confidants have been pushing him to consider even harsher measures Those include further limits on who can seek asylum  stronger action to close ports of entry along the Mexican border  an executive order to end birthright citizenship  more aggressive construction of a border wall  and a more robust embrace of active duty troops to secure the border against illegal immigration In an administration that is famous for chaos and last minute decision making  it is unclear on which of those policies the president might choose to move forward  But by removing Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Vitiello and perhaps others  Mr  Trump is getting rid of voices who sometimes cautioned him against taking actions they believed to be illegal or unwise  There was a perception that Secretary Nielsen was not as committed to the sort of full throated approach that others in the administration  including the White House  were seeking   said Seth Grossman  who served as deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2015 He said Ms  Nielsen s exit and Mr  Vitiello s step back  signals there is an intention to pursue more aggressive policies  Three senior administration officials with knowledge of the president s conversations over the past several months confirmed that Mr  Trump has repeatedly told aides that he wants to restart the family separation policy  One of the officials said the president had made it clear to aides that he liked Ms  Nielsen personally  but was critical of her job performance  All three officials spoke about the internal discussions on the condition of anonymity Stephen Miller  the architect of Mr  Trump s immigration agenda and one of the president s closest advisers in the White House  has been an advocate for a modified version of the family separation policy known as  binary choice  Others  including Kris Kobach  the former Kansas secretary of state and an informal immigration adviser  and Stephen K  Bannon  the president s former chief strategist  have also been urging tougher actions Under a binary choice policy  which is highly controversial  migrant parents would be given a choice of whether to voluntarily allow their children to be separated from them  or to waive their child s humanitarian protections so the family can be detained together  indefinitely  in jail like conditions  Immigration advocates have said the idea is inhumane and would be found illegal by courts The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other Ms  Nielsen was the head of the department during the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy last year that led to the separation of thousands of families  More than 2 700 children were separated from their parents at the border under that policy to prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally  even those with families seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds Mr  Trump eventually relented on the family separations  and a federal judge in California halted them in June  But in January  the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services reported that thousands more families might have been separated than previously reported While Mr  Trump has been hampered by the law in his efforts to impose some new enforcement policies  there are certain things he can do without congressional approval Those include shutting down ports of entries along the southwestern border and slowing down the process for both illegal and legal immigration Last month  he closed American field offices abroad that had helped facilitate immigration applications  Mr  Trump has also limited the number of people who can request asylum each day through a process known as  metering   and he has threatened to shut down traffic lanes and tariff trucks at the ports of entry Jonathan Meyer  a former deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security  said the Trump administration will continue to pursue hard line immigration policies because they are important to the president s political supporters  who helped fuel Mr  Trump s success in the 2016 presidential campaign  It appears that at times it s less important in this administration  whether they lose or win in court  than to just say they ve been able to have done it and have it as a talking point   Mr  Meyer said   And have an opportunity to criticize the courts if they lose  Mr  Meyer said installing a new secretary at the department will further embolden Mr  Trump  He s willing to move forward and do things even when he knows he s going to be sued for it and when the legality is in question   Mr  Meyer said   If that s the position you take and if you have people willing to implement that strategy  there s a lot of things you can do  But eventually you re going to be hit with a temporary restraining order  Mr  Grossman said Mr  Trump s personnel moves were indeed a signal that the administration would embrace aggressive policies  But he added that Mr  Trump has threatened to enact such policies before  only to back off The president could also be stymied by further court rulings blocking his efforts to crack down on immigrants On Monday in California  the judge said in his ruling that in addition to violating immigration laws  the protocols did not include  sufficient safeguards  to comply with the Department of Homeland Security s obligation against returning migrants to places where their  life or freedom would be threatened  Immigration advocates hailed the decision  calling it the latest victory in the legal battles with the Trump administration that began when the president imposed a travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries just days after taking office in 2017  Try as it may  the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States   said Judy Rabinovitz  the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants  Rights Project  who argued the case The Trump administration had negotiated the protocols with the Mexican government because of the president s longstanding anger with so called catch and release policies in which asylum seekers are temporarily released into the United States while they wait for their court hearings The policy of forcing some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico was an effort to stop that from happening  But the court ruling means that the president will have to abandon it  at least for the time being  

SAN DIEGO   The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year  a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47 000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1  2017 and June 25  2018   the day before U S  District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families  The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation   for example  children under 5 The administration would provide information on separated families on a rolling basis to the American Civil Liberties Union  which sued to reunite families and criticized the proposed timeline on Saturday  We strongly oppose a plan that could take up to two years to locate these families   said Lee Gelernt  the ACLU s lead attorney   The government needs to make this a priority  Sabraw ordered last year that more than 2 700 children in government care on June 26  2018 be reunited with their families  which has largely been accomplished  Then  in January  the U S  Health and Human Services Department s internal watchdog reported that thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017  The department s inspector general said the precise number was unknown The judge ruled last month that he could hold the government accountable for families that were separated before his June order and asked the government submit a proposal for the next steps  A hearing is scheduled April 16 Sheer volume makes the job different than identifying children who were in custody at the time of the judge s June order  Jonathan White  a commander of the U S  Public Health Service and Health and Human Services  point person on family reunification  said in an affidavit White  whose work has drawn strong praise from the judge  would lead the effort to identify additional families on behalf of Health and Health and Human Services with counterparts at Customs and Border Protection and U S  Immigration and Customs and Enforcement  Dr  Barry Graubard  a statistics expert at the National Cancer Institute  developed a system to flag for early attention those most likely to have been separated The vast majority of separated children are released to relatives  but many are not parents  Of children released in the 2017 fiscal year  49 percent went to parents  41 percent to close relatives such as an aunt  uncle  grandparent or adult sibling and 10 percent to distant relatives  family friends and others The government s proposed model to flag still separated children puts a higher priority on the roughly half who were not released to a parent  Other signs of likely separation include children under 5  younger children traveling without a sibling and those who were detained in the Border Patrol s El Paso  Texas  sector  where the administration ran a trial program that involved separating nearly 300 family members from July to November 2017 Saturday marks the anniversary of the administration s  zero tolerance  policy to criminally prosecute every adult who enters the country illegally from Mexico  The administration retreated in June amid an international uproar by generally exempting adults who come with their children  The policy now applies only to single adults

A prominent Texas medical school will stop considering race or ethnicity in deciding whether to admit applicants  as part of an agreement with the Education Department s civil rights office The president of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center signed the agreement in February  14 years after the department began investigating a complaint filed by an anti affirmative action group  The agreement is the first of its kind for the Education Department under Secretary Betsy DeVos  and comes as the Trump administration continues its hard turn against the use of race in admissions Roger Clegg  general counsel for the Center for Equal Opportunity  which filed the original complaint  said on Tuesday that the agreement could pave the way for similar actions at other schools  It shows that the Trump administration is serious about enforcing the civil rights laws in a way that protects the rights of all Americans to be free from discrimination   Mr  Clegg said   The more schools that stop using racial preferences  the harder it will be for other schools to continue using racial preferences  Affirmative action programs are under renewed scrutiny in courts and by federal authorities  Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are both facing court challenges to their admissions procedures that could reach the Supreme Court  The Trump administration is investigating allegations of discrimination against Asian American applicants at Harvard and Yale The administration has made clear its position on the use of race in admissions  abandoning Obama era policies that argued for the  compelling interests  of diversity to college campuses and encouraging race neutral admissions methods Jin Hee Lee  senior deputy director of litigation at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc   said the Texas Tech agreement was part of a broader pattern of chipping away at affirmative action  In the larger context of this administration s civil rights record  it s clear that this is yet another attack on education equity   Ms  Lee said   We will continue to take steps to protect efforts aimed at improving education equity throughout the country  The complaint by the Center for Equal Opportunity  which describes itself as a conservative civil rights organization  came after a 2003 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Grutter v  Bollinger  In that decision  the court upheld the use of race as a factor in admission to the University of Michigan Law School  saying that the school had a compelling interest in achieving diversity Soon after  the Health Sciences Center School of Medicine and Texas Tech University  the undergraduate campus in the Texas Tech system  announced that they would begin considering race in admissions  Mr  Clegg challenged the decision on the ground that race should be used only as a last resort But for the fall 2014 class  the undergraduate campus removed any consideration of race in admissions  As a result  the Education Department dismissed the case The department continued to investigate the Health Sciences Center  and found that the medical school was continuing to use race conscious admissions  according to documents in the case The policies had a significant effect on the makeup of the medical school  Enrollment went from 9 percent Hispanic in the class that entered in 2004 to 16 percent in the class that entered in 2018  The university said that it was trying to recruit more Hispanic students in part to send more people to practice medicine in underserved communities in West Texas  according to documents in the case Mr  Clegg said the investigation  which had begun during the George W  Bush administration  had lasted through the Obama years   which suggests that even under a liberal Democratic administration  there were problems  with admissions practices The medical school defended race conscious admissions by saying it needed to recruit students who showed the  cultural sensitivity  that would allow them to serve racially diverse patients  according to a letter from the Education Department s civil rights office  Federal officials were concerned that the medical school s admissions process violated civil rights law Eric D  Bentley  vice chancellor and general counsel of the Texas Tech University System  said in a letter to the civil rights office that while the medical school believed it was in compliance with the law  it was agreeing to stop using race in admissions  in an effort to resolve this matter and focus on educating future health care providers  The decision was effective March 1  according to the agreement  and set a deadline of Sept  1 to revise all admissions and recruitment materials to reflect the changes  It did not  the agreement said  constitute an admission that the university had run afoul of civil rights law

There s a lot we don t know about the legacy Donald Trump will leave behind  And it is  of course  hugely important what happens in the 2020 election  But one thing seems sure  Even if he s a one term president  Trump will have caused  directly or indirectly  the premature deaths of a large number of Americans Some of those deaths will come at the hands of right wing  white nationalist extremists  who are a rapidly growing threat  partly because they feel empowered by a president who calls them  very fine people  Some will come from failures of governance  like the inadequate response to Hurricane Maria  which surely contributed to the high death toll in Puerto Rico   Reminder  Puerto Ricans are U S  citizens  Some will come from the administration s continuing efforts to sabotage Obamacare  which have failed to kill health reform but have stalled the decline in the number of uninsured  meaning that many people still aren t getting the health care they need  Of course  if Trump gets his way and eliminates Obamacare altogether  things on this front will get much  much worse But the biggest death toll is likely to come from Trump s agenda of deregulation   or maybe we should call it  deregulation   because his administration is curiously selective about which industries it wants to leave alone Consider two recent events that help capture the deadly strangeness of what s going on One is the administration s plan for hog plants to take over much of the federal responsibility for food safety inspections  And why not  It s not as if we ve seen safety problems arise from self regulation in  say  the aircraft industry  have we  Or as if we ever experience major outbreaks of food borne illness  Or as if there was a reason the U S  government stepped in to regulate meatpacking in the first place Now  you could see the Trump administration s willingness to trust the meat industry to keep our meat safe as part of an overall attack on government regulation  a willingness to trust profit making businesses to do the right thing and let the market rule  And there s something to that  but it s not the whole story  as illustrated by another event  Trump s declaration the other day that wind turbines cause cancer Now  you could put this down to personal derangement  Trump has had an irrational hatred for wind power ever since he failed to prevent construction of a wind farm near his Scottish golf course  And Trump seems deranged and irrational on so many issues that one more bizarre claim hardly seems to matter But there s more to this than just another Trumpism  After all  we normally think of Republicans in general  and Trump in particular  as people who minimize or deny the  negative externalities  imposed by some business activities   the uncompensated costs they impose on other people or businesses For example  the Trump administration wants to roll back rules that limit emissions of mercury from power plants  And in pursuit of that goal  it wants to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from taking account of many of the benefits from reduced mercury emissions  such as an associated reduction in nitrogen oxide But when it comes to renewable energy  Trump and company are suddenly very worried about supposed negative side effects  which generally exist only in their imagination  Last year the administration floated a proposal that would have forced the operators of electricity grids to subsidize coal and nuclear energy  The supposed rationale was that new sources were threatening to destabilize those grids   but the grid operators themselves denied that this was the case So it s deregulation for some  but dire warnings about imaginary threats for others  What s going on Part of the answer is  follow the money  Political contributions from the meat processing industry overwhelmingly favor Republicans  Coal mining supports the G O P  almost exclusively  Alternative energy  on the other hand  generally favors Democrats There are probably other things  too  If you re a party that wishes we could go back to the 1950s  but without the 91 percent top tax rate   you re going to have a hard time accepting the reality that hippie dippy  unmanly things like wind and solar power are becoming ever more cost competitive Whatever the drivers of Trump policy  the fact  as I said  is that it will kill people  Wind turbines don t cause cancer  but coal burning power plants do   along with many other ailments  The Trump administration s own estimates indicate that its relaxation of coal pollution rules will kill more than 1 000 Americans every year  If the administration gets to implement its full agenda   not just deregulation of many industries  but discrimination against industries it doesn t like  such as renewable energy   the toll will be much higher So if you eat meat   or  for that matter  drink water or breathe air   there s a real sense in which Donald Trump is trying to kill you  And even if he s turned out of office next year  for many Americans it will be too late The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear

WASHINGTON   As she heads out the door  departing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will confront the odd dynamics of the post Trump job market Sure  opportunities await   but also perhaps some closed doors Outgoing top administration officials typically have a wide array of options in both the public and private sector   including speaking engagements  TV contracts  book deals  academic posts and corporate gigs  But some former Trump aides have found their options more limited than did their predecessors  in part due to controversy surrounding President Donald Trump s policies on issues such as the environment and immigration  as well as his record of racially charged language Nielsen  who resigned Sunday  has a resume offering expertise in managing a massive cabinet agency  But she also may face scrutiny as the public face of the administration s family separation policy  It s a totally different environment than a normal cabinet secretary leaving a normal administration  especially with her overseeing a lot of very controversial policies that have upset a lot of people   said Matt Lattimer  who served under President George W  Bush and is co founder of the Javelin literary agency   She s going to have to answer questions about those policies  Already  some critics are pushing to prevent Nielsen from cashing in on her tenure in the Trump administration  A collection of advocacy groups has written an open letter to executives  calling on corporate America to block any administration officials associated with family separations  including Nielsen  The letter was signed by the National Immigration Law Center  Southern Poverty Law Center  NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice and others  This is about making sure these administration officials  as they enter the revolving door of our government to private life  that they are not allowed to profit from the misery they inflicted on thousands of families   said Karl Frisch  a spokesman for Restore Public Justice  which is organizing the effort Frisch said the group was also readying a digital ad buy targeting Nielsen Some speculated that Nielsen would be a strong candidate for consulting jobs with companies that get government contracts  particularly as long as Trump is in office  when her knowledge and insight will be marketable Plenty of former Trump aides have found reasonably soft landings  though there have been some bumps along the way A number of formers have signed up with speaking agencies  among them Trump s most recent chief of staff John Kelly  former Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Trump s original chief  Reince Priebus  Priebus also returned to his former law firm  while Spicer wrote a book and serves as a consultant to a Trump supporting PAC  Still  Spicer did not score a TV contributor deal after he left the West Wing in 2017  though he recently signed on as a contributor to the syndicated entertainment show  Extra  Also writing a book was Omarosa Manigault Newman  Top communications official Hope Hicks took on a similar role at the new Fox company and Dina Powell  deputy national security adviser  returned to Goldman Sachs But corporate America has proven more elusive  compared with aides to President Barack Obama  Press Secretary Jay Carney is at Amazon  senior adviser David Plouffe is at Uber and Press Secretary Josh Earnest is at United Airlines  Tom Ridge  the first Homeland Security secretary under President George W  Bush  has served on a slew of private and public boards  While Trump officials have found lucrative options  those corner offices have not come their way To be sure  many Trump aides do not have the years of experience typically associated with top White House officials  which may also affect their prospects  And given the rapid turnover in the administration  they often are not able to conduct a methodical job hunt before making an exit Nielsen s carefully worded resignation letter suggests she is unlikely to break with the White House as she returns to private life  A former official in the George W  Bush White House who previously ran her own consulting firm  she had little public profile before taking the job For now  she is working to wind down her role with the department before a Wednesday exit  and evaluating options for the future    Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report  

On Sunday evening  news broke that Kirstjen Nielsen was leaving her job as head of the Department of Homeland Security  The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted that according to people close to Nielsen  one reason she hung on as long as she did was because  she was aware how awful life would will be for her on the outside   given her role in defending Donald Trump s policies Let s make it so Nielsen did not create Trump s monstrous policy of separating migrant families  but she should be known forever as the person who carried it out  She put babies in cages  traumatized children for life  and then appears to have lied to Congress about what she had done  She did this evil work with either blithe incompetence or malicious sloppiness  failing to create a system to properly track kids who were ripped from their families  On Friday  the Trump administration said it could take up to two years to identify thousands of separated migrant children  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt   Now Trump is gearing up to do it again  According to NBC News  for months the president has  urged his administration to reinstate large scale separation of migrant families crossing the border   Nielsen reportedly resisted  citing court rulings and Trump s own 2018 executive order ending his administration s family separation policy  Trump s choice for acting homeland security secretary  Kevin McAleenan  apparently is more open to the idea Should this happen  Congress and some judges will try to intervene  But Trump is growing ever more lawless and autocratic   There is a near systematic purge happening at the nation s second largest national security agency   a senior administration official told CNN on Monday  speaking of D H S  The president is filling positions with acting officials  circumventing Senate confirmation  Some senior members of the administration  like Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  are flatly refusing to cooperate with congressional oversight  CNN reported that Trump told border agents to ignore judges when taking steps to keep migrants out  We should not assume that government institutions will restrain the president before he visits anguish and terror on thousands more of the world s most vulnerable children What happens to Nielsen now can serve as an example to other people in the administration as they decide whether to just follow orders  By this  I don t mean that people should scream at Nielsen in restaurants  Rather  those horrified by family separation should do whatever they can to deny Nielsen the sort of cushy corporate landing or prestigious academic appointment once customary for ex administration officials  The fact that she evidently didn t go as far as an erratic and out of control Trump wanted is immaterial  she should be a pariah for going as far as she did Coincidentally  the day before Nielsen resigned  a coalition of progressive groups signed on to a petition asking corporate America to blacklist senior people in the Trump administration  including Nielsen  who took part in crafting  enacting or defending family separation   Allowing her to seek refuge in a corporate corner office or a boardroom  university  speaking agency or elsewhere poses a significant reputational risk for those involved   said Karl Frisch  a spokesman for Restore Public Trust  the group organizing the campaign How much of a risk will depend on decent Trump hating Americans  The Resistance has been flagging recently  even if abhorrence of Trump s degenerate administration has not  Many people  having worked frantically to deliver the House to Democrats in the midterms  are exhausted  The crackup of the Women s March  and the resulting tensions between some black and Jewish activists  has been deeply dispiriting  The beginning of the Democratic presidential primary has reanimated old intra left animosities  And relentless outrage is hard to sustain  no matter how justified But with the possible return of family separation  the Resistance needs to regroup  and demanding a boycott of Trump officials tainted by baby snatching is a good place to begin  Such a boycott would take advantage of one of the central asymmetries in American life  Rural voters  who tend to be conservative  have disproportionate political power  it s why Trump  who lost the popular vote  is president in the first place  But cosmopolitan progressives have disproportionate economic and cultural power  which is why we have the faintly absurd phenomenon of woke capitalism  That power should be deployed to force the sort of accountability Nielsen reportedly fears  and to serve as a warning to others that the Trump stink never washes off On Monday   Henry Farrell  a professor at George Washington University  wrote that he will boycott any university or think tank that employs Nielsen  and refuse to be on panels with anyone from such an institution  He invited others to join him  It s a small start  but a start  Nielsen should not be permitted to launder her reputation through a fellowship at Harvard  like Corey Lewandowski or Sean Spicer did  She should not get to follow H R  McMaster to Stanford There are plenty of places that will hire a disgraced child torturer   private prisons  which often hold undocumented immigrants  are a big business  And Henry Kissinger s storied social life shows that America s elite is far from inhospitable to ghouls  But as the country hurtles into a dangerous new phase of unbound Trumpism  those who want to say no need to muster whatever leverage they can  including public shame and economic sanctions  Either the leaders of corporate America and academia want to be associated with terrorizing toddlers  or not More from Opinion on Kirstjen Nielsen s departure Opinion   Jamelle Bouie  Who Is Left to Say No to Trump April 8  2019Opinion  U S  Policies Toward

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks with China were going well and he would only accept a  great  deal as negotiators hammered out differences ahead of a meeting between Trump and China s vice premier later in the day China and the United States are in the middle of intense negotiations to end a months long trade war that has rattled global markets  Washington wants sweeping changes to China s economic and trade policies  while Beijing wants Trump to lift expensive sanctions on Chinese goods The White House has no plans to announce a date on Thursday for a trade summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping  senior administration officials said  though they would not rule out the possibility Talks are scheduled to go through Friday and possibly longer  If it s not a great deal  we re not doing it  But it s going very well  Top officials are here  And we re very well along on the deal  It s a very complex deal  It s a very big deal   Trump told reporters  It ll be a great deal for our farmers  Technology  intellectual property theft    everything is covered  There s not a thing that s not covered   he said Trump is slated to meet with China s top trade negotiator  Vice Premier Liu He  at 4 30 p m   2030 GMT  in the Oval Office The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported that Trump was expected to announce a date for a summit at that time  but a senior administration official told Reuters that was incorrect  The White House is not expected to announce a date for a meeting   the official said A second administration official was a bit more cautious about prospects for an announcement  saying   It s possible  but I think it s unlikely  Hopes that the talks were moving in a positive direction have cheered financial markets in recent weeks  But U S  stocks were mixed on Thursday as investors waited for more developments in the trade negotiations  with the Dow Jones industrial Average slightly higher  and the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slightly lower    N Trump has proven unpredictable in past White House meetings with Liu  openly challenging U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in late February over the use of the term  memorandum of understanding  in the talks After meetings in Beijing last week  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are holding talks in Washington with Liu and a Chinese delegation this week Liu  Lighthizer and Mnuchin declined to speak to reporters as the three entered USTR offices near the White House on Thursday morning The second Trump administration official said that progress was being made on some issues in the talks  but others remained sticking points  such as the removal of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods and issues related to enforcement of any agreements The United States is seeking reforms to Chinese practices that it says results in the theft of U S  intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology from U S  companies to Chinese firms Administration officials initially envisioned a summit between Trump and Xi potentially taking place in March  but some U S  lawmakers and lobbying groups have said recently they were told that the administration was now aiming for a deal in late April  DEADLINES SLIPWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has declined to give a deadline for a deal  saying last week that the talks are  not time dependent  and could be extended for weeks or even months longer While some reform pledges by Beijing are largely agreed  including an agreement to avoid currency manipulation  the two sides have not yet settled on an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China keeps its pledges  Another key unresolved issue is whether and when punitive U S  tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods would be removed As the talks reach their final stages  resolving these two issues will be critical in determining whether a deal can be reached  U S  Chamber of Commerce international affairs chief Myron Brilliant told reporters on Tuesday  China has been very clear  publicly and privately  that they would like to see all the tariffs removed   Brilliant said   The  Trump  administration has been equally clear that they want to keep some of the tariffs in place as a way to have leverage over China fulfilling its obligations under whatever final package is reached     Editing by Susan Thomas  

WASHINGTON   The decision to seek the extradition of Julian Assange marked a dramatic new approach to the founder of WikiLeaks by the U S  government  a shift that was signaled in the early days of the Trump administration President Barack Obama s Justice Department had extensive internal debates about whether to charge Assange amid concerns the case might not hold up in court and would be viewed as an attack on journalism by an administration already taking heat for leak prosecutions But senior Trump administration officials seemed to make clear early on that they held a different view  dialing up the rhetoric on the anti secrecy organization shortly after it made damaging disclosures about the CIA s cyberespionage tools  WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service   former CIA Director Mike Pompeo said in April 2017 in his first public speech as head of the agency  Assange and his ilk   Pompeo said  seek  personal self aggrandizement through the destruction of Western values  A week after the CIA director s speech  then Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the arrest of Assange was a priority  part of a broader Justice Department crackdown on leakers  We ve already begun to step up our efforts  and whenever a case can be made  we will seek to put some people in jail   he said Pompeo  now secretary of state  declined Friday to discuss the issue  citing the now active legal pursuit of Assange following his removal a day earlier by British authorities from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London The administration won t say why they decided now to charge Assange with a single count of computer intrusion conspiracy that dates to 2010  Back then  WikiLeaks is alleged to have helped Chelsea Manning  then a U S  Army intelligence analyst  crack a password that gave her higher level access to classified computer networks Nor will they say whether the Obama administration had the same evidence that forms the basis of the indictment  or whether Assange will face additional counts if he is extradited to the United States But a U S  official  speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal and legal matters  traced the genesis of the indictment to what s known as the  Vault 7 leak  in 2017  when WikiLeaks released thousands of pages of documents revealing details about CIA tools for breaking into targeted computers  cellphones and consumer electronics A former CIA software engineer was charged with violating the Espionage Act by providing the information to WikiLeaks and is to go on trial later this year in New York  And the leak was a tipping point in deciding to pursue Assange  the official said  Vault 7 was the nail in the coffin  so to speak   the official said It ended years of ambivalence about what to do about Assange  who was hailed by many when WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of State Department cables and U S  military documents  including many that revealed previously unknown facts about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the detainees held at the U S  base at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba Even today  Assange and WikiLeaks have supporters around the world  amid a debate over whether the dissemination of raw  unfiltered documents and data counts as journalism Daniel Ellsberg  the former military analyst behind the famed leak of the secret history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers  called the charging of Assange an  ominous  effort to criminalize a necessary component of journalism  The charges are based on facts that were known throughout the Obama administration  which chose not to indict because of the obvious challenge to the First Amendment that would involve   Ellsberg said in an Associated Press interview A former Justice Department official  who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions  said there was an extensive debate within the government over the feasibility of charging Assange with the publication of stolen  classified materials But prosecutors grew concerned that such a case would not hold up in court  Even though officials did not agree with Assange s self characterization as a journalist  the former official said  there was concern that it would be hard to justify charging him with actions that more conventional journalists take The former official said the department at the time was more amenable to bringing a case like the one ultimately brought   a narrower prosecution centered on a hacking conspiracy  It focuses on an entirely different violation that may obviate any First Amendment or press freedom concern  This is just charging a journalist with conspiracy to hack into computer systems  which is no different than breaking into a building or breaking into a classified safe   said Mary McCord  a senior Justice Department national security official in the Obama administration   And that s not First Amendment protected activity  That is a widely held view in government  even among people generally sympathetic to the mission of the media  This was deliberate and malicious effort to cause harm to us  to U S  national security interests  and I think it would be good if there is some accountability at last   said David Pearce  who was U S  ambassador to Algeria in 2010 when WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables   So far there hasn t been any accountability for Mr  Assange       Associated Press writers Susannah George  Matthew Lee and Ned Barker contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   A bipartisan group of U S  senators introduced legislation on Wednesday mandating that the executive branch disclose details about authorizations it gives companies on sharing sensitive nuclear energy information with countries looking to build reactors  Lawmakers have criticized the Trump administration for issuing seven so called Part 810 authorizations to companies on sharing nuclear power information with Saudi Arabia and withholding information about them  They want to ensure the kingdom eventually agrees to strong nuclear power safeguards on uranium enrichment and reprocessing to avoid the risk of an arms race in the Middle East  Several lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives have asked the administration for details on the authorizations  but were told that even the names of companies that got them are proprietary  Previous 810 authorizations were made available to the public at the Department of Energy headquarters  Congress cannot play its oversight role and ensure U S  civil nuclear cooperation efforts do not encourage the spread of nuclear weapons making capabilities  when presidential administrations withhold information from lawmakers  Senator Marco Rubio said  Rubio and fellow Republican Senator Todd Young introduced the bill with Democratic Senators Tim Kaine and Edward Markey  A similar bill is expected in the House  The Trump administration has had talks with Saudi Arabia  which has been resistant to safeguards in a civilian nuclear cooperation pact known as a 123 agreement  which is subject to congressional approval  Such a deal would have to be signed before the transfer of materials to build reactors  The administration has also been trying to convince Riyadh to agree to safeguards in a so called Additional Protocol from the International Atomic Energy Agency  Markey asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a hearing to commit to sharing the 810 applications and authorizations  Pompeo said he would take the request under consideration but that other agencies have a voice in the authorizations  signed by Energy Secretary Rick Perry  Saudi Arabia says its plans are peaceful  But Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the kingdom would develop nuclear arms if its rival Iran did Riyadh plans to issue a multi billion dollar tender in 2020 to build its first two nuclear power reactors  sources said this month  Originally expected last year  the tender has been delayed several times  The United States  South Korea  Russia  China and France are competing for the business  U S  reactor builder Westinghouse  owned by Brookfield Asset Management Inc  would likely sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in any deal that involved U S  technology The bill  which faces an uncertain future in a tight congressional schedule  would amend the 1954 Atomic Energy Act to require the Department of Energy to turn over to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee reports on all 810 applications it receives and the authorizations it makes and denies  The chairs and ranking members of those committees could also ask the Energy Department for records on any 810 applications that are approved or pending  and the department would have 10 days to do so    Reporting by Timothy Gardner  Editing by Bill Berkrot and Leslie Adler  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration announced on Friday its latest round of economic sanctions against the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela  this time aimed at oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba  a country that the administration has accused of propping up Mr  Maduro s authoritarian government In a speech to the Venezuelan exile community in Houston  Vice President Mike Pence announced that the United States is levying sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Petróleos de Venezuela  S A   Venezuela s state run oil company  as well as on two international companies that transport Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba  Venezuela s oil belongs to the Venezuelan people   said Mr  Pence  who is expected to address the United Nations Security Council next week on the situation in Venezuela The goal of the sanctions  senior administration officials said  was to force a  recalibration  of the relationship between Venezuela and Cuba  which  alongside China and Russia  has been defending the Maduro government But in the short run  they are meant to end the arrangement by which the Maduro government provides oil to Cuba in exchange for intelligence and counterintelligence services while the Venezuelan people lack food  medicine and clean water  Venezuela has been shipping 20 000 to 50 000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba  according to experts in the oil industry and administration officials Russ Dallen  the managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets  who specializes in the Venezuelan oil industry  said the most likely outcome of the sanctions would be to create an atmosphere in which shipping companies would be even more wary of doing business with either Cuba or Venezuela  for fear of triggering sanctions He said they were also meant to  name and shame  companies that have transported Venezuelan oil to Cuba so that Mr  Maduro can help an ideological ally rather than use profits from the oil to feed a starving population  It makes Cuba and Venezuela even more radioactive   he said Mr  Dallen  who tracks oil shipments leaving Venezuela  said that some of the ships had begun turning off their transponders when in Venezuelan ports  something regulations prohibit but is a technique used in countries like Iran to conceal their presence in the country  One ship  Mr  Dallen said  had recently left its transponder off until it reached Europe The sanctions come as Venezuela has faced a month of blackouts that have resulted in an estimated loss of a week s oil production President Trump has thrown his support behind Juan Guaidó  the Venezuelan opposition leader  who in January declared himself the country s interim president and who has demanded Mr  Maduro s departure  Venezuela s economy and population have slipped further into crisis   with blackouts  as well as food and water shortages   while Mr  Maduro and Mr  Guaidó appear to be trying to wait each other out A senior administration official said on Friday that the latest round of sanctions would  tighten the noose of the financial strangulation of Maduro and his cronies   Those sanctions come weeks after the Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on a Russia based bank that it accused of helping Mr  Maduro s government sidestep American financial penalties But it has been more than two months since the Trump administration began imposing sanctions in Venezuela in hopes of pushing Mr  Maduro s government out of power  But to people living in Caracas  the capital  it is not clear that his grip on power is loosening  despite the American effort to target governors  generals and the state run oil company and to cancel visas for Mr  Maduro s friends and family members The American official said that there would be more actions by the United States in the coming weeks and that a military response continued to be a  very serious option   The official hinted that a red line for American intervention would be any threat to arrest Mr  Guaidó  

ADDIS ABABA  Ethiopia   Just two minutes after takeoff  the captain of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 said the plane was having problems  Pilots then began having trouble controlling the aircraft In the plane s short and fatal flight  pilots initially followed safety procedures recommended by Boeing  performing actions on the emergency checklist  including cutting off electricity to an automatic system that was pushing the nose down  But they were still unable to prevent the jet from crashing  according to an initial report by Ethiopian investigators About six minutes after takeoff  the plane went into a fatal dive that killed all 157 people on board The report  released Thursday  laid out a timeline of the flight based on analysis from 18 Ethiopian and international investigators and information from the jet s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder  The investigators  initial report was released several hours after a news conference held by Ethiopia s minister of transportation The data showed that shortly after liftoff  a crucial sensor that measures the angle that the plane is moving through the air  began fluctuating wildly on the pilot s side  falsely indicating that the plane was close to stalling  The sensor  one of two sensors on the plane s nose  began giving readings nearly 60 degrees different from that of its counterpart About a minute and a half after takeoff  after the pilots had performed routine tasks like retracting flaps on the wings  the false reading appears to have set off an automated system known as MCAS  the black box data shows  MCAS is intended to prevent a stall and began rapidly pushing the nose of the craft down A Faulty SensorMoments after takeoff  one of two crucial sensors that measure the plane s angle of attack diverged wildly  eventually triggering an automated system that pushed down the nose of the plane        g ethiopia aoa box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g ethiopia aoa box  g artboard

angle of stabilizers on the tail of the plane  which had been moved by MCAS  About five seconds after the pilots tried the right the plane  MCAS again engaged  moving the stabilizers to a dangerous angle in another nose down action The pilots pushed the electrical switches again  Then  the report says  they followed the emergency checklist and disabled the entire stabilizer electrical system using the so called stabilizer trim cutout  The first officer called out  stab trim cutout  two times   the report says   Captain agreed and first officer confirmed stab trim cutout  Although that move disabled MCAS  it also forced the crew to control the stabilizers manually with wheels at their feet   a physically difficult task on a plane moving at high speed  A little under four minutes after takeoff  the first officer said the manual method  is not working  Soon after  the black box data indicates  the crew turned electricity back on and tried two more times to move the stabilizers by hitting the switches  But once they turned the electricity back on  MCAS engaged again  putting the plane into a dive from which it would not recover The crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10 followed the unrecoverable nose dive almost five months earlier of another jet of the same model  a Boeing 737 Max 8  in Indonesia  Indonesian investigators have implicated MCAS in that disaster  in which the plane s computer system appeared to override pilot directions based on faulty data  Here s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes  and what Boeing has been doing since   These guys are executing the checklist   Dennis Tajer  a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union  said of the Ethiopian pilots after reviewing the report   They were identifying the problem and taking swift action  The initial findings are likely to heighten scrutiny of the Max  Boeing s newest and top selling generation of jets  Since the Ethiopian Airlines crash  airlines worldwide have grounded their Max fleets  amid concerns over the apparent propensity of MCAS to malfunction when fed erroneous data The preliminary report was the first official investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines flight  and it echoed some initial suspicions about the crash Boeing 737 Max  What s Happened After the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air CrashesBoeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months Ethiopian authorities portrayed the pilots of the plane in a positive light  Dagmawit Moges  Ethiopia s minister of transportation  said that the flight crew repeatedly followed procedures recommended by the plane s manufacturer  but was not able to control the aircraft  The Dangerous Flaws in Boeing s Automated SystemHere s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months Both 737 Max 8 jets crashed at high speed minutes after takeoff in clear weather  following roller coaster trajectories that hinted at desperate struggles by pilots to control planes seemingly immune to their interventions In a statement on Thursday  Boeing s chief executive  Dennis A  Muilenburg  said that the company was  confident in the fundamental safety of the 737 Max   Boeing has said it plans to release a software update to MCAS soon  along with increased pilot training for the 737 Max planes  This update  along with the associated training and additional educational materials that pilots want in the wake of these accidents  will eliminate the possibility of unintended MCAS activation and prevent an MCAS related accident from ever happening again   Mr  Muilenburg said After the report from Ethiopia was released  Boeing said it was working  to ensure unintended MCAS activation will not occur again   Boeing has developed and is planning to release a software update to MCAS and an associated comprehensive pilot training and supplementary education program for the 737 Max   the company said in a statement Investigations into both crashes are continuing  A final report on the Lion Air accident is expected in August  at the earliest  Ethiopian officials said on Thursday that their final findings could take a year to be released Indonesian investigators have focused on whether the anti stall system was activated by incorrect data on the plane s angle of attack  essentially a measure of an aircraft s likelihood of stalling After the Lion Air crash last October  pilots and airlines complained that they had not been adequately briefed on MCAS by Boeing  The Max manual had no specific mention of how to correct a malfunctioning MCAS  Some pilots reported that they had not even known of the software s existence In 12 Minutes  Everything Went WrongHow the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control In creating the Max jet  Boeing added bigger engines to the 737  which gave the airplane the fuel efficiency it needed to compete with a new model from its rival  Airbus  But the change also altered the jet s aerodynamics and the larger engines had a tendency to push the airplane s nose up in certain flight conditions To compensate  Boeing engineers created MCAS  which was meant to make the Max behave more like older versions of the 737  To receive certification to fly the Max  some pilots with prior 737 experience had to complete only a couple hours of online training Boeing has said that existing procedures were sufficient to address a MCAS malfunction  but early data suggests that pilots on the doomed flights may not have known how to disengage the system  or may have done so too late to save their flights Most airplane systems are built with backup redundancies to prevent a single data malfunction from altering a plane s course  but MCAS is activated by data from just one angle of attack sensor  not two The Federal Aviation Administration released a statement saying it was still working with Ethiopian officials to investigate the crash   As we learn more about the accident and findings become available  we will take appropriate action   the F A A  said In the news conference  Ms  Moges  the transport minister  cautioned against holding any party responsible for the plane s fatal plunge  The major objective of this investigation is to make sure that there is safety in the aviation sector   she said   It is not to blame someone   

President Trump on Friday announced a new wireless spectrum auction intended to speed the rollout of the next generation of wireless communications networks  a technology the administration views as critical to winning an economic war with China Yet Mr  Trump has so far remained silent on whether the United States would issue an order essentially banning Chinese firms like Huawei from building those networks At the White House on Friday  Ajit Pai  the Federal Communications Commission chairman  announced the third  and largest  auction of spectrum that telecom companies will use to build  fifth generation   or 5G  networks  which promise a major speed increase for downloading data over cellular networks Rolling out those networks  in both cities and rural areas  requires essentially rebuilding the nation s cell networks and switching systems  Over time  the evolution to the new architecture promises to transform how billions of  internet of things  devices   such as autonomous cars and industrial sensors   operate  allowing faster  seamless connectivity The Trump administration sees this next generation of technology as critical to the United States  ability to dominate industries of the future and power its long term economic prospects  It views China s ability to control these networks as a national security threat because it could  at least theoretically  give Beijing access to the information that flows across them  Secure 5G networks will absolutely be a vital link to America s prosperity and national security in the 21st century   Mr  Trump said on Friday But Chinese telecommunications companies  like Huawei  are poised to dominate because they offer the most inexpensive  and what some European and Asian officials consider some of the best  equipment to provide the technical backbone of 5G networks  There are no American suppliers for the main switching networks  meaning that the American systems will largely be built by firms like Nokia and Ericsson  both European The administration has long been contemplating an executive order that would ban American telecom companies from using Huawei or other Chinese equipment when building 5G networks  But that executive order has not materialized  leading many officials and industry executives to believe the administration is holding back until the current trade negotiations with China are completed  Any move to bar Chinese firms from the United States could anger Chinese leadership It is possible that Mr  Trump will allow some Chinese access to the American market   despite national security concerns   in order to strike a trade deal with Xi Jinping  China s president Even without the ban  the Trump administration has taken a hard line with allies  telling them that allowing Huawei to build and maintain 5G systems  even if they are operated by Western companies  could give Beijing an undetectable backdoor into wireless networks The fear is that the Chinese government will be able to suck up and copy data flowing over wireless networks  potentially compromising that information and  theoretically  putting trade secrets and military intelligence at risk  While much of that data is encrypted  giving Chinese firms control over the flow of data is considered a major risk by the Pentagon and intelligence agencies But to Mr  Trump  5G is an election issue as much as a security issue  Speaking at the White House  surrounded by wireless company workers wearing cowboy hats and hard hats  Mr  Trump said the United States could not allow itself to be  outcompeted  in 5G networks  The race to 5G is a race America must win   Mr  Trump said   And it is a race frankly that our great companies are now involved in  We have given them the incentive they need  It is a race we will win  The Trump administration had considered a plan that would have created national 5G networks using federal money  Mr  Trump said on Friday that that approach had been rejected and that private industry would build out the American 5G networks Mr  Trump made no mention of China or any Chinese companies like Huawei  though he did say 5G networks must be  guarded from the enemy   and we do have enemies out there  Mr  Trump also repeatedly said he would extend broadband access to rural America   No matter where you are you will have access very quickly to 5G  and it will be a different life   Mr  Trump said But critics of the administration s approach said the technology the United States had embraced focused too much on the high band spectrum  which will make it more difficult to deliver 5G service in rural America Jessica Rosenworcel  a Democratic appointee to the F C C   criticized the Trump administration s 5G policy  saying it had done  more harm than good   From imposing tariffs on 5G equipment to alienating allies on 5G security to falling behind the rest of the world on critical mid band spectrum  it has yet to offer a workable plan for US leadership   she said on Twitter The United States has auctioned other parts of the high band electromagnetic spectrum to firms that need to communicate to a new generation of cellphones and internet of things devices Some experts think the United States should focus more on developing midband  not high band  spectrum  High band allows more data  but has a much smaller range  meaning providers must build far more 5G towers  It also means a 5G system based on high band spectrum is harder to build in rural areas Other parts of the world  especially in Asia  have focused their 5G development on midband spectrum  which covers a broader area although with less capacity  It s essential that we pivot to midband right now because the rest of the world could leave us behind   Ms  Rosenworcel said in an interview   This is the spectrum that is most likely to bring 5G service to rural parts of this country  and we need to think about investing in this now and not later   

WASHINGTON   The head of the U S  Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday the agency would revise its proposed freeze of vehicle fuel economy standards before unveiling its final regulation in the coming months In August  the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  proposed freezing requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026 but EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview at the agency s headquarters  our final regulation is not going to be the same as our proposal   We ve taken constructive comments  criticisms  concerns from a whole host of different interest groups   Wheeler said   I hope our final regulation is something that everybody can get behind and support  Two U S  officials briefed on the matter said they expected the EPA to wind up requiring a small increase in the yearly fuel efficiency gains  likely around mid June  but said the precise figure had not been finalized  It is also not clear what flexibilities will remain in the final rule Obama era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46 7 miles per gallon by 2026  with average annual increases of nearly 5 percent  compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration s preferred option The administration s proposed changes would also strip California of the ability to impose its own state emissions standards or require a rising number of electric vehicles The proposed fuel efficiency freeze would hike U S  oil consumption by about 500 000 barrels per day by the 2030s  according to administration officials  Wheeler denied the rules were written at the behest of oil industry lobbyists  This has nothing to do with the oil industry  We re not doing this for the oil industry  I m not doing this for the oil industry   Wheeler said The Trump administration said in August that the freeze would save automakers more than  300 billion in regulatory costs and reduce the projected cost of a new vehicle by  1 850  It also said the measure would save lives because Americans would more quickly buy newer safer vehicles  a claim disputed by California and environmental groups Automakers like General Motors Co  Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp oppose a freeze but want requirements reduced to account for changes in oil prices and consumer demand  All have pushed for a compromise deal to head off years of legal uncertainty  The White House in February ended talks with California to try to reach a deal  Reuters reported in March the White House had held meetings with automakers to push them to back it in its fight with California  California last week sued the EPA over its failure to provide data used to justify easing vehicle efficiency standards   California and 16 other states had previously vowed to challenge any emissions rollback Wheeler heaped scorn on California   This is so much more about politics for the state of California than it is protecting the environment   Wheeler said California s top air regulator Mary Nichols said in February the proposal flies  in the face of science  logic and any effort to protect public health    Reporting by David Shepardson  Tim Gardner  mValerie olcovici and Humeyra Pamuk  Editing by Tom Brown

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Friday that his administration was  strongly  considering releasing migrants detained at the border into mostly Democratic  sanctuary cities   suggesting that the idea should make liberals  very happy  because of their immigration policies Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws  we are indeed  as reported  giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only      Donald J  Trump   realDonaldTrump  April 12  2019     The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders  Open Arms policy   so this should make them very happy   Donald J  Trump   realDonaldTrump  April 12  2019  We are looking at the possibility  strongly looking at it to be honest with you   he said on Friday in response to a question about the proposal  We might as well do what they always say they want   Mr  Trump said if Democrats do not agree to new immigration policies   We ll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it   he said  adding that California welcomed the idea of more people coming to the state  We can give them a lot  We can give them an unlimited supply   he said VideoPresident Trump said that his administration was  strongly  considering sending migrants to so called sanctuary cities   Let s see if they have open arms   he said CreditCreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThe comments came a day after the administration said the policy proposal was never seriously considered  But after the president s Twitter posts on Friday  a White House spokesman said Democrats should work with the administration to welcome migrants into their districts  Democrats say we must have open borders and that illegal immigrants have a right to be in this country at all costs   the spokesman  Hogan Gidley  said  adding   so they should be working with the administration to find the best ways to transport those illegal aliens that are already set for release  into communities in their districts and states  Democratic lawmakers do not want  open borders   as the president has suggested  They favor improving border security  but they do not support many of Mr  Trump s hard line immigration policy proposals  such as building a wall along the southwestern border Last year  Trump administration officials had floated the idea of transporting migrants to sanctuary cities  which do not strictly adhere to federal immigration laws  as a way to address the influx of migrants crossing the border with Mexico One of the highest profile sanctuary cities is San Francisco  home to Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who is one of the president s top political rivals and a thorn in his efforts to change American immigration laws  The White House raised the proposal again in February  suggesting it could punish Democrats for rejecting budget requests for border security Ms  Pelosi s office condemned the Trump administration for the idea  which the Department of Homeland Security said on Thursday was ultimately rejected But Mr  Trump s tweets on Friday indicated it was not off the table  and the president appeared to revel in the Democratic outrage  saying   The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders  Open Arms policy   so this should make them very happy  Senator Edward J  Markey  Democrat of Massachusetts  a state with several sanctuary cities  criticized the president s proposal  Trump s plan to release migrants into  enemy  cities as if they are some kind of contagion is reprehensible   Mr  Markey tweeted   Trump is obsessed with the border and sanctuary cities because he only wins by dividing people  There has been an influx of migrant families crossing the southern border into the United States  exceeding the staffing and resources available for immigration enforcement  And with a shortage of space in shelters and detention centers  immigration officials have been releasing migrants into the country as they wait to appear before an immigration court  Those courts are so backlogged with cases that it can be months or years before the migrants are called to appear before a judge A top immigration official at the Department of Homeland Security pushed back last year against the proposal to release migrants into sanctuary cities  and said it would create  an unnecessary operational burden  on Immigration and Customs Enforcement Currently  these migrants are released into border towns  Transporting them to sanctuary cities  which are scattered across the country   with some as far away as Massachusetts and Vermont   would come at a great expense Typically  reallocating homeland security funds intended for a specific purpose would require approval from House and Senate appropriators Some immigration advocates saw Mr  Trump s proposal as an attempt to stoke racial tensions across the country George Gascón  the district attorney for San Francisco  said the proposal was  the clearest sign yet that the president fully intends to chart a path to re election on the back of racist rhetoric and policies intended to divide us  Janet Murguía  the president of UnidosUS  formerly the National Council of La Raza  called the proposal  reprehensible   It seems that not only is President Trump attempting to utilize human beings  who have already experienced a traumatic situation  as tools to get back at political foes  but as a vehicle to further divide communities by stoking racial tensions   she said in a statement  

SAN FRANCISCO   A U S  judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration s policy of returning asylum seekers to Mexico as they wait for a court to hear their cases  but the order won t immediately go into effect Judge Richard Seeborg on Monday granted a request by civil liberties groups to halt the practice while their lawsuit moves forward  The decision is on hold until Friday to give U S  officials the chance to appeal The groups say the policy violates U S  law by failing to adequately evaluate the dangers that migrants face in Mexico President Donald Trump s administration says the policy responds to a crisis at the southern border that has overwhelmed the ability of immigration officials to detain migrants The launch of the practice in January marked an unprecedented change to the U S  asylum system  

WASHINGTON   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo left open the possibility on Wednesday of entering a conflict with Iran without first seeking explicit congressional approval  telling senators  there is no doubt there is a connection  between Al Qaeda and Iran His comments came two days after the Trump administration designated Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist group  and were likely to fuel concerns of American military action against the country Senator Rand Paul  Republican of Kentucky  pushed Mr  Pompeo to commit that the Trump administration would not attack Iran under a war authorization allowing the use of military force against Al Qaeda and other extremist groups responsible for the terrorist attacks of Sept  11  2001 Mr  Pompeo demurred  saying he would  prefer to just leave that to lawyers  Mr  Paul  a libertarian who promotes isolationist policies  said he was troubled by Mr  Pompeo s response   I can tell you explicitly  you have not been given power or authority by Congress to have war with Iran   he said in the exchange at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Mr  Pompeo pivoted  noting ties between Iran and Al Qaeda   There is no doubt there is a connection  Period  Full stop  After the Sept  11 attacks  and as American forces prepared to bomb Afghanistan  more than a dozen senior Qaeda members fled to Iran  The circumstances of their living conditions were murky  but at least some were detained and later traded  in a prisoner swap with a Qaeda branch in Yemen  Hamza bin Laden  a son of Osama bin Laden  was believed to be among those living in Iran after the 2001 attacks  he is now considered a rising Qaeda leader Over several administrations  American officials have interpreted and stretched the 2001 authorization for use of force against the perpetrators of the Sept  11 terrorist attacks as granting legal permission to wage an armed conflict against not just Al Qaeda and the Taliban  but also other Sunni Islamist groups with links to Al Qaeda in the Middle East and North Africa It is not clear how the Trump administration could plausibly say Iran is an ally of Al Qaeda and participated in the Sept  11 attacks  Among other things  Al Qaeda and its affiliates are Sunni extremists who consider adherents of the Shiite branch of Islam  like Iran s government  to be heretics Mr  Pompeo has been a ringleader in the Trump administration s pressure campaign against Iran  The terrorist designation that he announced on Monday was the first by the United States against an official entity in another country s government It also appeared to pique Mr  Paul s questioning about whether the United States was outlining a foundation for war  Mr  Pompeo called the designation against the Iranian military unit a  recognition of reality  Additionally  Mr  Pompeo was asked to affirm support for a two state solution in the Israeli Palestinian conflict  as have previous Republican and Democratic administrations  He declined to answer when asked to describe what the United States would do if the Israeli government tried to annex the West Bank  widely seen as the foundation for a Palestinian state  The old set of ideas aren t worth retreading   he said in a reiteration of answers he gave at a Senate hearing on Tuesday   They have simply not succeeded  Pressed by Senator Tim Kaine  Democrat of Virginia  on whether a two state solution was an  old idea   Mr  Pompeo replied   I would argue that millions of man hours have been spent to try to build out a two state solution  It hasn t worked to date  it may work this afternoon  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  who appeared to win a fifth term Tuesday  said last weekend that he would apply sovereignty to some or all of the West Bank if re elected  A framework for peace negotiations is likely to be unveiled soon by Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law and Middle East adviser  although it is not expected to insist on a two state solution or on ceding sovereignty to the Palestinians Mr  Pompeo said the peace framework would contain  things that neither of them like   referring to Israeli and Palestinian leaders   but things that the Gulf States think make sense  Mr  Kushner has sought approval for his plan from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia  but the kingdom has been critical of Mr  Trump s decision in 2017 to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem  

A federal court settlement announced on Friday would allow almost 2 700 children living in Central America to safely reunite with their parents  who are living in the United States under protected status The settlement between the families and the Trump administration affects children who had been conditionally approved by the government to join their parents before the White House canceled the Central American Minors program in August 2017 The program began under the Obama administration in 2014  It allowed the children of parents who are lawfully in the United States to apply for permanent residency as refugees  Many of those parents hold temporary protected status  which allows migrants from countries that have experienced natural disasters  longstanding unrest or conflict to remain in the United States Without the program  children from El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras would have had to travel through dangerous conditions to reach the United States border and apply for refugee status  When you re a refugee  you typically have to come to the U S  border to request protection via our asylum system   said Justin Cox  a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project  which helped represent the families  The Central American Minors program was designed as a workaround to reunite children with their parents  by allowing the kids to apply from their home countries Four families whose children had applied to the program and been conditionally approved filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after it was canceled  They were joined by CASA  a Maryland based immigration advocacy group The nearly 2 700 children covered by the settlement had been conditionally approved to join at least one of their parents in the United States  according to Mr  Cox Many were waiting for a medical check  a final step in the process  he said  when the Trump administration quietly stopped all processing shortly after coming into office  Seven months later  in August 2017  the White House officially announced the end of the program In December 2018  a judge for the United States District Court in San Francisco ruled that the government s revocation of the conditional approvals for the child applicants was against the law  Last month  the same judge ordered the government to resume processing the children The government will now reverify the children s eligibility and start medical checks   It could take months   Mr  Cox said   but the expectation is that most  if not all  the kids should be able to come  In fact  the settlement with the government stipulates that most of the children are expected to be approved and allowed to travel to the United States Many parents whose children are covered by the settlement have had temporary protected status for several years  during which they have not seen their children Linda Evarts  who is also a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project  said   We are so pleased that after many years apart  our clients will finally have the opportunity to reunite with each other in safety   

 Reuters    The United States approved nearly 40 percent more oil and gas drilling permits on public lands in 2018 than it did the previous year thanks to an automated online system introduced in the waning days of the Obama administration  helping reduce a big backlog of applications President Donald Trump has made it a priority to speed permitting and reduce regulation as a way to boost production of oil  gas and coal from public lands   an agenda that has pleased the energy and mining industries but outraged environmentalists concerned about pollution and climate change The Department of Interior s Bureau of Land Management approved 3 991 drilling permits in fiscal 2018  up from 2 887 in 2017  the agency said  an increase of 38 percent  The average time to process an application to drill with BLM was cut nearly in half to 63 days from 120 days in 2017 A BLM spokesman  Derrick Henry  attributed the permit approval increase in 2018 to  using increased automation and flexible staffing to make decisions more quickly  The numbers were first revealed by Brian Steed  deputy director for policy and programs at BLM  in Congressional testimony earlier this month  BLM said the figures were not yet finalized and could still change BLM in 2017 set a goal of eliminating its backlog of permit applications that have been pending for three or more years by October of this year  and in the first nine months of 2018 slashed it by 47 percent from 551 to 288  according to a BLM document reviewed by Reuters  Under the Obama administration  BLM undertook a major effort to improve its system for processing permits to address long delays and inefficiency  In 2016 it shifted to all electronic filing  Permit approval times were around 200 days prior to the introduction of the new system  according to BLM data The Western Energy Alliance  an oil and gas industry trade group  said speedier permit approvals were due to both increased automation and a more supportive administration  The improvements in automation were started under President Obama  but having an administration which wants to move forward is even more important   said Kathleen Sgamma  WEA s president  Environmentalists say the increased speed has come at the expense of allowing the public to provide input on the drilling applications  which are posted publicly on the permitting web site for 30 days and then removed  BLM is cutting corners on environmental reviews of drilling permits by shutting out the public from commenting on those reviews   said Kelly Fuller  energy and mining campaigns director for Western Watersheds Project  The group argues that the 30 day posting falls short of the BLM s obligation to seek public input under federal environmental law   Reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles  Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington  Editing by Phil Berlowitz  

WASHINGTON   U S  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  who oversaw President Donald Trump s bitterly contested immigration policies during her tumultuous 16 month tenure  resigned on Sunday amid a surge in the number of migrants at the border with Mexico A senior administration official said Trump asked for Nielsen s resignation and she gave it  Trump  who has recently expressed growing anger about the situation at the border  said on Twitter   Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position  and I would like to thank her for her service  In another tweet  Trump said Kevin McAleenan  the current U S  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  would become acting DHS secretary In a tweet late Sunday  Nielsen said that she would stay on until Wednesday  I have agreed to stay on as Secretary through Wednesday  April 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are not impacted   she said Nielsen s departure was first reported by CBS News  Nielsen  46  had been DHS secretary since December 2017  Her departure had been repeatedly rumored over the past year  particularly after a wave of anger over the administration s 2018 family separation policy at the border with Mexico and most recently as U S  border officials estimated that 100 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in March  the highest level in a decade Another senior administration official said Trump s national security adviser  John Bolton  after a blowup with Nielsen late last year  also recommended to Trump that she should go Trump has made a clampdown on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his two year old presidency  leading chants of  Build that wall  at his rallies as he has sought to cut back on the number of newcomers entering the United States without proper documentation Many of the migrants picked up last month were Central Americans seeking U S  asylum Trump was so frustrated about the increase that he announced he would cut off U S  aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  He also threatened to close the border with Mexico  although he later backed off that proposal with a threat to impose tariffs on auto imports In her resignation letter  Nielsen asked for more from Congress and the courts  which have opposed such Trump administration initiatives as his effort to limit immigration from Muslim nations and the border wall  I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse   she wrote to Trump Trump also took aim at Congress in another tweet later on Sunday  saying   Country is FULL   and saying Democrats in Congress must  fix loopholes  and repeating his threats to close the border or impose tariffs if Mexico does not do more  Nielsen s resignation was the latest high profile departure from the Trump administration  and leaves just four women in his Cabinet  Among others  Trump currently lacks a permanent secretary of defense or chief of staff LIGHTNING RODNielsen s departure was announced two days after the Republican president abruptly said on Friday he was dumping his nominee to be the top official at U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE   Ronald Vitiello  saying he wanted someone  tougher  ICE is under the jurisdiction of DHS  which was formed following the Sept  11  2001  attacks on New York and Washington Repeatedly subjected to tough questioning by Democrats at congressional hearings  Nielsen became a lightning rod for criticism of Trump s policies  She was confronted by protesters last year at a Mexican restaurant in Washington Last year  Nielsen came under increasing pressure by critics to step aside after the Trump administration adopted the policy of separating migrant children from their parents as part of its  zero tolerance  approach intended to deter families from leaving home in the hope of entering the United States After criticism as pictures of children in cages were spread across the world  Trump signed an executive order in June ending family separations and requiring that families be held together in federal custody while the adults awaited prosecution for illegally crossing the border But the government reported that at least 245 children were taken from their families between that time and the first months of 2019 Trump insists that the arrival of immigrants across the southern U S  border constitutes a national emergency so important that he sidestepped Congress  refusal to provide him with billions of dollars he requested to build the border wall Representative Bennie Thompson  the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee  said Nielsen s tenure at DHS  was a disaster from the start  He said in a statement  however  that she should not serve as a scapegoat  blasting Trump for  terrible and cruel policies   Noting that the department now has neither a permanent secretary nor deputy secretary  Thompson called on the administration to work with Congress  in good faith  Before she was nominated as secretary  Nielsen worked as a deputy to former Marine General John Kelly  who headed DHS before becoming White House chief of staff  Kelly resigned as chief of staff on Jan  2

 Reuters    The Trump administration has agreed to allow approximately 2 700 children living in Central America to be reunited with their parents in the United States under a court settlement announced on Friday  according to court documents The settlement follows a lawsuit that challenged a decision in 2017 by President Donald Trump s administration to shut down a programme that allowed children living in Central America to be reunited with parents residing legally in the United States The Central American Minors programme  which began in 2014  allowed parents living legally in the United States to request refugee status for their children residing in Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras Many of the parents are in the United States under the so called temporary protected status  which allows immigrants from countries that have suffered natural disasters  civil conflicts or other problems to stay in the United States  Last month  U S  Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco ordered the government to resume processing children who had been conditionally approved for the programme when it was terminated by the Trump administration The settlement  which must be approved by a judge  requires the government to finish processing children who were in the final stages of their applications when the programme was ended  the International Refugee Assistance Project  IRAP   which represented the plaintiffs  said in a statement It said the government anticipates most applicants will be approved and allowed to travel to the United States  We are so pleased that after many years apart our clients will finally have the opportunity to reunite with each other in safety   IRAP attorney Linda Evarts said in the statement  These families belong together here in the United States  and we are hopeful this settlement will allow for their swift reunification   she said The U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services agency  which signed the settlement  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  nor did the U S  Justice Department   Reporting by Eric Beech and David Alexander in Washington  Editing by Sandra Maler  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration on Monday scrapped a historic agreement between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that would have allowed Cuban players to sign with U S  teams without needing to defect The existing deal will not be allowed to go forward because it was based on an erroneous ruling by the former Obama administration that the Cuban Baseball Federation was not part of Cuba s Communist government  a senior U S  official said The move essentially overturns an agreement reached between MLB and the Cuban federation in December after three years of negotiation under which Cuban players would have had a safe  legal path to playing professionally in the United States  In the past  some Cuban stars have undertaken risky escapes  including being smuggled off the island in speedboats The U S  decision was the latest step by President Donald Trump to roll back the rapprochement with Havana  America s old Cold War foe  that was spearheaded by his predecessor  Barack Obama  Trump has especially stepped up pressure on Cuba recently over its support for Venezuela s socialist president  Nicolas Maduro  The agreement with  MLB seeks to stop the trafficking of human beings  encourage cooperation and raise the level of baseball   the Cuban Baseball Federation said on Twitter   Any contrary idea is false news  Attacks with political motivation against the agreement achieved harm the athletes  their families and the fans  The senior Trump administration official suggested that the agreement would have subjected the players to  human trafficking  by the Cuban government  making them  pawns of the Cuba dictatorship  Carlos Tabares  a member of Cuba s 2004 Olympic gold medal winning squad who until last year played for a Havana team  said the Trump administration was seeking  to destroy us  even through baseball   The MLB deal  he said  would have allowed Cuban players  to enter legally rather than falling into the hands of traffickers and having to risk their lives  The U S  official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the administration would be willing to work with MLB to seek an arrangement consistent with U S  law  We are unsure of the next steps   an MLB source said The announcement came just days after the Cuban federation released its first list of 34 players authorized to sign contracts directly with major league teams  A PAYMENT TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT The U S  Treasury Department on Monday reversed the Obama era ruling that Cuba s league was not part of the Cuban government  which had laid the groundwork for the baseball deal The Trump administration considers the Cuban Baseball Federation to be part of the island s National Sports Institute  which  according to the U S  official  is a government entity that U S  law says makes such business dealings illegal  A payment to the Cuban Baseball Federation is a payment to the Cuban government   Treasury said in a letter to MLB Cuba maintains  however  that its baseball federation is not part of the state  It says the federation falls under the Cuban Olympic Committee  which in turn reports to the International Olympic Committee  not the Cuban government MLB teams would have paid the federation a release fee for each Cuban player signed  providing a windfall for Cuban baseball  which has suffered from dwindling budgets and the defection of its best players In the past  many Cuban players seeking riches in the big leagues have made dangerous journeys via human traffickers to defect  Others abandoned the Cuban national team while playing abroad Cuban MLB players who had defected include Yasiel Puig of the Cincinnati Reds  Yoenis Cespedes of the New York Mets and Jose Dariel Abreu of the Chicago White Sox   all of whom have signed multi year  multimillion dollar contracts Puig defected from Cuba on a speedboat at age 21 and soon found himself entangled with Mexico s notorious Zetas crime organization  which threatened to chop off his arm if it failed to receive the promised  250 000 fee for his passage When Puig finally reached U S  shores in 2012  he was rewarded with a seven year   42 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers Under the deal agreed by MLB and the Cuban federation in December  MLB teams were going to pay the federation a fee ranging from 15 percent to 25 percent of the value of player contracts That money  which was not to be deducted from the player s salary but be paid on top of it  would have been used to help Cuba further develop its baseball program Cuban players older than age 25 and with six years of service in the Cuban league would have been free to sign with MLB teams  Younger players would have needed Cuban baseball s permission to leave   Reporting by Matt Spetalnick  additional reporting by Dan Trotta in New York and Sarah Marsh in Havana  Editing by Bill Berkrot and Tom Brown

SAN SALVADOR  El Salvador   California Gov  Gavin Newsom says his visit to El Salvador is a counter to President Donald Trump s  demoralizing  and  toxic  rhetoric about Central American migrants The Democratic governor says he wants Salvadorans to know people in the United States want to understand their struggles Newsom s trip began Sunday and lasts through Tuesday  He began with a visit to the tomb of Saint Oscar Romero  the Salvadoran priest who was assassinated in 1980 over his advocacy for the poor Newsom s trip will also include meetings with El Salvador s president and president elect as well as the U S  ambassador It comes as the Trump administration moves to cut aid to El Salvador  Honduras and Guatemala because the administration believes they have failed to stop people from fleeing to the United States California is home to the nation s largest Salvadoran population and its busiest border crossing  

The 2020 United States presidential campaign is already in full swing in Latin America  Four hot button issues that helped propel President Trump to the White House in 2016 are already coming into play in his approach with the region  and they are being driven by two parallel electoral strategies  appeals to his political base nationwide on immigration  drugs and trade  and a hard sell directed at South Florida on Cuba and Venezuela Since he announced his candidacy in 2015  Mr  Trump has treated Mexico as a proxy and scapegoat  particularly on immigration and trade  two issues on which he promised a radical policy shift  Calls to build  the wall  on the United States Mexico border became shorthand for a tough  aggressive stance on these issues that reliably rallies and excites Mr  Trump s hard core supporters But closing down the border  as the president threatened to do recently  would hurt both countries and cause irreparable damage to what is arguably the United States  most crucial relationship  On Thursday  under pressure from Republicans in Congress  he backed off that threat  only to issue another one   We re going to give them a one year warning  and if the drugs don t stop or largely stop  we re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products  particularly cars  Until now  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico has done a great deal to accommodate Mr  Trump  including working out an updated Nafta agreement and allowing Central American refugees to remain in Mexico while their asylum claims are being adjudicated  The move to close the border will test the limits of Mr  López Obrador s forbearance  On March 29  the Mexican foreign minister  Marcelo Ebrard  said on Twitter   Mexico does not act on the basis of threats  We are a great neighbor  Perhaps just as outrageous  Mr  Trump also announced that he would cut aid to the three countries of Central America s so called  Northern Triangle    Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras   citing their failure to curb the continuing mass outflow of migrants headed for the United States  This move has led some to speculate that Mr  Trump is seeking to deepen the crises in these countries  which could result in exploding migration flows and that could pose a  real  national security crisis on the United States Mexico border  thus justifying the president s hard line policies and providing a powerful campaign issue It remains to be seen whether Mr  Trump even has the authority to cut off congressionally appropriated funding  or if he ll follow through on these threats  But the announcement understandably left the governments of Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador bewildered  having done everything to accommodate the United States  The Guatemalan and Honduran governments sought to curry favor with the Trump administration by moving  or considering moving  their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem  Mr  Trump s announcement is particularly insulting to El Salvador s incoming president  Nayib Bukele  On a recent visit to Washington  Mr  Bukele unveiled a much tougher policy on Venezuela and pledged to review the outgoing government s decision to break with Taiwan and recognize China   both diplomatic wins for the Trump administration  Moreover  there is evidence that United States assistance is helping reduce migration from El Salvador On the drug question  too  the president is posturing to shore up his political base for the campaign  The Colombian president  Ivan Duque  recently met with Mr  Trump and vowed to pursue a United States backed strategy to bring down rising levels of coca production  But that wasn t enough  Mr  Duque was reportedly taken aback when Mr  Trump told reporters   he  Duque  said how he was going to stop drugs  More drugs are coming out of Colombia right now than before he was president   so he has done nothing for us   The title of an article that ran in the Colombian weekly magazine  Semana  was telling   With Friends Like These  The Colombian president deserves better treatment  Mr  Duque has been the Trump administration s most steadfast regional partner in pressuring the regime in neighboring Venezuela  His government is struggling to cope with over 1 3 million Venezuelans who have fled to Colombia  As the United States presidential campaign picks up steam  United States Colombia ties are in danger of becoming  re narcotized   which would undermine efforts in recent years to broaden the bilateral agenda The Trump administration s approach toward Venezuela and Cuba should be distinguished from issues of nationwide concern such as immigration  drugs  and trade  Still  there is little question that domestic politics  largely focused on South Florida  is a key element helping to shape policy  More ideological factors  advanced less by Mr  Trump himself and more by his national security adviser  John Bolton  and Marco Rubio  the Florida senator  are also relevant  The Trump administration s sustained pressure on the Venezuelan dictatorship  carried out in concert with hemispheric and European allies  has rightly provided badly needed support for a democratic transition to a beleaguered Venezuela  But the United States  agenda in Venezuela is tightly linked to the administration s pursuit of regime change in Cuba  as Mr  Bolton has repeatedly made clear  Though in Latin America there is no love lost for the Cuban regime  the region is more cautious about Cuba than Venezuela  Most Latin Americans consider the past six decades of United States policy toward Cuba  aside from the two year opening under Obama  to be a failure and strongly oppose any new threats and punishments To be sure  infelicitous phrases by Mr  Trump and other senior administration officials like   All options are on the table   and   I wish Nicolás Maduro and his top advisers a long  quiet retirement  living on a nice beach somewhere   may draw cheers  help deliver votes  and generate money in a critical swing state in 2020  But they also evoke possible military action and  as a result  risk weakening or dividing the broad coalition that has been forged on Venezuela  To preserve this coalition   a major asset for the United States  Venezuela policy   the Trump administration needs to keep its posturing for electoral purposes in check  Invoking the  socialism  boogeyman in Venezuela as a way to attack the Democratic Party for its health care and New Green Deal proposals shows how the hemisphere s worst crisis could be used in the presidential campaign It would be naïve to call for a moratorium on theatrics as November 2020 looms  Playing on domestic politics with Latin American issues may work for President Trump as he pursues a second term  Still  it is crucial not to completely lose sight of the national interest  which means investing wisely in Central America and cooperating closely with Mexico  Mr  Trump needs to stick with the broad coalition on Venezuela  eschew any suggestion of military action there and any reference to regime change in Cuba  These issues should command bipartisan support  If not handled well  they could have consequences for the United States policy in the region for decades to come  RelatedOpinion   Someone Is Always Trying to Kill You April 5  2019Trump Wants to Cut Aid to Central America  Here Are Some of the Dozens of U S  Funded

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Monday that he was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization  the first time that the United States has named part of another nation s government as that type of official threat The designation imposes wide ranging economic and travel sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as well as organizations  companies and individuals with ties to it  Iran s Revolutionary Guards carry out operations across the Middle East  train Arab Shiite militias and oversee businesses in Iran Monday s designation  will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime   Mr  Trump said in a statement The designation was opposed by some top Trump administration national security officials who said it could incite retaliation by Tehran against American troops and intelligence officers  It takes effect April 15  but was announced Monday in what American officials described as a chaotic and rushed process In Baghdad  where some Iraqi officials have close ties to Iran  American officials said they had been given no guidance on how to enforce the policy The timing of Mr  Trump s announcement appeared aimed at giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel a final boost in a tight re election campaign before a vote on Tuesday  Mr  Netanyahu and Trump administration officials have said Iran is the greatest threat to Israel  and Mr  Netanyahu immediately thanked Mr  Trump in a Twitter post Mr  Netanyahu has repeatedly raised the specter of the Iranian threat to Israel and tried to reinforce the notion that his close ties to Mr  Trump strengthen Israeli security In thanking Mr  Trump on Twitter  Mr  Netanyahu took credit for the idea of the terrorism designation   Once again you are keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism   Mr  Netanyahu wrote in English  while writing in a separate tweet in Hebrew   Thank you for accepting another important request of mine  Last month  in an effort to bolster Mr  Netanyahu  Mr  Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  the United Nations considers it occupied territory After Mr  Trump s announcement  Iran s Supreme National Security Council said it was designating as a terrorist organization the United States Central Command  which oversees American military operations in the Middle East Iraqi leaders had no immediate reaction  although Karim al Nuri  a senior figure in the Badr Organization  an influential Iraqi Shiite militia  said there may not be much direct effect  But it will put more pressure on Iraq  from Tehran to grow closer to Iran  he said Some American officials said the broad designation potentially covers 11 million members of the Iranian group and affiliated organizations  including the large Basij volunteer militia In its statement about the new designation  the State Department sharply criticized the Quds Force  an elite unit of the Revolutionary Guards led by Qassim Suleimani  That unit and Mr  Suleimani are already under sanctions from lesser terrorism designations Top American intelligence and military officials  including Gen  Joseph F  Dunford Jr   the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  opposed Mr  Trump s action  which they argued would allow Iranian leaders to justify operations against Americans overseas  especially Special Operations units and paramilitary units working under the C I A But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R  Bolton  the national security adviser  pushed for it  a Trump administration official said  The fighting among the senior administration officials intensified after The New York Times disclosed the pending designation last month VideoSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would designate Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization  This is the first time that the United States has labeled a part of another nation s government a foreign terrorist group CreditCreditSaul Loeb Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe final decision belonged to Mr  Pompeo because the State Department controls the list of designated terrorist organizations At the height of the Iraq war in the mid 2000s  Iranian military officials and partners helped train Iraqi Shiite militias to fight American troops  The Defense Department says at least 603 American personnel were killed in Iraq by Iran backed fighters   17 percent of all Americans killed in hostile action there When the Islamic State  a radical Sunni group  took over large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014  the Quds Force helped train Iraqi Shiite militias to retake the territory  The American military also took part in the campaign  meaning the Americans and Iranians were on the same side Many Iraqi officials are opposed to the new terrorist designation  as it could impose travel limits and economic sanctions on some lawmakers in the Shiite led government and other Iraqis who have ties to Iranian officials The new pressure from the Americans also could fuel a popular proposal among Iraqi lawmakers to limit the movements and actions of some 5 000 American troops based in Iraq In recent days  State Department officials had asked Mr  Pompeo to delay any announcement  arguing that the designation could have unintended consequences for unrelated countries  a government official said  But Mr  Pompeo dismissed their concerns Under a provision of the USA Patriot Act  low level officials are empowered to deny entry to foreigners who are associated with an organization that the officials decide meet broad standards for terrorism   even when the United States government has not formally applied a terrorism label to that group Until now  American officials had never interpreted laws as permitting them to deem a government entity a terrorist organization The Trump administration s decision to breach that constraint with the Iranian group raises the question of whether other government intelligence services that use violence   including those of Israel  Pakistan and Russia   also now meet that standard  If so  should American officials deny visas to people who work with those agencies  State Department officials say the rushed announcement meant such policy details have not been worked out The George W  Bush administration considered a range of tough actions on Iran during the Iraq war  but held back  The potential blowback vastly outweighs the benefits   said Jeffrey Prescott  a senior Middle East director under President Barack Obama Wendy R  Sherman  a former top State Department official  said the Obama administration considered designating the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization  but decided against it because there would be no practical payoff given the risks to Americans and the fact the group was already under other sanctions  By designating a foreign military as a foreign terrorist organization  we were putting our troops at risk  particularly our troops in Iraq  next door to Iran   she said The Revolutionary Guards oversaw the previous Iranian nuclear program  and some of the top officers were placed under United States and United Nations sanctions The Obama administration entered into a nuclear deal with Tehran and world powers in 2015  Mr  Trump withdrew the United States from that agreement last year in the start of a crackdown against Iran There are signs that Trump era sanctions on Iran are undermining its budget for foreign military activities  meaning less money for Hezbollah and other Iranian allies  The new terrorism designation could expand on this by further undermining the Revolutionary Guards  finances  

WASHINGTON   White House officials have tried to pressure U S  immigration authorities to release migrants detained at the border into so called sanctuary cities such as San Francisco to retaliate against President Donald Trump s political adversaries  the Washington Post reported on Thursday The Post  which reviewed emails on the issue and spoke to unnamed officials at the Department of Homeland Security  said the White House proposed the measure at least twice in the past six months  Sanctuary cities are those where local officials decline to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report  A DHS spokesman told Reuters in a statement the plan was  a suggestion that was floated and rejected  which ended any further discussion   The Post quoted a White House official as saying the same thing Trump administration officials proposed the measure in November as a caravan traveled through Mexico with mostly migrants from Central American countries toward the southern U S  border  The proposal emerged again in February during a standoff with Democrats over funding the president sought to build a wall on the border  one of the signature issues of his 2016 election campaign and presidency The Post said a Nov  16 email broached the proposal  asking officials at different agencies whether members of the migrant caravan could be detained at the border  then bused to  small  and mid sized sanctuary cities   where local officials refuse to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s district in San Francisco was one of those the White House considered targeting  the Post cited the DHS officials as saying Ashley Etienne  a spokeswoman for Pelosi  denounced the administration for its  cynicism and cruelty  over the plan  Using human beings   including little children   as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable  and in some cases  criminal   she said  adding that Americans had  resoundingly rejected this administration s toxic anti immigrant policies    Reporting by David Alexander and Eric Beech  editing by Grant McCool  

WASHINGTON   In the staid world of the U S  Supreme Court  where decorum and etiquette are prized and silence is enforced by court police  the F word could create quite a stir  Yet that expletive and others will be the focus on Monday when the nine justices hear arguments in a free speech case brought by Los Angeles based clothing designer Erik Brunetti  His streetwear brand  FUCT    which sounds like  but is spelled differently than  a profanity   was denied a trademark by the U S  Patent and Trademark Office  Brunetti has tried to calm concern about the potential for foul language during arguments in the ornate courtroom  In a written brief  his lawyer told the justices  the discussion will be purely clinical  analogous to when medical terms are discussed  At issue is a provision of U S  trademark law that lets the trademark office deny requests for trademarks on  immoral  and  scandalous  words and symbols  Brunetti  50  is challenging the law as an infringement of his right to freedom of expression  protected by the U S  Constitution s First Amendment In 2017  a Washington based federal appeals court ruled in his favor  President Donald Trump s administration has appealed that ruling to the conservative majority Supreme Court  The provision at issue has been on the books for more than a century Uttering profanities inside the walls of the Supreme Court is one thing  The main concern  the administration said  is all the expletives and sexually graphic imagery that would flow into the marketplace if the law were to be struck down For Brunetti  the government s fears are hypothetical  There are always going to be people who are offended  but you can t control how everybody thinks   Brunetti said in an interview   When it has to do with the First Amendment  it s a slippery slope  The justices struck down a similar law forbidding the registration of  disparaging  trademarks in a 2017 case involving an Asian American dance rock band called The Slants  a name that trademark officials deemed offensive to Asians  Speech may not be banned even if it expresses ideas that offend  the court ruled  Banning vulgar terms and sexually indecent images is different because it does not discriminate against anyone s viewpoint  U S  Solicitor General Noel Francisco  the administration s top Supreme Court lawyer  said in a written brief  Instead  it  advances the government s interest in encouraging the use of marks that are appropriate for all audiences  including children  The federal government  Francisco added  should not be forced through the trademark system to actively promote words and images the public would find shocking or profane  GRAPHIC  Major Supreme Court cases of 2018 2019 term   https   tmsnrt rs 2V2T0Uf FRIENDS U CAN T TRUST Brunetti  who grew up skateboarding  saw a market for edgy streetwear and founded FUCT in 1990  with a focus on questioning authority   That was the cleverness of it  that a majority of people think it s pronounced  fucked    he said  The acronym  he added  also means  Friends U Can t Trust  A trademark would make it easier to protect his brand against counterfeiters  But the FUCT trademark application  filed in 2011  was denied  The trademark office said the brand would be perceived as the phonetic equivalent of the profanity  observing that Brunetti s products contained sexual imagery  misogyny and violence  That sounds to me like every movie that has come out over the last 40 years   Brunetti said  adding that his products are actually quite tame   Should we start regulating the entertainment industry then  The American Civil Liberties Union  backing Brunetti in the case  noted that the Supreme Court in 1971 upheld the free speech rights of a Vietnam War opponent convicted of  offensive conduct  for wearing a  Fuck the Draft  jacket  We don t want the government picking and choosing the messages it approves and disapproves of   ACLU attorney Emerson Sykes said  The court has decided other cases featuring profanities more recently  In 2009  it upheld a federal crackdown on  fleeting expletives  uttered on network television  including actress singer Cher s use of the F word at the 2002 Billboard Music Awards Brunetti used to sell his wares in some retail stores  but has moved exclusively online  where his monthly lines sell out within hours  Among his recent products  A hoodie that reads   We are Fuct  In its 2017 ruling in Brunetti s favor  the U S  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit   a court that specializes in intellectual property   noted the ubiquitous nature of vulgar content  with or without trademarks  and skewered the government s attempts to police it  In this electronic Internet age  to the extent that the government seeks to protect the general population from scandalous material  with all due respect  it has completely failed   the court said  And it said the trademark office applies the law unevenly  Even other words referencing the same foul term as Brunetti s have been approved  such as Fcuk  and Mutha Effin Bingo  the court said  Meanwhile some powerful messages  such as  Fuck Cancer   run the risk of rejection  The Trump administration tried to emphasize the importance of targeting vulgar material  filing with the Federal Circuit a list of rejected registrations including drawings of sex acts  pictures of genitalia  and phrases like  Fuck Off You Fucking Fuck  The administration said even more graphic and vulgar trademarks would be submitted for approval if this law were to be struck down  with a ripple effect that could reach beyond trademarks because all levels of government commonly exclude explicit pictures and profanity from places or programs they create  Even military cemeteries or public transportation advertising authorities could lose control over whether that graphic or profane content would be displayed on their property   the administration said  For a graphic on major

The U S  oil and gas industry is praised by supporters for boosting America to the forefront of global production and attacked by critics who blame it for sowing doubt about the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is changing the Earth s climate The American Petroleum Institute is the energy industry s lobbyist in Washington  These days it is led by Mike Sommers  previously the chief of staff for former Republican House Speaker John Boehner Recently Sommers talked with The Associated Press about the energy industry  climate change  offshore drilling and other issues  His answers here have been edited for brevity Q  The U S  is now the world s biggest oil producer  What does that mean for the industry and investors A  The most important component is what it means to the United States  It s given our lawmakers an incredible amount of flexibility to help lead the world  No longer are we subject to the whims of an oil cartel in the Middle East  We re the world s swing oil and gas producer  and that s exciting for American leadership Q  At a recent big energy conference in Houston  there was talk by Shell and BP about investing in renewables  Are U S  oil companies going to be left behind A  I don t think there s any threat of them being left behind     They are committed to reducing their methane emissions Q  Are you worried about Norway s sovereign wealth fund reducing its oil and gas holdings  Could other investors follow A  This industry of course relies on the availability of capital  and you know we re continuing to focus on making sure that investors in this industry understand everything that this industry has done to reduce the environmental footprint while meeting consumer demands for more affordable energy Q  Is current U S  production sustainable A  The reports that we look at  particularly  the U S  Energy Information Administration   project that this continued production within the United States is going to go on for a long time  The United States as a leader in this space is good of course for the American consumer  but it s good for American industry as well  The  International Energy Agency  report that I recently saw was that even under the rosiest scenarios for renewables  oil and natural gas will still provide over 50 percent of the world s energy needs in 2050  So the future is bright for this industry Q  Will U S  offshore oil drilling increase A  We need access to these offshore resources to continue to supply the American consumer s demand for these products  so we re working with the administration to make sure that these resources are available  for  the opening up of new resources off both the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico Q  You ve given up on the California coast A  Our focus is really on the Atlantic and continued exploration in the Gulf Coast Q  Are you happy with the Trump administration on energy A  This is an administration that has really focused on what they call the energy dominance agenda  and I think that they have been really focused on making sure that consumers have access to safe  reliable and affordable energy that is also produced in an environmentally sustainable way  That s what this industry delivers on every single day Q  In your state of the industry speech  you seemed to dismiss the Green New Deal A  We know that climate change is real  but we also know that the solutions to climate change have to be real as well  This country has undergone a real energy revolution in the last 12 years as a consequence of the fracking boom in the United States  and that has allowed for  a shift  from coal to natural gas  and that has led to the air being cleaner today than it has been in a generation Q  Are environmentalists wrong because they think we should move directly to renewables and not use natural gas as a so called bridge fuel A  Of course wind has a future in the United States  and of course so does solar  but natural gas has to be around when the sun doesn t shine and the wind doesn t blow  Consumers are demanding more sustainable fuels  This industry is responding to that  but they also continue to demand that those fuels be affordable  and that s what natural gas has delivered on and will continue to deliver on I think for many  many generations to come Q  Even in places like the Permian Basin in West Texas there is some local opposition or concern about the impact of fracking on water use  truck traffic and pollution  What s API doing about that A  One of the reasons why those continue to be concerns is because we don t have the infrastructure built up to support the energy boom  So I do think that those issues are going to continue to diminish as we are able particularly to build pipelines to these communities to support the boom that s going on  particularly in the Permian  But you know some of the same people that are complaining about that environmental impact of trucks  etc  are also those that are blocking the infrastructure  There are new technologies that are being advanced in the oil fields today to make sure that we are recycling water  for example Q  What do you dislike about the administration s trade policy A  We are very concerned about some of the     trade policies that have come from Washington over the last couple of years  For example  there s a company in Midland  Texas  that can t complete a pipeline because they can t get the steel that need they need as a consequence of some of the quotas that have been imposed  We need to get those quotas and those tariffs eliminated as quickly as possible  We also have concerns about the ongoing trade fight with China that has led to tariffs on U S  LNG  liquefied natural gas   Once you lose those markets they are hard to get back  so we re hopeful that the administration s efforts to get to end the trade war with China prove fruitful very soon  

Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter WASHINGTON   As the Trump administration prepares to drastically weaken Obama era rules restricting vehicle pollution  nervous automakers are devising a strategy to handle their worst case scenario  a divided American auto market  with some states following President Trump s weakened rules while others stick with the tougher ones The effort is increasingly urgent because the Trump administration has now settled on the key details of its rollback plan  according to two people familiar with the matter  The new rules would all but eliminate the Obama era restrictions  essentially freezing standards at about 37 miles per gallon  compared to 54 5 miles per gallon required by the current rules  The policy makes it a near certainty that California and 13 other states  collectively representing roughly one third of the United States auto market  will keep enforcing the stricter rules  splitting the national auto market in two Although Mr  Trump has billed his rollback as a boon to the auto industry  automakers say the split market outcome would be a logistical and financial nightmare for them  Their current strategy centers on selling completely different kinds of cars in different parts of the country   chiefly hybrids or electric vehicles in states like California  and less efficient SUVs  which American car buyers love  in other states But automakers recognize it would be easy for some buyers to simply cross state lines to buy what they want  We could see a scenario where there are limited choices for consumers in the high fuel economy states  or a stampede at the border to buy cars in the states that follow the federal standards   said Gloria Bergquist  a vice president at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  In that case  Ms  Bergquist said  states with stricter standards might have to create new rules against buying cars from other states   Because this is all such new territory  no one s quite sure how this is going to work   she said   We re trying to figure it out  But it s going to be a headache  Automakers have told White House officials that they dread this split market outcome  but it appears increasingly likely because California and the 13 other states that follow its strict state pollution rules have said they plan to sue the White House in order to keep the current standards in place The industry had initially asked Mr  Trump to loosen the auto pollution rules  which were among Mr  Obama s signature policies aimed at fighting climate change  However  the companies also asked that Mr  Trump strike a deal with California and the other states to maintain a single national standard  But the White House has stopped negotiating with California The administration has settled on the key details of its rollback  according to two people familiar with the terms  The plan  which is being jointly written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department  would require automakers to raise the fuel economy of their fleets by about 1 percent annually between 2021 and 2026  according to these people  That would be a sharp reduction from the 5 percent annual increase now required In addition  the Trump plan would also give automakers credits for using cleaner technologies  like more modern refrigerants in air conditioners  something that most already do  The Trump plan would also revoke the legal right of California and other states to set their own  stronger standards  setting up the legal clash between the federal government and the states The plan is expected to be published in the next few months  at which point it formally goes into effect  The president has made it clear he wants automakers to publicly support the rollback when it is announced   Every administration wants the industry to stand with them in the Rose Garden   Ms  Bergquist said   But regulatory certainty is really important for automakers  If the nation s auto market does get split in two  the challenge for automakers will come specifically in figuring out how to sell a radically different mix of cars in different states  For example  in states like California  automakers would have to demonstrate that the average mileage of all the cars they sell is much higher  about 54 miles per gallon by 2025  than in states like Utah  where the new Trump standard of about 38 miles per gallon would be in effect  But because Americans have shown a growing preference for SUVs over thriftier vehicles like electrics  manufacturers might have to significantly cut prices on electric vehicles in the high mileage states  a potentially money losing proposition for them  while raising the prices of gas guzzlers  Meanwhile  auto lots in low mileage states might hold a completely different mix of cars at different prices  If car buyers simply cross state lines to buy gas guzzlers and bring them into the cleaner standard states  it could create more regulatory headaches for the companies  which could also be subject to fines from high mileage states if they fail to comply Representatives of Ford and General Motors  who spoke on condition of anonymity because the administration s final plans have not been made public  said their companies felt torn between backing the Trump plan  which could hurt their bottom line  or opposing it and siding with California  which could bring retaliation from Mr  Trump In particular  automakers fear that the administration would retaliate against them by imposing trade sanctions like tariffs on auto imports  That could raise the cost of American vehicles  many of which are manufactured overseas A recent a draft report from the Commerce Department concluded that auto imports threaten national security  according to one person who viewed it  A final version of that report has been sent to the White House  and while it has not been made public  the conclusion that auto imports are a national security threat would pave the way for Mr  Trump to impose tariffs on auto imports  They will have to choose between Trump and California   said Margo T  Oge  a former senior E P A  official who works on auto pollution policy issues  If you go with Trump  it solves the short term temper tantrum and the threat of trade wars on the horizon   she said   But that is also taking a big legal risk  Because in the long term  California could win the legal fight to keep its state standards  Trump is right now  but California is forever  Mr  Trump has frequently turned to tariffs on foreign products as a wide ranging source of leverage to try to exact concessions from both foreign governments and multinational companies A senior White House official  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record  said the White House still hoped to have the auto industry s backing and was unaware of plans to use trade sanctions as leverage or punishment   The auto industry is important to the White House   the official said   The agencies are still working through the rule making process and no final decisions have been made  In interviews  California officials who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record  noted that California already has in place border laws requiring vehicles brought into the state to meet certain pollution standards  California is prepared to strike at any blow dealt our way and regardless of what comes next  we have laws in place to keep our state moving forward   the state s attorney general  Xavier Becerra  said  Although officials at the E P A  and the Transportation Department have largely settled on the top line numbers of the plan  they are months from completing the accompanying legal and technical documents required to justify such a major rule change  according to three people familiar with the plan  Those people noted that the process of creating the documents was stalled by the 35 day government shutdown earlier this year ImageAndrew R  Wheeler  administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThose document delays mean the final plan is unlikely to be made public until at least late spring or early summer  these people said  The release date is significant because it would prompt the expected legal battle  which is likely to end up before the Supreme Court  But if the plan isn t released until this summer  it means the legal challenges aren t likely to reach the Supreme Court during Mr  Trump s first term in office The risk is that  should a Democrat defeat Mr  Trump in his re election bid  the new administration could simply decline to defend the plan in court  The longer they wait on this  the easier it will be for the next administration to undo it   said Jody Freeman  a professor of environmental law at Harvard University who served as legal counsel in the Obama administration  Ana Swanson contributed reporting from Washington  and Hiroko Tabuchi from New York For more news on climate and the environment  follow

The arrest in London of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange ends one bizarre saga  but opens a legal drama that is likely to stretch over many years and could probe uncharted areas of press freedoms and national security in the United States in the digital era  There is good reason to be watchful as the case unfolds Mr  Assange  a 47 year old Australian  had spent almost seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy  initially to avoid arrest by Swedish authorities in a sexual assault investigation that has since been dropped  then British charges of skipping bail  But extradition to the United States was what Mr  Assange really feared  and what the cat and mouse game was always about It was in the United States that the materials posted on WikiLeaks created the greatest furor  first through the publication of a trove of classified documents supplied by an Army private  Chelsea Manning  and then by releasing material stolen from the computers of Hillary Clinton s campaign The Obama administration was wary of pursuing Mr  Assange because WikiLeaks was essentially involved in investigative work common to a free press  But the Trump administration saw Mr  Assange and WikiLeaks as targets as soon as it took office   Mr  Trump loved WikiLeaks in 2016 when it was embarrassing top officials of the Clinton campaign   Two years ago  as director of the C I A   Mike Pompeo labeled WikiLeaks  a nonstate hostile intelligence service  after it released a cache of C I A  hacking tools  Efforts got underway then to build a case against Mr  Assange  This was confirmed through an inadvertent mention in a federal court filing last November Mr  Assange  meanwhile  managed to exhaust his welcome at the Ecuadorean Embassy  and on Thursday British police officers unceremoniously bundled the scraggly bearded refugee off in a van  Soon after  Scotland Yard acknowledged that it was also acting on an American extradition warrant  after which a federal indictment was unsealed in the United States charging Mr  Assange with conspiring to hack a government computer The single charge is straightforward  It alleges that Mr  Assange helped the Army private break into a government computer in 2010 to steal classified and sensitive documents  According to the indictment  when Ms  Manning told Mr  Assange that she had no more material to send him  he replied   Curious eyes never run dry in my experience   Ms  Manning served almost seven years of a 35 year sentence for the leak  and is now back in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks The still unproven charge is far less contentious than had it been  as widely anticipated  for espionage related crimes  That would have been a direct challenge to the distinction between a journalist exposing abuse of power through leaked materials   something traditional newspapers like The Times do all the time   and a foreign agent seeking to undermine the security of the United States through theft or subterfuge These questions will arise in any event   starting with the extradition hearings  at which Mr  Assange s lawyers are likely to argue that the American charges are politically motivated  And if Britain does extradite him  there is no certainty that the Trump administration  with its combative stance toward the press and its documented recent antipathy for Mr  Assange  will not throw more charges at him The issues WikiLeaks raises are vitally important  The responsibilities  ethics and rules of journalism are fast changing in an era when terabytes of secret data can be dumped in a flash  and when hostile governments like Russia s can burrow into foreign computers for compromising information and then launder it through other channels The case of Mr  Assange  who got his start as a computer hacker  illuminates the conflict of freedom and harm in the new technologies  and could help draw a sharp line between legitimate journalism and dangerous cybercrime  Once in the United States  moreover  he could become a useful source on how Russia orchestrated its attacks on the Clinton campaign The administration has begun well by charging Mr  Assange with an indisputable crime  But there is always a risk with this administration   one that labels the free press as  the enemy of the people    that the prosecution of Mr  Assange could become an assault on the First Amendment and whistle blowers More coverage of Julian Assange and WikiLeaksJulian Assange Arrested in London as U S  Unseals Hacking Conspiracy IndictmentApril 11

WASHINGTON   U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined on Wednesday to publicly say the Trump administration still backs a two state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians  We are now working with many parties to share what our vision  is  as to how to solve this problem   Pompeo told a U S  Senate hearing where he was pressed for a response on the issue He said the administration  has been working on a set of ideas  for Middle East peace  that we hope to present before too long   adding that he hoped they would provide a basis for discussions on resolving the Israeli Palestinian conflict Democratic Senator Tim Kaine asked Pompeo  a former Republican member of the House of Representatives  if he thought a peace agreement including one state for Israel and one state for the Palestinians was an outdated idea  It s certainly an idea that s been around a long time  senator   Pompeo responded  Ultimately the individuals in the region will sort this out   the secretary of state said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re election on Wednesday  and a record fifth term in office  with religious rightist parties set to hand him a parliamentary majority  despite a close contest against his main centrist challenger  a vote tally showed In a rare turn during the campaign toward the Israeli Palestinian conflict  Netanyahu alarmed Palestinians by pledging to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re elected  Palestinians seek a state there and in the Gaza Strip  with East Jerusalem as its capital That came after Trump signed a proclamation during Netanyahu s visit to Washington on March 25  officially granting U S  recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli territory  a dramatic departure from decades of American policy The move  which Trump announced in a tweet days prior  was widely seen as an attempt to boost Netanyahu as he ran for re election on April 9 Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally  The Trump administration has been promising for many months that it would roll out a Middle East peace plan after Israel s election   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Lesley Wroughton  editing by Jonathan Oatis  

WASHINGTON   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on President Donald Trump Tuesday to sign into law a resolution ending American involvement in the war in Yemen  The situation in Yemen     has left an indelible scar and stain on the conscience of the world   Pelosi told reporters  She said the resolution passed by Congress last week sets  a standard for what kinds of military engagements we take part in  Trump has already pledged to veto the measure Under the War Powers Resolution enacted in 1973  the president is required to  consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities  The White House statement threatening a veto argued U S  support for the Saudi led coalition in Yemen does not constitute engaging in  hostilities   meaning the War Powers Act doesn t apply  It also said the bill raises  serious constitutional concerns  The conflict in Yemen has ground on for more than four years  killing thousands and leaving millions on the brink of famine Opposition to U S  involvement in the Saudi led war in Yemen grew in the aftermath of the killing of U S  based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabian agents last year  Lawmakers from both parties are frustrated Trump hasn t done more to condemn the kingdom s leaders after the incident Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was questioned Tuesday by lawmakers about the Trump administration s response to the Khashoggi killing  Pompeo told a Senate subcommittee the administration was  continuing to pursue facts  and  when we find the facts we will apply the law appropriately  The State Department announced Monday it would deny entry to 16 Saudis over their roles in Khashoggi s killing  The action was taken under the 2019 State Department appropriations bill  which requires Pompeo to deny entry to individuals  involved in significant corruption or gross violations of human rights  Saudi Arabia has been a key U S  security and economic partner for decades  The U S  has supported the kingdom s involvement in Yemen since 2015 with intelligence sharing  logistical support and inflight refueling Trump administration officials argue withdrawing American involvement could diminish chances for a negotiated peace and lead to even higher numbers of civilian casualties  

WASHINGTON   The Education Department failed to approve a single application for federal student loan relief in the second half of last year  according to new department data that signals that students who claim they were cheated by their colleges cannot count on help from Washington anytime soon The department neither approved nor denied any relief claims filed by students under the so called borrower defense program from June to December 2018  even after a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration s foot dragging was illegal  In October  the judge ordered the Education Department to enforce a long delayed Obama era rule that expanded and expedited loan relief for defrauded students  many of whom attended for profit colleges Amid that inaction  the number of pending claims has swelled to more than 150 000   over double the number of applications the department inherited from the previous administration  And with no firm timeline to process them  advocates say the department has referred borrowers to the Treasury Department to have their tax refunds garnished to offset debts that have piled up while their claim is pending Liz Hill  a spokeswoman for the Education Department  blamed the delay on the swirl of lawsuits filed by advocates pressing for a more generous response to loan relief applicants  Pending litigation has slowed down the department s processing to provide relief to additional borrowers   Ms  Hill said   We will fully implement the 2016 borrower defense regulations and ensure those who qualify for discharge receive it  About 22 000 approved applications that are waiting to be discharged are delayed because of lawsuits  the department said  as it  continues to assess alternatives to provide a fair  balanced and consistent approach for legitimate borrower defense applications  Ms  Hill added that the department was taking steps to increase its capacity to manage applications  which in recent months have been coming in at nearly 2 000 a week Last month  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos offered no such assurances when pressed by senators about the backlog  Don t you have a heart   Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the No  2 Democrat  asked Ms  DeVos at a hearing on the department s budget  where he cited 140 000  victim students waiting on your department to give them relief so they can get on with their lives  He noted that many of the students were defrauded by predatory for profit schools  which Ms  DeVos has been accused of favoring with her policies  Nine percent of high school graduates go to for profit colleges and universities  but 34 percent of loan defaults belong to those students  No student should be defrauded  and if fraud is involved  there are consequences  and there will be consequences   Ms  DeVos replied   But we should not be judging institutions by their tax status  Let s be very honest here  there are bad actors on both sides of the equation  She added  with some indignance   Let s talk about the nonprofits that are doing a bad job  that are subject to bribes  that are lying in order to improve their U S  News and World Report statistics   referring to the recent college admissions scandal rocking Ivy League and other elite institutions  Since taking office  Ms  DeVos has tried to overhaul the 2016 process started by the Obama administration that was supposed to pave an easier road for students to secure loan relief after their colleges are found to have misled them with inflated claims of false promises of jobs  The Obama administration approved nearly 30 000 such claims  estimated at  450 million  in its last year in office  The Education Department approved 16 155 from Jan  1  2017 to December 31  2018 The Obama administration rewrote the borrower defense rule  which was virtually unknown until 2015  when two large for profit chains  ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges  began to crumble  The new rule was supposed to take effect in 2017 But Ms  DeVos delayed issuing what she said amounted to  free money  and has moved to narrow its scope to only forgive debts of students who  regardless of their schools  actions  fail to secure gainful employment and can prove they were otherwise harmed A 2017 report from the department s inspector general found that the Obama process had some flaws  Ms  DeVos  instituted a tiered system to grant some borrowers partial relief  but those measures were struck down by the courts  The department then blew a deadline to rewrite the rules  which were supposed to go into force this year Ms  Hill  the department spokeswoman  said that under Ms  DeVos  the department has discharged nearly 50 000 borrower defense claims  the bulk of which were queued up by the Obama administration  totaling more than  534 million She said it has also enforced part of the 2016 Obama regulation that automatically relieves students of debt when a school closes  As of February  the department discharged approximately 51 000 loans for 15 000 borrowers  totaling more than  158 million But applications have continued to pile up as the department charts its next move Education Department officials released data in response to a request from Senator Patty Murray  Democrat of Washington  showing that it still had 158 000 pending claims  The data covered the period from September to December  but officials wrote that those had not changed since the previous quarter The department did not say whether it has approved or denied any borrower defense claims in 2019  There s nothing stopping Secretary DeVos from providing relief to struggling borrowers today  and she needs to begin approving claims immediately so students who were cheated out of their education and savings get the relief they are entitled to   Ms  Murray said in a statement Eileen Connor  the director of litigation at Harvard Law School s Project on Predatory Student Lending  said that she had borrowers who had claims pending from as far back as four years The project  which represents thousands of students from ITT Tech and Corinthian  said that it had over 14 000 applications from ITT Tech pending at the department  Only 33 have been approved  and those were by the Obama administration  Zero have been approved under Ms  DeVos Debt on the loans has continued to grow  Ms  Connor said  In lawsuits  the group has described how borrowers have experienced anxiety  fear and psychological and financial distress caused by delays The project has won several lawsuits against Ms  DeVos  But it said that the department continued to ignore crucial court rulings  including one that found the department could not take tax refunds of former Corinthian College students to pay their student loans while they have borrower defense applications pending  The department s delay is not neutral   Ms  Connor said   It s harming students   

WASHINGTON   In a major test case  Medicare is poised to cover a promising but expensive new type of cancer treatment  with significant restrictions meant to hold down the cost Cancer patients  doctors and drug companies are urging the Trump administration to remove the restrictions and broaden coverage so more patients can benefit from the treatment  known as CAR T cell therapy  or CAR T  But insurance companies are pushing for the restrictions The treatment is manufactured specifically for each patient  and many more such  personalized medicines  are in the pipeline  Medicare s final decision  expected in the next few weeks  will influence commercial insurers and state Medicaid programs  which often follow its lead Medicare and other insurers typically pay for drugs as they are used  from month to month and year to year  By contrast  the CAR T treatments generate high costs up front  but the benefits could last for years The Food and Drug Administration has approved two CAR T products to treat certain blood cancers  Kymriah  made by Novartis  with a list price of  373 000 or  475 000  depending on the type of cancer  and Yescarta  made by Gilead Sciences  with a list price of  373 000 The treatments have been remarkably effective in some patients who had a dismal prognosis after exhausting other options  Researchers around the country are conducting more than 450 clinical trials to explore other uses of CAR T medicines that work in similar ways The Trump administration has proposed covering CAR T therapy when it is prescribed by a cancer specialist and given in a hospital to Medicare patients whose cancer has not responded to other treatments like chemotherapy and radiation  Medicare would also cover the treatment for patients whose cancer returns  causing a relapse after a period of improvement Seema Verma  the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  has described CAR T as  an entirely new approach to treating serious and even life threatening diseases  Dr  Francis S  Collins  the director of the National Institutes of Health  said that harnessing the power of a patient s immune system in this way was a  marvel of modern medicine   But  because of the need to personalize the preparation of cells for every patient   he said   costs are quite high  and it could be truly challenging to scale up use of the technology  Officials will increasingly confront such challenges as they try to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to the latest treatments at an affordable cost CAR T therapy sounds like science fiction  Immune cells   T cells   are removed from a patient s blood  sent to a laboratory where they are genetically engineered to recognize and attack cancer cells  and then sent back to the hospital for infusion into the patient The total cost of treatment  including the CAR T infusion  doctors  services and hospital stays  can easily exceed  750 000  This looks like a big price tag   said Dr  Caron A  Jacobson  director of a cell therapy program at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston   But when you actually consider what you are paying for over the course of someone s lifetime  and you think about the cost of other therapies that this is replacing  it actually is not astronomical  There is no national Medicare policy for covering CAR T cell therapy  The request for a Medicare coverage decision came from one of the nation s largest insurers  UnitedHealth Group  which expressed concern that  CAR T therapies could create significant financial risks  for the government and for private Medicare Advantage plans UnitedHealth is the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans  with about five million people enrolled in its plans  The private plans receive a fixed monthly payment from the government to provide the full range of services covered by Medicare America s Health Insurance Plans  a trade group for insurers  also urged caution  saying   There is currently limited evidence for CAR T therapies  But Bonnie Falbo of Charlottesville  Va   a caregiver for her 70 year old husband  who has multiple myeloma  said   This treatment is one that could save his life one day  Immunotherapy is the future of cancer care  Approving payment for this therapy right now will save the lives of patients who have run out of other options  Advocates for patients and physician groups said the coverage policy proposed by the Trump administration was too limited and could delay lifesaving treatment for cancer patients who were very ill  We have a new therapy  a result of years of research  and it has been approved by the F D A    said Kirsten A  Sloan  a vice president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network   Let s make sure people have access to it  Let the doctor decide which patients should be eligible  A patient s health care provider is in the best position to determine when and whether a patient will benefit from CAR T cell therapy and should not be limited by a narrow coverage policy  Ted Okon  the executive director of the Community Oncology Alliance  an advocacy group for cancer doctors and patients  said the coverage criteria proposed by the Trump administration were  much more restrictive  than the uses of CAR T therapy permitted in the F D A  approved label Moreover  Mr  Okon said  coverage should not be limited to patients treated at a hospital  as the government proposed   CAR T treatment has been slowly moving to the outpatient setting   he said   Many community oncology practices have the experience and capabilities to administer CAR T treatment  saving money for patients and Medicare  Hospitals providing CAR T therapy said they were trying to figure out how to pay for it Charles N  Kahn III  the president and chief executive of the Federation of American Hospitals  which represents investor owned hospitals  said they faced large financial losses in providing the treatment to Medicare patients  This is a brave new world   Mr  Kahn said   No one anticipated such an extraordinary expense when Medicare s hospital payment formulas were adopted  Under the Trump administration proposal  Medicare would pay for CAR T therapy in patients who have  relapsed or refractory cancer  that has resisted other treatments  CAR T cell therapy shows promise   the administration said in a 39 000 word decision memo  but  the evidence is inadequate to confidently conclude  that it will improve health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries To date  it said   few clinical trials on CAR T cell therapy have been performed  and those data available have limited participation by Medicare beneficiaries   More study is needed  it said So Medicare would cover the procedure only if hospitals agreed to monitor patients  enroll them in a study or  registry  and report detailed data on their medical condition and quality of life for at least two years after treatment Doctors and scientific researchers raised several concerns The eligibility requirements  may exclude some patients who could benefit from treatment   said Cynthia A  Bens  a senior vice president of the Personalized Medicine Coalition  an education and advocacy group Dr  Roy L  Silverstein  the president of the American Society of Hematology  said it was  shortsighted to limit coverage to those patients who have

LEESBURG  Va    U S  House of Representatives Democrats are accusing Republican President Donald Trump of aggravating a crisis situation at the southern U S  border  saying he has not used funds available to help deal with a surge of migrants and exacerbated the problem with his attempts to crack down House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that bipartisan immigration reform  which has eluded Congress and the White House for years  is still the solution  It is in fact  inevitable   Pelosi said on the sidelines of a Democratic party meeting in Leesburg  Virginia  In Washington  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  a Republican  also called for bipartisan discussions on immigration  But he focused on toughening U S  asylum law  a move that Democrats likely would oppose Democrats have not proposed a comprehensive immigration bill since taking the majority in the House this year  Republicans still hold the Senate Instead  Democrats last month proposed legislation offering a pathway to citizenship for more than 2 million undocumented immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children  Known as Dreamers  they face possible deportation The House Democratic bill would also help immigrants from countries hit by civil conflicts or natural disasters who have temporary protected status  known as TPS U S  officers arrested or denied entry to over 103 000 people along the border with Mexico in March  a 35 percent increase over the prior month and more than twice as many as the same period last year  according to data released by U S  Customs and Border Protection this week The steady increase in migrant arrivals  which has been building over the past several months  is driven by a growing number of children and families  especially from Central America  Trump has threatened to close the border  saying the United States is  full   He has urged the building of a wall on the southern border since before he became president in 2016  Recently his ire has been directed at his own officials  Congress  and Latin American countries  who he says have not done enough to stop their citizens from traveling to the United States Pelosi  asked Thursday what should be done at the border  said the bipartisan legislation Trump signed to end a government shutdown in February included money for judges and humanitarian aid  to bring order to the border   but Trump has not used the funds Although a bipartisan effort at comprehensive immigration reform by Democrats and Trump last year failed  Pelosi said such an overhaul still had a chance  I m not giving up on the president on this   Pelosi said   I still say to him   We ve got to have comprehensive immigration reform    Representative Pramila Jayapal  speaking to reporters later  said the Trump administration had manufactured a crisis at the border in part by  stripping away  legal routes to immigration  such as by stopping asylum seekers at legal ports of entry Trying to curb the flow of Central American asylum seekers  the administration has been sending more people back to Mexico to wait for their asylum claims to be heard by U S  courts  Representative David Cicilline said the Trump administration had exacerbated a challenging border situation by not spending money that was appropriated for border facilities and personnel  as well as by cutting off aid to Central American countries for sending migrants to the United States Cicilline  who runs the House Democrats  policy and communications committee  denied Democrats were simply  looking on helplessly  at the problems  But the administration has responsibility in all these areas  And we can appropriate funding and we can pass legislation but ultimately they are responsible for executing the immigration laws in this country   he said   Reporting by Susan Cornwell  Editing by James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   In a White House where no secret is safe for long  one development has remained stubbornly confidential   the contents of a Middle East peace plan authored by President Donald Trump s advisers Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt With Trump having delighted Israelis and angered Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital in 2017 and moving the American Embassy to the holy city last May  a U S  brokered peace deal may seem farther away now than when talks collapsed five years ago Then on Wednesday  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re election  only days after proposing to annex Jewish West Bank settlements  traditionally viewed as illegal by much of the world  The Trump administration has yet to comment on the election eve remarks Aides expect Trump to release the plan once Netanyahu forms a government coalition  and officials say that despite criticism of the administration s moves to date  the plan will demand compromises from both sides That the peace plan has remained a secret is remarkable in a White House where drafts of executive orders  confidential conversations and internal deliberations all find their way to the front pages  Kushner and Greenblatt have limited the plan s distribution over the two years they have been crafting it  It has been kept secret  to ensure people approach it with an open mind  when it is released  a senior administration official said Only four people have regular access   Kushner  Greenblatt  U S  Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Kushner aide Avi Berkowitz  the official said Trump is briefed regularly on the contents but is not believed to have read the entire document of dozens of pages  He is briefed if something interesting is happening or there is an idea they want to run by him   the official said Kushner  a New York real estate developer and husband of Trump s daughter Ivanka  and Greenblatt  a former lawyer for Trump  joined the process knowing little about the tortured  decades long path in search of Arab Israeli peace  Their proposal addresses such core political issues as the status of Jerusalem  and separately aims at helping the Palestinians strengthen their economy Cloaked in secrecy is whether the plan will propose outright the creation of a Palestinian state  the Palestinians  core demand  On Wednesday  Trump s secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the plan would be presented before too long but  when asked  declined to say whether the administration favored a two state solution  long the basis of Middle East peacemaking Not even Trump  who is known to blurt out news whenever he feels like it  has dribbled out details of the peace plan because of the sensitivity He tells his Middle East envoys   If you guys can get this done you re going to be the greatest negotiators in history   said a senior White House official   YOUR CHILDREN S FUTURE When Kushner and Greenblatt began developing their plan in 2017  they asked the parties to look to the future and describe an outcome on each issue that they could accept rather than get locked into historical stances  two officials said  You can t let your grandfather s conflict hold back your children s future  was their message to both sides  one official said Palestinians reject Trump s pro Israel policies  The extremist and militaristic agenda  led by Benjamin Netanyahu  has been emboldened by the Trump administration s reckless policies and blind support   said PLO Executive Committee Member Hanan Ashrawi U S  Vice President Mike Pence  Pompeo and White House national security adviser John Bolton are all kept up to date on the peace plan  but have kept a hands off approach to it  deferring to Kushner  two other officials said The secrecy maintained by Kushner and Greenblatt  even as they refine and polish the plan  has posed something of a challenge for Gulf governments  who want to know the details before committing resources to a Palestinian fund Kushner and Greenblatt toured Gulf states in February to promote the economic part of the plan and get opinions about it  without providing a detailed view of the contents of the more crucial political section One of their stops was in Qatar Qatari Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Lolwah Al Khater  speaking to a small group of reporters in Washington recently  gave no indication that Kushner and Greenblatt provided much in the way of details on the political plan when they visited  I don t think it s still set in stone   she said Dennis Ross  a longtime Middle East envoy and now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  said the U S  team still has  a lot of work to do to make sure that Arab leaders aren t surprised by what s going to be presented  and they need to see it in writing  not verbally  But he said secrecy at this point is understandable  Holding something very close makes sense and it s not taken as a negative by the parties  because in the end  if the content isn t leaking out  it also makes sure that what would be controversial doesn t create an immediate firestorm  There s a logic to that   Ross said   Additional

WASHINGTON   The House will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump s declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border  Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday  the latest in a series of efforts to stop Mr  Trump from securing money that Congress refused to give him for his promised wall  The president s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds  an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority   Ms  Pelosi said in a statement  The House will once again defend our democracy and our Constitution  this time in the courts   she added   No one is above the law or the Constitution  not even the president  The Trump administration has argued that Mr  Trump s moves to spend more taxpayer dollars on border barriers than Congress had agreed to give him are lawful because he is invoking statutes that granted the president the power to move money around under urgent circumstances  Those statutes placed few limits on a president s authority to determine that such situations exist Mr  Trump and his defenders have also noted that presidents have declared national emergencies nearly 60 times since Congress passed the National Emergencies Act in 1976  although critics point out that in no previous such instance did a president invoke extraordinary powers as an end run around lawmakers after failing to win legislative approval for a proposal The lawsuit was authorized by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group  which consists of the top leaders of both parties in the House  Ms  Pelosi  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the majority leader  Representative James E  Clyburn of South Carolina  the majority whip  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader  and Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana  the minority whip The group met briefly on Thursday and voted along party lines to authorize the lawsuit  It is unclear when it will be filed Legal action has been an option for House lawmakers since Mr  Trump declared a national emergency at the southwestern border in February to activate the power to redirect military construction funds  effectively trying to go around Congress s refusal to fund a border wall at the level he had demanded  Both chambers passed legislation that would have ended the national emergency  but Mr  Trump vetoed the bill   the first veto of his presidency   and the House could not muster enough votes to override it On Thursday  a Pentagon spokesman said that final decisions about what military construction projects would have their funds repurposed for his declaration have not yet been made The House will be joining several other lawsuits already filed  Plaintiffs in another suit challenging Mr  Trump s border barrier plans sought on Thursday to expedite obtaining a judicial order to block the government from taking further steps toward building new border barriers   even as administration officials raced to spend what money they had as quickly as they could The plaintiffs   the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition  which are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union   filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would bar the administration from building new barriers near Yuma  Ariz   and El Paso until the litigation can be resolved on the merits  Last month  the Trump administration had identified those sectors as locations for new or replacement barrier projects  while redirecting  1 billion in excess military pay and pension funds for that purpose That part of Mr  Trump s plans relies not on his high profile invocation of emergency powers  but on another component that has received less attention  using the Pentagon s separate authority to redirect some of its annual budget in order to beef up its counternarcotics programs  which in turn can be tapped for blocking smuggling along the border  Because that money must be spent before the fiscal year ends on Sept  30  the administration is trying to move quickly to issue contracts But the A C L U  says that its clients are likely to prevail in their argument that it is unlawful for Mr  Trump to use such tactics to spend more on border barriers than Congress appropriated  Its motion maintains that freezing any further steps toward construction before a final ruling   even as the clock continues to tick toward the end of September   would be justified because any such construction would  among other things   disrupt these ecosystems and cause irreversible damage  That case is pending before a Federal District Court judge in Oakland  Calif   Haywood S  Gilliam Jr   who was appointed in 2014 by President Barack Obama  The plaintiffs have asked him to hold a hearing on the request on May 9  

To the Editor Re  Migrants Pour Into a System That s  on Fire    front page  April 11  The challenges at our border are manageable and are caused neither by court rulings nor by  loopholes   as your article suggests  The Trump administration chose cruel and illegal responses to a regional refugee and displacement crisis  stoking chaos rather than pursuing effective solutions Instead  it could have led a regional initiative to resolve the crisis and expand refugee hosting capacity across the region  something a future administration must do  To sharply reduce numbers fleeing to its border  the United States must counter the problems involved in pushing people to leave and work with other countries so more refugees can be received and protected in the region To manage our border  the Department of Homeland Security should restore orderly asylum processing at points of entry rather than encouraging crossings between points  And it must start a case management program to facilitate hearing appearances rather than pushing more detention for families with children  To ensure fair  timely and effective decision making  the immigration courts should be made independent  protected from political influence and fully staffed Eleanor AcerNew YorkThe writer is senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First To the Editor Re  A  Full  Nation in Dire Need of New Faces   news analysis  front page  April 10  I had the privilege of driving across the United States several times when my younger daughter was attending college in Colorado  What struck me  along with the beauty of this vast and diverse country  was the amount of empty space  I often remarked that we have so much room  and so much latent capacity  to absorb refugees and immigrants at a level that far outpaces our current rate  It saddens me that the Trump administration is so miserly in its thinking and actions  We have more than enough  We can welcome so many more people and families who are yearning to make a new life for themselves and contribute to our society  Given that we ve all come from someplace else  except for Native Americans   we have a moral obligation to share the bounty we have all been offered  America is blessed with ample space and resources  It would be a great shame if we turned our backs on would be fellow citizens  and we would all be poorer as a result Joanne HeymanHastings on Hudson  N Y  

WASHINGTON   The Treasury Department on Friday targeted four companies and nine ships  including some that transported oil from Venezuela to Cuba  as part of the Trump administration s ongoing efforts to isolate President Nicolas Maduro So far  the U S  has revoked the visas of 718 of Maduro s associates and has issued sanctions on more than 150 people and entities  We continue to target companies that transport Venezuelan oil to Cuba  as they are profiting while the Maduro regime pillages natural resources   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement   Venezuela s oil belongs to the Venezuelan people  and should not be used as a bargaining tool to prop up dictators and prolong oppression  Despite the sanctions  Maduro clings to power with help from Russia  China and Cuba  The international coalition that supports the opposition stands at 54 nations  although some longtime U S  allies have refused to join the Trump administration in recognizing the head of the National Assembly  Juan Guaido  as interim president The companies sanctioned were Jennifer Navigation Limited  Lima Shipping Corp  and Large Range Limited  all based in Monrovia  Liberia  and three of their vessels suspected of delivering oil products from Venezuela to Cuba this year  In addition  Treasury sanctioned PB Tankers S P A   based in Italy  and six of its oil and storage tankers  including one that also delivered Venezuelan petroleum products to Cuba  

It may take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the southern United States border  the government said in court documents filed on Friday A federal judge had asked for a plan to identify these children and their families after a report from government inspectors in January revealed that the Trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents than was previously believed These families were separated before the administration unveiled its  zero tolerance  immigration policy in the spring of 2018  when nearly all adults entering the country illegally were prosecuted and any children accompanying them were put into shelters or foster care To identify these families  the government said it would apply a statistical analysis to about 47 000 children who were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and subsequently discharged  according to the court filing  From there  the government said it would manually review the case records of the children who appeared to have the highest probability of being part of the separated families Officials estimated that the process would take at least one year and potentially two  In explaining the reason for such an arduous process  the government said United States Customs and Border Protection did not collect specific data on migrant family separations before April 2018 Lawyers representing the Office of Refugee Resettlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday In a court filing for the government  Jonathan White  a commander with the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps  wrote that identifying this group of children presented new challenges because they were already discharged from the Office of Refugee Resettlement  meaning the government  lacks access  to them The statistical analysis was required because manually reviewing the cases of nearly 50 000 children would  overwhelm  the office s resources  he wrote The government s proposed plan arose from a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California  In June  Judge Dana M  Sabraw ordered the reunification of children and parents who had been separated under the Trump administration policy  President Trump rescinded the policy that same month ImageRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee  Democrat of Texas  speaking on Capitol Hill in February about the Trump administration s separation policy involving migrant families CreditJose Luis Magana Associated PressAbout 2 800 children have been reunified with their families or situated according to their parents  wishes  said Lee Gelernt  who challenged the policy in court on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union The January report  by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services  revealed that a group of separated families was unaccounted for because the government lacked an effective tracking system  In March  Judge Sabraw ruled that those families should be included in the litigation Mr  Gelernt said this identification process should take months  not years   If the government believed finding these children was a priority  they could do it quicker than two years   Mr  Gelernt said The families the government may now be tasked with locating are those who entered the United States on or after July 1  2017  the earliest known date that families were separated  were detained by immigration officials  and have a child who was detained and then released to a sponsor  such as a relative  before the judge s reunification order on June 26  2018 When the government previously identified children for reunification  it included only the children who were detained at the time of the reunification order Judge Sabraw wrote in his March 8 order that because all of these families had been subjected to the same policies and had been separated under  questionable circumstances   they should have the same opportunity for relief  Although identifying the families may be burdensome  as the government argued   it clearly can be done   the judge wrote According to the government s proposed plan  officials would update the A C L U  about the families  information after completing the analysis and reviewing the children s cases  The organization would then use that information to help reunify parents and children Mr  Gelernt said a two year wait to reunite families would be devastating  The longer these children remained separated from their families  he said  the more psychological trauma they would endure  He said the A C L U  planned to argue against the proposed plan in court The family separations were a central part of the Trump administration s effort to deter migrant families from trying to enter the United States through its southern border with Mexico Data released last month suggested that the administration s immigration measures   including the separation policy and attempts to beef up border security and limit who qualified for asylum   failed to deter tens of thousands of migrants traveling to the United States  most of whom were escaping violence and poverty in Central America  

WASHINGTON   Republican U S  Senator Lindsey Graham flatly rejected on Tuesday President Donald Trump s request to slash the budget for the U S  State Department by more than 23 percent That proposal  ain t happening   Graham  chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the State Department  declared at the opening of the hearing with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Senator Patrick Leahy  the top subcommittee Democrat  said the administration has proposed  damaging funding cuts  with little to no logical explanation  The Trump administration requested about  40 billion to fund the State Department and its aid arm  the United States Agency for International Development  for the fiscal year starting in October Pompeo noted the hearing comes days before his first anniversary as Trump s second secretary of state  Graham joked that Pompeo was the longest serving member of Trump s cabinet  referring to the high turnover of senior level staff at the White House Pompeo smiled but did not reply  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stepped down this week in the latest high profile resignation  and Trump said on Monday he would replace the head of the U S  Secret Service Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives have also said they will reject the proposed cuts to the budget  setting the stage for a budget battle with the White House   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Lesley Wroughton in Washington  Editing by James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump knew WikiLeaks until he didn t With his government seeking to prosecute WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  Trump is drawing a blank on a hacking organization he praised to the rafters during the 2016 campaign because of the discomfort it caused his Democratic opponent  Hillary Clinton It was among a number of factual faux pas and flips in his rhetoric over the past week A few months after asserting a need for legal immigrants  Trump declared the country  full  and he also seemed to change the grounds upon which he is refusing to release his taxes  It s not because he can t  but because he doesn t want to And with the release of more of the special counsel s report imminent  Trump kept up his refrain that Robert Mueller exonerated him despite Mueller s explicit statement that he did not A review WIKILEAKSTRUMP  asked if he still  loves  WikiLeaks   I know nothing about WikiLeaks  It s not my thing     remarks Thursday with South Korea s president THE FACTS  WikiLeaks was very much Trump s thing in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign  when candidate Trump showered praise on the anti secrecy organization night after night On the same October day that the  Access Hollywood  tape emerged  revealing that Trump had bragged in 2005 about groping women  WikiLeaks began releasing damaging emails from Clinton s campaign manager  John Podesta  Trump and his allies seized on the dumps and weaponized them  WikiLeaks  I love WikiLeaks   Trump said in Pennsylvania  This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove   Trump said in Michigan  Boy  I love reading WikiLeaks   Trump said in Ohio All told  Trump extolled WikiLeaks more than 100 times  and a poster of Assange hung backstage at the Republican s debate war room  At no point from a rally stage did Trump express any misgivings about how WikiLeaks obtained the emails from the Clinton campaign or about the accusations of stealing sensitive U S  government information  which led to the charges against Assange on Thursday  The U S  is seeking Assange s extradition from Britain    TAX RETURNSTRUMP   As you know  I got elected last time with this same issue      I would love to give them  but I m not going to do it while I m under audit     remarks Wednesday to reporters at the White House THE FACTS  Nothing s preventing Trump from releasing his tax returns Being under audit is no legal bar to anyone releasing his or her returns Asked repeatedly at a House hearing Tuesday whether any regulation prohibited a taxpayer from disclosing returns when under audit  IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig responded  no  Trump declined to provide his tax information as a candidate in 2016 and as president  something party nominees have traditionally done in the name of the transparency  By withholding his tax returns  Trump has not followed the standard followed by presidents since Richard Nixon started the practice in 1969  During the campaign  Trump said he wanted to release his returns but because he was under a routine audit   I can t  After the November midterm elections  Trump claimed at a news conference that the filings are too complex for people to understand    JOB APPROVALTRUMP  tweeting a Fox Business Network graphic showing his  soaring approval  at 55  overall   Great news   MAGA    tweet Thursday THE FACTS  The graphic on the Georgetown University poll was incorrect  The poll found 55  disapproval of Trump s performance  not approval  Fox Business issued an on air correction but Trump s tweet remains    CLIMATE CHANGETRUMP   We withdrew the United States from the one sided Paris climate accord  where you don t do any more drilling for oil and gas  That was going to cost us a lot of money  No more oil and gas with the Paris accord  That s good for Paris  but that s not good for us  Right     remarks Wednesday at a ceremony for the signing of executive orders meant to accelerate pipeline construction THE FACTS  Wrong  The Paris accord does not ban any form of energy development  It does not impose emission caps on signatory countries  The accord is a set of voluntary targets determined by individual nations    RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONTRUMP   I ve been totally exonerated  No collusion  No obstruction     remarks Wednesday at the White House TRUMP   I m not concerned about anything  because frankly there was no collusion and there was no obstruction     remarks Thursday with South Korea s president THE FACTS  Attorney General William Barr s four page summary of Mueller s nearly 400 page report did not  totally  exonerate Trump  Mueller specifically states in the report  as quoted by Barr   While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  The summary of principal conclusions by Barr notes Mueller did not  draw a conclusion   one way or the other   as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction   but rather set out evidence for both sides  leaving the question unanswered of whether Trump obstructed justice  Barr said ultimately he decided as attorney general that the evidence developed by Mueller was  not sufficient  to establish  for the purposes of prosecution  that Trump committed obstruction In Senate testimony Wednesday  Barr acknowledged that Mueller did not ask him to draw a conclusion on the obstruction question  nor did he know whether Mueller agreed with him  Barr said he would be able to explain more fully after releasing a public version of Mueller s report in coming days    IMMIGRATIONTRUMP   Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States  or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and or institute Tariffs  Our Country is FULL     tweet Sunday THE FACTS  Despite the overwhelmed southern border  there s plenty of room in the United States  Dozens of countries have greater population density  It s only full in terms of the people Trump doesn t want His claim of a U S  with no vacancies for more immigrants is at odds with his own statement two months ago that encouraged  the largest  influx of legal immigrants ever  It also belies a U S  reality of aging baby boomers and falling birth rates  which make immigrants increasingly important to sustain a level of population growth for the U S  economy to keep expanding The nation s population growth is at its lowest since 1937  with the 18 and under population declining both nationally and in 29 states  according to William H  Frey of the Brookings Institution  Economists say that restricting immigration would probably weaken economic growth  A shrinking labor force could also harm the health and stability of safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare Trump himself seemed to acknowledge the realities during his State of the Union address in February  declaring   I want people to come into our country  in the largest numbers ever  but they have to come in legally   He s now describing a U S  bursting at the seams  unable to take any immigrants  including those seeking legal asylum Immigrants as a whole make up a greater percentage of the total U S  population than they did back in 1970  having grown from less than 5 percent of the population to more than 13 percent now  In 2030  it s projected that immigrants will become the primary driver for U S  population growth  overtaking U S  births    TRUMP on separating migrant children from their parents when caught crossing into the U S  illegally   I m the one that stopped it  President Obama had child separation     remarks to reporters Tuesday THE FACTS  No  he s the one who started it on a broad scale  He instituted a  zero tolerance  policy aimed at criminally prosecuting all adults caught crossing into the U S  illegally  That meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody  During the Obama administration and the early Trump administration  such family separations were the exception  They became the rule under his policy  He suspended the practice in June because of a public uproar    TRUMP on the family separations   President Obama had the law  We changed the law  and I think the press should accurately report it but of course they won t     remarks to reporters Tuesday THE FACTS  This is false  Trump did not achieve any change in the law Trump s zero tolerance policy was of his own making  His administration is operating under the same immigration laws as Obama s During the Obama administration and before Trump s zero tolerance policy was introduced  migrant families caught illegally entering the U S  were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings  not requiring separation  unless they were known to have a criminal record  Then and now  immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases  such as serious criminal charges against a parent  concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns    ENERGY and ENVIRONMENTTRUMP   We have the cleanest air and water  they say  in the world  We are the best    remarks Wednesday at the signing of orders on pipelines THE FACTS  Not true about air U S  drinking water is among the best by one leading measure Trump s own Environmental Protection Agency data show that in 2017  among 35 major U S  cities  there were 729 cases of  unhealthy days for ozone and fine particle pollution   That s up 22 percent from 2014 and the worst year since 2012  Findings for 2018 are incomplete The State of Global Air 2019 report by the Health Effects Institute rated the U S  as having the eighth cleanest air for particle pollution   which kills 85 000 Americans each year   behind Canada  Scandinavian countries and others The U S  ranks poorly on smog pollution  which kills 24 000 Americans per year  On a scale from the cleanest to the dirtiest  the U S  is at 123 out of 195 countries measured On water  Yale University s global Environmental Performance Index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water  the U S  among them  On environmental quality overall  the U S  was 27th  behind a variety of European countries  Canada  Japan  Australia and more  Switzerland was No  1    TRUMP   With the help of the incredible workers in this room  the United States is now the No  1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world  anywhere on the planet  Not even close  Made a lot of progress in the last two and a half years  haven t we  Huh  Took down a lot of barriers     signing ceremony THE FACTS  As he s done many times before  Trump is crediting himself with things that happened under Obama Here s what the government s U S  Energy Information Administration says   The United States has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009  when U S  natural gas production surpassed that of Russia  and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013  when U S  production exceeded Saudi Arabia s  As for crude oil specifically  the information agency says the U S  became the world s top crude oil producer last year  That is largely attributed to the shale oil boom that began during the Obama administration  which has sent production from the Permian Basin in the southwest surging    TRUMP   Under this administration  we have ended the war on American energy like never before     signing ceremony THE FACTS  It wasn t much of a war  U S  petroleum and natural gas production has increased by nearly 60  since 2008  according to the Energy Information Administration  achieving pre eminence during the Obama administration  That said  the Trump administration is more closely aligned with fossil fuel interests as it works to restrain environmental obstacles and the power of states to stand in the way of pipelines and other energy development    Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire  Ellen Knickmeyer  Seth Borenstein and Mary Clare Jalonick

WASHINGTON   In recent months  Kirstjen Nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  had become a regular presence eating dinner at the Trump International Hotel  She had been heckled and booed when dining out after becoming the face of some of President Trump s most hard line immigration policies  like family separations  and her affinity for the hotel  a gathering place for the president s supporters  seemed like a sign that she felt safer on the inside But her status inside the White House  where she was subject to dressing downs from Mr  Trump during cabinet meetings and constant criticism by the president  was not much more secure So when Ms  Nielsen went to the White House on Sunday night to meet with the president to discuss some grievances  she was also prepared to avoid a messy end by letting Mr  Trump  who is known for not personally firing people  off the hook  After Mr  Trump made it clear that he was looking for a change  Ms  Nielsen told him she would resign  ridding him of a cabinet secretary who had long disappointed him Ms  Nielsen s departure  announced Sunday night  was abrupt but hardly unforeseen  the latest in a long and growing conga line of senior officials who have left the administration unceremoniously because of their own frustrations with the president  or because of the president s obvious disappointment in them  Usually  it is both Mr  Trump has ripped into Ms  Nielsen  holding her personally responsible for the uptick in crossings at the southwestern border  And Ms  Nielsen wanted to tell Mr  Trump that she was upset not to have been notified beforehand about his sudden withdrawal of Ron Vitiello  the nominee to serve as Immigration and Customs Enforcement director  and that she was frustrated at being pulled from security meetings in Europe last week and ordered to appear by the president s side on a trip to the border  according to someone close to Ms  Nielsen The end for Ms  Nielsen was something that has become familiar in the Trump administration  a high ranking official like Jeff Sessions  the former attorney general  or Rex Tillerson  the former secretary of state  leaving with a reputation in need of rehabilitation  Normally  people just resign   said Ronald A  Klain  who served as chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   The president sends word through an intermediary that he s unhappy  and you resign  The president says something nice about them and then they leave  But here  quitting isn t good enough  Some exits have been more humiliating than others  Since the departure of Mr  Tillerson  Mr  Trump has referred to him as  dumb as a rock  and  lazy as hell   After calling the departure of his defense secretary  Jim Mattis  a  retirement  and praising his service  Mr  Trump turned on him once he understood that the resignation was an affront to him   What s he done for me   Mr  Trump said of Mr  Mattis   How had he done in Afghanistan  Not too good  After years of haranguing Mr  Sessions in public and in private  Mr  Trump sent John F  Kelly  his former chief of staff  to demand his resignation in November  and he has not let up on him since he left office  In a speech in front of the Conservative Political Action Conference last month  Mr  Trump mimicked Mr  Sessions s southern accent while discussing his decision to recuse himself from the special counsel s investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 campaign ImageRex Tillerson  left  the former secretary of state  and Jeff Sessions  the former attorney general  were both forced out of their positions in the Trump administration CreditStephen Crowley The New York TimesMr  Kelly later suffered his own ignoble end  After he and Mr  Trump ironed out a departure plan at the end of last year  Mr  Kelly planned to make his own announcement at a senior staff dinner at the White House  But the president chose to break the news first  telling reporters that Mr  Kelly would be departing at the end of December Although all involved tried to put the best face on the Sunday meeting between Mr  Trump and Ms  Nielsen   someone familiar with it said the president had even asked her if she would want to return in another position   the two competed afterward for how to spin its contents Within minutes of the meeting s end  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter that Ms  Nielsen was  leaving her position   making it sound as if she was the latest cabinet secretary he had ousted online  Ms  Nielsen then posted her resignation letter on Twitter  notably leaving out any mention or praise for Mr  Trump Mr  Trump has yet to criticize her publicly since  But Ms  Nielsen has already absorbed more than her share of criticism for her role in implementing the president s policies Immigration and civil rights groups have been pressuring Fortune 500 companies to blacklist former Trump officials like Ms  Nielsen  who have promoted his immigration policies  writing that they  should not be allowed to seek refuge in your boardrooms or corner offices   Many other former administration officials have not experienced the post White House career bump that has become part of the payoff for putting in grueling hours on government salaries With a few exceptions  like the smooth send off for Nikki R  Haley  the former ambassador to the United Nations  and a glowing farewell to Linda McMahon  the former administrator of the Small Business Administration  Mr  Trump s top aides often find themselves damaged by their former boss in real time  or on delay Even those who have managed to stay in Mr  Trump s favor  like Mike Pompeo  the secretary of state  have a sense of gallows humor about what might ultimately befall them  I ll be there until he tweets me out of the office   Mr  Pompeo recently joked at an event in his home state of Kansas  when asked about his future in politics For her part  Ms  Nielsen appears to be intent on trying to minimize the damage to her reputation  with surrogates out defending her record  The so called immigration hard liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration  giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems   said Thad Bingel  who was a senior homeland security official in the Bush administration and served as an aide to Ms  Nielsen during her Senate confirmation  They apparently don t want anyone like a Secretary Nielsen or Secretary Kelly  who deals in reality  to tell them or the president any of this   

WASHINGTON   The White House said on Tuesday it would appeal a court ruling that halted a Trump administration policy requiring some asylum seekers to return to Mexico and wait for their legal cases to proceed U S  District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco said on Monday that the administration s policy of sending some Central American asylum seekers to Mexico while their claims work through a backlogged immigration court system was not authorized by U S  law and lacked safeguards to protect refugees from threats to their lives or freedom  This action gravely undermines the president s ability to address the crisis at the border with the tools Congress has authorized and disrupts the conduct of our foreign affairs   the White House said in a statement  We intend to appeal  and we will take all necessary action to defend the executive branch s lawful efforts to resolve the crisis at our southern border   it added The judge s ruling is scheduled to take effect on Friday  It was not immediately clear if the government would seek a suspension of the ruling while the appeals process runs its course A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment Federal agencies on the U S  Mexico border are trying to stem the rising numbers of immigrants  many of them families fleeing violence and poverty in Central America  The Department of Homeland Security said it arrested or denied entry to more than 103 000 people along the border last month  more than double the March 2018 figure   Reporting by Eric Beech  Makini Brice and Yeganeh Torbati  Editing by David Alexander and Grant McCool

WASHINGTON   Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  resigned on Sunday after meeting with President Trump  ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the border security agency that had made her the target of the president s criticism  I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside   Ms  Nielsen said in a resignation letter   I hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse  Ms  Nielsen had requested the meeting to plan  a way forward  at the border  in part thinking she could have a reasoned conversation with Mr  Trump about the role  according to three people familiar with the meeting  She came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president Mr  Trump in recent weeks had asked Ms  Nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers  which Ms  Nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate  While the 30 minute meeting was cordial  Mr  Trump was determined to ask for her resignation  After the meeting  she submitted it ImageListen to  The Daily   The Brief  Controversial Tenure of Kirstjen NielsenAs homeland security secretary  she enacted and publicly defended the family separation

Michael Barbaro  produced by Rachel Quester  Jessica Cheung and Eric Krupke  and edited by Paige CowettAs homeland security secretary  she enacted and publicly defended the family separation policy  In President Trump s eyes  she didn t go far enough michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  The secretary of homeland security was forced out of her job  even after carrying out and defending President Trump s most restrictive immigration policies  Why that wasn t enough  It s Tuesday  April 9  Caitlin  describe what happened over the weekend caitlin dickersonSo on Sunday  Kirstjen Nielsen  who s the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security   she s the nation s highest ranking immigration officer   she goes to the White House for an unscheduled meeting with President Trump michael barbaroCaitlin Dickerson covers immigration for The Times caitlin dickersonAnd he  in recent weeks  has been very riled up publicly over an increasing number of people crossing the border  especially families who seek asylum who have legal protections that mean they have to be allowed into the country  So the secretary arrives at her meeting with a list of ideas for how to address this problem  and she thinks she and the president are going to come up with a way forward  But instead  a few hours later  the president sends a tweet announcing that she will be leaving her job archived recording 1Breaking news here on CNN  From the White House  the secretary of homeland security  Kirstjen Nielsen  has resigned archived recording 2President Trump made the announcement via Twitter archived recording 3In a tweet  the president said  quote   Secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position  and I would like to thank her for her service  archived recording 4So it appears that the president is swinging the revolving door yet again  trying to install new people in his administration to carry out his bidding michael barbaroThat sounds like a meeting that went very poorly for the secretary caitlin dickersonClearly  they were not able to come up with a solution that both could agree on michael barbaroAnd by tweeting her resignation  I think what we re politely suggesting is that he fired her caitlin dickersonFired her  Yes  exactly michael barbaroSo what is the history between President Trump and Secretary Nielsen caitlin dickersonSo Secretary Nielsen takes her job at the end of 2017  She s replacing her former boss  John Kelly  who went to be President Trump s chief of staff  And she takes on this role as basically the person who has to approve any new policy that s going to be introduced along the border  And it s at this period of time when  I think  the President is settling into his role  He s fired up about really coming up with some hard evidence that he can point to ahead of the midterm elections  for example  and say  look  I m keeping my campaign promises  and I m lowering immigration really dramatically  So right away  she s faced with aggressive ideas for how to prevent people from coming to the United States  and the first one is family separation michael barbaroAnd what do we know about how Nielsen responds to that very controversial policy when it is first introduced to her caitlin dickersonShe slow walks it  We reported in December of 2017 that a family separation policy had reached her desk for that final signature  and it took her four months to approve it  during which time she and President Trump clashed quite a bit  She had questions about the legality of it  She had questions about the practicality and how the public was going to respond  And she had just a lot of reservations about moving forward  But ultimately  she agreed  and the policy was introduced in a formal way in April archived recording 1Quit separating the kids  They re separating the children  Mr  President  don t you have kids  Don t you have kids  Mr  President archived recording 2I don t believe in this  This is not America  This is not our country  This is not what we should be doing archived recording  kirstjen nielsen This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border archived recordingShame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay at the other side of the border  fearing death  and allow the secretary to come here and lie archived recording  kirstjen nielsen Calling me a liar are fighting words  I m not a liar  We ve never had a policy for family separation  And let s be clear   if an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States  they would go to jail  and they would be separated from their family  This is not a controversial idea caitlin dickersonInternally  she s  if not resisting  she s certainly questioning and slowing down a lot of these policies  And then  externally  to the public  she s having to defend them and really look like the face of them  and that ends up being something that she does actually over and over again in her job michael barbaroAnd remind us what ends up happening to the family separation policy caitlin dickersonSo President Trump stopped the practice himself by signing an executive order archived recording  donald trump I consider it to be a very important executive order  It s about keeping families together caitlin dickersonBut it didn t matter  because a few days later  a federal judge intervened  deemed the practice unconstitutional  and he didn t stop there  He said that  archived recordingFamilies who have been separated as a result of the Trump administration s zero tolerance policy be reunited within 30 days  The order says kids under 5 must be back with their parents within 14 days from now caitlin dickersonSo sort of a resounding disavowal of this policy michael barbaroBy the legal system caitlin dickersonExactly  And so even though she d pushed back against it  Secretary Nielsen ends up taking the blame michael barbaroSo what s another example something that she expresses internal qualms about but then goes out and defends publicly caitlin dickersonSo one of the next policies to be introduced was an idea to limit asylum pretty significantly so that people could only apply if they showed up at a legal port of entry   whereas beforehand  people could and did very often show up anywhere along the border  present themselves to a border agency  ask for protection  and they were ushered into this legal process  The idea was to say  you can t do that anymore  You have to show up at a specific office  which is  of course  a pretty tall order for somebody who s coming from Central America with maybe a cell phone  maybe not  not a whole lot of resources  They don t always know exactly where these offices exist archived recording  kirstjen nielsen You do not need to break the law of this country by entering illegally to claim asylum  If you are seeking asylum  go to a port of entry caitlin dickersonBut as Nielsen pointed out to the president  it was very hard to justify  because immigration law explicitly says that you can request asylum regardless of where you enter michael barbaroSo again  Nielsen is saying inside the White House  hey  this might not be legal  I have reservations about it  But it nevertheless gets implemented  And as you ve said  she s the decider  So she signs off on it caitlin dickersonExactly  And it s important to point out that when Nielsen pushed back against President Trump  it wasn t a reflection of her being a liberal on immigration or having a more sympathetic view toward asylum seekers  She just happened to be the face of an entire agency full of people who work in immigration enforcement but who still made clear to her that there were going to be legal and logistical roadblocks to putting these ideas into place michael barbaroAnd what happens to that port of entry policy that would limit the number of locations that people can apply for asylum caitlin dickersonVery quickly after  it s blocked by federal courts  and it remains that way archived recordingA district court ruled that the ban conflicts with immigration law caitlin dickersonSo this was the executive branch trying to very clearly contradict laws that were approved by the legislative branch archived recordingAnd now the Supreme Court has refused to step in to unblock the ban michael barbaroSo her legal reservations are well founded  In other words  her advice to the president is correct  even if it s ignored caitlin dickersonThat s right  Her analysis is sound  because each time she is pushed back  she s been right  And these ideas have been blocked michael barbaroDo any of these policies that we re describing   family separation  limiting the locations at which people can seek asylum   do any of them succeed in curbing the flow of migrants  even for the very short period of time that they re in place before they are legally challenged caitlin dickersonThey don t archived recordingNew numbers show a 400 percent   4 0 0  that is   400 percent increase over just last year caitlin dickersonLast October  we saw a record number of families seek asylum in the United States  This is after family separation is introduced  And every month since then  the numbers have gotten even higher archived recordingC B P  officials say Border Patrol agents are on pace for apprehensions and encounters with more than 100 000 migrants in March michael barbaroSo not only are these policies being blocked in court  for the very short bit of time that they were ever in place  they re not doing their job of limiting the flow of migrants caitlin dickersonThey re not  The numbers keep going up  And some people would argue that maybe the policies weren t left in place for long enough to show any concrete outcome  and we can t know that for sure  But what we do know is that these policies that Nielsen was pushing back on  saying they re not going to work  didn t work  And the numbers have continued to rise michael barbaroAnd so what does that do to the president s relationship to Nielsen  She s in a sense being vindicated  but the problem she s there to solve is only getting worse caitlin dickersonShe s simultaneously sort of being vindicated if you look at it from a legal standpoint  but from a relationship standpoint  she s the face  in President Trump s eyes  of these failures archived recording 1Kirstjen Nielsen appears to be on shaky ground  That s according to a New York Times report  Nielsen told colleagues that she was close to resigning Wednesday after being berated by the president in front of the entire cabinet archived recording 2Nothing sets him off more than immigration  and I m told that meeting on Wednesday in the cabinet room was very heated  was incredibly heated  She spoke back to him about it  tried to defend herself caitlin dickersonSo it s in this context of the policies that are being introduced being blocked in the courts  the number of people crossing the border rising  and Trump s relationship with Secretary Nielsen falling apart that he comes up with his most aggressive idea yet archived recordingAnother day  another threat from President Trump  and today  he is threatening to shut down the southern border caitlin dickersonWhere he wants to completely seal the border  100 percent  Not let anybody come into the U S archived recording  donald trump And if they don t stop them  we re closing the border  We ll close it  and we ll keep it closed for a long time  I m not playing games michael barbaroAnd how exactly would that work caitlin dickersonWell  we shouldn t assume that the president had any particular policy in his mind when he tweeted that he wanted to seal the border  We can assume  though  that he wasn t talking about  for example  cargo moving back and forth or people with actual visas and permission to come into the United States  but really that he s talking about shutting down asylum and shutting down the ability of people who don t previously have permission to come into the United States  And the policy that we know has come closest to achieving that goal  one that s been kicking around in Washington for some months now  would be to get rid of asylum as we know it  It would no longer allow anyone to apply for asylum in the United States  And instead  people who needed that status or wanted that status would have to stay in their home country  similar to the way that Syrian refugees apply to come to the United States   apply from home  wait many months  go through lots of vetting and background checks  and then only if they re approved  they would be allowed to come here michael barbaroAnd I guess  what could be a more extreme version of limiting asylum than literally telling people  you cannot come to this country and apply for asylum caitlin dickersonI don t think there is a more extreme version  because I think this idea means eliminating asylum  It goes away michael barbaroAnd as best we understand it  what was Secretary Nielsen s response to this idea caitlin dickersonFrom what we know  it s been very similar to the way she reacted to family separation  to that idea to significantly limit asylum to the ports of entry  which is that this is going to be challenged by the courts immediately  It s going to be a huge lift to get a policy like this introduced  to work out the logistics  and all of it will be for naught  because it ll be enjoined by the courts  And it s that oppositional and resistant stance that she s in when she walks into the White House for her meeting with the president  It s unclear who threw up their hands first or second  or whether they both did it  but what we know is that the president did not leave her with an option  that he  at least  decided this isn t going to work  You re out  And she was by the end of that night  And so what that means is the homeland security secretary who oversaw some of the most controversial and aggressive immigration policies this country has ever seen   even she wasn t aggressive enough for President Trump  And so now she s gone  and he s looking for a replacement who will go even further michael barbaroWe ll be right back  So Caitlin  who is the president turning to to replace Nielsen as he looks for somebody to go further than she was willing to go caitlin dickersonHe s turning to Kevin McAleenan  who s currently the head of United States Customs and Border Protection  That s the agency that oversees both the customs officers who you meet at the airport when you ve gone on vacation abroad and then the Border Patrol  Those are the police  the boots on the ground along the border  And McAleenan is known as sort of a policy wonk  a really smart and reasonable guy who s willing to work with Democrats  and somebody who served under President Obama as well  He s got more than 10 years of experience at the agency  People know him as this reasonable guy  But when you dig a little bit deeper  McAleenan was inspired to get into homeland security work right after 9 11  And at C B P   especially most recently when he was overseeing this agency  it really became known as the sort of policy engine with him at the center of it coming up with ways to turn President Trump s ideas into actual policies that could be carried out  If D H S  is this agency run out of Washington that s overseeing all of this work  it was McAleenan s staff members that were actually physically taking children away from their parents  that were physically turning asylum seekers away at the border or telling them to go elsewhere or to wait in line  So now he s moving into this role where he s got even more power  but I think we can expect that he ll continue to do what he was doing before  which was take President Trump s ideas that are sort of extreme and that aren t necessarily encumbered by the immigration laws  norms  history  and he ll try to translate them into something that s practical and that can be introduced on the ground michael barbaroSo even though he might seem moderate at first glance  he s actually someone who the president trusts to put these more restrictive  maybe even extreme policies into practice  And he s been involved in doing that already  Now he s being elevated to do it at an even higher level caitlin dickersonExactly michael barbaroAnd I guess that all makes sense  If Nielsen is seen as too reluctant to put these policies into practice  then the president would turn to somebody who is willing to do that caitlin dickersonThat s right  who is willing to try  But remember that McAleenan is going to run up against the exact same legal framework and logistical challenges that anybody else in that role is going to michael barbaroRight  So if these policies are going to run into legal trouble in the courts  regardless of who is leading the agency  what does it matter  in the end  if the leader of the Department of Homeland Security is gung ho about the President s policies or is reluctantly saying yes  as Nielsen was caitlin dickersonI think you can look at that question a couple of different ways  On one hand  you re right that it s not going to make a huge difference who s sitting in the office at the head of the Homeland Security Department  because no matter what they introduce  if it violates the immigration law  they re going to wind up in court  But another way of looking at it is family separation only existed as an official sort of policy for what  45 days under zero tolerance  Not a very long period of time before it had to end  But still  I don t think that very many people are going to argue that family separation was a small thing or something that didn t affect very many people  I mean  I think it had a huge impact  So I do think that if you have a hawk running the Homeland Security Department  even when they re sort of encumbered by the existing legal framework  they can make some pretty big changes  even if  ultimately  those changes wind up in court  I think that Kevin McAleenan has two things going for him in President Trump s eyes  The first  like we said  is that he knows the policies and he knows the situation on the ground like the back of his hand  And the second thing is that he s shown a willingness to follow President Trump s lead  and so he may be the person who s best positioned to come up with the most legal ways to achieve President Trump s goals  And even if the policies that he comes up with don t remain in place in the long term  they might at least exist long enough to give President Trump something to point to and show his supporters when they ask  where are you on these campaign promises  Where are you on this idea of  if not sealing the border  significantly decreasing the number of immigrants coming to the United States michael barbaroSo even if these policies are ultimately blocked by the courts  it feels like it s important to this president to have someone at the Department of Homeland Security who is willing to try them  and that may be enough caitlin dickersonI think in President Trump s heart of hearts  right  he would hope that he would find not only somebody who is willing to try but somebody who is going to succeed  He wants aggressive policies to be instituted in the long term  But I think it s better in his mind than nothing to have somebody who s willing to try  And as we know  politically  it s better than nothing  because then the president can point to these policies that he tried to introduce  if only it wasn t for the courts who had blocked him  or if only it wasn t for Congress who blocked him michael barbaroRight  My intention was there  Somebody else is at fault for it not working caitlin dickersonExactly  He has at least an attempt to meet these campaign promises to point to when voters ask  why haven t you made a significant change  So I think that having a more aggressive leader in place who s more willing to introduce these policies  when they get stuck in the courts  it allows Trump to blame the courts rather than his own administration for getting in his way  He can say  look  I tried  but these judges are blocking me  whereas it wasn t just the judges blocking him with Secretary Nielsen  It was her  too michael barbaroIf Congress is not going to change the law  and I think the assumption is that they are not going to do that anytime soon when it comes to basic immigration law  is the president right to suggest that the current system is broken  and the only way to fix it is to test these new ideas  even if they push the boundaries of the law caitlin dickersonI would say yes to the first part of your question  Most people agree that the system is broken  But when it comes to fixing the problem  what are you trying to fix  In the president s mind  the problem is the vast number of people coming here to seek asylum  His idea of a fix would decrease that number  But other people see the problem as not that people are coming here to seek asylum at all but the ways that we re dealing with them  We don t have space to place people physically in custody when they enter  We don t have judges to hear their cases for years and years  So if you see that as the problem  then  michael barbaroHe s not really addressing those caitlin dickersonHe s not addressing those problems  and I think that s because a lot of people who agree with the president are concerned that if we come up with better systems for processing asylum seekers   we make it more organized and efficient and  in some cases  comfortable   that all that will do is encourage more and more people to come  And again  if the numbers themselves are what you see as the problem  then making the system better only makes it worse michael barbaroCaitlin  what does all of this tell us about where President Trump plans to go on immigration caitlin dickersonI think it shows that President Trump is going to continue full steam ahead to achieve his immigration goals and that if there are people  even informed career officials  who want to stand in the way of that  they re going to be pushed out  because he s very committed to the goal of limiting the number of people who come to the border  regardless of the many legal challenges he s already faced  those that are sure to come  the public reaction  all these other things notwithstanding  We re not seeing any signs of slowing down  I think this week is actually an indicator of a ramping up of these goals michael barbaroIn other words  the gloves are coming off  even though  in a lot of people s minds  they thought the gloves were already off caitlin dickersonThat s right  It s like another set of gloves are coming off michael barbaroCaitlin  thank you very much caitlin dickersonThank you michael barbaroOn Monday  The Times reported that President Trump plans to push out more officials from the Department of Homeland Security  including the department s general counsel and the director of U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  as he seeks to carry out his harder line approach to immigration  A few hours later  in the latest legal setback to that approach  a federal judge blocked a Trump administration policy that required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico rather than in the U S  while their cases made their way through U S  immigration court  The judge found that the policy violated federal law  Here s what else you need to know today archived recording  mike pompeo Today  the United States is continuing to build its maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime  I am announcing our intent to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  including its Quds Force  as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act michael barbaroOn Monday  the Trump administration said that it was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization  the first time that the U S  has classified part of any country s government as such a threat archived recording  mike pompeo We re doing it because the Iranian regime s use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government michael barbaroThe move was debated at the highest levels of the administration  with top officials at the Defense Department and the C I A  opposing the designation  arguing it could justify Iranian attacks against the U S  and its allies  But the president s national security adviser  John Bolton  and his secretary of state  Mike Pompeo  advocated for the decision  arguing the designation would further isolate Iran by discouraging businesses from working with its military archived recording  mike pompeo This historic step will deprive the world s leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world michael barbaroIn response  Iran s government said it was designating the U S  Central Command  which oversees military operations in the Middle East  as a terrorist organization as well  That s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow The move comes just two days after Mr  Trump  who has repeatedly expressed anger at a rise in migrants at the southwestern border  withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a  tougher  direction Mr  Trump

secretary through Wednesday  in order  to assist with an orderly transition   The abruptness was unusual because the Department of Homeland Security currently does not have a deputy secretary  who would normally take the reins The president said in a tweet that Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  would take over as the acting replacement for Ms  Nielsen  who became the sixth secretary to lead the agency in late 2017  But by law  the under secretary for management  Claire Grady  who is currently serving as acting deputy secretary  is next in line to be

said Ms  Nielsen had been pressured by Mr  Trump to be more aggressive in stemming the influx of migrant crossings at the border  people familiar with their discussions in recent months said Her entire time in the job was spent batting back suspicion from the president  even as he told people he liked how she performed on television and enjoyed dealing with her personally  He initially was

home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country  including doing things that were clearly illegal  such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum  She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws  court settlements and international obligations Those responses only infuriated Mr  Trump further  The president s fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as Ms  Nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained In a cabinet meeting surrounded by her peers  Mr  Trump castigated her repeatedly  leading her to draft a resignation letter and to tell colleagues that there was no reason for her to lead the department any longer  By the end of the week  she had reconsidered and remained in her position  becoming an increasingly fierce supporter of his policies  including the family separations Mr  Trump and Stephen Miller  the president s top immigration adviser  have privately but regularly complained about Ms  Nielsen  Lou Dobbs  a Fox News host who is one of the president s favorite sounding boards  has also encouraged Mr  Trump s negative views of her handling of the migrant crisis Ms  Nielsen lost a powerful protector when Mr  Kelly  her mentor  left his job as White House chief of staff at the beginning of the year  Mr  Kelly was the Trump administration s first homeland security secretary and lobbied for Ms  Nielsen to replace him Multiple White House officials said she had grown deeply paranoid in recent months  after numerous stories about her job being on the line  She also had supported the Immigration and Customs Enforcement nominee Mr  Trump withdrew  Ronald D  Vitiello  and her support for him was described as problematic for her with the president  Mr  Trump felt Mr  Vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president threatened again to do in a tweet on Sunday night The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other In early 2019  as the number of migrant families from Central American countries surged  the president s fury at Ms  Nielsen did  too  He repeatedly demanded that she cut off foreign aid to Central American countries even though the funding was the responsibility of the State Department  She repeatedly deflected his demands One day after Ms  Nielsen traveled to Honduras to sign a regional compact with officials from Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  Mr  Trump cut State Department funding for the countries  And in recent days  the president made public moves to undercut her authority  leaking news that he might nominate an  immigration czar  to assume oversight of the issue at the heart of Ms  Nielsen s department Still  Ms  Nielsen embraced the president s  crisis  language as apprehensions of migrants at the border shot up to thousands per day  On Friday  Mr  Trump traveled with Ms  Nielsen and Mr  McAleenan to Calexico  Calif   to highlight the issue While the number of border crossings is not as high as in the early 2000s  the demographic of migrants has shifted largely from individual Mexicans looking for jobs   who could easily be deported   to Central American families  overwhelming detention facilities and prompting mass releases of migrants into cities along the border Ms  Nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100 000 migrants in March But despite the trip and several stories about how much better her relationship with Mr  Trump was  Ms  Nielsen never learned how to manage him  people familiar with their discussions said  He often felt lectured to by Ms  Nielsen  the people familiar with the discussions said ImageMs  Nielsen lost a powerful protector when John F  Kelly  her mentor and the Trump administration s first homeland security secretary  left his job as White House chief of staff at the beginning of the year CreditAl Drago for The New York TimesAnd his son in law  Jared Kushner  was not an admirer of Ms  Nielsen  several administration officials said  That came to a head recently as Mr  Kushner had inserted himself into immigration discussions While Mr  Trump often blamed Ms  Nielsen for the surge in migrant crossings  she will be remembered for leading the department during the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy along the southwestern border  which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families An intense backlash ensued  and the Department of Homeland Security was unprepared to deal with separating nearly 3 000 children from their parents  Hampered by misstep after misstep  Kirstjen Nielsen s tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start   said Representative Bennie Thompson  a Mississippi Democrat and the chairman of the House s committee on Homeland Security   It is clearer now than ever that the Trump administration s border security and immigration policies   that she enacted and helped craft   have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border  Mr  Trump eventually moved to halt the family separations  though the government struggled in some cases to reunite those it had already separated By naming Mr  McAleenan acting secretary  Mr  Trump is installing another veteran of previous administrations  not a loyal foot soldier of Mr  Trump s campaign Married to a Salvadoran immigrant  Mr  McAleenan is a lawyer who wrote an honors thesis at Amherst College on marriage equality and applied at the F B I  after the Sept  11 attacks Described by colleagues as a savvy political operator  Mr  McAleenan worked cooperatively with Obama administration officials but later embraced Mr  Trump s agenda  which included unshackling Border Patrol agents from restrictions that the previous administration had imposed Mr  McAleenan was also one of three Department of Homeland Security officials who had urged Ms  Nielsen to sign the memo authorizing the routine separation of migrant families at the border The department  which has a budget of more than  40 billion and more than 240 000 employees  is an amalgam of 22 government agencies that was created after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  It is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters At 46  Ms  Nielsen was the youngest person to lead the sprawling department  and an unlikely choice for the job In the months immediately after the Sept  11 attacks  she helped set up the Transportation Security Administration  now an agency within the department  She also worked as a special assistant to President George W  Bush on natural disaster response while serving on the White House Homeland Security Council When Mr  Trump moved Mr  Kelly to the White House in July 2017  Ms  Nielsen moved with him  As the principal deputy chief of staff  she enforced Mr  Kelly s attempts to regulate access to Mr  Trump in the Oval Office  including the president s schedule   irritating White House staff members  who complained she was uncompromising Mr  Kelly later backed Ms  Nielsen to succeed him at the Homeland Security Department  though she was criticized as too inexperienced for the job by Democrats and anti immigration groups  Mr  Trump  however  said she was  ready on Day 1   There will be no on the job training for Kirstjen   Mr  Trump said in October 2017  announcing her nomination for the post But by the following spring  Ms  Nielsen was telling associates she was miserable in the job

SAN DIEGO   A Trump administration regulation set to go into effect Friday bars transgender people from the military unless they  correct those deficiencies   a description the American Medical Association said Thursday is unfair and defies science   The AMA told The Associated Press on Thursday the policy and its wording mischaracterizes transgender people as having a  deficiency   It said it also objects to the Defense Department classifying the need to transition to another gender among  administratively disqualifying conditions  that include those the Pentagon has labeled as  congenital or developmental defects  The new regulation strips transgender troops of rights they only recently secured under the Obama administration to serve openly and receive care if they choose to transition to another gender The Defense Department said its use of the words  deficiencies  is military lingo for when an individual fails to meet standards to maintain a lethal force  It is not a reference to gender dysphoria  a condition of extreme distress from not identifying with one s biological gender  Lt  Col  Carla Gleason said The department says transgender people can serve if they remain in their biological sex  The only thing deficient is any medical science behind this decision   American Medical Association President Dr  Barbara L  McAneny said Decorated Army helicopter pilot Lindsey Muller was a plaintiff in one of four lawsuits that tried to block the policy from taking effect  But the final legal injunction was lifted in March  though new legal challenges are expected Muller said she and other transgender troops feel demoralized  Under our ethical standards  we can t say anything derogatory against the administration  while we are being presented in a disparaging and derogatory light   said Muller  37  who is based in Fort Carson  Colorado Troops like Muller  who began openly identifying as a woman in 2016  are worried they will be discharged  The administration says it will not boot current service members who transitioned before the Pentagon issued its directive  though the government has also said it retains the right to eliminate that protection Muller said the policy will cost the armed forces far more in terms of losing experienced personnel like herself and training replacements than any costs associated with specialized health care for trans servicemembers  She plans to retire from the military next year after serving 20 years Under the new policy  a service member can be discharged based on a diagnosis of gender dysphoria if he or she is  unable or unwilling to adhere to all applicable standards  including the standards associated with his or her biological sex  or seeks transition to another gender  It said the discharge should come after an individual  has been formally counseled on his or her failure to adhere to such standards and has been given an opportunity to correct those deficiencies  The policy calls for troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria to be medically evaluated before discharging them to see if they qualify as having a disability  Otherwise gender dysphoria can be considered a  condition that interferes with military service  like sleep walking  bed wetting  motion sickness  and personality disorders  They can dress it up in whatever words they want  but when you carefully look at this it s total disrespect for these human beings by saying a core piece of them is not acceptable   former acting U S  Army Surgeon General Gale Pollock said Pollock signed a statement with three former U S  surgeons general and two former military surgeons general  saying they are  troubled by the Defense Department s characterization of the need to undergo gender transition as a  deficiency   and by the addition of gender dysphoria to official lists of  congenital or developmental defects  that include bed wetting and  disturbances of perception  thinking  emotional control  or behavior   An estimated 14 700 troops identify as transgender Military chiefs testified before Congress last year that they found no problems with transgender troops on morale or unit cohesion  Many have received medals since the armed forces welcomed them in 2016 Transgender troops say the regulation mirrors the  don t ask  don t tell  policy that prohibited gay men and women from serving openly in the armed forces before Congress repealed it in 2010      Crary reported from New York

A Democratic House chairman on Saturday castigated the Treasury Department for failing to meet his deadline to furnish President Trump s tax returns  arguing that the administration s apparent concerns over his use of powers outlined in the Internal Revenue Service s tax code  lack merit  The chairman  Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  set a new deadline for compliance  April 23  and warned that if the Trump administration did not reply by then  its  failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request  The tone of Mr  Neal s letter suggested Democrats are prepared to take their request   made through a little known provision in the federal tax code   to court if necessary  initiating what could be a protracted legal fight over Congress s oversight powers  In it  he cited legal precedent that he argued clearly showed the law is on the committee s side  and said that the executive branch had no right to  second guess  its motivations  Read the letter here   I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding my request and the authority of the committee   Mr  Neal wrote   Those concerns lack merit  Moreover  judicial precedent commands that none of the concerns raised can legitimately be used to deny the committee s request  The Treasury secretary  Steven Mnuchin  said on Saturday that he had read Mr  Neal s letter but made no commitments about complying with the request by the new deadline  which he described as  arbitrary   I feel a responsibility that we get this right and that the I R S  doesn t become weaponized like it was under the Nixon administration   Mr  Mnuchin said during a news briefing on the sidelines of the annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Mr  Mnuchin said that Treasury lawyers were studying the lawfulness of the request with the Justice Department  While he said that he would follow the law  he made clear that he had serious concerns about protecting the privacy of the tax returns of all taxpayers  including Mr  Trump  I don t think these are simple issues   Mr  Mnuchin said   They are constitutional issues  House Democrats  anticipating an increasingly likely legal fight over the Ways and Means action  have also taken steps to open a side door into Mr  Trump s finances  Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee  informed Republicans on Friday that he intended to issue a subpoena in the coming days to compel Mazars USA  an accounting company tied to the president  to turn over relevant financial records in its possession Republicans balked at the request  calling it an  astonishing abuse  of the committee s powers  But Mr  Cummings said he had the authority to investigate potential wrongdoing by Mr  Trump and testimony from Michael D  Cohen  his longtime fixer  that the president had intentionally misrepresented his assets and liabilities to suit his needs at a given moment  The committee has full authority to investigate whether the president may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office  to determine whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions  to assess whether he is complying with the emoluments clauses of the Constitution  and to review whether he has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities   Mr  Cummings wrote  hinting at the broad scope of his own investigation This month  Mr  Neal formally requested six years of Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns  ending months of speculation about when newly empowered Democrats would make a request and how they would justify it Mr  Trump himself has made abundantly clear he does not intend to relent on his yearslong objections to turning over his tax returns  and his personal lawyer has urged the Treasury Department to fight Mr  Neal s request ImageMr  Trump has defied modern political norms and refused to release any of his tax returns CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesOn Wednesday  just before Mr  Neal s initial deadline for compliance  the Treasury Department said it needed more time to assess the legality of the request but cast doubt on his assertions to having a legitimate legislative purpose to do so  Mr  Mnuchin wrote that he was consulting the Justice Department to draft a response  but did not indicate how long that would take  The committee s request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional investigative authority  the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose and the constitutional rights of American citizens   Mr  Mnuchin wrote   The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically motivated disclosures of tax information  regardless of which party is in power  Mr  Trump has defied modern political norms and refused to release any of his tax returns  either as a candidate or as president  He has repeatedly claimed  including as recently as Wednesday  that he is under audit by the I R S  and therefore cannot make the documents public as every other presidential nominee has done for decades But no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing returns while under audit  and the I R S  automatically audits the returns of all presidents and vice presidents while they are in office Mr  Neal says it is a committee investigation of that mandatory presidential audit policy that necessitates seeing Mr  Trump s returns Mr  Neal is relying on a little known provision in the federal tax code  Section 6103  that dates to the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s and gives the chairmen of Congress s tax writing committees unique powers to request tax information on any filer  The code itself gives the executive branch little wiggle room in responding  stating only that the Treasury secretary  shall  furnish the information upon request Legal scholars who have studied the provision and Mr  Neal s request believe that if the Treasury Department does object  it will argue that the Ways and Means chairman has overstepped Congress s oversight authority by making a request that lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and is meant only to achieve a political end  A resulting legal fight could ultimately make it to the Supreme Court and have significant implications on the expansiveness of Congress s investigative powers Republicans on Capitol Hill  Mr  Trump s White House aides  and his personal lawyer  William S  Consovoy  have all argued that Democrats are merely out to politically embarrass the president and urged the I R S  and Treasury Department to reject their request as illegitimate Mr  Neal s letter on Saturday punched back at some of their objections  Notably  it was addressed not to Mr  Mnuchin but to Charles P  Rettig  the I R S  commissioner  whom Democrats believe should make the decision himself At the news briefing on Saturday  Mr  Mnuchin defended his decision to oversee the request  noting that the Treasury Department supervises the tax collection agency Mr  Neal argued that the statute in question was clear that Mr  Rettig must hand over the information  But he added that the administration had no authority to question how the committee would handle the information or the validity of its legislative purpose  There is no valid basis to question the legitimacy of the committee s legislative purpose here   Mr  Neal wrote  citing a 1957 Supreme Court case  Watkins v  United States  as saying Congress s investigative powers were  broad  and  encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes  But legal scholars say that the administration could seek to cite the same 1957 ruling against the committee  because it also holds that while the powers of Congress to investigate are  broad   they are also  not unlimited

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump said Friday he is strongly considering releasing  Illegal Immigrants  into Democratic strongholds to punish congressional foes for inaction on the border  just hours after White House and Homeland Security officials insisted the idea had been rejected as fast as it had been proposed  Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws  we are indeed  as reported  giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only   Trump tweeted  He added that   The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders  Open Arms policy   so this should make them very happy  The reversal  which appeared to catch officials at the Department of Homeland Security off guard  came as critics were blasting Trump for the supposedly rejected idea  accusing him of turning migrants into pawns to go after his political opponents  It comes as Trump has grown increasingly exasperated by a surge of Central American migrant families crossing the southern border and is looking for new ways to pressure congressional Democrats to change laws that he insists are making the problem worse Indeed  last week Trump urged his soon to be acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan to seal the southern border and told McAleenan he would pardon him if he were to find himself in trouble for blocking legal asylum seekers  according to two people familiar with the conversation who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private exchange It was not clear whether the president was joking  and a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement   At no time has the president indicated  asked  directed or pressured the acting secretary to do anything illegal    The reported conversation came during the president s trip last week to Calexico  California  a day after he announced he was delaying his threat to close the border because Mexico appeared to be stepping up its enforcement efforts Before Trump s tweets on Friday  both the Department of Homeland Security and a White House official had released nearly identical statements saying the sanctuary cities plan had been floated but then flatly rejected But not  apparently  by the president  who emphatically revived the idea Asked about it by reporters  he said he was  strongly looking at  releasing migrant families into those communities  They re always saying they have open arms  Let s see if they have open arms   he said There were no indications  however  that officials were taking any steps to move forward with the idea or considered the president s words anything more than bluster  Sanctuary cities  are places where local authorities do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials  denying information or resources that would help ICE round up for deportation people living in the country illegally They include New York City and San Francisco  home city of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who on Friday called the idea  unworthy of the presidency of the United States and disrespectful of the challenges that we face as a country  as a people  to address who we are   a nation of immigrants  Rep  Bennie Thompson of Mississippi  who chairs the House Homeland Security committee  said it  serves as a reminder that the Trump administration s reckless immigration agenda is not about keeping the country safe  but about partisan politics and wantonly inflicting cruelty   The idea of pressing immigration authorities to embrace the plan was discussed in November and then again in February as the Trump administration struggled with a surge of migrants at the border  according to three people who spoke on condition of anonymity to outline private conversations  Homeland Security and ICE lawyers quickly rejected the proposal  according to the people  on the grounds that it was complicated  too expensive and a misuse of funds  two of the people said The plan  which was first reported by The Washington Post  is one of a litany of ideas being tossed around by an increasingly anxious White House in recent months  Officials say they are running out of options  and have proposed and recycled numerous ideas that have never come to fruition  Trump in recent weeks  for instance  has discussed the idea of renewing his administration s controversial family separation policy   even as he s publicly declared he won t do that   and has threatened to completely seal the border despite opposition from many in his administration There have been at least two versions of the sanctuary city plan discussed  One to move people who have already been detained to places with Democratic opponents of the president  the other to transport migrants apprehended at the border directly to San Francisco  New York City  Chicago and other spots ICE arrests people in the U S  illegally and also manages migrants who present themselves at border crossings and ask for asylum The surge of migrant families at the border has been taxing the system  and ICE says it no longer has the resources to handle immigrants processed by the Border Patrol  As a result  more than 125 000 people have been released as they await court hearings   a practice Trump has derided as  catch and release  With immigrant processing and holding centers overwhelmed  the administration has already been busing people hundreds of miles inland and releasing them at Greyhound stations and churches in cities such as Albuquerque  San Antonio and Phoenix Transporting large groups of immigrants to distant cities would be even more expensive for an agency already strapped for cash  Flights chartered by ICE cost about  7 785 per flight hour  according to the agency  and require multiple staffers  including an in flight medical professional  The agency also uses commercial flights but requires that migrants to pay for those At the same time  many  sanctuary  communities would likely welcome the immigrants in question  Some of these cities have robust networks of nonprofit legal groups that could help them strengthen their legal cases to stay The Department of Health and Human Services said this week it had started scouting vacant properties that could be turned into facilities for holding migrant children in several cities  including Atlanta  Dallas  Houston  Phoenix  and San Antonio Those facilities would be licensed by each state and likely take several months to be approved and opened  separating them from the rapidly expanding emergency shelter at Homestead  Florida  and the now closed tent facility at Tornillo  Texas The Defense Department has also been reviewing a number of military bases to find a location that can house up to 5 000 unaccompanied migrant children as the U S  braces for a surge of people crossing the U S  Mexico border this spring Under the Trump administration  ICE has significantly stepped up arrests  including of people who have no U S  criminal records  In response  some cities have banished ICE from jails where agents could easily pick up immigration violators  Police in New York  Baltimore and Seattle rarely  if ever  disclose information about when suspected criminals in the U S  illegally will be released from custody Democrats have said they will tackle immigration bills  possibly as soon as they return from their spring recess  and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has indicated an interest    Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant in Houston  Astrid Galvan in Phoenix and Lisa Mascaro and Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed to this

HAVANA   Cuban President Miguel Diaz Canel accused the Trump administration on Saturday of dragging relations with the United States to their worst level in decades and called on Cubans to strengthen the Communist run country s defenses and economy Diaz Canel  in a speech closing the National Assembly  said the United States is engaging in an  asphyxiating financial persecution that makes the import of goods and resources of primary necessity particularly difficult  The Cuban economy has stagnated in recent years in tandem with the implosion of strategic ally Venezuela  resulting in cuts in fuel and energy use by state entities and this year shortages of basic goods such as bread  chicken and eggs An increase in U S  sanctions under President Donald Trump is also making it even harder for cash strapped Cuba to get credit from financial institutions Cuba s Economy Minister Alejandro Gil Fernandez earlier in the day called on the government to tighten belts further and seek alternatives to imports  as foreign exchange earnings decline and credit for supplies and investment become more difficult to find  Exports are not growing as planned  The levels of foreign investment that the economy demands are not materializing   Gil said   We can forecast the import plan will not be fulfilled because the credits we need cannot be finalized due to the arrears of payments of debts  Cuba relies on imports directly or indirectly for much of what it produces and consumes  including fuel and food  and purchases the supplies with foreign currency it earns from exports and obtains through credits The government has been struggling to keep economic growth in the black and forecast a 1 5 percent increase in gross domestic product this year after a 1 2 percent increase last year The Trump administration has said Cuba is responsible for the survival of socialist Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro and slapped new sanctions on Cuba  which is already under a crippling trade embargo  leaving the detente of former president Barack Obama in the dust This month the United States sanctioned vessels and companies that ship oil to Cuba from Venezuela in exchange for health and other technical services  threatening the energy grid and transportation The Trump administration says it soon may activate a long dormant law under which Cuban Americans could sue foreign companies that profit from their properties nationalized during the first years of the 1959 Revolution  Our response is no  imperialist gentlemen  we Cubans do not surrender   Diaz Canel said on Saturday  adding the situation meant  we have two absolute priorities  the preparation of our defense and the economic battle at the same time  According to western diplomats and businessmen  Cuba has failed to pay suppliers on time for a number of years  piling up around  1 5 billion in short term debt Trade fell around 25 percent from 2013 through 2017 and declined again last year  according to the government In addition to the Venezuelan crisis  the advent of a far right government in Brazil led last year to the scrapping of a doctors for cash deal valued at an annual  300 million   Reporting by Marc Frank  additional reporting by Nelson Acosta  editing by Grant McCool  

JERUSALEM   When will the  deal of the century   as President Trump has called his forthcoming plan for Israeli Palestinian peace  finally be unveiled Certainly not before April 9  when Israel holds its next election  But how soon after   In less than 20 years   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo noncommittally told a congressional committee recently In any case  American peace plans are nothing new  Does anyone recall  for instance  the Rogers Plans  named after Secretary of State William P  Rogers  who served under President Richard Nixon 50 years ago  When the second of his plans was discussed in the Knesset in 1970  one Israeli legislator confidently projected that  it won t be long   a year  a year and a half  two at most   before the thing called  the held territories  is no more  and the Israel Defense Force pulls back into Israel s borders  Needless to say  that  thing  is far from being  no more   While the Rogers Plans have since all but disappeared from memory  erased by a string of plans put forward by successive American presidents  reality in the occupied Palestinian territories didn t simply halt  Israel s occupation has deepened and evolved  Gaza has become the world s largest open air prison  bombed into submission every few years  East Jerusalem was formally annexed by Israel  the West Bank has become an archipelago of Palestinian Bantustans  surrounded by settlements  walls and checkpoints  subject to a mix of state and settler violence  Yet Israel s real feat has not only been achieving all of this but doing so with impunity  triggering minimal consequences from the rest of the world  all the while somehow holding on to its valuable public relations label as a  vibrant democracy  The history of these past 50 years is what we should recognize as the real deal  the one that is already in effect  the deal of the half century  In this deal  as long as Israel advances its occupation enterprise while applying a measure of brutality just below the level that would prompt international outrage  it is allowed to carry on  while still enjoying various international perks justified by grand  but obviously hollow  commitments to   as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently put it   the  shared values of liberty and democracy  ImageElectoral campaign posters bearing the portraits of Israel s prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  left

subjects denied that same right  Israeli settlers in the West Bank don t even need to drive to a polling station inside Israel to vote on their Palestinian neighbors  fate  Even settlers in the heart of Hebron can vote right there  with 285 registered voters  out of a total population of about 1 000 settlers   surrounded by some 200 000 Palestinian nonvoters  Or as Israel calls it   democracy

since the occupation began  and perhaps the one in which Palestinian lives are least discussed   except when tallying up their deaths and celebrating their destruction  Earlier this year  Gen  Benny Gantz  now leader of the new  centrist  party that poses the strongest challenge to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  published a video highlighting how many Palestinian  terrorists  were killed in Gaza in the summer of 2014  when Mr  Gantz was the Army s chief of staff   According to research carried out by the Israeli nonprofit B Tselem  most of those killed by the Israeli army that summer were civilians  among them more than 500 children   For his part  Mr  Netanyahu has promised that if he remains in office the occupation will continue   I will not divide Jerusalem  I will not evacuate any community and I will make sure we control the territory west of Jordan   he said in an interview over the weekend Instead of the rights and freedom of Palestinians  the campaign season has focused on Mr  Netanyahu s likely indictment on corruption charges  But does it really matter to the Palestinian family whose son will be killed with impunity or whose home will be bulldozed if the prime minister responsible for these policies is corrupt or squeaky clean At some point after April 9  we may finally get to see what  deal  the Trump administration has in mind  In fact  one cannot help wondering if it isn t already taking shape before our very eyes  Last May  the Trump administration moved the United States  embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  a few months later  it cut off aid to Palestinians and the United Nations agency serving Palestinian refugees  most recently  it extended recognition of Israel s sovereignty in the Golan Heights  a move celebrated by one Israeli official as a sign of things to come with regards to the future of the West Bank It s hard to see how the  deal of the century  will be anything other than an extension of the deal of the half century  David M  Friedman  the Trump administration s ambassador to Israel  more or less admitted this in an interview with The Washington Examiner  when he said that the administration would  like to see Palestinian autonomy improve significantly  as long as it doesn t come at the risk of Israeli security   But Palestinians deserve full freedom  not an American marketed improved autonomy  which suggests nothing more than prolonging Israel s occupation  That means a future based on neither justice nor on international law  but on more control  oppression and state violence Unless the international community takes the deal of the half century off the table  making Israel finally choose between further oppression of Palestinians and facing real consequences  the occupation will continue  The Trump administration  clearly  isn t up to this task  But the United Nations  including the Security Council  key member states of the European Union   Israel s largest trading partner   and international public opinion all have ample leverage  And Americans who sincerely believe in human rights and democracy  not just as empty slogans or bargaining chips but as genuine demands  need not wait until 2020 to flex their political power Together with the systemic overtaking of lands and the imposition of restrictions on freedom of movement  the denial of political rights was one of the cornerstones of apartheid South Africa  That country  too  considered itself a democracy Many Israelis will consider April 9 a celebration of democracy  It s not  This Election Day should be nothing more than a painful reminder of a deeply undemocratic reality  one that the Trump administration seems pleased to perpetuate   and which the rest of the international community will continue to allow until it finally stops looking the other way  We  the nearly 14 million human beings living on this land  need a future that is worth fighting for  one based on the common humanity of

NEW DELHI   The Indian government may have to make a series of major changes at the top of the nation s civil service if Prime Minister Narendra Modi is re elected to a second term in May  according to multiple sources in the administration At least eight senior bureaucrats in the prime minister s office have either sought a transfer to other departments or plan to take premature retirement  three government officials said  The officials  from the prime minister s office  the home  interior  ministry and the foreign ministry  declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject Two of them said they too are keen to be transferred to state capitals or to other jobs  They said officials in several ministries were trying to move  but did not have a number There are about 25 senior civil servants working in the prime minister s office  which under Modi has become the single most powerful department in government The three officials said the reasons for wanting out are almost all the same  Many top bureaucrats complained about two aspects of the Modi administration   their inability to influence government policy as it is largely controlled and set by the prime minister and a small group of ministers and advisers  and the demanding work schedule they face  The sense of partnership is missing  Modi and his ministers do not have an organic relationship with the bureaucrats   said the civil servant in the home ministry  Sanjay Mayukh  a spokesman for Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   declined to comment on the grounds that governance issues were managed directly by ministers A spokesman in the prime minister s office did not return phone calls seeking comment To be sure  some other major governments around the world often face a series of departures and changes  especially when a first term morphs into a second term  Also  just because an official talks about quitting doesn t mean they will  But in India  officials in the prime minister s office are hand picked for loyalty and tend to stay if the administration is re elected  Modi s BJP led alliance is tipped to win a slim majority in the April May general election  pollsters say  Senior bureaucrats said Modi s top down approach  and his orders to work on public holidays  to demand they submit details of their assets  and to clean their own workplaces at the start of a five year cleanliness campaign in 2014  has widened the gap between the civil servants and the nation s leader Amit Shah  a close aide of Modi and the head of the BJP  in a closed door meeting attended by two ministers in February said bureaucrats continued to suffer from  communist romanticism   a reference to the alleged influence of the left leaning Congress opposition party on the bureaucrats  The ministers  who spoke to Reuters  declined to be identified DISCONNECT WITH RULING PARTYFor some of the 5 000 or so mandarins who run the Indian government  its state owned entities  as well as administration at state government level  Modi s style of leadership has been a jolt  Many of these top officials have received a Western style education at India s elite universities or schools overseas and are uncomfortable with the ruling party s right wing Hindu nationalism and Modi s rough hewn approach to governance While getting into the Indian Administrative Service  IAS   is incredibly hard   only 1 out of about 4 500 who took the civil service exam got selected in 2018   traditionally once someone got in they had a job for life with few risks of ever getting fired  An IAS job   one of the most sought after in India   bestows huge power as well as cheap housing  a car with a driver and other perks  leave for government paid foreign study  and often the chance for plum positions in business or government consultative work after retirement  There is also a handsome pension But such conditions can also breed complacency and a lack of  can do  behavior  according to Indian politicians and civil servants  They say there are plenty of Sir Humphreys in New Delhi  referring to a character in the British TV comedy series  Yes Minister  about how top officials in Whitehall stall government policies they don t agree with  In particular  there is deep resentment in the top echelons of the Indian civil service over the interference in government by the Rashtriya Swayemsevak Sangh  RSS   the Hindu right wing umbrella group of which the BJP is a part  these officials said  RSS functionaries have had a major role in successfully lobbying for big changes at the Reserve Bank of India  for example  leading to last December s resignation of its governor and his replacement with an official who is considered more loyal to Modi  officials said  TECHNOCRATS  NOT GENERALISTSRSS figures also criticize Modi for not having enough professionally trained experts in place to implement some of his more controversial policies  The country needs a professional administration for economic development and can t depend on generalists   said Ashwani Mahajan  co convenor of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch  SJM   the economic wing of the RSS that has campaigned against some bureaucrats  Last year  Modi proposed bringing in at least ten professionals from the private sector into the civil service at the joint secretary level  but the plan has still to be implemented  and is facing strong resistance from civil servants  Joint Secretaries are two rungs below full Secretaries  the top civil servant in a ministry A senior finance ministry official said major policy decisions including demonetization  Modi s decision to wipe out high denomination bank notes without warning in 2016 and to hastily launch a goods and services tax that hit millions of small businesses and jobs  were examples of political decisions that didn t get enough airing among officials before being implemented  Both are thought to have hurt jobs growth  economists say  There is a wider concern in the civil service about India being ruled by a Hindu nationalist party that some see destroying the country s previous tolerant and secular nature But the hours are as much of a concern to some  I am looking out for other opportunities and have even requested for a transfer because it is almost impossible to work for 12 13 hours every day  even during weekends   said a senior official working with Modi since 2014   Reporting by Manoj Kumar  Rupam Jain   Editing by Martin Howell and Raju Gopalakrishnan  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s administration stepped up pressure on the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on Tuesday  raising the likelihood that he might fire more senior officials as the agency struggles with a surge of immigrants on the U S  Mexico border Two days after Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced her departure  a senior administration official said others at DHS were not doing enough to enact Trump s promised immigration crackdown  a top priority for him since he announced his candidacy for the White House four years ago DHS acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady offered her resignation to Trump  effective Wednesday  after a 28 year career at the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security  Nielsen said in a tweet late on Tuesday Several other DHS officials could be forced out soon  said an official familiar with the matter Among them were the department s general counsel  John Mitnick  and U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  Director Francis Cissna  the source said  A DHS spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the officials  expected tenure Trump denied that he was overhauling DHS and said his administration was fighting  bad laws  on immigration and a court system that  never ever rules for us    a frequent refrain of his as a succession of policies to curb entry to the United States has been met with legal challenges by civil rights advocates  Nobody ever said I was cleaning house   Trump told reporters at the White House Nielsen announced her resignation on Sunday after a meeting with Trump in which the two disagreed on the best way to handle border security  The personnel changes could further destabilize the U S  domestic security agency as it tries to stem rising numbers of immigrants arriving at the border  many of them families fleeing violence and poverty in Central America  DHS said it arrested or denied entry to more than 103 000 people along the border last month  more than double the March 2018 figure  The U S  Secret Service said on Monday that its chief  Randolph  Tex  Alles  would depart his job next month  Trump last Friday withdrew the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to serve as director of U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement Several top DHS jobs are either vacant or filled on an acting basis  including positions responsible for disaster response  immigration enforcement  finance  policy  and science and technology  It s not good to have all these people performing in an acting position   said Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson  a Republican FRUSTRATIONSTrump has grown increasingly frustrated as DHS officials have told him that the dramatic immigration changes they seek are not possible under current law and would require the cooperation of Congress  several sources say Trump repeatedly pressed Nielsen over recent weeks to bring back last year s controversial policy of separating migrant children from their parents  one source said  Trump abandoned that policy last year in the face of widespread public outrage  and it was subsequently struck down in court Trump denied on Tuesday that he was reviving the separation policy  Johnson said that policy would have  no support  in Congress A senior administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said one option may be to give migrant families a choice of staying in long term detention together while they await a court hearing or splitting up  an idea known as  binary choice   The administration may also move to detain migrant children for longer than the 20 day maximum set by a court ruling  to spur a legal challenge that could overturn that limit  the official said  The official said DHS has been too slow in drafting new rules that would tighten immigration The official singled out USCIS  saying it had not moved quickly enough to tighten H 1B visas for skilled workers and has granted an  astronomical  number of asylum claims Asylum officers found that applicants had a  credible fear  of persecution in their home countries in 78 percent of the cases they decided between October and February  according to USCIS data The White House could anger allies in Congress if it fires USCIS head Cissna  who previously worked with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said on Twitter that Cissna was  doing what voters asked4 w PresTrump election  Any move to fire Cissna or other DHS leaders would likely complicate the department s leadership woes U S  Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan is due to take Nielsen s place on a temporary basis  starting on Wednesday  leaving DHS without a permanent leader on the front lines of the border crisis DHS s acting deputy secretary Grady was legally supposed to take over after Nielsen s departure  so Grady s resignation on Tuesday cleared the way for McAleenan to take the agency s reins Trump has interviewed several candidates for the top job over the past week and a half  including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach  former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli  and former acting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement head Thomas Homan  All three have expressed hard line views on illegal immigration  and could have difficulty winning confirmation in the U S  Senate  which Trump s Republicans control by a 53 47 margin Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Congress needed to set aside its differences to overhaul immigration laws  which it has repeatedly failed to do over the past 15 years   Reporting by Andy Sullivan and Roberta Rampton  additional reporting by Makini Brice  Jeff Mason  Yeganeh Torbati  Susan Cornwell and Doina Chiacu

WASHINGTON   President Trump moved to clear out the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security on Monday  a day after  forcing the resignation of its secretary  Kirstjen Nielsen  as he accelerated a purge of the nation s immigration and security leadership The White House announced the departure of Randolph D  Alles  the director of the Secret Service  who had fallen out of favor with the president even before a security breach at his Mar a Lago club that the agency effectively blamed on Mr  Trump s employees Government officials  who asked not to be identified discussing personnel changes before they were announced  said at least two to four more high ranking figures affiliated with Ms  Nielsen were expected to leave soon  too  hollowing out the top echelon of the department managing border security  presidential safety  counterterrorism  natural disasters  customs and other matters The wave of departures of officials originally appointed by Mr  Trump underscored his growing frustration with his own administration s handling of immigration and other security issues  In recent days  Mr  Trump has threatened to close the southwestern border altogether only to back off and give Mexico a one year notice in the face of warnings about deep economic damage from such a move The shake up  coming more than two years into Mr  Trump s term  indicated that he is still searching for a team that will fulfill his desire for an even tougher approach to immigration  It also signaled the enduring influence of Stephen Miller  the president s hard line senior adviser who has complained about recalcitrant homeland security officials Some of the president s allies complained that he was going too far  taking out subordinates who actually share his goals on immigration at the prodding of White House aides hunting for scapegoats for the failure to control the border as he has promised to do  Without names  there s people in the White House that speak about immigration   Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  said in an interview   They haven t accomplished a whole lot  so they need to find some other way to make themselves look important  The latest shuffle came just a day after Mr  Trump pushed out Ms  Nielsen for not doing enough in his view to secure the border and three days after Ronald D  Vitiello  the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  was told to step aside so the administration could go in a  tougher direction   as Mr  Trump put it Officials said they expect to see the departures of L  Francis Cissna  the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  Kathy Nuebel Kovarik  one of his top deputies  and John Mitnick  the department s general counsel and a senior member of Ms  Nielsen s leadership team  All of them were said to be viewed by Mr  Miller as obstacles to implementing the president s policies The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other The White House is also pressing for the resignation of Claire Grady  the acting deputy secretary  who under law would normally fill in for Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Trump has already announced that he will install Kevin K  McAleenan  the Customs and Border Protection commissioner  as Ms  Nielsen s acting replacement  which he cannot do if Ms  Grady remains in place The latest moves appeared to be a housecleaning of officials associated with John F  Kelly  the president s former chief of staff and his first homeland security secretary  who was pushed out at the end of last year after months of tension with Mr  Trump Mr  Alles  a retired Marine major general who served with Mr  Kelly in the military and goes by Tex  was the first person from outside the Secret Service to head the agency in more than a century and some administration officials said he had a hard time fitting in At Mr  Trump s instruction  Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  told Mr  Alles at least 10 days ago to expect a transition after two years in office and to develop an exit plan  according to officials familiar with the discussions Mr  Trump  who talks with members of his own Secret Service detail  had soured on Mr  Alles a while ago  convinced that as an outsider he was not popular among the agents  officials said  The president even made fun of the director s looks  calling him Dumbo because of his ears  But a Secret Service ally of Mr  Alles disputed the notion that he did not fit in  saying that the director was well liked among the work force Mr  Alles was told to develop an exit plan before the arrest of a Chinese woman carrying a malware laced device at Mar a Lago  exposing holes in the security of the private club  The Secret Service was so disturbed that it issued a statement faulting the club s staff for not tracking its guests closely enough Some Secret Service officials said on Monday that they suspected that Mr  Alles s departure was accelerated in part because of the episode The White House made no mention of that in its statement announcing Mr  Alles s departure issued shortly after it was reported by CNN Mr  Alles  has done a great job at the agency over the last two years  and the president is thankful for his over 40 years of service to the country   Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  said in the statement She said he would be replaced in May by James M  Murray  a career Secret Service official who oversees protective operations Mr  Alles was the focus of an early fight between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kelly in the first months of the administration  Mr  Kelly threatened to resign as homeland security secretary if Mr  Alles was not made Secret Service director  according to former administration officials ImageRandolph D  Alles  the director of the Secret Service  received instructions 10 days ago to come up with an exit plan and was expected to leave on his own timeline CreditDavid Goldman Associated PressIn an email message to his work force on Monday  Mr  Alles confirmed that his departure was ordered by the president last month  No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my  firing    he wrote   I assure you that this is not the case  and in fact was told weeks ago by the administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security  The president has directed an orderly transition in leadership for this agency and I intend to abide by that direction   he added   It is my sincere regret that I was not able to address the work force prior to this announcement  Regardless of when the decision was made  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said Mr  Alles should testify before Congress about the Mar a Lago breach  The public and Congress need to know the extent to which adversarial governments   like China   and their agents are attempting to gain access to  or conduct electronic surveillance on  conversations or other information regarding national security at President Trump s properties   he said Not all of Mr  Trump s allies were happy with the moves  There s no doubt that Cissna has proved his competence  in a lot of things he s doing   things that the president is for   Mr  Grassley said  Referring to Mr  Cissna and Ms  Kovarik  both of whom once worked on his staff  Mr  Grassley said   If he gets rid of these two  it s self defeating because I don t know anyone else in the department or at least in immigration  who could do better One administration official said Mr  Cissna angered Mr  Miller by refusing to make changes to asylum policy without congressional approval  Under current law  unauthorized immigrants facing expedited removal may seek asylum before an immigration judge if found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture As for Ms  Nielsen  she expressed no unhappiness about her departure on Monday and thanked Mr  Trump  for the tremendous opportunity  to serve her country and the employees of her department for their efforts to secure the nation The latest departures  along with previous vacancies  will leave the Department of Homeland Security without a permanent secretary  deputy secretary  two under secretaries  Secret Service director  Federal Emergency Management Agency director  ICE director  general counsel  citizenship and immigration services director  inspector general  chief financial officer  chief privacy officer and  once Mr  McAleenan moves  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  The purge of senior leadership at the Department of Homeland Security is unprecedented and a threat to our national security   said Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California Senator Ron Johnson  Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  complained about  congressional dysfunction  in addressing border security  but added   I am concerned with a growing leadership void within the department tasked with addressing some of the most significant problems facing the nation   

For 340 days  Scott Kelly circled the Earth aboard the International Space Station  gathering data about himself He drew blood from his arms  He saved his urine  He played computer games to test his memory and reaction speed  He measured the shape of his eyes Two hundred and forty miles below  Mr  Kelly s twin brother  Mark  who also served as an astronaut  carried out identical tests  Now  a comparison of these two men has provided a unique opportunity to learn what happens to the human body in space   down to the molecular level  On Thursday  just over three years after Mr  Kelly  55

brothers  NASA hoped to better understand the changes that Scott Kelly experienced during his mission  The fact that they re twins really narrows down the alternatives   said Susan Bailey  a cancer biologist at Colorado State University and a co author of the new study   We can say that  as best as we can tell  these changes are due to spaceflight  ImageMr  Kelly administering a flu shot to himself in September 2015  part of the Twins Study CreditJSC NASATen research teams designed experiments for the twins  they are likely to bring an avalanche of research  But to Mr  Kelly  the experience didn t feel very different from previous missions  Drawing his own blood in zero gravity  for example  was a familiar routine   I ve had a couple spills in my time   Mr  Kelly said   You just reach out and grab the blobs of blood  By many measures  the scientists eventually found  Mr  Kelly changed about as much as astronauts who stayed on the space station for only six months  Eventually the pace of biological change slowed  suggesting that perhaps the human body reaches a new equilibrium in space But Mr  Kelly s body was also altered in some surprising ways Scott Kelly Spent a Year Taking Photos in Space  They re Beautiful In orbit aboard the International Space Station  the astronaut wasn t just gathering data for NASA s Twins Study  He also produced some  well  stellar images April 12  2019Dr  Bailey studied special sections of his DNA called telomeres  which sit at the end of chromosomes  protecting them from deterioration  As people age  their telomeres tend to get shorter  Stress   such as radiation or pollution   may hasten aging by fraying telomeres even faster than usual Strangely  the average length of Mr  Kelly s telomeres increased in space  rather than decreasing  as if his cells were becoming more youthful  Regular exercise and a healthy diet might be part of the reason  But going to space also might have awakened a quiet population of stem cells in Mr  Kelly s body  Dr  Bailey said  His cells might not have grown longer telomeres  in other words  Instead  perhaps his body manufactured a new supply of young cells with longer telomeres Activated genesGoing to space also appeared to trigger a genetic shift in Mr  Kelly  Thousands of genes that were once quiet increased their activity   genes that remained quiet in Mark Kelly s body back on Earth  The longer Scott Kelly stayed aloft  the greater the number of genes becoming active Some of the awakened genes are known to encode proteins that help fix damaged DNA  That would make sense  given that radiation levels in the International Space Station are higher than on Earth  Christopher Mason  a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York  estimated that Mr  Kelly was exposed to 48 times more radiation than the average exposure on Earth over the course of a year  His cells might have been busy repairing radiation injury ImageMr  Kelly on a spacewalk in December 2015 CreditNASA  via Associated PressA number of other activated genes  however  play roles in the immune system  What exactly triggers those changes isn t clear  It may be the overall stress of life in the space station provokes an immune response  But recent studies have also shown that latent viruses can awaken in astronauts  Or maybe it s that the immune system  which never evolved for survival in space  simply gets confused  Is it good or bad  We just know it s more   Dr  Mason  a co author of the new study  said of the immune activity   To know for sure  we d need more astronauts  Mr  Kelly s return to Earth on March 1  2016  proved to be one of the biggest moments   biologically speaking   of the whole mission  His body showed signs of intense stress  and his immune system was in high gear  Michael Snyder  a geneticist at Stanford University and co author of the research  cautioned that this response might not be typical   Maybe he got a viral infection   he speculated   This is why you want to see it in more people  Despite that shock  Mr  Kelly s body mostly returned to preflight condition  Some species of bacteria that thrived in his gut while he was in space  for example  became rare again on his landing The strange lengthening of Mr  Kelly s telomeres disappeared after less than 48 hours on Earth  In fact  Dr  Bailey and her colleagues started finding many cells with telomeres that were shorter than before Mr  Kelly went to space  People have asked me   Well  is going to space the fountain of youth    said Dr  Bailey   I don t think so  If it is  you re going to have to stay up there forever   Fighting through quicksand Some aspects of Mr  Kelly s biology didn t return to the preflight norm Six months after he came back to Earth  8 7 percent of his genes were still behaving in an altered way  Judging from the small size of this shift  Dr  Snyder described the change as modest The researchers also found that Mr  Kelly didn t do as well on his return on cognitive exams   He got slower and less accurate on virtually all of the tests   said Dr  Mathias Basner  a cognitive scientist at the University of Pennsylvania It s possible that some biological change was to blame  But Dr  Basner noted that Mr  Kelly also faced a lot of demands back on Earth  including a busy schedule of television interviews and public speaking And on an unconscious level  he may no longer have been pushing himself   I mean  he basically retired the moment he hit the ground  and so perhaps he just wasn t as motivated any longer   Dr  Basner said ImageRegular exercise and healthy diet  zero gravity M M s notwithstanding  might partly explain how Mr  Kelly s cellular telomeres lengthened  He lost 15 pounds on the space station CreditJSC NASAIn his 2017 memoir   Endurance   Mr  Kelly describes struggling after his return with pain  sleeping troubles and other woes  One night he felt as if he was  fighting through quicksand   he wrote In an interview  Mr  Kelly speculated those difficulties might be to blame for his cognitive scores   It s hard to concentrate when you re not feeling well   he said Another enduring change  scientists found  was a collection of genetic mutations that Mr  Kelly gained in space   We see them appear in flight  and then they persisted afterward   Dr  Mason said Sometimes radiation triggers a type of mutation that makes cells prone to gain still more mutations as they divide  Eventually  the cells may start growing uncontrollably    taking steps on the road to cancer   Dr  Bailey said Peter Campbell  a cancer biologist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Britain who was not involved in the new study  said scientists can t predict what the extra mutations will mean for Mr  Kelly s health   It is hard to be sure  but I believe those sorts of numbers would be associated with a moderate increase in cancer risk   he said These two lingering changes   in Mr  Kelly s cognition and DNA   left a number of experts concerned about the risks of a trip to Mars  which could take a year Gary Strangman  a psychologist at Harvard Medical School  said that a decrease in speed and accuracy  could potentially have serious consequences on long duration missions  After a grueling journey to the red planet  astronauts would probably need to take quick  accurate actions as they landed  If you had a period of slower cognitive processing speed and difficulty with balance and eye head coordination  those behaviors would be at risk   said Rachael Seidler  a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Florida A heavy load of genetic mutations would not present immediate dangers to astronauts on their missions  but it might raise their lifelong risks of cancer  Dr  Mason estimated that a mission to Mars would expose an astronaut to eight times more radiation than Mr  Kelly experienced  Every effort will need to be made to limit exposure to astronauts during periods of prolonged space travel   said Charles Swanton  a cancer biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in Britain who was not involved in the new study Dr  Topol  of the Scripps institute  found the implications of Mr  Kelly s experience to be grim  The main conclusion I got from this paper  based on all the objective data  is why would anybody want to go to Mars or be in space   he said   Because this is really scary  Jerry Shay  a cell biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center  was much more optimistic  He held out hope for countermeasures that would protect astronauts Already he and his colleagues  for example  are testing drugs to trigger cells to fix DNA damaged by radiation   I think all these problems are solvable   Dr  Shay said NASA has begun sifting through all these results to help plan the next round of missions to the International Space Station  It won t be a replication of what you saw in the Twins Study   said Jennifer Fogarty  the chief scientist at NASA s Human Research Program  We re going to learn from that  and we re going to be smarter about the questions we ask  There s a lot of fascinating stuff to go measure  It s just not clear what it means  Dr  Bailey  for her part  plans to keep on studying Mr  Kelly s baffling telomeres  Solving that mystery might shed light on ordinary aging and the diseases it brings  When we figure out the how and why of that  it s going to be important for astronauts as well as for us mere Earthlings   she said ImageMr  Kelly on a helicopter in Kazakhstan after returning from the space station in March 2011

WASHINGTON   The Latest on the departure of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  all times local  12 45 p m Kirstjen  KEER  sten  Nielsen says she continues to support President Donald Trump s goal of securing the U S  Mexico border in her first public remarks since her surprise resignation as Homeland Security secretary Nielsen told reporters gathered outside her Alexandria  Virginia  home on Monday that she will keep supporting  all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis  on the border Nielsen thanks the Republican president for  the tremendous opportunity to serve this country   She says she s spent the last 24 hours talking to administration officials and members of Congress to ensure a smooth transition and intends to continue  to support  the department  from the outside  Nielsen resigned Sunday amid Trump s growing frustration and bitterness over a spike in Central American migrants crossing the border Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan has taken over as department head    12 55 a m Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has resigned amid President Donald Trump s growing frustration and bitterness over the number of Central American families crossing the southern border Trump announced on Sunday in a tweet that U S  Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would be taking over as acting head of the department  McAleenan is a longtime border official who is well respected by members of Congress and within the administration  The decision to name a top immigration officer to the post reflects Trump s priority for the sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept  11 attacks Though Trump aides were eyeing a staff shake up at Homeland Security and had already withdrawn the nomination for another key immigration post  the development Sunday was unexpected  

Time finally ran out for Kirstjen Nielsen  President Trump s beleaguered secretary of homeland security The terms of Ms  Nielsen s departure are unclear  She met with the president on Sunday evening to discuss continuing problems at the southern border  At the conclusion of the meeting  Mr  Trump announced on Twitter that Ms  Nielsen  will be leaving her position  and he thanked her for her service  implying he had asked her to step down  Ms  Nielsen issued a formal letter of resignation  saying it was the  right time for me to step aside   Considering the long simmering tensions between the president and Ms  Nielsen  the most surprising thing about her departure may be that it didn t happen months ago She was said to have become increasingly insecure in her job in recent weeks  as Mr  Trump repeatedly railed about the chaos at the border and pushed for dramatic action  including reinstating his policy of separating migrant families at the border and closing legal ports of entry  The president grew impatient with Ms  Nielsen s insistence that federal law and international obligations limited her actions  In recent days  including in the hours immediately after the secretary s resignation  he repeatedly fumed that  our country is full   It s no secret that Mr  Trump had a problem with Ms  Nielsen  whom he considered  weak  on matters of border security  The president and Stephen Miller  his hard line immigration adviser  have long grumbled privately about the secretary s insufficiently brutal approach to the surge in migrant families across the border  Last May  stories surfaced about Mr  Trump berating her in front of the entire cabinet for failing to stop the crossings  In her letter released on Sunday  Ms  Nielsen noted   For more than two years of service beginning during the Presidential Transition  I have worked tirelessly to advance the goals and missions of the Department  This is hardly something to brag about  Whatever the secretary s personal views  and no matter how impossible her job  she was the face of some of the administration s most poorly conceived and gratuitously callous policies  At best  she was complicit and  yes  rather weak Ms  Nielsen s response to her boss s displeasure and abuse was often both morally anemic and strategically incoherent  Last summer  as Republicans and Democrats   and much of the American public   protested the administration s practice of tearing migrant children from their parents at the border  Ms  Nielsen rushed to defend the policy  Scratch that  She insisted  repeatedly and bizarrely  that the administration had no such policy  even as her agency was enforcing and justifying it   We do not have a policy of separating families at the border   she said on Twitter in June   Period   She repeated as much to Congress as recently as March  But the grim repercussions of this nonpolicy are still being felt  Just on Friday  in a court filing  federal officials said it could take up to two years to identify possibly thousands of migrant children taken from their families beginning in July 2017 Not that immigration was the only issue on which Ms  Nielsen floundered  On the critical question of Russia s meddling in the 2016 elections  she was even less lucid  At times  she seemed to support the intelligence community s findings that the Kremlin had been up to no good  Other times  she supported the view that Russia had not favored Mr  Trump in the election  Her every utterance seemed intended to obfuscate rather than to clarify Ms  Nielsen s departure is part of a broader purging in her department  Two days before meeting with the secretary  the president withdrew his nomination for the next head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency  saying that he wanted to go in a  tougher direction   On Monday  the White House confirmed that Randolph Alles  the head of the Secret Service  was on his way out as well  The general counsel for Homeland Security  John Mitnick  and the head of Citizenship and Immigration Services  L  Francis Cissna  are expected to soon follow  For now  Ms  Nielsen s acting replacement will be Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  This leaves Homeland Security without a top official at either of its critical immigration agencies  It comes as the swell of migrant families across the border pushes the system toward collapse  Possible successors being discussed include Rick Perry  the secretary of energy  and Ken Cuccinelli  the former attorney general of Virginia Whoever takes Ms  Nielsen s place  it seems likely that greater influence will be exerted by Mr  Miller  who inspires and reinforces Mr  Trump s harshest impulses on immigrants and immigration  As the president becomes increasingly agitated about the border situation  Mr  Miller is said to be aggressively pushing to stock the administration with like minded hard liners  In addition to being a longtime critic of Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Miller is thought to have played a role in the withdrawal of the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead ICE and the impending departure of Mr  Cissna  The House speaker  Nancy Pelosi  a Democrat  said of Ms  Nielsen s departure   It is deeply alarming that the Trump administration official who put children in cages is reportedly resigning because she is not extreme enough for the White House s liking  The plan is for Ms  Nielsen to continue through Wednesday to help with an  orderly transition    I share the president s goal of securing the border   she said Monday morning   I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border  If Ms  Nielsen is inclined to perform one last act of public service  she should come clean about the costs of the policies she enforced over the past year and a half  not only to the desperate migrants seeking a better life in the United States  but also to the thousands of employees of her department charged with carrying out an inhumane and ineffective agenda  RelatedKirstjen Nielsen Resigns as Trump s Homeland Security SecretaryApril 7  2019Kevin McAleenan  Top U S  Border Enforcement

UNITED NATIONS   Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday urged the United Nations to revoke the credentials of Venezuela s ambassador to the world body  portraying him as a loyalist to the country s disputed president  Nicolás Maduro  and to a government that has allowed crime  violence and starvation to rise In a 20 minute speech to the United Nations Security Council  Mr  Pence called for a formal recognition of Juan Guaidó as the rightful leader of Venezuela  which he called  a failed state   and as history teaches  failed states know no boundaries  Mr  Pence turned to the Venezuelan ambassador  Samuel Moncada Acosta  telling him   You shouldn t be here   You should return to Venezuela and tell Nicolás Maduro that his time is up   Mr  Pence said   It s time for him to go  The Council meeting addressed the situation in Venezuela  which officials and experts are increasingly describing as a humanitarian crisis that has led about 3 5 million citizens to flee the country Instead of offering temporary asylum to Venezuelans  the Trump administration has called for Mr  Maduro s ouster to relieve a country rattled by skyrocketing inflation  widespread blackouts and a growing public health crisis  The United States  as a replacement  is forcefully supporting Mr  Guaidó  the National Assembly politician whom the administration recognizes as the rightful interim president On Wednesday  Mr  Pence also accused China and Russia of meddling in efforts to remove Mr  Maduro  While  Russia and China continue to obstruct at the Security Council   Mr  Pence said   rogue states like Iran and Cuba are doing all they can to prop up the Maduro regime  Global rivalries have hindered the ability of the United Nations to address the crisis  despite intensifying warnings that the situation is deteriorating In February  the United States and Russia introduced dueling resolutions on Venezuela at the Security Council  The American proposal called for free and fair elections  and the Russian plan backed Mr  Maduro s government  Both failed Two weeks ago  President Trump warned Russia to  get out of  Venezuela after two of Moscow s military planes landed in Caracas  the Venezuelan capital  to unload supplies and military personnel  But Mr  Trump has done little else to publicly engage as the crisis continues That role has fallen to Mr  Pence  But on Wednesday  he did not give a firm answer when asked by a reporter where the United States would draw a line on Russia s involvement  He also did not give a timeline when asked if the possibility of American military intervention  an option long played up by administration officials  was drawing closer as conditions in Venezuela worsened Instead  the Trump administration has tried to choke off Mr  Maduro s economic resources  Last week  it announced a round of sanctions targeting oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba  the latest in a string of initiatives meant to curb Caracas s ability to do business  Visas have been revoked in recent weeks for hundreds of Mr  Maduro s associates In briefings held before Mr  Pence arrived to speak  United Nations officials warned of a situation that has only grown more dire as unrest continues and said that offering relief to Venezuelan citizens should not be a political issue Mark Lowcock  an under secretary for humanitarian affairs  told the Security Council that a recent draft overview of the situation by the United Nations indicated that around 1 9 million people require nutritional assistance because of worsening food availability  including 1 3 million children under 5  Additionally  Mr  Lowcock said  tuberculosis  diphtheria  measles  malaria and other preventable diseases have resurfaced in Venezuela Food shortages also remain a main factor in driving people out of the country  Surveys show that 80 percent of Venezuelan households struggle with finding enough food  United Nations officials said  In Venezuela  there is a need to separate political and humanitarian objectives   Mr  Lowcock said   Humanitarian assistance must be delivered on the basis of need alone  The number of people expected to leave Venezuela may surpass five million by the year s end  said Eduardo Stein  a special United Nations envoy for Venezuelan refugees and migrants Citing a worsening public health crisis aggravated by constant blackouts  Kathleen Page  a doctor and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine  urged the Security Council to declare a humanitarian crisis formally and address it in a  neutral  independent and impartial  way On Tuesday  Mr  Maduro said he had met with members of the Red Cross to finalize plans for the arrival of aid to Venezuela  His government and the opposition reached a deal to organize a large scale relief effort late last month  We reiterated our disposition to establish cooperation mechanisms for international aid and assistance   Mr  Maduro wrote Tuesday on Twitter The United States still does not have a permanent representative to the United Nations  a fact that reporters pointed out to Mr  Pence as he fielded questions over whether the Security Council would support his demand to revoke the Venezuelan ambassador s credentials Mr  Pence said he felt that  momentum is on the side of freedom   

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s new acting chief of Homeland Security will be under pressure to implement legally dubious solutions to an influx of migrants at the U S  Mexico border   policies that his predecessor either could not  or would not  deliver  Kevin McAleenan  presently commissioner of U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP   will be the fourth person to helm the agency under Trump  He takes over as U S  border officials estimated that 100 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in March  the highest level in a decade The president  who made immigration a key campaign theme  has grown increasingly frustrated with his officials  even as they have implemented aggressive policies to limit immigration Immigration experts say Trump lately has called for policies that would violate U S  laws  international agreements and court settlements or require U S  Congress to pass major legislation On Friday  he called for Congress to  get rid of the whole asylum system  and get rid of immigration judges  and criticized a long standing federal court decree mandating certain standards of care for migrant children A congressional official familiar with the matter said some in Congress believe Trump forced out Kirstjen Nielsen  who resigned as secretary on Sunday  in part because she was trying to obey laws on treatment of refugees  granting of amnesty and separation of families A source close to Nielsen said Trump was convinced to oust her by his senior aide Stephen Miller  an immigration hardliner Nielsen did not respond to a request for comment It was not immediately clear what strategies McAleenan could implement to achieve Trump s objective of limiting migrant crossings at the southern border  especially as they are expected to reach their yearly peak in the coming months  experts said A U S  judge on Monday halted the administration s policy of sending some asylum seekers back across the border to wait out their cases in Mexico  a policy it said last week it planned to expand  The White House did not respond to a request for comment  So much of what the president put out there isn t really legally feasible   said Sarah Pierce  an immigration policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute  a non partisan think tank in Washington   I  like many  and maybe Nielsen herself are kind of puzzled as to what could happen  A CBP spokesman declined to comment and directed questions to the White House McAleenan follows Nielsen and Elaine Duke  who led the DHS on an acting basis after John Kelly  Trump s first DHS secretary  became White House chief of staff in 2017  Trump took office in January that year  ZERO TOLERANCE Nielsen oversaw a  zero tolerance  prosecution policy that led to the separation of thousands of parents and children  and launched a policy to return asylum seekers to Mexico until their claims are heard  Both policies garnered legal challenges  and both required extensive implementation by McAleenan and his agency Stephen Legomsky  a former chief counsel at U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services under Democratic President Barack Obama  said McAleenan likely will not have much freedom to pursue policies opposed by Trump or Miller  Whoever is put in that position in this administration is going to have a very hard time resisting the philosophy of the White House   Legomsky said John Sandweg  former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  during the Obama administration  said the Trump administration s focus on deterring migrants at the expense of other policies had hamstrung Nielsen and would likely hobble McAleenan  There s nothing we can do that s worse than what people are facing in Central America   he said   If we re going to work our way through this problem  being tough is not a strategy  it s a soundbite   NOT RADIOACTIVEWhite House officials said Trump wanted someone at DHS who would focus on the border as the top priority  McAleenan is seen as having a good relationship with Trump and 20 years of experience  so the president felt he would be a good choice to handle the influx at the border  officials said The White House envisions McAleenan working more with Congress  one official said  though the official declined to be specific about policy details  McAleenan is a rare Trump appointee with cordial relations with Democrats in Congress  After testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in December  McAleenan chatted afterwards for close to 15 minutes with Senator Dianne Feinstein and other Democrats on the committee  He s not considered to be radioactive   said a congressional Democratic aide on condition of anonymity Democratic Representative Joaquin Castro demanded McAleenan resign in December  after a Guatemalan migrant girl died in federal custody and McAleenan failed to report it to Congress within 24 hours  as required On Sunday  he said McAleenan s appointment as acting secretary was  deeply disturbing  Trump further reshuffled the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on Monday by replacing the director of the Secret Service   which does not have immigration responsibilities   with a career agent   Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball and Andy Sullivan in Washington  Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh  Susan Thomas and Sonya Hepinstall  

 President Trump said he is considering releasing migrants in so called sanctuary cities  Read the latest here  WASHINGTON   President Trump s top aides considered an idea to pressure immigration agencies to release apprehended migrants into so called sanctuary cities represented by Democratic lawmakers  according to several people familiar with the proposal The idea was floated in an email by a top White House policy adviser in November  when Mr  Trump was furiously condemning migrant caravans from Central America headed toward the southwestern border  the people  including two government officials  said In the email dated Nov  16  with the subject line  Sanctuary City Proposal   May Davis  the deputy White House policy coordinator  raised the idea with officials from the Department of Homeland Security  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection Ms  Davis suggested that migrants who had been apprehended and were slated to be released into border towns could instead be taken to one of several sanctuary cities  which limit how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration officers The proponents of the idea inside the White House argued at the time that it would help with overcrowding at nonprofit shelters in border towns by transferring the migrants to cities that already embrace the idea of having more immigrants  one official said Once there  the migrants would be released onto the streets   potentially sending a message to the Democratic politicians who oppose Mr  Trump s immigration agenda and his demands for a wall along the border with Mexico  The idea has been raised by one to two principals that  if we are unable to build sufficient temporary housing  that caravan members be bused to small  and mid sized sanctuary cities   Ms  Davis wrote to the officials at the agencies  She added   There is not a White House decision on this  Matthew Albence  the acting deputy director of ICE  objected to the idea  telling the White House that there would be liability issues if a migrant were injured during transport  He also raised concerns that the agency s budget had not been appropriated for that purpose In an email  Mr  Albence responded that the proposal would create  an unnecessary operational burden  on the department and added that he did not know how paying extra to transport migrants to another location was  a justified expenditure  Mr  Albence is in line to run ICE after the departure this week of Ronald D  Vitiello  whom Mr  Trump pushed out because the president said he was not responding to the surge of immigrants in a tough enough fashion  This was a suggestion that was floated and rejected  which ended any further discussion   a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on Thursday evening In a statement from the White House  an official called the proposal a  nonstory  and said that  these are illegal aliens already being released and sent to U S  communities every day   The administration s position is that we want to deport   not release   illegal aliens   the official said The plan to transport migrants to sanctuary cities  which was first reported Thursday evening by The Washington Post  did not go into effect  according to the officials ImageSpeaker Nancy Pelosi of California this week in Washington  A spokeswoman for Ms  Pelosi  who represents San Francisco  one of the most high profile sanctuary cities in the country  condemned the idea on Thursday night CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesBut the White House did raise the idea again several months later  in February  suggesting that releasing the immigrants into the sanctuary cities would be a way of punishing Democrats for resisting budget requests for more money to detain undocumented immigrants  according to one person familiar with it A White House official denied that punishing the Democratic lawmakers was the primary purpose of the idea  The official said that it was an effort to deal more efficiently with migrants who were already going to be released But at that time  officials at the Department of Homeland Security once again raised significant concerns about the idea s legality  and the proposal was not carried out A spokeswoman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi  Democrat of California  who represents San Francisco  one of the most high profile sanctuary cities in the country  condemned the idea on Thursday night  The extent of this administration s cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated   said Ashley Etienne  a spokeswoman for Ms  Pelosi   Using human beings   including little children   as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable  and in some cases  criminal  Ms  Etienne added   The American people have resoundingly rejected this administration s toxic anti immigrant policies  and Democrats will continue to advance immigration policies that keep us safe and honor our values  Mr  Trump has frequently  and harshly  criticized sanctuary cities  saying their actions are a violation of federal immigration laws and allow violent criminals who are undocumented immigrants back onto the streets instead of being deported During his campaign for the presidency  Mr  Trump often cited the case of Kate Steinle  who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco  He mentioned the case during a key immigration speech in 2016  months before the election  Another victim is Kate Steinle   Mr  Trump said   Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco  by an illegal immigrant  deported five previous times  And they knew he was no good  As president  he has continued to lash out at sanctuary cities  In remarks in the East Room in January 2018  Mr  Trump said that sanctuary cities were  the best friends of gangs and cartels  One person familiar with the proposal to transport migrants to sanctuary cities said that none of the proposals came directly from Stephen Miller  the architect of the president s immigration agenda and the top domestic policy adviser in the White House But the person said that Department of Homeland Security officials understood that Mr  Miller was a chief advocate of the idea  Mr  Miller did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday night But Mr  Albence said in a statement issued late Thursday by the department that  as the acting deputy  I was not pressured by anyone at the White House on this issue   I was asked my opinion and provided it and my advice was heeded   he said   The email exchange is clear  and suggesting that it indicates inappropriate pressure is inaccurate  The idea s existence was revealed as Mr  Trump and Mr  Miller have begun to purge the immigration agencies of officials they believe have not worked aggressively enough to prevent the surge of migrants at the border and to advance the president s hard line immigration agenda In addition to Mr  Vitiello  Mr  Trump pushed out Kirstjen Nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  and Claire Grady  the acting deputy secretary of the department  The president also appears poised to oust two other top immigration officials at the department in the coming days A senior administration official told reporters this week that when it comes to the administration s core priorities on immigration  many of them have been  moving too slowly or moving in the wrong direction  at immigration agencies

PARIS   The International Criminal Court abandoned a possible Afghanistan war crimes investigation on Friday  saying the United States and others in the conflict would not cooperate The court s chief prosecutor had long sought permission to open a formal inquiry into civilian killings  torture and other abuses in the Afghanistan war  including possible crimes by American forces  But a panel of the court s judges decided that the difficulties of obtaining evidence and witness testimony outweighed the benefits of a prosecution  with a low prospect of any convictions The decision was welcomed by the Trump administration and came just weeks after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would deny visas to the court s staff and judges involved in prosecuting or ruling on war crimes involving Americans  Last week the State Department confirmed that the United States visa of the court s chief prosecutor  Fatou Bensouda  had been revoked But the decision by the judges  which took nearly 18 months to reach  troubled lawyers and stunned human rights activists  who said the court had capitulated to what they called Trump administration intimidation and pressure that had weakened the court s credibility  With its decision today  the International Criminal Court sends a dangerous message  that bullying wins and that the powerful won t be held to account   said Katherine Gallagher  a senior staff lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York While Ms  Bensouda s office said she was considering her options  including a possible appeal of the judges  decision  it appeared to dim any hopes of accountability for abuses committed in the Afghanistan conflict  including torture of detainees by C I A  operatives at secret prisons known as  black sites  An announcement from the court said the judges had decided that the impediments to securing evidence and obtaining cooperation meant that  an investigation into the situation in Afghanistan at this stage would not serve the interests of justice  While the judges said that there was a  reasonable basis  to conclude crimes had been committed and that the court had jurisdiction   the current circumstances of the situation in Afghanistan are such as to make the prospects for a successful investigation and prosecution extremely limited  The White House issued a statement by Mr  Trump praising the decision  coupled with a reiteration of the longstanding United States position that the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction to prosecute any Americans  including those who served in Afghanistan or elsewhere  This is a major international victory   Mr  Trump said   not only for these patriots  but for the rule of law   He said the United States  holds American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards  The court s judges said the lack of cooperation so far by all sides   including the United States  the Afghan authorities and the Taliban   meant that pursuing a successful investigation and prosecution would be a poor use of the court s resources Nonetheless  human rights advocates assailed the decision as a startling retreat from the court s purpose of providing war crimes victims with a means of seeking justice  Some said the language of the court s decision masked what was effectively a capitulation to the United States Jamil Dakwar  director of the Human Rights Program at the American Civil Liberties Union  said it was  outrageous that victims of war crimes are far less likely to get justice for well documented atrocities because of the Trump administration s authoritarian efforts to sabotage an investigation before it could even get started  Mr  Dakwar said the administration was  playing a dangerous game  that had severe implications for other prosecutions by the court  No one except the world s most brutal regimes win when we weaken and sabotage international institutions established to fight impunity and hold human rights abusers accountable   he said The retreat on Afghanistan compounds the litany of setbacks that has confronted the court  Burundi and the Philippines have withdrawn from the treaty that created the court nearly two decades ago  Ms  Bensouda was forced to drop a case against Kenya s leaders in 2014 for lack of cooperation The just ousted president of Sudan  Omar Hassan al Bashir  has been wanted by the court on charges including genocide for a decade  but the generals who toppled him said Friday they will not extradite him ImageFatou Bensouda  center  chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court  during a visit last year to the Democratic Republic of Congo CreditJohn Wessels Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMs  Bensouda requested authorization from the judges in November 2017 to begin a formal investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity that followed the American led invasion of Afghanistan in early 2002 to rout the Al Qaeda plotters of the Sept  11  2001 attacks and the Taliban rulers who had sheltered them While Ms  Bensouda s inquiry would have mostly focused on large scale crimes against civilians attributed to the Taliban and Afghan government forces  it also would have examined accusations of abuses by the C I A  and American military personnel including actions at secret C I A  detention centers in Afghanistan  Poland  Lithuania and Romania In a clear reference to the black sites  contained in the decision by the judges to abandon the investigation  they wrote that Ms  Bensouda had wanted to look at how C I A  agents  mistreated  prisoners  allegedly with a view to forcing confessions  obtaining information or retaliating for  the 9 11 attacks The prosecutor  they wrote  argued there was  a reasonable basis to believe that  since May 2003  members of the U S  armed forces and the C I A  have committed the war crimes of torture and cruel treatment  outrages upon personal dignity  and rape and other forms of sexual violence pursuant to a policy approved by the U S  authorities  The judges wrote that the prosecutor relied on studies conducted by the Pentagon and Congress  notably by the Senate s Intelligence Committee  an apparent reference to the public portion of the so called Senate Torture Report that studied the C I A  s black site program The judges also wrote that the prosecutor submitted material that appeared to catalog violations of international law by the C I A   including inflicting  extremely cruel  brutal and gruesome  physical and mental pain on its captives  refusing to let captives sleep  eat  drink and pray  as well as shaming captives through  acts of a sexual nature  Although the United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court  established nearly two decades ago  American governments have cooperated  or at least not interfered  with the court on some of its work in other investigations Americans suspected of having committed crimes in countries that are members of the court are potentially subject to prosecution  Afghanistan  Poland  Lithuania and Romania are all members Param Preet Singh  associate director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch  called the court s decision a  devastating blow  to victims  The judges  logic effectively allows states to opt out on their obligation to cooperate with the court s investigation   she said   This sends a dangerous message to perpetrators that they can put themselves beyond the reach of the law just by being uncooperative  Guenael Metraux  a Swiss scholar who has also appeared before international tribunals in The Hague  said the court s decision was self destructive to its own authority  Judicially  this is the closest thing to a suicide   he said   It s a catastrophically misguided surrender of responsibilities that will be painted by the U S  administration as a resounding victory and perceived by others as a model on how to resist the court  He said the judges had effectively affirmed the view of critics who argue that the court only prosecutes those too weak to stand up to it Some legal experts  however  said the judges had made a sensible decision by foreseeing frustration and failure in prosecuting a case in which all the major parties were not cooperating  The perception will be that the court cowed to Washington  but the judges are being realistic   said Alex Whiting  a former American prosecutor at the court who now teaches at Harvard Law School He said that lessons drawn from recent setbacks and failed cases at the court showed it must focus on situations where it can succeed   The prosecution has already come to that realization and now the judges are too   he said For John R  Bolton  the president s national security adviser  who has painted the court as a transnational institution that infringes American sovereignty  the retreat on Friday was a major victory During the George W  Bush administration  Mr  Bolton led the charge for the United States to  un sign  the Rome Statute  which created the court   an event he later described as his happiest day in government  Today is my second happiest day in government   Mr  Bolton said

DETROIT   A U S  auto safety group wants the government to investigate automatic emergency braking on some Nissan Rogue SUVs  alleging that the safety feature makes the vehicles brake even when there s no emergency The nonprofit Center for Auto Safety filed a petition with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration seeking the probe  The group says about 675 000 Rogues from the 2017 and 2018 model years should be recalled Nissan says it has notified all customers of a software update that improves performance of the automated braking system  But the center says the campaigns don t acknowledge the seriousness of the safety problem and give owners little incentive to get the SUVs fixed In a letter posted Friday by the government  center Executive Director Jason Levine says it found 87 complaints about unintended braking in the safety administration s database   Many complaints indicate that braking is abrupt or forceful  endangering both the Rogue occupants as well as people in the vehicles nearby who are forced to avoid a collision with a suddenly stopped vehicle   the letter says Automatic emergency braking uses cameras and radar to slow or stop vehicles when drivers don t take action  The technology has great potential to save lives  but it also can develop glitches  Twenty automakers representing 99 percent of U S  new car sales signed a voluntary agreement with the government to make the feature standard on all light vehicles by Sept  1  2022 In its petition  the center said that according to the complaints  the Nissan braking system can be triggered by railroad tracks  traffic lights  bridges  parking structures  and other fixed objects that do not pose a threat to the vehicle  In an email  Levine said a recall is needed rather than Nissan s service campaign because false activation of the braking system is a safety hazard  He wrote that some drivers are turning off the technology because of the problem NHTSA said in documents that it will evaluate whether to grant or deny the center s petition  Safety advocates and vehicle owners can petition the government to open safety investigations Nissan said it will continue to work with NHTSA and Canadian safety regulators on all matters of product safety

WASHINGTON   As President Donald Trump rails against an influx of migrants at the border  two of his most influential White House power players are at odds over the future of his immigration policy Fresh off orchestrating a shake up at the Department of Homeland Security  an ascendant Stephen Miller is making a renewed push to impose tougher policies at the border  That s setting up a face off with senior adviser and presidential son in law Jared Kushner  who has been quietly working on his own immigration reform package for months Their divergent approaches to the president s signature campaign issue speak to more than the ideological gulf between the two men  They echo a long standing philosophical divide within the West Wing over how to best position the president ahead of his re election campaign Miller  the mastermind of the president s Muslim travel ban and other hard line immigration policies  has long been the combative ideologue  urging Trump to take ever more drastic action to stanch the border flow  Kushner  whose faith in his own careful dealmaking power rivals Miller s zeal  has spent months meeting with lawmakers and interest groups  trying to put together a package of legal immigration and border security changes that Republicans can rally around heading into the 2020 presidential election The resulting parallel tracks   one bent on implementing ever stricter policies and another meant to forge a more palatable and unifying legislative package   have created uncertainty and confusion both inside the administration and on Capitol Hill about where Trump is headed The conflict came into focus during a recent White House meeting when Trump effectively knighted Miller  saying the aide would oversee immigration going forward  But Kushner had already been tasked by the president with coming up with a legal immigration plan  which Trump was briefed on this week  We ll talk to you about it soon   Trump said Wednesday of Kushner s plan  labeling it  very exciting  very important for the country  Despite the aides  differing approaches  administration officials insist there is no ill will between Kushner and Miller  who have worked together over the years at the White House and on Trump s campaign  The two are among the last remaining members of Trump s tightknit 2016 team to still work at the White House and have been longtime collaborators  co writing speeches  including the president s convention address But for all that  the two hold fundamentally different views on immigration and notions on how Trump ought to govern Miller  the unrelenting hard liner  sees illegal and legal immigration as existential threats to national security and the American worker  and views Trump as a generational voice willing to make dramatic changes  Kushner  a former Democratic leaning real estate developer  sees a broken immigration system as another intractable Washington problem that could be solved with the right deal That leaves them working at cross purposes at times After Trump threatened to shut down the southern border two weeks ago  Kushner was among those whom Homeland Security officials worked with to get the president to back off  Indeed  Kushner is seen within the department as someone who accepts the realities of legal limitations and can be trusted to calm Trump down  not spin him up  as they feel Miller tends to do on immigration  according to three administration officials with knowledge of the dynamic  They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations Senior administration officials have tried to paint Miller and Kushner s efforts as complementary   Miller addressing the day to day crisis at the border while Kushner looking at longer term solutions  President Trump alone sets immigration policy that s designed to solve the humanitarian crisis at our border  prevent illegal entry into our country and protect the American people   there s no daylight between the president s team as they work to implement that agenda   spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement Trump on Wednesday also challenged the notion that anyone was running his immigration policy other than him Asked by reporters whether he had considered tapping Miller to lead Homeland Security  Trump said   Stephen is an excellent guy  He s wonderful person   But  he added   Frankly  there s only one person that s running it  You know who that is  It s me  But former officials said the absence of clear lines of authority and the recent purge of senior leadership at Homeland Security could create confusion  leaving the agency to implement whichever viewpoint wins the day  To whom are we listening  Who s setting the priorities   said David Lapan  the department s former press secretary Thad Bingel a former senior Homeland Security official  who helped shepherd outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen through her confirmation process  echoed those concerns  saying that when it s not clear who s in charge at the White House  departments and subagencies  spin their wheels a lot trying to satisfy multiple masters  Raising the stakes further is that Kushner is no mere White House aide   he s the president s son in law and has proven capable of forcing staff turnover at the highest level  He was instrumental in the departure of two chiefs of staff and the president s former chief strategist Kushner s latest efforts on immigration date to early January  when Trump asked him to pursue a deal with lawmakers that would win the president more money for his border wall during the government shutdown While White House officials caution that the plan has yet to be finalized  aides said it would include  merit based  changes to the legal immigration system as well as proposals on border security that could include modernizing ports of entry and changing the way the country detains and removes people who enter the country illegally As part of that effort  Kushner has convened a series of informal listening sessions with almost 50 groups  including anti immigration advocates  business and conservative groups coming together to talk through ideas  It was the same playbook he used last year on criminal justice reform  which culminated in the only major piece of bipartisan legislation the president has signed During those meetings  Kushner was been careful not to tip his hat on his personal views  But participants say they expect the plan to include significant changes  including increases in employment based green cards  While protections for the hundreds of thousands of so called Dreamers brought to the country illegally as children were a major point of discussion  a senior administration official said Dreamers are not currently part of the plan Jessica Vaughn  director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies  which advocates for lower immigration levels  cautioned that unveiling a major plan now would be a distraction from the immediate border crisis  The timing couldn t be worse   she said   It s just the wrong time to be getting into a battle over this when the priority should be on fixing the border crisis and getting our enforcement on track     Associated Press writer Colleen Long contributed to this report

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  facing criticism that the Trump administration has sought to sweep away the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi s brutal killing  announced on Monday that 16 Saudis  including one of the closest aides to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  were being barred from entry to the United States The list included the close aide  Saud al Qahtani  who officially served as the royal court s media czar  but appeared to have overseen the operation to seize Mr  Khashoggi  It was one of a dozen or so operations by what American intelligence officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group  set up by Mr  al Qahtani to silence or eliminate dissent about Prince Mohammed s rapid rise to become the de facto Saudi leader But conspicuously missing from the list is Prince Mohammed himself  despite the conclusion by American intelligence agencies that he was ultimately responsible for sending the team to Istanbul to kill Mr  Khashoggi  and for other actions by the Rapid Intervention Group  More than a year before Mr  Khashoggi s death  American intelligence officials intercepted a communication from the crown prince saying that if Mr  Khashoggi  a Washington Post journalist who lived in Virginia  did not voluntarily return to the kingdom and cease publishing his criticism  the state should go after him  with a bullet  Based on the findings of the C I A   which he led until last year  Mr  Pompeo would have been free to add the crown prince to the list  though that would have been an unusual move to take against a leader of a close ally  But Mr  Pompeo has at times also sounded passive about the investigation  saying he was giving the Saudis time to complete their own inquiry By moving to name the Saudis and barring them and their immediate families from traveling to the United States  the Trump administration appears to be trying to tamp down an unusual uprising in Congress that has involved members of both parties But it is far from clear that the relatively minor penalty  against Saudis who would be unlikely to enter the United States under current conditions  will be viewed as sufficient  Mr  Pompeo and President Trump are likely to still face the accusation that they are deliberately ignoring the C I A  s intelligence findings in an effort to put the killing behind them  Mr  Trump once called the report about the crown prince s involvement a  feeling  by the C I A   and has insisted that the evidence is not conclusive VideoAn autopsy expert  A lookalike  A black van  Our video investigation follows the movements of the 15 man Saudi hit team that killed and dismembered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi It is unclear whether their effort to move on from the killing will work  Congress has already moved to stop all American support for Saudi military action in Yemen  and there are questions about continued military transfers  And Mr  Trump s administration has been negotiating for two years now on a deal to sell civilian nuclear power designs and equipment to Saudi Arabia  an action that would require congressional approval and raises concerns about whether the Saudi government might use the technology to seek a nuclear weapon  The crown prince has been explicit that if Iran got a weapon  Saudi Arabia would as well The administration regards Saudi Arabia as its key partner in confronting Iran The announcement appeared timed to generate little news and less embarrassment for the Saudi crown prince  Mr  Pompeo s list was published Monday evening  on a day in which upheavals at the Department of Homeland Security and Mr  Pompeo s decision to name the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a foreign terrorist organization dominated headlines  Mr  Pompeo had appeared at the State Department press room and took questions on the Iranian designation earlier Monday  making no mention of the approaching announcement on Saudi Arabia One American diplomat involved in Saudi affairs who was not authorized to speak on the subject said the decision to act had taken considerable time The Saudis have never publicly talked about the whereabouts of Mr  al Qahtani  who was the crown prince s chief enforcer and one of the architects of the effort to consolidate his power  In private  Saudis say he is under house arrest  But there is no indication whether he is being criminally prosecuted  and some reports indicated that he continued to hold power until the investigation became too hot  and someone near the crown prince had to take the fall The list of barred Saudis also included several members of the team sent to Istanbul  where Mr  Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi Consulate in an encounter that the Saudis insist was intended to forcibly bring him back to Riyadh  the Saudi capital  It includes the leader of that team  Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb  an intelligence officer who knew Mr  Khashoggi from their days working together at the Saudi Embassy in London  He often traveled with the crown prince abroad Mr  Mutreb and another Saudi listed by the State Department  Thaar Ghaleb al Harbi  a member of the royal guard and a favorite of the crown prince s for his role in fighting off an attack on one of Prince Mohammed s palaces  are standing trial  Saudi officials have told The New York Times Also listed was Salah Tubaigy  whom The Washington Post recently identified as a  medical specialist  for the Saudi Interior Ministry who is said to have administered a powerful sedative to Mr  Khashoggi during a struggle inside the consulate  He died shortly thereafter  perhaps because of the sedative  or his asthma  or because of strangulation His body was cut up and has never been recovered Much of the evidence against the men named in the State Department s list came from Turkey  which had surveillance videos outside the consulate and had apparently bugged the consulate itself  resulting in an audio recording of the killing  

WASHINGTON   It could take the U S  government up to two years to identify potentially thousands of additional children separated from their parents by the authorities at the southern border  the government said in a court filing The filing late on Friday outlined for the first time the Trump administration s plan for identifying which family members might have been separated by assessing thousands of records using a combination of data analysis  statistical science  and manual review Last month  a federal judge in San Diego expanded the number of migrant families that the government may be required to reunite as part of a class action lawsuit brought last year by the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  The Office of Inspector General at the U S  Department of Health and Human Services said earlier this year that the agency had identified many more children in addition to the 2 737 initially included in the suit  U S  District Court Judge Dana Sabraw had already ordered that those children be reunited with their parents  Defendants estimate that identifying all possible children     would take at least 12 months  and possibly up to 24 months   the government wrote in Friday s filing  It added that the time frame would be affected by the efficacy of its predictive statistical model  the manpower it can dedicate to the manual review  and any follow up meetings required In a statement on Saturday  the ACLU s lead attorney for the case  Lee Gelernt  said the group strongly opposed the government s proposed plan and accused it of not treating the separations with the necessary urgency  The government was able to quickly gather resources to tear these children away from their families and now they need to gather the resources to fix the damage   Gelernt said President Donald Trump s administration implemented a  zero tolerance  policy to criminally prosecute and jail all illegal border crossers  even those traveling with their children  leading to a wave of separations last year  The policy sparked outrage when it became public  and the backlash led Trump to sign an executive order reversing course on June 20  2018   Reporting by Kristina Cooke and Yeganeh Torbati  Writing by Michelle Price  Editing by Daniel Wallis  

RIO DE JANEIRO   President Jair Bolsonaro s first 100 days in office have been marked by infighting in his administration  insults to adversaries and allies  praise for Brazil s 1964 1985 dictatorship and a scarcity of bills passed by Congress   pretty much the same as his record as a congressman and as a candidate So far  the anti corruption and pro gun outsider who is frequently compared to U S  President Donald Trump has scored only a few major victories to keep his far right base excited Bolsonaro s electoral triumph in October sent Brazil s left to its biggest defeat in almost two decades  But for many  so far Bolsonaro s administration is heavy on discourse and light on concrete accomplishments Bolsonaro has achieved some of his campaign promises  He signed a decree easing restrictions on gun ownership as an anti crime move  privatized some state run companies  installed a Cabinet with eight members of the military   more than at any time since the restoration of democracy   and has built strong ties with Trump and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu while distancing Brazil from Venezuela s socialist leader  Nicolas Maduro He has also begun moves to weaken environmental restrictions on development  as promised Still  as he marks off his 100th day in the presidency Wednesday  he has also given critics a lot of material to work with  and corruption suspicions against the president s family have emerged The former army captain has been widely criticized for celebrating the March 31  1964  coup that launched Brazil s military regime and for labeling Nazism as a leftist ideology while in Jerusalem  He managed to offend even allies with a pornographic tweet of a Carnival party in response to revelers who had mocked him What is widely seen as his most crucial challenge  fixing the country s costly pension system   remains trapped in Congress with other proposals  including a highly touted revamp of the anti crime and anti corruption systems During 27 years in Congress  Bolsonaro was noted for inflammatory speeches but presented only two bills that became law  This administration is characterized by strong rhetoric that is not necessarily supported by actions in the same direction   said Renato Flores  an analyst with the Rio based Fundacao Getulio Vargas think tank Some once staunch supporters of the president now worry about the role he gives to his sons Carlos  Eduardo and Flavio  Criticism by Carlos helped prompt the resignation of Bolsonaro s aide and attorney Gustavo Bebianno  Eduardo alarmed some by tweeting that the president would need only  one soldier and one corporal  to deal with the Supreme Court Bolsonaro s Cabinet appears to be divided into four  sometimes fractious factions  the military  with eight out of 22 ministers  evangelical conservatives who control the government s human rights agenda  a moderate wing overseeing economic and justice ministries  and a cluster of anti globalist fans of Olavo de Carvalho  a far right Brazilian writer who lives in the United States  now dominate foreign relations and education Carlos Melo  a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo  said the divisions put Bolsonaro s administration  in paralysis from the start   There are too many conflicts  We can t see a proper plan to grow the economy and Bolsonaro is losing the momentum presidents have in the first six months  Even his pension reform  which led many moderates to believe him  seems at risk of failing or being massively dehydrated by the very Congress he doesn t talk to   Melo said   It can all change  he has time  But the signs are not here yet  Even lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia  who initially had good relations with Bolsonaro  has complained that the far right leader is  playing at being Brazil s president   Now it is time for us to stop joking around and it is time that he sits on his chair that Congress sits here and we solve Brazil s problems together   Maia said last month The public also seems restless  The Datafolha polling institute reported Sunday that Bolsonaro s approval rating has slipped to 32   the lowest for any elected first term Brazilian president  though still far above the single digit approval rating his predecessor  Michel Temer  had at the end Datafolha interviewed 2 086 people April 2 3 and reported a two  percentage point margin of error Business leaders and stockbrokers initially welcomed Bolsonaro s victory  but so far there has been little sign of economic improvement  Unemployment officially is still at 12   a record 4 9 million Brazilians stopped searching for jobs in March and an initial stock market rally was erased following some of the president s Twitter made rifts with allies  The government research institute recently reduced its 2019 economic growth expectations from 2 7  to 2  Bolsonaro  who likes to say he is pushing ideology out of Brazil s foreign affairs  has shifted the country s alliances toward other leaders who share his conservative tendencies  joining in regional efforts to isolate Venezuela s Maduro He has been hosted in Trump s White House and in Netanyahu s Jerusalem  but China  Brazil s biggest trading partner  has been shunned  Agribusiness leaders fear that approach could harm Brazilian exports to Asia Vice President Hamilton Mourao has tried to soften that stance  calling China a partner and meeting with Chinese diplomats The man once hailed as an anti corruption hero by supporters is facing suspicions of familial wrongdoing Regulatory authorities said his son Flavio  who is also a senator  received 48 suspicious payments totaling about  25 000 in a single month from his former driver Fabricio Queiroz  who also made a payment to first lady Michelle Bolsonaro of about  5 500  All involved deny any wrongdoing  An investigation is ongoing None of those difficulties have alienated Bolsonaro s hardcore supporters  like 60 year old hairdresser Roberta Duarte  Bolsonaro is doing what he promised  No other president did this in more than 50 years  He is putting the house in order  fighting crime and violence   said Duarte  who lives in a violent region in the south of Sao Paulo   Violence was so strong that no one could leave at night to watch a movie or eat a pizza  Slowly things are improving  Others  like 18 year old journalism student Lucas Batista  are worried by Bolsonaro s frequent nods to Brazil s military dictatorship when his administration comes under criticism  He is an authoritarian leader who believes he is the only one capable of solving the country s problems   Batista said   I fear Bolsonaro and his followers want to reintroduce a military regime     Associated Press writer Marcelo Silva de Sousa reported this story in Rio de Janeiro

WASHINGTON   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s vow for Israel to annex parts of the West Bank would flout four decades of American policy  under both Republican and Democratic presidents  But nothing emboldened Mr  Netanyahu to take such a risk more than the support of his ally President Trump From recognizing Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights to moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem  Mr  Trump has given Mr  Netanyahu the political cover and legal legitimacy to embrace a position that critics say would all but extinguish the dream of a viable Palestinian state Mr  Trump s moves are not merely temporary gestures  which a future president or Israeli leader could reverse  They are policy changes that experts say have permanently altered the contested landscape of the Middle East  making his own stated goal of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians more unattainable than ever  They talk about a peace plan  but we never see it   said Martin S  Indyk  a former American ambassador to Israel who tried to negotiate a deal between Israel and the Palestinians during the Obama administration   What we see are new facts on the ground that will make a two state solution impossible  The White House declined to comment on Monday on Mr  Netanyahu s latest remarks  Partly  this reflected qualms about speaking out on a delicate diplomatic issue on the eve of an Israeli election  But it also revealed the extent to which Mr  Trump has become Mr  Netanyahu s biggest enabler ImageLabourers at a construction site in Beitar Illit  an Israeli settlement in the West Bank CreditRonen Zvulun ReutersFor Mr  Trump  who has talked about brokering a  deal of the century  between Israel and the Palestinians  Mr  Netanyahu s aggressive move could pose a long term problem  There is no obvious alternative to a two state solution  however bleak its prospects  If Mr  Netanyahu is re elected and follows through on his promise to annex territory  it would force the United States to retire a diplomatic strategy that dates to President Richard M  Nixon Mr  Trump continues to promote the idea of a peace accord  placing his hope in a blueprint drafted by three of his senior aides  Jared Kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  Jason D  Greenblatt  his special envoy for Middle East peace  and David M  Friedman  the American ambassador to Israel  The Trump administration  officials said  still intends to present the plan sometime after the Israeli election  A big thing for me  and some of you won t like this maybe  but I would love to see peace in the Middle East   Mr  Trump said Saturday at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas   If those three can t do it  you ll never have it done  The setting captured the tension between Mr  Trump s diplomatic ambitions and his domestic political imperatives  Acknowledging that the audience might not welcome a peacemaking effort that required compromises by Israel  he spent most of his time taking credit for decisions like the Jerusalem embassy and Golan Heights  which are popular with right wing Jews and evangelical voters In Israel  meanwhile  Mr  Netanyahu suggested that he had the tacit backing of Mr  Trump to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank  The prime minister told Israeli news media over the weekend that the White House was aware of his plans and said that he hoped to  do it  if possible  with American support   though he added that he would not change his position  regardless of how the United States reacted ImageMembers of Iran s Revolutionary Guards Corps on parade in Tehran last year CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesThere was little in Washington s silence to indicate that Mr  Netanyahu would face pushback  At every step of the prime minister s hard fought campaign to stay in power  Mr  Trump has tried to help him  The president s announcement on the Golan Heights last month came at a critical moment  when Mr  Netanyahu faced a rising opponent and damaging new disclosures in the corruption cases against him Even Mr  Trump s announcement on Monday that the State Department would designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a foreign terrorist organization paid dividends for Mr  Netanyahu  On his Hebrew language Twitter feed  Mr  Netanyahu thanked Mr  Trump for  keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism  Mr  Trump has wrapped Mr  Netanyahu in a warm embrace from the beginning of his presidency  even as he has voiced mild support for a two state solution   That s what I think works best   he said last fall during a meeting with the prime minister at the United Nations General Assembly While Mr  Trump s moves have been unstintingly pro Israel  some could also be interpreted as a way to pressure the Palestinians to come back to the bargaining table  The administration cut off aid to Palestinian groups  closed its diplomatic office in Washington and ended funding for a United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees None of that persuaded the Palestinians to reopen a dialogue with the United States that was cut off after Mr  Trump announced the embassy move in late 2017  The threat of annexation  experts said  might be the last form of leverage the United States has over the Palestinians  Unless they agree to a peace deal  the United States could give Mr  Netanyahu a green light to claim territory ImageIsraeli tourists watching the Syrian side of the border in the Golan Heights last month CreditAtef Safadi EPA  via Shutterstock The one issue that clearly opened a Pandora s box was the Golan Heights announcement   said Ghaith al Omari  a former Palestinian negotiator   Once they broke that particular taboo  they opened the door for all the annexationists in Israel to say   Now go for the West Bank   Whatever his election eve theatrics  some analysts argue that Mr  Netanyahu would be loath to take such a radical step  They say he is motivated less by a desire to upend decades of diplomacy than by his own political survival  Dangling the prospect of annexation is a way to nail down the support of smaller right wing parties  which he will need to form a government  He s smart enough to realize that if he goes through with this  he is creating with his own hands a Bosnia on the Mediterranean   said David Makovsky  a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy But Mr  Makovsky acknowledged that if the Trump administration presented its plan and was rebuffed by the Palestinians   a scenario he and other veterans of peace negotiations view as likely   Mr  Netanyahu could use that as a pretext for selective annexation of large settlements Mr  Trump s aides have kept a tight lid on the details and timing of their plan  Some analysts speculated that they might introduce it after the election  but before the victor forms a government  so as to influence the makeup of the new coalition  That scenario now seems less likely  given Mr  Netanyahu s weakened position  because he will probably have to reach out to right wing parties to form a government   and none of those are interested in a Palestinian state Some former diplomats argue that the intense focus on the peace plan misses the point  The Trump administration has utterly transformed the paradigm for American engagement in the Middle East  What we re watching in terms of American policy is a shell game   said Daniel C  Kurtzer  a former American ambassador to Israel and Egypt   They want you to watch the peace plan   it s 40 pages long  it s 60 pages long  What they don t want you to watch is how they are trying extraordinarily hard  under cover of the plan  to change things on the ground

SAN DIEGO TIJUANA  Mexico   At least 60 Central American asylum seekers who were waiting in Mexico for their cases to be heard have been allowed to stay in the United States since Monday s court ruling to halt a Trump administration policy of sending them back across the border The admissions occurred even though the U S  District Court ruling does not come into effect until Friday  and despite the fact the ruling does not clearly apply to the hundreds of people returned to Mexico  The number and outcomes of the cases were confirmed by a migrant attorney and a Reuters reporter who have attended court proceedings in San Diego this week  The administration has indicated it will appeal the ruling  and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether there has been a policy change But the stance of the DHS in the cases in a San Diego court shows the U S  government is already allowing some migrants coming in from Mexico to stay in the United States as their individual cases come up A source at Mexico s National Immigration Institute said on Thursday that around 1 400 people have been returned to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols policy  MPP  since January  most of them to the border town of Tijuana  where many said they feared dangerous conditions The policy was stepped up in the days before the ruling  Mexican government statistics show  No one appears to have been sent back under the policy since Tuesday  the day after the ruling  said the Mexican immigration source  who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media The court ruling clearly applied to the 11 plaintiffs in the civil liberties lawsuit as well as future asylum applicants  but the status of those already in Mexico was left unclear  Not one of 20 asylum seekers who crossed the border from Tijuana on Wednesday for court hearings in San Diego was returned to Mexico  however  At one hearing  a Guatemalan man asked specifically whether he would have to go back to Tijuana  Definitely  he will not be returned to Mexico   said Pamela Ataii  the DHS lawyer  Another migrant told Judge Scott Simpson that he was scared to go back  to which Simpson responded   You are lucky  because I don t think that s going to happen  Luis Gonzalez  supervising immigration attorney with the Jewish Family Service of San Diego  who attended court on Tuesday  said he knew of 13 people who had hearings that day who had been released and one who was detained in the United States   Our understanding so far is that families under the MPP program are now being released into the United States after coming to court   Gonzalez said El Salvadoran Gabriela Orellana  26  and her two children were among those allowed to pursue their cases in the United States  I am here  thank God  in a shelter in San Diego   she said in a telephone interview on Thursday President Donald Trump s administration has argued that asylum seekers who are released into U S  territory often do not show up at their hearings  a contention at odds with federal statistics which show that the majority do appear Carmen Rivera  who said she was fleeing gangs in El Salvador  had given up hope of receiving U S  asylum after she was sent back to Mexico  She told Reuters she decided weeks ago not to attend her court hearing in San Diego After the ruling this week  however  she changed her mind  I m excited to know that we have this opportunity  because to return to Mexico  to Tijuana  is very dangerous   she said from a shelter close to the border fence in Mexico  where many migrants were camped out in tents   Thank God  things changed     Additional reporting by Andrew Hay  writing by Kristina Cooke  Editing by Julie Marquis and Sonya Hepinstall  

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States and China were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks  while warning Beijing that it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without a pact The two countries are engaged in intense negotiations to end a months long trade war that has rattled global markets  but hopes of a resolution soared after both sides expressed optimism following talks in Beijing last week Speaking to reporters at the White House at the start of a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  Trump said some of the tougher points of a deal had been agreed but there were still differences to be bridged  We re getting very close to making a deal  That doesn t mean a deal is made  because it s not  but we re certainly getting a lot closer   Trump said in the Oval Office  And I would think with  oh  within the next four weeks or maybe less  maybe more  whatever it takes  something very monumental could be announced  Trump said he would hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping if there were a deal Xi assured Trump that text of the China U S  trade could be finalised soon  in a message conveyed by Liu He According to state run news agency Xinhua  Liu He told Trump that Xi believed under his and Trump s leadership  China U S  relations will make new and greater progress Xi said that in the past month or more  the two sides  trade teams had maintained close contact and  achieved new and substantive progress on issues in the text of two countries  trade agreement    I hope the two sides  trade teams can continue working in the spirit of mutual respect  equality  and mutual benefit to resolve each other s concerns  and finish negotiations on the text of the China U S  trade agreement soon   Xi said to Trump through Liu KEEPING LEVERAGE Trump declined to say what would happen to U S  tariffs on  250 billion worth of goods as part of a deal  China wants the tariffs lifted  while U S  officials are wary of giving up that leverage  at least for now  Asked about the benefits of an agreement for China  Trump said   It s going to be great for China  in that China will continue to trade with the United States  I mean  otherwise  it would be very tough for us to allow that to happen  Goods trade between the United States and China  the world s two largest economies  totaled  660 billion last year  according to U S  Census Bureau data  consisting of imports of  540 billion from China and  120 billion in exports to China On China s behalf  Liu cited  great progress  in the talks because of Trump s direct involvement and expressed hope that the talks would lead to  a good result  U S  SEEKS SWEEPING CHANGESTrump has previously threatened to impose punitive tariffs on all imports from China  more than a half trillion dollars worth of products  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  who is leading the talks for the Trump administration  said there were still some  major  major issues  to resolve and praised Liu s commitment to reform in China  Asked about the remaining sticking points  Trump mentioned tariffs and intellectual property theft  He said he would discuss tariffs with Liu in their meeting  Some of the toughest things have been agreed to   Trump said  He later said that an enforcement plan for a deal remained a sticking point as well   We have to make sure there s enforcement  I think we ll get that done  We ve discussed it at length   he said Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are holding talks in Washington with a Chinese delegation this week after meeting together in Beijing last week  The current round of talks is scheduled to go through Friday and possibly longer Hopes that the talks were moving in a positive direction have cheered financial markets in recent weeks  But U S  stocks were mixed on Thursday as investors waited for more developments in the trade negotiations  with the Dow Jones industrial Average slightly higher  and the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slightly lower    N The United States is seeking reforms to Chinese practices that it says result in the theft of U S  intellectual

currency manipulation  an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China keeps its pledges and the status of U S  tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods must be resolved  China has been very clear  publicly and privately  that they would like to see all the tariffs removed   U S  Chamber of Commerce international affairs chief Myron Brilliant told reporters on Tuesday   The  Trump  administration has been equally clear that they want to keep some of the tariffs in place as a way to have leverage over China fulfilling its obligations under whatever final package is reached

NEW YORK   The Labor Department is proposing new rules to determine whether companies can be considered joint employers  sharing control over workers in one of the businesses The proposed rules announced last week would affect companies including those that are franchises or that are in a contractor subcontractor relationship  There has been controversy and litigation over the joint employer standard in recent years The Labor Department s proposal creates a test to help determine if a company is a joint employer   Does the company have the power to hire or fire a worker   Who supervises and control the employee s work schedules or conditions of employment   Who determines how much employees are paid and how are they paid   Who maintains a worker s employment records The current joint employer standard has been on the books since 1958  under it  companies must exercise  direct operational and supervisory control  over employees to be considered joint employers  But in 2015  under the Obama administration  the National Labor Relations Board said in a contractor subcontractor case that it will consider factors such as whether a company exercised control over employees  indirectly through an intermediary  or whether it has reserved the authority to do so  in determining whether companies are joint employers That decision was criticized by small business and franchise groups who said it would take away small companies  control over their workers  The International Franchise Association said at the time that individually owned franchises  which are often small businesses  could be drawn into national labor disputes between unions and franchisors  There were concerns that individual owners wouldn t have the final say over matters like how much they paid their workers The joint employer standard was among the Obama era federal regulations the Trump administration has targeted for change Business groups welcomed the Labor Department proposal  Karen Kerrigan  head of the advocacy group Small Business   Entrepreneurship Council  said in a statement that the proposal  will bring needed certainty in business to business relationships and in the franchise industry  The proposed rule won t become final until after the public has had a chance to comment on it  the period for comments ends June 10  The proposal can be found at www regulations gov in the rulemaking docket RIN 1235 AA26      Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www twitter com JoyceMRosenberg   Her work can be found here  https   apnews com   

WASHINGTON   As the United States and China edge closer to a trade agreement  the ability to reach a final deal is coming down to a central question  Will Beijing live up to its promises Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  in a CNBC interview on Wednesday  said that the countries had  pretty much agreed  on an enforcement mechanism for a trade deal  adding that both sides would establish  enforcement offices  to deal with continuing trade matters But it remains unclear which provisions of the trade deal will be subject to enforcement and how much power the United States will have to punish Beijing if it reneges on the agreement  The ability to secure a firm commitment from China to hold up its end of the pact or face repercussions will be a key determinant in whether President Trump s trade deal is seen as a true win or a capitulation The emerging pact tries to resolve longstanding concerns about Beijing s economic practices  including forcing American companies to turn over valuable technology as a condition of doing business in China and restricting American firms from participating in certain industries  But business leaders are closely watching to see exactly how American negotiators will ensure that China holds to its commitments The United States is pushing for a broad commitment that would allow American tariffs on Chinese goods to snap back if China violates key promises   without permitting China to retaliate in response  So far  Chinese leaders have been reluctant to agree to an enforcement mechanism that would leave their economic future at the mercy of American politicians In a hearing in March  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top negotiator leading the China talks  said the United States had to maintain the right to be able to raise tariffs  in situations where there s violations of the agreement   That s the core   he added   If we don t do that  then none of it makes any difference  Mr  Lighthizer and other White House officials have criticized past administrations for extracting promises from the Chinese  only to see those pledges go unfulfilled as the two sides engaged in extended dialogues  But some China experts and business leaders say that the Trump administration s approach  as described publicly  does not appear to differ much When asked about the enforcement mechanism at a hearing in February  Mr  Lighthizer said that the two countries would hold a series of regular meetings at various levels of the government to resolve complaints brought by companies  If the issues could not be resolved through negotiation  the United States would impose tariffs China experts say enforcement is necessary given that the United States wants Beijing to make significant structural changes that will take time  The proof of structural change will only emerge over the next year or more   said Elizabeth Economy  director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations   Then we will see  for example  whether new market access actually yields new opportunities for foreign companies or whether death by a thousand cuts prevents foreign firms from actually realizing any benefits  But pressing China for firm commitments has not been easy  The Chinese are not expected to accept a tough enforcement mechanism   or agree to a final deal   without confirmation from the United States to remove some portion of Mr  Trump s tariffs on the  250 billion worth of Chinese goods he imposed last year  The more hawkish members of Mr  Trump s administration  including Mr  Lighthizer  have cautioned that no provisions are final until the entire deal is done Craig Allen  the president of the U S  China Business Council  suggested that Mr  Mnuchin might have been getting ahead of himself on the enforcement agreement if such a deal includes China agreeing not to retaliate against future tariffs  I remain very cautious on this   Mr  Allen said   Will the Chinese really renounce the ability to retaliate at what they feel is an unfair trade action  I think it defies Chinese tradition  Mr  Trump  who met with a Chinese delegation in the Oval Office last week  said negotiators might require four more weeks to finish ironing out the deal Mr  Mnuchin on Thursday declined to specify whether the countries were on track for that timeline  saying Mr  Trump is  more focused on the right deal  Mr  Mnuchin added that some chapters of the agreement were close to finished  while others still had  technical issues   He declined to comment on whether the United States and China had agreed to remove all or part of the tariffs the two countries had leveled on each other  and when Myron Brilliant  the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  said the two sides were closer but cautioned that the Chinese would not agree to a final deal without something in return  I remain confident in the prospects of a deal  but I think we need to be cleareyed and understand that China could walk away from expected commitments in purchases  market access  intellectual property and other areas if they don t get something out of this deal  and that s tariff relief   he said Political reception of the deal in the United States will largely come down to how tough the United States appears to have been on China  I think you have hawks on both sides that are now down to the heart of the matter   Stephen K  Bannon  Mr  Trump s former strategist  said on Tuesday   What do you do on these structural issues  What are the triggers  What s the enforcement   No one to date has gotten to the right of Trump on China   he added  But once details of the deal emerge  outspoken China critics like Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  Senator Chuck Schumer  Democrat of New York  and Richard Trumka  the president of the A F L  C I O    may say  hey  this is not tough enough   Mr  Bannon said American and Chinese negotiators have continued to carry out talks this week through video conferencing  after a Chinese delegation visited Washington last week  Negotiators have already worked out the bulk of a 150 page agreement on issues including intellectual property protections  purchases  subsidies and currency  Yet the two sides have recently grappled with sticking points over issues including intellectual property and approvals for genetically modified crops  as well as major differences on lifting Mr  Trump s tariffs and the enforcement mechanism The negotiations have been highly secretive  and it was not clear on Thursday how many of these remaining issues had yet to be resolved  A spokeswoman for the United States trade representative  which is leading the negotiations  declined to comment People familiar with the negotiations speculated that Mr  Mnuchin s optimistic remarks  coming as foreign officials gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  might spring from a desire to reassure financial markets and foreign officials On Thursday  Vice President Mike Pence said that the Trump administration s approach differed from previous administrations  literally going back decades since we admitted China into the World Trade Organization   We kind of made a bet that if we opened up access to China to world markets and we engaged in broader trade that we would see China embrace the kind of policies that would respect private property rights and open up their markets to the West   Mr  Pence said   And candidly  that hasn t happened  Both investors and allies have worried that Mr  Trump s aggressive and unilateral approach to trade is causing uncertainty and acting as a drag on global economic growth On Tuesday  the International Monetary Fund announced that it had cut its 2019 economic estimates for global growth to just 3 3 percent  down from previous estimates of 3 5 percent in January and 3 7 percent in October  It cited  trade tensions and tariff hikes between the United States and China   as well as tighter financial conditions  declining business confidence and Britain s potential exit from the European Union

The United States barred a prominent Palestinian activist from entering the country on Wednesday  a move that rights groups said was an attempt by the Trump administration to silence Palestinian voices The activist  Omar Barghouti  is one of the co founders of the Boycott  Divestment  and Sanctions movement  also known as B D S   which encourages broad economic pressure on Israel over its treatment of Palestinians  The movement has increasingly come under fire in the United States  with some 27 states passing laws that punish companies or individuals who support the boycott Mr  Barghouti was supposed to speak at a series of events in the United States organized by the Arab American Institute in Washington  including at panels at Harvard University and an event with New York University  He was also planning to attend his daughter s wedding in Texas  This U S  entry ban against me  which is ideologically and politically motivated  is part of Israel s escalating repression against Palestinian  Israeli and international human rights defenders in the B D S  movement   Mr  Barghouti said in a statement  He called for an end to what he called  U S  complicity in Israel s crimes against our people  Mr  Barghouti  a permanent resident of Israel  was stopped at Israel s international airport when he tried to board a flight to Washington via Frankfurt  and airline staff told him only that the American Consulate in Tel Aviv had been directed to stop him from traveling  He said he was told it was an immigration matter but was given no further explanation  One precious thing that this ban deprives me of  and that I cannot compensate  is being at my daughter s wedding   Mr  Barghouti said   I am hurt  but I am not deterred  Critics say American laws against supporters of the boycott are unconstitutional and limit free speech  But this year  the Senate passed a bill to safeguard the right of states to adopt anti B D S  laws The episode comes days after Israelis voted in parliamentary elections that are expected to result in a fifth term for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  Many Arabs see his agenda as increasingly discriminatory President Trump is one of Mr  Netanyahu s key allies and has offered support for many of his contentious policies  Mr  Trump has recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights   a territory captured from Syria in the 1967 war A State Department spokesman declined to provide information about Mr  Barghouti s case  citing confidentiality requirements James Zogby  the president of the Arab American Institute  called Mr  Barghouti a  leading Palestinian voice on human rights   The denial of entry is  the latest example of the Trump administration s disregard for those rights   he added  It is clear this arbitrary political decision is motivated by this administration s effort to silence Palestinian voices   Mr  Zogby said  citing recent bills and resolutions targeting the B D S  movement The move by states and  more recently  the federal government to take action against those who support the B D S  movement has been a point of contention  While some say the laws protect Israel and guard against anti Semitism  others say they limit freedom of speech Former President Jimmy Carter denounced the anti B D S  bill this month and urged the House of Representatives to reject it  Under our Constitution  people and legal entities have the right to express political views without fear of consequences   he said   U S  courts have protected the right of individuals to participate in boycotts as a form of political protest  The same protection applies to the right to advocate or oppose B D S  Israel maintains that the movement is part of a campaign to delegitimize the country The Israel government had previously restricted Mr  Barghouti s ability to exit and enter the country by refusing to renew his travel documentation  In February  Amnesty International called for an end to the  arbitrary travel ban  on him Eventually issued an Israeli travel document  he already had a visa for the United States that was valid through January 2021 Israel has also made efforts to restrict the entry of boycott supporters into the country  In January  Israel published a list of 20 United States based organizations that support the B D S  movement and whose leaders are now banned from entry into Israel

There s no reason to mourn Kirstjen Nielsen s departure from the Department of Homeland Security  She was an immigration hard liner working aggressively to carry out President Trump s restrictionist agenda  She spearheaded efforts to crack down on migrants and asylum seekers  She requested military assistance at the border  She limited the number of people who can legally present for asylum at ports of entry  And she vastly increased the number of immigrants in detention She also carried out the president s  zero tolerance  policy  resulting in the separation of thousands of families at our border with Mexico  Many parents are still searching for their children But there were limits to Nielsen s embrace of Trump s immigration policies  She pushed back on his demands to break the law to stop migrants from entering the country  according to The Times  and repeatedly reminded the president of  the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws  court settlements and international obligations  In almost any other administration  this would be unremarkable  It simply means Nielsen took her job and its legal obligations seriously   what we would expect from any civil servant  But Trump is unusual among modern presidents for his routine elevation of people who lack that basic sense of public ethics  If regular pressure to break the law was part of Nielsen s decision to leave the administration  then her departure illustrates how any belief in the public good  no matter how slight  is incompatible with working for this president  even if you share his views  Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing  culture and ideas from around the internet  For exclusive thoughts  photos and reading recommendations  sign up for his newsletter  This was evident from previous resignations and firings  Rex Tillerson  Trump s first secretary of state  seemed to share the president s skepticism of the department  carrying out an agenda meant to shrink its influence  But when Trump wanted to break the law   which  Tillerson said in an interview after leaving the administration  was  often    Tillerson would push back  unwilling to completely subordinate himself to the president s will   I would have to say to him   Mr  President  I understand what you want to do  but you can t do it that way  It violates the law   The president s first attorney general  Jeff Sessions  faced similar pressures after he recused himself from any investigations related to the prospect of Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election  Sessions took that step after The Washington Post revealed his meetings with the Russian ambassador  Sergey Kislyak  during the campaign   the kind of contact he had denied during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Trump was furious  which grew into rage after the deputy attorney general  Rod Rosenstein  appointed Robert Mueller special counsel  Trump reportedly berated Sessions in the Oval Office   which the attorney general called his  most humiliating experience in decades of public life    and complained that the recusal was  unfair  Trump wanted Sessions to derail the Russia investigation and protect him from scrutiny  essentially making himself above the law  And he spent much of 2018 pressuring the attorney general to do just that  either attacking him in public or cajoling him in private  Sessions  who shared Trump s politics but not his complete contempt for the rule of law  wouldn t budge   As long as I am the attorney general  I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor  and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution   he said in a February 2018 statement  This stalemate resolved itself after the midterm elections  when a frustrated and weakened Trump finally fired Sessions  replacing him temporarily with Matthew Whitaker  a loyalist who served as Sessions s chief of staff  and permanently with William Barr  who served as attorney general under George H W  Bush  shielding him from the fallout of the Iran contra scandal The overall pattern is clear  Trump wants to act with impunity  breaking the law if he needs or even just wants to  His appointees  who share his goals but not his methods  resist  He scolds and attacks them until they resign  replacing them with loyalists who may actually bend to his will Rex Tillerson was replaced by Mike Pompeo  then serving as director of the C I A  Unlike Tillerson  who attempted to contain Trump s worst instincts  Pompeo has been willing to say or do nearly anything to stay in Trump s favor  It s why he would echo the president s widely criticized flattery of Kim Jong un and the North Korean government Trump says that Kevin McAleenan  until now the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  will take over for Nielsen as acting secretary of Homeland Security  Like Nielsen  McAleenan backs the president s harsh border policies  He defended border patrol agents after they used tear gas on hundreds of migrants  including women and children  who tried to enter the United States near Tijuana  Mexico  Some attorneys say it s unclear if Trump can elevate McAleenan  since the laws regarding succession point to under secretary for management Claire Grady as next in line as acting director For a more permanent replacement  Trump is reportedly considering Ken Cuccinelli  the former Virginia attorney general turned conservative television personality  and Kris Kobach  the former Kansas secretary of state notorious for his aggressively anti immigrant policies With either choice  Trump would affirm the pattern of his administration so far  jettisoning people who act as if they were accountable to the public and replacing them with people who above all are loyal to Trump  willing to go in the  tougher    and possibly illegal   direction he demands on kirstjen

WASHINGTON   U S  congressional Democrats on Saturday headed for a showdown with the Internal Revenue Service over President Donald Trump s tax returns  setting a new hard deadline of April 23 for the federal tax agency to hand the documents over to lawmakers In an April 13 letter that appeared to move Democrats closer to a federal court battle against the Trump administration  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal warned the IRS that failure to comply with his request for six years of Trump s individual and business returns by April 23 would be interpreted as a denial The Trump administration has already missed an initial April 10 deadline for providing the tax records  which Neal first set when he made his request on April 3  Democrats based their request on the panel s jurisdiction over IRS enforcement of the tax laws regarding U S  presidents But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that Neal was  just picking arbitrary dates  in setting deadlines and said it was more important to get the decision  right  to ensure the IRS would not be  weaponized  in a political dispute   I do intend to follow the law  But I think these raise very  very complicated legal issues  I don t think these are simple issues  There are constitutional issues   he told reporters on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington He could not say whether the Treasury  which oversees the IRS  would complete its review of Neal s request by April 23  Mnuchin  who has consulted with the White House and Department of Justice about Trump s tax returns  said earlier this week that Neal s request raised concerns about the scope of the committee s authority  privacy protections for U S  taxpayers and the legislative purpose of lawmakers in seeking the documents  He said he has not spoken personally to Attorney General William Barr about the request   Those concerns lack merit  Moreover  judicial precedent commands that none of the concerns raised can legitimately be used to deny the committee s request   Neal told IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig in his letter   It is not the proper function of the IRS  Treasury or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information  Please know that  if you fail to comply  your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request   Neal wrote As Ways and Means chairman  Neal is the only lawmaker in the House of Representatives authorized to request individual tax information under a federal law that says that the Treasury secretary  shall furnish  the data Despite the law s clarity  Democrats have long acknowledged that the request  if denied  would mean a federal court battle that could ultimately be settled by the U S  Supreme Court  Legal experts say lawmakers could vote to hold administration officials in contempt of Congress  which would provide a basis for the House to ask a federal judge to order the Treasury Department to comply Congressional Republicans have condemned Neal s request as a political fishing expedition by Democrats  while the White House has said the documents will  never  be turned over  But Congress would likely win a court fight  though it could take months or even years to unfold  experts say  Neal s request for the returns of a sitting president is unprecedented  and legal experts say its success or failure may depend on a court ruling about the committee s legislative purpose for seeking the documents  Neal said in his letter that the request is needed to further  legislative proposals and oversight related to our Federal tax laws  including but not limited to  the extent to which the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a President   Democrats want Trump s tax returns as part of their investigations of possible conflicts of interest posed by his continued ownership of extensive business interests  even as he serves the public as president  Trump broke with a decades old precedent by refusing to release his returns as a presidential candidate in 2016 and continues to do so as president  saying his tax returns are under IRS audit  But the president s former personal lawyer  Michael Cohen  told a House panel in February that he does not believe Trump s taxes are under audit  Cohen said the president feared that releasing his returns could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties   Reporting by David Morgan  additional reporting by David Lawder  Pete Schroeder and Jan Wolfe  Editing by James Dalgleish  Dan Grebler and Jonathan Oatis

Welcome to Crossing the Border  a limited run weekly newsletter from The New York Times  Like what you see  Send this to a friend  If someone forwarded it to you  sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox This border wall has doors  Big ones By Manny Fernandez in Los Indios  Tex The border wall doesn t get any shorter or stranger than this   giant  pointy topped steel pillars that would seem imposing  if only there were more of them This border fence has exactly 36 burgundy colored beams  They stand alone on a grassy island in South Texas where two dirt roads intersect  It s open on the left and open on the right  You can walk around the whole thing at a fast clip in 17 36 seconds  a quick lap around a pocket sized piece of America s border security The line that is the border wall here is dotted  It zigs  It zags  It stops  It starts  It stops again  It has corners where it mimics the twists and turns of the Rio Grande  And it has doors  Sometimes  these doors are gates that open when a code is entered on a keypad  Sometimes  these doors are full fledged openings   a road cuts into the fence  leaving a gap that essentially gives the Border Patrol one more thing to worry about The mini wall is the unusual product of two such openings  The fence line in the Texas border town of Los Indios spreads out north of the Los Indios International Bridge  about 20 miles northwest of Brownsville  The steel slat wall traces a path parallel to Robertson Street  in a flat rural landscape of corn and grain sorghum fields  But at the point where Robertson Street intersects with Rio Grande Avenue  the border wall takes a hard left and flows to the west along Rio Grande Avenue The fence designers created an opening on Robertson but also put another one at Rio Grande  So as the fence turns at this intersection  the two openings create a leftover morsel of wall in the middle  a lonely  taxpayer funded gothic median President Trump lamented the various doors in the border wall last week  during a border security roundtable in Calexico  Calif  He talked about a stretch of fence along the Rio Grande that had been erected under previous administrations  saying it was  not a good looking wall  because it had  36 doors that you can drive a truck through   So now we re filling up those big  those big gaping wounds in this wall and it s going to have a big effect   Mr  Trump said But it s unclear if the president was aware of this Los Indios patch  which was built around 2009  Local and federal officials said the funding dried up to close the openings and install gates that would connect the grassy island with the rest of the fencing Representative Filemon B  Vela Jr   a Democrat who represents Brownsville in Congress and whose district includes Los Indios  said the little piece of fence illustrated the pointlessness of a border wall  regardless of which administration built it  I ve voted against every single piece of border wall funding that s ever come up  and I m going to continue to do so   Mr  Vela said   Decisions are being made in Washington in terms of where to put fencing that don t make any sense  As the president suggested  this strange little spot s days appear to be numbered  A Border Patrol official who oversees the Los Indios area  Henry Leo  the patrol agent in charge of the agency s station in Harlingen  Tex   said plans are in the works to finally install the necessary gates in the next one to three years  We did request additional fencing and gates in that area  so what you see right now is not the complete picture   Mr  Leo said   The plan is to connect to that piece of fencing and make it a continuous fence with gates  Both Mr  Leo and the mayor of Los Indios  Rick Cavazos  defended the fence in the area  including the stand alone section  saying that overall the fencing had helped decrease illegal crossings   I saw a dramatic decline in crossings and apprehensions as a result of the barrier   said Mr  Cavazos  who is a retired Border Patrol agent   In 2004  2005  2006  this was a high crossing area  People would come up from the river  The numbers went down  On a hot April afternoon  it was all quiet at the fence island  The loudest sound was the soil  the dry brush  dirt and grass crunches underfoot  The pillars of the fence are as rough as sandpaper  and leave little red flakes on your fingertips that resemble chili powder Adding to the head scratching quality of this fence is its location On one side of the fence is America  But the other side is America  too  The fence runs inland  far from the river  the middle of which is the official boundary between Mexico and the United States  That means this 36 beam fence in one sense divides the country itself  In that sense  the openings in the fence are necessary  They allow property owners and ranchers to access their land that is north of the river but south of the fence  a region locals call a  no man s land  Here  as much as anywhere  the Border Patrol is watching  Walk around the spot  and it s only a matter of minutes before two agents drive up in marked and unmarked vehicles Manny is one of a team of New York

Republican of California  and Kirstjen Nielsen  then the Homeland Security Secretary CreditAl Drago for The New York TimesAn intense week for border newsBy Caitlin Dickerson  New York Times national immigration reporterFirst came the news that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had resigned  likely at the request of President Trump  Then  at least two other high ranking agency officials were pegged for dismissal   all of it happening days after the president had pulled back on his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement  with Mr  Trump telling reporters that he had decided to go in a  tougher direction  It s been a whirlwind week on the immigration front  with all signs suggesting that the president plans to triple down on his goal of securing the border  The unusually large number of heads rolling around Washington seemed to indicate that anyone with misgivings about the administration s plans will be asked   if not forced   to leave Mr  Trump is operating under mounting pressure from unauthorized border crossings that are steadily increasing  And he s contending with the painful reality that after 14 months of harsh policies designed to discourage immigration  he  the president who was elected on a promise to crack down on border crossings  has not made a meaningful dent in them To the contrary  whoever fills the now open jobs in his administration will have to contend with record numbers of Central American families seeking asylum  all of whom are being processed through a decades old system that is not equipped to handle them  And their efforts will be frustrated by the same set of laws and court settlements that have blocked many of the administration s attempts thus far from going into effect It was those laws that led to the downfall of Ms  Nielsen  who lost her job because the president felt that she was not hawkish enough  Though she became known during her tenure as the public face of many of Mr  Trump s most controversial immigration policies  including family separation  in private  the two had often clashed when she cautioned him about the legal and logistical constraints that rendered his policy ideas untenable Read earlier installments of Crossing the Border here  Sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox

NEW YORK   John Murante  a conservative Nebraska senator  last year introduced a bill to prevent non citizens from being counted when the state redraws its voting maps He said the effort aimed to ensure each election district contained similar numbers of voters  but opponents argued it intended to undermine the political power of immigrant communities Murante s bill died after its critics pointed out a lack of granular data on where the state s non citizens live  That data may soon be available The Trump administration believes its proposed question about citizenship on the 2020 Census will help states that want to draw citizens only voting districts in the next round of redistricting by providing the first comprehensive data on non citizens in about 70 years  according to a Reuters review of court and federal register documents and interviews with more than a dozen state lawmakers Such a change would provide a new opportunity for Republican controlled states   those most likely to adopt citizens only redistricting   to redraw their voting maps in a way that could help their party win more state level elections Currently  state and federal voting districts are drawn to be roughly equal in population  regardless of how many residents can legally vote  That means tallies for district drawing purposes include non citizens  such as green card holders and undocumented immigrants Democrats and immigrant rights activists say this system ensures elected leaders represent everyone in their district who depends on public services such as schools and trash pickup  regardless of voting eligibility Republicans argue that districts should be the same size so each vote carries the same weight  If one district has far fewer eligible voters than another  each vote there has more influence on election outcomes  That s a problem for Republicans because the eligible voters in immigrant heavy districts tend to support Democrats Trump administration officials have been considering the merits of citizens only redistricting since 2017   well before announcing their intention in March 2018 to add the citizenship question to the decennial survey  according to court documents filed as part of litigation over the citizenship question And in December  the Census Bureau issued a notice in the Federal Register saying that if any states  indicate a need for     citizenship data  to use in redistricting  it would  make a design change  to provide it Republican lawmakers in Texas  Arizona  Missouri and Nebraska told Reuters they would consider making use of the citizenship data if it became available The tactic is prohibited at the federal level by past U S  Supreme Court decisions that have interpreted the U S  constitution as requiring that U S  House districts be based on total population  But the court  in a 2016 case known as Evenwel v  Abbott  left the door open for state level districts to use other metrics The Commerce Department  which includes the Census Bureau  declined to comment on whether redistricting was part of the motivation for proposing the citizenship question  James Whitehorne  the chief of the Census Bureau s Redistricting   Voting Rights Office  called the federal register notice routine   We re supposed to provide states with what they identify as needing   he said U S  voting districts are drawn at the state level  most often by state legislators  giving the party in power control over how the lines are redrawn  While both Republicans and Democrats frame the debate over citizen only districts around fairness  demographic experts point out that both sides have a lot at stake politically Data from the nonpartisan APM Research Lab showed that 95 of the 100 U S  congressional districts with the highest foreign born populations are represented by Democrats  Similar data for state level seats was not available Redrawing such districts with citizen only populations would give Republicans a better shot by expanding the districts into more conservative areas  said Albert Kauffman  a professor at St  Mary s School of Law in San Antonio who has studied redistricting and opposes excluding non citizens  In Texas  a citizens only map could strip Latino voters of majorities in two or three state senate seats and six or seven state representative seats  Kauffman said  pointing out that Hispanic voters traditionally lean left   Democrats know they would probably lose seats at every level   Kauffman said SUPREME CHALLENGEImmigrant rights activists and Democratic led cities and states have sued the Trump administration to prevent it from asking census respondents about their citizenship  and the Supreme Court will decide by June if the question can remain Opponents argue the administration aims to use the question to intimidate immigrants out of responding to the census  which would cost their communities political representation and a share of about  800 billion in annual federal aid allocated based on population The administration disputes that  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his decision to add the question was aimed at getting the Justice Department the comprehensive citizenship data it needs to better enforce Voting Rights Act provisions that protect minorities from discrimination  Ross has not publicly commented on how citizenship data might be used in redistricting  But Census records  as well as emails released during the litigation over the citizenship question  showed he was thinking about citizens only redistricting well before he announced plans to add the question In April of 2017  at the behest of former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon  Ross spoke with former Kansas Secretary of State and noted immigration hawk Kris Kobach  according to the emails  One topic of discussion was  the problem that aliens     are still counted for congressional apportionment   according to a subsequent email from Kobach to Ross describing their conversation  The following month  Ross asked Commerce Senior Policy Advisor David Langdon to look into whether non citizens  including illegal immigrants  are included in voting maps  according to Langdon s deposition in the litigation over the citizenship question  Kobach and Langdon did not respond to requests for comment  ATTRACTING INTERESTA handful of states will likely request the census data on citizenship if the question survives its legal challenges  state lawmakers and a Republican strategist told Reuters  Lawmakers and state officials from Arizona  Missouri  Nebraska and Texas said in interviews they are considering citizen only districts  Republicans in Tennessee also voiced support for citizens only redistricting in court papers filed in the Evenwel Supreme Court case  Reuters reached out to several of the Tennessee lawmakers who signed the court brief  but all declined to comment Missouri Representative Dean Plocher  a Republican who sponsored unsuccessful legislation last year to base Missouri s voting districts on citizen population  said the effort is aimed solely at equalizing the power of all votes in the state  He said he hadn t considered how such changes might affect his party s chances in elections Nebraska s Murante   the former senator behind his state s failed citizens only redistricting bill and now the state s treasurer   said he supports citizens only maps because the state s constitution requires that  aliens  be excluded from voting districts Immigrant rights activists counter that citizens only districts could be forced to expand in ways that weaken the political influence of immigrant communities The effect could be particularly pronounced in places such as south Texas  where immigrants make up more than a quarter of the population  said Juan Hinojosa  a Democratic state senator  Hinojosa s district includes areas known as colonias   informal communities of poor  largely Hispanic families  Citizen only redistricting would make it more likely that anti immigration Republicans would win elections in the border region  Hinojosa said The question of how to count non citizens in voting districts may end up at the Supreme Court  said Kel Seliger  a Republican Texas state senator  who told Reuters that lawmakers there would explore citizen only maps  You ve got be careful   he said   that the Republican bias doesn t get us on the wrong side of the Constitution     Reporting by Nick Brown  Editing by Richard Valdmanis  Brian Thevenot and Paul Thomasch  

Scientists have finally confirmed something they had doubted  that Mars does occasionally emit puffs of methane into its atmosphere  That doesn t necessarily mean what you presume it means  that the Red Planet is or once was home to alien cows or other forms of life  But it could Most of the methane on Earth is pumped out by microbes and other living creatures   most notoriously cows  which emit vast clouds of the greenhouse gas  though largely by burps  contrary to popular lore   So while sniffing methane may not be so thrilling on Earth  discovering that Mars is burping up the stuff   following confirmation that there is water below its rusty surface   fits a critical piece in a most intriguing puzzle Searching for life on Mars  or getting there  has obsessed earthlings ever since telescopes enabled them to spy on the neighboring globe  The passion persists  The methane report last week  from scientists working for the European Space Agency s Mars Express orbiter  was followed by a statement from the NASA administrator  Jim Bridenstine  that the agency hopes to send astronauts to Mars by 2033  One way or another  the rusty dot of twilight is getting awfully lively The notion of Martian life gained popularity and respectability when Percival Lowell  a well regarded scientist who founded the Lowell Observatory in Arizona  spent 15 years gazing at Mars at the close of the 19th century and came up with detailed maps of canals and oases  positing that they had been built by a civilization desperately tapping its last source of water as the planet dried up  That helped spur a rich Martian sci fi literature  including such classics as C S  Lewis s  Out of the Silent Planet   in which a dying Mars is populated by intelligent species that choose to become extinct rather than invade Earth Sadly  science eventually quashed the Lowellian vision of intelligent life forms digging ditches to delay their end  though it s something earthlings might ponder as they relentlessly accelerate their planet s doom by pumping carbon dioxide and other climate altering gases  including methane  into the atmosphere  But if there are no canals or oases on Mars  there is liquid water  the sine qua non of life as we know it  and something burping up methane  a signature  though not a proof  of life The former was confirmed in July when Italian scientists working for the Mars Express mission reported that they had detected a 12 mile wide underground liquid pool near the Martian South Pole  And now the same team of scientists has confirmed earlier readings of wafts of methane by measurements from the Mars Express orbiter and from NASA s Curiosity rover Neither is proof of life  The lake was probably too salty to freeze  and therefore too salty for life  and methane can be produced by geological processes  or it could have been produced eons ago and trapped under ice  So the search goes on  But at least scientists have pinpointed where the gas is coming from  which is within the Gale Crater  near the Martian Equator  where the Curiosity rover is still actively sniffing and sifting for microbial life That might be a good spot for NASA s astronauts to start their explorations  perhaps scoping sites for the canals and oases desperate earthlings will need when they flee their overheated planet  In the meantime  the European Space Agency invites all  citizens of planet Earth  to compete for a 30 second audio file that will be played on Mars in an experiment planned for the ExoMars 2020 mission  The file will also be broadcast on Earth  so the Czech organizers urge a message  valid for the world today  More on Mars from Times Opinion Opinion   The Editorial BoardAn Intrepid Explorer of Mars Falls SilentFeb  15  2019Opinion   The Editorial BoardMars BeckonsNov  27  2018Opinion   Tim KreiderEarthlings  Unite  Let s Go to MarsDec  16  2017The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

WASHINGTON   U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday a U S  China trade agreement would go  way beyond  previous efforts to open China s markets to U S  companies and hoped that the two sides were  close to the final round  of negotiations Mnuchin  speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings  said that he and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would hold two calls next week with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  The officials also were discussing whether more in person meetings were necessary to conclude an agreement  I think we re hopeful that we re getting close to the final round of concluding issues   Mnuchin said Beijing and Washington are seeking a deal to end a bitter trade war marked by tit for tat tariffs that have cost the world s two largest economies billions of dollars  disrupted supply chains and rattled financial markets The United States is seeking sweeping changes to China s economic and trade policies  including new protections for U S  intellectual property  an end to forced technology transfers and cyber theft of trade secrets  Washington also wants Beijing to curb industrial subsidies  open its economy wider to U S  companies and increase purchases of American farm  energy and manufactured goods to shrink a  419 billion U S  trade deficit with China  Asked whether market openings in the agreement would go beyond what was contemplated in the 2016 Bilateral Investment Treaty negotiations  he replied   We are making progress  I want to be careful  This is not a public negotiation     this is a very  very detailed agreement covering issues that have never been dealt with before   Mnuchin said   This is way beyond anything that looked like a bilateral investment treaty  The BIT talks  pursued by former President Barack Obama s administration  stalled as China refused to satisfy U S  demands to open significant sectors of its economy to foreign investment  The talks were not taken up by the Trump administration  which pursued tariffs on Chinese goods instead  leading to the current talks  Mnuchin said the two sides are negotiating an agreement with seven chapters that would be  the most significant change in the trading relationship in 40 years  He said the deal would have  real enforcement on both sides   adding that the United States was open to being subjected to penalties if it failed to keep its commitments in the deal  I would expect that the enforcement mechanism works in both directions  that we expect to honor our commitments  and if we don t  there should be certain repercussions  and the same way in the other direction   said the Treasury chief  who is playing a key role in the negotiations with China   Reporting by David Lawder and Pete Schroeder  Editing by Paul Simao and Andrea Ricci  

NEW YORK   Democratic U S  mayors said on Friday their cities would welcome illegal immigrants  dismissing President Donald Trump s threats to transport people detained at the border to  sanctuary cities  as illustrating the White House s callous approach to the issue Trump confirmed on Twitter that he wanted to transport people detained in his immigration crackdown at the U S  Mexico border to sanctuary cities  an informal designation for localities that refrain from assisting federal immigration authorities in detaining people living in the country illegally Mayors from across the country were quick to respond to Trump s latest portrayal of immigrants and sanctuary cities as threats In New York City  where nearly 40 percent of the population are immigrants  Mayor Bill de Blasio said Trump s immigration policy was rooted in cruelty  He uses people like pawns   de Blasio said in a statement   New York City will always be the ultimate city of immigrants   the President s empty threats won t change that  In Philadelphia  known as the city of brotherly love  Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement that his city  would be prepared to welcome these immigrants just as we have embraced our immigrant communities for decades   He said the White House was demonstrating  the utter contempt that the Trump Administration has for basic human dignity  The Republican president has made cracking down on illegal and legal immigration a centrepiece of his administration  and has regularly threatened to try to cut federal funding to programmes in generally Democratic leaning sanctuary cities  counties and states  Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws  we are indeed  as reported  giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only   Trump wrote on Twitter  confirming a Washington Post report  The mayor of Los Angeles  Eric Garcetti  responded by saying on Twitter   These are people  not pawns  Mr  President  At least one governor  New Mexico s Michelle Lujan Grisham  weighed in  calling the plan  absurd  sad and all too characteristic of the president   not to mention indicative of a complete and cruel indifference to the plight of migrant families  The mayors of Oakland  California  and Takoma Park  Maryland  voiced similar reactions Trump s latest move on immigration comes days after U S  officials said they arrested or denied entry to over 103 000 people along the border with Mexico in March  more than twice as many as the same period last year  I am shocked but not surprised that once again this president is playing a cynical game with people s lives in order to score political points   Jesse Arreguin  the mayor of Berkeley  California  said in a statement   Rather than supporting a real pathway to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in this country  he is fanning the flames of division    Reporting by Jonathan Allen  editing by Jonathan Oatis and Leslie Adler  

PHOENIX   Yousuf Abdelfatah already knows the answer he ll give about his race on the 2020 census questionnaire will be wrong He s an Arab American  but the only race options on the census are white  black  Asian and categories for American Indian  Alaska Native  Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander  Reluctantly  Abdelfatah will mark white  If you look at me  my skin is darker  I m visibly not white   said the 22 year old research assistant   I ve lived my life as a person of color  but I m categorized as white  With the census going to printing presses later this year  Arab Americans are again feeling left out of a process that helps draw the nation s political map and provide an accurate population count  which in turn can determine how much federal funding minority groups get for government programs and medical research Organizations have long been pushing for a separate Middle Eastern or North African category but realize it s probably too late for 2020 with questionnaires ready to be printed  The census is in our Constitution and it s meant to count everyone   said Maya Berry  the executive director of the Arab American Institution According to census estimates  the Arab American population is measured at just over 2 million people  The Arab American Institute  however  says that number is closer to 3 6 million Underreporting from the census has come amid a rapid growth of the community  which advocates say has increased by more than 72  between 2000 and 2010 Population data is a key factor in political redistricting  researching human rights  monitoring government programs and antidiscrimination laws  meaning Arab Americans are subject to a lack of representation and health and social services  Right now we have that  white  designation on paper but we don t benefit from it   said 24 year old activist and organizer Naia Al Anbar   The truth is we aren t ever going to be white in their eyes and we will still be discriminated against  Al Anbar  who generally supports the idea of a new category  has a Saudi Arabian father and would mark  other  on the census if a more precise category isn t offered The Arab American Institute considers 22 countries to consist of Arabs  spanning Africa and Asia  meaning Arab Americans can fall into several categories provided in the survey This creates an odd decision during the census for Arab Americans  Does someone from Egypt  for example  check the African American box because their home country is in Africa  Would someone from Iraq be expected to mark that they are Asian  As an Egyptian  I considered marking  African American  but I m not black   24 year old Nashville resident Dina El Rifai said   However  marking  white  doesn t reflect who I am or the diversity I bring  In another complicating factor  the Trump administration wants to ask people whether they are American citizens on the census   an issue that is supposed to be resolved by the U S  Supreme Court this summer before the forms are printed  Some fear that will stifle participation among various immigrant groups  especially in the aftermath of the administration s travel ban from Muslim countries that spread fear among Arab Americans This question would discourage 30  of Arab Americans from taking the survey  a study by the American Arab Anti Defamation Committee found The Arab American Institute and other groups have worked on getting an Arab category introduced in the census for decades but have always been met with opposition  That was until 2009  when the Census Bureau concluded that it would introduce a Middle Eastern and North African category for the next cycle after years of trials and tests  Test results found that the vast majority of Arab Americans supported the issue and would mark the new option on the census But the momentum came to a halt when a new executive government was voted in to power  After all that work  and all the millions spent  the Trump administration came in for what we believe are political reasons to put an end to it   said Samer Khalaf  president of the American Arab Anti Defamation Committee   Their reasoning was that additional testing would be required  The Census Bureau did not comment about the Middle Eastern category  but pointed to previous news conferences where policy leaders discussed how more research was needed to include a Middle Eastern North African category not as a race  but as an ethnicity  We do feel that more research and testing is needed before we can proceed to implement or propose to implement a separate Middle Eastern or North African category   Census Bureau chief of Population Karen Battle said at a program review in January 2018 That would be a step in the right direction for many Arab Americans  as it could lead to a better count and more research and federal funding to benefit their communities  The most important thing is that we are on the cusp of getting the Census Bureau to finally get the

WASHINGTON   A top House Democrat on Saturday ratcheted up his demand for access to President Donald Trump s tax returns  telling the IRS that the law clearly gives Congress a right to them  The government s failure to respond by an April 23 deadline could send the dispute into federal court Trump s treasury chief  who oversees the IRS  cited  complicated legal issues  and bemoaned  an arbitrary deadline  set by Congress  while saying he would answer in that time frame A new letter by Rep  Richard Neal  the House Ways and Means Committee chairman  comes after the Trump administration asked for more time to consider his initial request last week  Neal had requested six years of Trump s personal and business tax returns  Neal  D Mass   argues that a 1920 era law saying the IRS  shall furnish  any tax return requested by Congress  is unambiguous and raises no complicated legal issues  and that the Treasury Department s objections lack merit The letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig is the latest exchange in a tug of war over Trump s returns  which would give lawmakers far greater insight into the president s business dealings and potential conflicts of interest as it exercises its oversight role Asked about the letter Saturday  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would respond to within the new deadline set by Neal but he did not promise to produce Trump s tax returns by that time  Mnuchin is the Cabinet secretary that oversees the IRS Mnuchin took issue with Neal s characterization of the dispute as a straightforward issue in light of the law governing the matter  These are complicated legal issues and I think it is more important to the American taxpayers that we get this right than we hit an arbitrary deadline   Mnuchin told reporters   I would just emphasize this is a decision that has enormous precedence in terms of potentially weaponizing the IRS  Mnuchin said that Treasury Department lawyers have been working  diligently  to research the issues involved and have been in contact with Justice Department attorneys  But he said he has not personally discussed the issue with Attorney General William Barr Mnuchin said he thought Neal was just picking arbitrary deadline and he refused to speculate how the administration would proceed if the issue goes to court Trump declined to provide his tax information as a candidate in 2016 and as president  something party nominees have traditionally done in the name of the transparency  By withholding his tax returns  Trump has not followed the standard followed by presidents since Richard Nixon started the practice in 1969 During the campaign  Trump said he wanted to release his returns but said because he was under a routine audit   I can t   Being under audit is no legal bar to anyone releasing his or her returns  And after the November midterm elections  Trump claimed at a news conference that the filings were too complex for people to understand Asked repeatedly at a House hearing Tuesday whether any regulation prohibited a taxpayer from disclosing returns when under audit  Rettig responded  no  The issue appears sure to end up in federal court  With an eye to a legal challenge  Neal told Rettig that he has two weeks to respond   by 5 p m  on April 23  If Rettig fails to do so  Neal said he will interpret as denying the request  which could pave the way for a court battle  Neal also could seek the returns through a subpoena Mnuchin had told Neal this past week that he needs more time to consider the unprecedented demand for Trump s returns and needs to consult with the Justice Department about it At congressional hearings  Mnuchin accused lawmakers of seeking Trump s returns for political reasons  But he also acknowledged his  statutory responsibilities  and that he respects congressional oversight  Some Treasury watchers observe that Mnuchin s decision to consult with the Justice Department could suggest that Treasury lawyers believe Neal has a legal right to Trump s returns Neal said Saturday that the administration has no right  to question or second guess  his motivations Trump s acting chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  has said Democrats will  never  see the returns   nor should they   and  they know it   Mulvaney has tried to frame the issue of the president s taxes as old news  saying it was  already litigated during the election  and the American people  elected him anyway  William Consovoy  whose firm was retained by Trump to represent him on the matter  has written the Treasury s general counsel and said the congressional request  would set a dangerous precedent  if granted and that the IRS cannot legally divulge the information    AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report

Jae in   I think that sanctions right now are at a level that s a fair level  Moon  for his part  has called for an easing of sanctions  including those holding back joint economic projects between North and South Korea  Trump said he would favor easing those sanctions at the right time but added   This isn t the right time  He said he was open to discussing smaller steps  such as helping to ease North Korea s humanitarian problems  but that  in general  the U S  wants sanctions to remain  There are various smaller deals that maybe could happen   Trump said  You could work out step by step pieces  but at this moment  we re talking about the big deal  The big deal is we have to get rid of the nuclear weapons  Negotiations on Pyongyang s nuclear program appear to be stalled  and there is uncertainty over whether Kim is considering backing out of talks or restarting nuclear and missile tests  The Korean Central News Agency on Thursday said that at a party meeting on Wednesday  Kim stressed  self reliance  in his country to  deal a telling blow to the hostile forces  that  go with bloodshot eyes miscalculating that sanctions can bring  North Korea  to its knees  Moon said it s important to maintain the  momentum of dialogue  and express a positive outlook to the international community that a  third U S  North Korea summit  will be held  I d like to express my high regard for how you have continued to express your trust towards Chairman Kim   Moon said   And also  you have made sure that North Korea does not deviate from the dialogue track  The United States and North Korea have accused each other of causing the Hanoi summit s breakdown  But they haven t formally abandoned diplomacy  Moon  a liberal who facilitated U S  North Korea diplomacy last year  told Trump that he would push for an inter Korean summit with Kim  according to Moon s office  Moon met Kim three times last year At the White House  Moon did not publicly address the issue of sanctions  But several North Korea watchers  including Sue Mi Terry  a North Korean expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Asia analyst at the CIA  said Moon is trying to persuade

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae in comes amid uncertainty over whether the leader of North Korea is considering backing out of nuclear negotiations or restarting nuclear and missile tests Trump  in his first meeting with Moon since the unsuccessful U S  summit with Kim in Hanoi  said the U S  wants to keep economic sanctions in place to pressure Kim to denuclearize  But Trump said he retains good relations with Kim and didn t rule out a third summit or taking steps to ease food or other shortages in the repressive nation  We want sanctions to

LEESBURG  Va    House Democrats insisted on Thursday that they remained optimistic about potential compromises with the Trump administration on infrastructure  prescription drugs prices and immigration  even as they criticized the president s prospective Federal Reserve Board picks and his recent comments about migrants and asylum seekers The balance that Speaker Nancy Pelosi  her deputies and new Democratic members sought to strike during an annual member retreat underscored the contradictions of their approach to divided government Even as they have railed against the president in pushing to expand their agenda and diverse majority  the Democrats still have clung to the possibility of compromise with President Trump and Senate Republicans to deliver some of their campaign promises Much of the agenda that Democrats worked to highlight at the three day conference at the Lansdowne Resort and Spa in suburban Virginia    putting check marks next to the to do list   as Representative Veronica Escobar  Democrat of Texas  put it   has yet to reach the Senate floor  And it is not likely to  with Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  in control The first 100 days of the Democrats  majority in the House included a record long government shutdown and involved partisan squabbling  including over tougher administration oversight and the scope of the party s priorities The retreat also offered a chance for lawmakers to regroup after multiple internal fissures that played out publicly  including a vote delay on a two year budget deal and efforts by the House Democratic campaign wing to shut down party challengers  This is bigger than us now   said Representative Jahana Hayes  Democrat of Connecticut   We re a country built on compromise  Several sessions at the conference aimed to address what lawmakers described as  kitchen table issues    maintaining economic growth  lowering drug prices and working toward what Ms  Pelosi said could be at least a  1 trillion infrastructure package  I m not giving up on the president   Ms  Pelosi said in reference to immigration overhaul  even as she bashed Mr  Trump s recent comments that the country was  full  and could not accept any more migrants But senior Democrats did not hold back from criticizing the president or the recent upheaval in his administration Ms  Pelosi and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York  the No  5 Democrat in the House  excoriated the two men Mr  Trump has singled out as potential nominees to the Fed  Stephen Moore  a conservative economic adviser to Mr  Trump  and Herman Cain  a former pizza executive whose 2012 bid for president ended over accusations of sexual misconduct   Neither man has been formally nominated   With stiff competition  these two appointments to the Fed are the worst  ill suited candidates the president could have come up with   Ms  Pelosi told reporters at the retreat Mr  Jeffries called the potential Fed picks an embarrassment   It s not clear to me if that s reality or a  Saturday Night Live  skit   he said By contrast  Ms  Pelosi praised Mr  Trump s handpicked Fed chairman  Jerome H  Powell  and his independence in the face of repeated criticism from the president  He spoke to House Democrats later Thursday in a closed door session on economic issues  a speech Ms  Pelosi said was not intended to be political In the session  Mr  Powell emphasized that his role is apolitical and emphasized the Fed s independence from political pressure  according to two people in the room Asked by Representative Carolyn B  Maloney  Democrat of New York  if he believed either prospective nominee to the board would be independent  Mr  Powell declined to comment Democrats at the retreat   which offered yoga sessions and a cooking class for lawmakers and their families   largely insisted their ideological divisions remained a strength  In one instance  Representative Jim Himes  Democrat of Connecticut  noted that moderates were responsible for the new majority  despite the emergence of a few progressive  rock stars  But Representative Ben Ray Luján  Democrat of New Mexico and the deputy speaker  shrugged off any disagreements   Make no mistake   he said   we get together to solve big problems  Ms  Pelosi  who entered the dinner on Wednesday night with her caucus and the celebrity couple John Legend and Chrissy Teigen to  We Are Family   rebuked news coverage that highlighted divisions in the wings of her new majority  telling reporters the next day   You guys have it all wrong  On Wednesday  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the majority leader  had argued that the decision against voting on a budget caps deal this week was not a blow to the Democratic agenda  The delay came after objections from the Congressional Progressive Caucus and fiscally conservative Democrats  Very frankly  we wouldn t have lost any vote this week if we wanted to win   Mr  Hoyer said  

On Thursday General Khalifa Hifter  the leader of eastern Libya militias  ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli  the capital  where the country s internationally backed Government of National Accord is led by Prime Minister Fayez al Sarraj Ghassan Salame  the United Nations envoy to Libya  had recently urged opposing Libyan factions to come together at a U N  brokered national conference in mid April to lay the groundwork for elections and pull Libya back from the brink  By ordering his forces toward Tripoli when U N  Secretary General António Guterres was in the city to help organize the national conference  General Hifter has made his disdain for the peace efforts clear The septuagenarian commander  who is backed by the United Arab Emirates  France  Egypt  Russia and Saudi Arabia  was aiming to scuttle the conference in a brazen bid for power  But he has encountered more resistance than he expected Despite appeals from the United Nations for stronger American diplomatic engagement  especially to restrain meddling by General Hifter s foreign backers  the Trump administration has long been uninterested in Libya  Recently  it seems to be warming to General Hifter  according to foreign diplomats we have spoken with  Such support from the Trump administration aligns well with the White House s ties to General Hifter s backers in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh  and President Trump s preference for authoritarian leaders A former officer in Muammar el Qaddafi s army  General Hifter broke with the dictator in the 1980s and received C I A  support before fleeing to Virginia  where he lived for two decades  He returned to Libya shortly before the NATO intervention in 2011 hoping to lead the revolution against Colonel Qaddafi  Sidelined by the rebels  he re emerged in 2014  waging a battle against Islamists in the eastern city of Benghazi  After years of fighting  he gained control over eastern Libya  Then he set his sights on Tripoli In recent days  clashes have broken out around the capital between General Hifter s forces and militias loosely allied with Mr  Sarraj s government  The country is entering a state of civil war The United Arab Emirates and Egypt have provided military support to General Hifter s campaign  according to U N  investigators  He was further emboldened after meeting King Salman of Saudi Arabia in late March  These Arab states back the Libyan general because he has vowed to eliminate political Islamists they oppose from Libya  France has been another key supporter and has provided clandestine advisers to his forces  The continued interference of these powers has undermined the efforts of the United Nations to mediate a peaceful solution Although the United States has officially backed the Tripoli Government of National Accord  continued American ambivalence on Libya or  worse  active support for General Hifter  could push Libya into greater conflict  This disorder could strengthen the Islamic State  which carried out a spate of attacks in Libya last year It s not hard to see why the White House could be drawn to General Hifter  Libya has the largest oil reserves in Africa  and the Trump administration reportedly sees Libya s oil production as important in keeping global prices low  In the past year  General Hifter s forces have secured oil facilities in Libya s central and southern regions  boosting output  He has highlighted his role in fighting terrorists  garnering favor among parts of the American military and intelligence agencies  He allowed the C I A  to establish a base in the eastern city of Benghazi  which he controls General Hifter also has Libyan supporters  His promise to establish order has been welcomed by Libyans exhausted by years of chaos and outraged at the failings of the weak Government of National Accord Despite this allure  he does not serve American interests  Nor is he the national savior he purports to be  He claims to be eradicating militias and building a professional army  but his forces depend heavily on militias  some of whom have committed war crimes  His common labeling as an anti Islamist is belied by his backing of Salafist armed groups  But most alarming is his apparent disdain for electoral politics  He has said that Libya is  not ripe for democracy   The recent history of the Arab world shows that such absolutism is not a formula for stability In General Hifter s case  the danger of more conflict is made even worse by the fact that he is not as strong as he seems  For all his aspirations  the general is unlikely to fully unite or subdue the country s factions and militias  His rise to power could provoke resistance by groups that fear reprisals and a return to dictatorship To avoid an escalation  American diplomatic intervention is needed now  Many Libyans actually want more American involvement  In our conversations over the years  it is clear that the United States still retains credibility in Libya as a relatively honest broker  especially when compared with the Europeans and Arabs pursuing competing and narrow interests In the summer of 2018  when General Hifter s forces seized oil facilities in central Libya  American diplomats  working alongside the U N  envoy  prevented these vital assets from falling out of the control of the internationally recognized government in Tripoli In the current crisis  similar American resolve is needed again  The Trump administration should issue a public censure of General Hifter and press for sanctions   both its own and through the United Nations   against the general for subverting efforts at a peaceful settlement and violating Security Council resolutions  In the past  such punitive measures have been applied to other militia leaders who have attacked the capital  Beyond this  greater American diplomatic leadership is needed to shift European and Arab states from backing an authoritarian to supporting a more inclusive path The United States cannot solve all of Libya s manifold problems  but the next several weeks offer a crucial window  and decisive American diplomacy could make all the difference  Without it  Libya risks spiraling into wider violence Frederic Wehrey is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of  The Burning Shores  Inside the Battle for the New Libya   Jeffrey

CROSBY  Texas WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump signed two executive orders in the heart of the Texas energy hub on Wednesday targeting the power of states to delay natural gas  coal and oil projects as he looks to build support ahead of next year s election Trump s orders direct his Environmental Protection Agency to change a part of the U S  clean water law that has allowed states to delay projects on environmental grounds  New York has delayed pipelines that would bring natural gas to New England  for example  and Washington state has stopped coal export terminals  My action today will cut through destructive permitting delays and denials     what takes you 20 years to get a permit  those days are gone   said Trump  surrounded by workers in hard hats and yellow vests He signed the orders at a training center for petroleum industry workers near Houston  an event sandwiched between fundraising events for the 2020 presidential campaign  Critics vowed to oppose Trump s actions  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the orders were a  gross overreach of federal authority that undermines New York s ability to protect our water quality and our environment   Any attempt to usurp state authority on the projects will be fought  tooth and nail   the Democrat said Chris Stockton  a spokesman for Williams Cos Inc  which has fought Cuomo s denial of its Constitution gas pipeline from Pennsylvania  said the company supported Trump s effort to  foster coordination  predictability and transparency in federal environmental review  The orders direct the EPA to review and update guidance issued during the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama on the so called 401 provision of the Clean Water Act  The measure required companies to get certifications from states before building interstate pipelines and projects approved by the federal government  In 2017  Washington Governor Jay Inslee  a Democrat and 2020 candidate for president  used the provision to block a permit for the Millennium Bulk Terminal  a coal export facility that would have expanded the ability of companies to send Western coal to Asian markets Inslee  who has centered his campaign on tackling climate change  said Trump s orders would put the country on a  fatal path  of unconstrained fossil fuel use and hold back clean energy development  EVERY TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL The orders are part of the Trump administration s  energy dominance  policy to increase oil  gas and coal production  but forcing the EPA changes will take time  A senior administration official told reporters the agency would have to follow normal procedures  including a comment period  and that projects already tied up in litigation  are obviously a much longer term issue   A lawyer with experience in energy regulation in the U S  government said it was unclear how much impact the orders would have  A change in the clean water law s requirement for companies to get permits from the states would have to be made in Congress  said Fred Jauss  a partner at the firm Dorsey   Whitney  Michael Brune  the chief of the Sierra Club  which sues the government frequently  said the group would fight the orders  with every tool at our disposal  One order directs the transportation secretary to propose allowing liquefied natural gas  a liquid form of the fuel  to be shipped in approved rail cars  The orders also give the president the power to issue permits for projects that span international borders  taking that power from the secretary of state  Trump issued a presidential permit last month for the long delayed Keystone XL pipeline to bring crude from Canada Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc supports the orders   focus on enhancing the predictability of the permitting process and the critical importance of investing in energy infrastructure in the U S  and Canada   company spokesman Michael Barnes said  Enbridge had an oil pipeline project from Canada to the United States halted by opposition in Michigan  The orders could also speed projects in Texas  Energy investors vying for permits to build oil export terminals along the Gulf Coast say they have worked closely with Trump officials in a bid to speed regulatory reviews of facilities capable of loading supertankers  U S  and state agencies overseeing permit applications have taken too long to approve projects  the investors said  adding they were worried their projects would miss the most profitable years of the U S  crude export boom  Four energy groups led by Trafigura AG  Carlyle Group  Enterprise Products Partners LP and Enbridge have applied to build terminals in Texas    Reporting by Jeff Mason in Crosby  Texas and Timothy Gardner in Washington  Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington  Collin Eaton in Houston and Jessica Resnick Ault and Scott Disavino in New York  Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney  

WASHINGTON   The U S  Justice Department on Thursday defended its handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report examining contacts between President Donald Trump s 2016 campaign and Russia as it faced increased pressure to make the document public The department said Attorney General William Barr must strike confidential information from the nearly 400 page document as reports surfaced in the news media that members of Mueller s team were unhappy with the way Barr had characterized its main conclusions House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler  already pressing Barr to release the entire unredacted report to Congress  expanded his demands  Nadler  a Democrat  called on Barr to immediately release summaries of the document prepared by Mueller s team  He also asked Barr to hand over communications between the special counsel s team and the department about the report The department said those summaries include secret grand jury information that cannot under law be made public Barr  appointed by the Republican president  has pledged to release a redacted version of the report by mid April Barr said last week that Mueller s 22 month inquiry did not establish that Trump s campaign conspired with Russia in the election  Barr also said Mueller also did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump had illegally interfered with the Russia investigation  which has cast a shadow over his presidency While Mueller did not exonerate Trump  Barr said he then concluded there was not enough evidence to show that Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice The New York Times and the Washington Post reported that some investigators were unhappy with the way Barr had described their findings  in a sign of tensions between some members of Mueller s team and administration officials overseeing the report s release Every page of Mueller s report contains a warning that it might contain confidential material  so Barr decided first to release the report s main findings as quickly as possible  Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said  The Department continues to work with the Special Counsel on appropriate redactions to the report so that it can be released to Congress and the public   Kupec said in a statement The Judiciary Committee authorized Nadler on Wednesday to subpoena the department to obtain Mueller s full report  moving closer to a legal clash with the Trump administration Congress  not Barr  should determine what gets made public  Nadler said  He has yet to issue a subpoena   We are entitled to that information and we need that information   Nadler told reporters on Thursday FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress he had not seen Mueller s report   Additional reporting by David Morgan and Sarah N  Lynch  Editing by Will Dunham and Ross Colvin  

The federal government wants to issue more visas for foreign workers to take temporary jobs in housekeeping  landscaping and other fields   even as President Trump seeks to seal off the border with Mexico  where most of those workers come from The Departments of Homeland Security and Labor said they planned to issue up to 30 000 additional H 2B visas through Sept  30  the end of the federal fiscal year  Congress has generally capped the number of visas  which businesses compete for  at 66 000  divided evenly between summer and winter seasons Only workers who had previously secured the visas would be eligible for the proposed additional ones The visas provide legal status for immigrants in temporary nonfarm jobs with landscaping companies  restaurants  hotels and amusement parks  among other industries Last fiscal year  about 75 percent of these visas were issued to workers from Mexico  according to State Department data  Visas were also issued to  among others  Jamaicans  Guatemalans and South Africans Business groups regularly push lawmakers to raise or eliminate the cap on the number of visas issued  a demand that has increased as unemployment has dropped and domestic workers have become more scarce The government s move to expand the H 2B program appeared inconsistent with the Trump administration s repeated message about a crisis on the southwestern border of the United States  On Saturday  Mr  Trump told a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition that  our country s full   What can we do  We can t handle any more   he said   Our country s full  You can t come in  I m sorry  Alex Nowrasteh  a senior immigration analyst with the Cato Institute  a libertarian think tank  said there were  a lot of contradictions  within the government s proposals  On one hand  we need more people because the economy is booming   he said   Then on the other hand  to say   The country is full  go back    it s impossible to reconcile those  The H 2B visa program  which started in the mid 20th century  has been a feature of a persistent debate over using foreign workers for seasonal labor Unions and immigration opponents argue that hiring H 2B workers suppresses wages and deprives Americans of jobs  Advocacy groups say foreign workers are often exploited  and employers say the cap encourages businesses to hire undocumented workers Andrea Palermo  a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security  did not directly answer questions about what was behind the plan for additional H 2B visas  She also did not address questions about the apparent contradiction in the administration s positions  Congress   not D H S    should be responsible for determining whether the annual numerical limitations for H 2B workers set by Congress need to be modified  and by how much  and for setting parameters to ensure that enough workers are available to meet employers  temporary needs throughout the year   she said The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday Mr  Nowrasteh said he favored the H 2B program   I think the economic benefits from the H 2B visa are very large  the benefits to the workers are huge   he said Because businesses are required to show that no American workers want the jobs  the cap  makes no sense   he said  If they try to hire Americans  and Americans don t want to do that job  then there should be no cap   he said Mr  Nowrasteh said he believed that H 2B visas for Mexican workers have helped drive down illegal immigration  He said expanding the program or eliminating the cap could also help reduce the number of undocumented immigrants from Central American countries Last month a bipartisan group of senators  led by Susan M  Collins and Angus S  King of Maine  asked the Department of Homeland Security to increase the number of visas as a way to support small businesses in a tight labor market  especially those preparing for the summer season  In the short run  many areas of our country simply lack the working age population needed to meet the demand for seasonal jobs   the senators wrote in a letter signed by 11 lawmakers   In some industries  particularly tourism  we fear that the demand for workers so far outstrips the available supply that businesses could be forced to curtail operations  putting at risk the jobs of American workers who fill year round positions at these establishments  But Mark Krikorian  the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies  which supports curbs on immigration  was critical of the program and said it enabled  businesses to avoid hiring people they d rather not hire   A nation with a third of a billion spanning an entire continent  with 50 million working age people not in the labor force  doesn t need to be importing labor   he said Mr  Krikorian said the proposed expansion of the program was not  backtracking or flip flopping  by the administration  The president has always been a big fan of these guest worker visas   said Mr  Krikorian  who noted that Mr  Trump s properties  such as Mar a Lago  use this visa program to hire workers

MERIDA  Mexico   Business and political leaders from the U S  and Mexico gathered Friday to promote greater trade at a time when actions by both governments have rattled investors  expressing optimism despite times of uncertainty and tensions over the border and illegal immigration Investment in Mexico has been cool pending passage of the new U S  Mexico Canada trade agreement that is meant to update NAFTA  and due to other concerns for the global economy  and attendees saw ratification as a solution to that Thomas Donohue  president and CEO of the U S  Chamber of Commerce  stressed the valuable U S  Mexico relationship  noting that every day the countries do more than  1 7 billion in trade and some 500 000 people cross their shared border legally for work  school  or tourism  That s why we have fought vigorously for the successful completion of the USMCA   Donohue said   and we re going to keep up that fight until the deal is ratified and implemented   He also called for Washington to lift steel and aluminum tariffs against Mexico and Canada before Congress considers the trade deal In remarks to assembled executives and political leaders  Donohue issued a pointed rejection of President Donald Trump s recent threats to close the United States  southern border and warnings to immigrants not to come because  our country is full   America has the lowest level of unemployment in 65 years  Simply stated  we re out of people   Donohue said  adding that the business community was leading efforts to expand the U S  labor pool and toward passage of  an effective immigration bill as soon as possible  That message resonated well with the Mexican audience  We just heard that the United States has money and lacks people  We lack money and have people to spare   said Carlos Salazar Lomelín  president of Mexico s Coordinating Business Council   There s no     more clear reason to be allies  Donohue s and Salazar s organizations signed a cooperation agreement at the end of the meeting  Also Friday  Mexico s lower house of Congress approved a labor reform aimed at ensuring workers can freely vote for their union representation and contracts  a change needed to win approval of the USMCA While Trump recently walked back his threat to seal the country s southern frontier  redeployments of border agents to handle a surge of migrant families led to long wait times at points of entry  with drivers sleeping in their trucks to keep their place in line Possible disruption of the cross border industrial supply chain worried some at the gathering  For purposes of enforcement  the administration  is drawing down on what is needed to move trading  to move people and goods legally and efficiently across our points of entry   said Antonio Garza  former U S  ambassador to Mexico Laurence Fink  chairman and CEO of investment management firm BlackRock  spoke of ample investment opportunities in Mexico and called for the two neighbors to work together  I am deeply saddened by the rancor and the tension that has grown between our countries       Antagonism between our nations dehumanizes and demands  it poisons the well of economic opportunity and dims the vision that businesses  workers and investors have about what is truly possible However Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has rattled some nerves by canceling a multibillion dollar airport project for the capital that was already about a third built shortly after taking office Dec  1 Representatives were promoting his signature infrastructure project Friday  an ambitious  Maya Train  that would link cities  beach resorts and archaeological ruins in the country s southeast  During a dinner gala the previous night at a lavish hacienda north of Merida  Mexican officials assured the guayabera clad executives that their investments would be safe Still  Mexico has work to do to woo foreign capital  Mexican political and economic analyst Macario Schettino wrote recently for the newspaper El Financiero that unless trends change  investment could fall 5  in the first trimester and possibly remain at similar levels throughout 2019 López Obrador said Mexico remains committed to things such as strengthening rule of law  policies favoring investment  lowering taxes and raising wages without harming business  and respecting contracts  He also promised to work with Central American nations that are the source of much northward migration to ensure that leaving one s country  is optional  not forced  U S  Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said after meeting with Mexican Energy Secretary Rocío Nahle and Chief of Staff Alfonso Romo that there is no desire to roll back reforms that opened the energy sector to private companies five years ago under López Obrador s predecessor  then President Enrique Peña Nieto   only an intention to review and evaluate their performance  I didn t get any indication that they were looking to undo those reforms or somehow upend that effort       What we heard from Mr  Romo and what we heard from Minister Nahle is that they understand the sanctity of contracts  and that s very important for U S  companies   Brouillette said Often historically tricky  U S  Mexico relations became particularly fraught following the election of Trump  who repeatedly hammered the United States  southern neighbor on trade  the border and migration  I congratulate the new presidential administration in Mexico for its strong emphasis on improving the economic development of this region in particular   U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at the gala   We also thank them for assisting us as we confront the crisis at our southern border  Mexico is the United States  second largest export market and its third biggest trading partner  with more than  678 billion in goods and services changing hands last year  according to Ross  U S  foreign direct investment in Mexico was over  109 billion in 2017  he added  and Mexican investment in the United States has reached more than  35 billion As the 2020 presidential campaign ramps up  candidate Trump is seen as likely to try to keep illegal immigration front and center as meat for his base  When he is competing electorally or out there on the stump  he goes to a dark place  and Mexico is often in that place   said Shannon O Neil  senior fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations  Whether it s immigration or drugs or other security threats or Mexico s effect on the economy as he perceives it  I think that will be the mainstay of his rhetoric   said O Neil  who was not at the Merida gathering Before López Obrador took office in December  many had been concerned about possible clashes between Trump and the leftist populist who won the presidency in his third try  But so far  ties between Washington and Mexico City seem to have generally held up well  with the two administrations working closely on a number of bilateral issues and López Obrador officials reluctant to react to critical tweets from Trump Mexican officials said in Merida that from the earliest days  López Obrador s administration has looked to private sector leaders in both countries  executives with deep and longstanding cross border ties  for cues on navigating what they expected to be a trying relationship  I should thank President Donald Trump for being open to dealing with our commercial  migratory and security issues with respect and in a way that I consider most effective   López Obrador said   through permanent dialogue and with cooperation for development   

Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter WASHINGTON   The Senate on Thursday voted to confirm David Bernhardt  a former lobbyist for the oil and agribusiness industries  as secretary of the interior  The confirmation of Mr  Bernhardt to his new post coincided with calls from more than a dozen Democrats and government watchdogs for formal investigations into his past conduct  Senators voted 56 41  largely along party lines  in favor of Mr  Bernhardt s confirmation  Three Democrats   Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia  the senior Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee  Senator Krysten Sinema of Arizona  and Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico   supported Mr  Bernhardt  as did one independent  Senator Angus King of Maine  As interior secretary  Mr  Bernhardt  who has already played a central role in designing many of Mr  Trump s policies for expanding drilling and mining  will now serve as the nation s senior steward of its 500 million acres of public land and vast coastal waters Mr  Bernhardt was the deputy to Mr  Trump s first interior secretary  Ryan Zinke  who resigned this year amid allegations of ethical misconduct At least eight senators  all Democrats  and four government ethics watchdog groups have requested that the Interior Department s inspector general open formal investigations into various aspects of Mr  Bernhardt s conduct  Separately  at least one Democratic senator and one government watchdog group have requested that the United States attorney s office investigate whether Mr  Bernhardt may have committed civil or criminal violations before he joined the Trump administration Mr  Bernhardt has testified to Congress that he has made an effort to be ethical in all his work   I believe public trust is a public responsibility  and maintaining ethical culture is critical   he said at his Senate confirmation hearing last month  He also said that he has sought to strengthen the culture of ethics at the Interior Department  which became notorious for corruption scandals during the George W  Bush administration  when the deputy secretary of the interior  J  Steven Griles  was sentenced to prison for lying to a Senate committee about his ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff  At that time  Mr  Bernhardt was the Interior Department s solicitor  I know how important and how devastating it is when folks at the top act in an unethical manner   he said The questions about Mr  Bernhardt s conduct do not appear to have swayed Republican support for Mr  Trump s nominee  Republican leaders have praised Mr  Bernhardt s  experience in the Bush administration   Mr  Bernhardt has significant private practice experience as well as a past record of service at the Department   said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the Republican leader  in a statement   Along the way  he s earned the respect of those who rely on the public lands the Department of the Interior is charged to oversee  from Native American leaders to sportsmen s groups  He s been praised as a  proven leader  who  acts with integrity  and has  the right approach and skill set   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said   It still amazes me  Donald Trump campaigns on cleaning up the swamp and he does exactly the opposite when in office  An oil and gas lobbyist as head of the Department of Interior  My God  That s an example of the swampiness of Washington if there ever was one  And when are Donald Trump s supporters going to understand this  Environmental groups who opposed Mr  Bernhardt s confirmation were not surprised that Senator Manchinn   whose state  West Virigina  is rich in coal and who often votes with Republicans on energy and environmental policy matters   supported Mr  Bernhardt  But many environmentalists expressed anger that Senator Heinrich  who has presented himself as an environmental champion  particularly on issues of climate change  backed the confirmation of a former oil lobbyist to oversee public lands  This week  the Western Values Project  a conservation advocacy organization  ran a television ad campaign in New Mexico urging Senator Heinrich to vote against Mr  Bernhardt  Senator Heinrich said that  as a lawmaker from a state where roughly one third of the land is owned and operated by the Interior Department  it was important to him to have a permanent  confirmed secretary at the head of the agency  even if the person in that role was not his first choice  I need to be able to pick up the phone and talk to the secretary of interior on a regular basis  I m not going to be able to get the interior secretary I wanted  We didn t win in 2016   he said  referring to the presidential race   But in New Mexico  I m going to put my state and protection of public lands in my state first  The National Ocean Industries Association  a lobbying organization for offshore drilling companies  including many of Mr  Bernhardt s former clients  cheered his confirmation   His unparalleled depth of experience at the department and knowledge of energy and conservation policies will serve our nation s public lands and resources well   said the group s president  Randall Luthi  Offhore oil companies have been working closely with Mr  Bernhardt over the past several months as he develops the administration s plan to open up most United States coastal waters to offshore drilling  A draft of that plan was made public last year  and Mr  Bernhardt is expected to put forth a final plan later this year  Government watchdog groups criticized the ties between Mr  Bernhardt and his former clients   We know with absolute certainty that Bernhardt will be a horrible secretary  because he had been a catastrophic deputy secretary   eager to do the bidding of his former clients  without regard to the impact on the public lands  endangered species or public health   said Robert Weissman  president of Public Citizen  which has filed a complaint against Mr  Bernhardt with the Interior Department s ethics office   In addition  ethics specialists and Democratic lawmakers have requested that the Interior Department s inspector general explore the findings of a New York Times investigation in February that revealed that Mr  Bernhardt  while in office  had personally directed a policy to weaken endangered species protections on a California fish  a change that could directly benefit one of his former lobbying clients  the Westlands Water District They have also sought an investigation based on a separate Times report detailing previously undisclosed emails indicating that  in the months before he was nominated to office  Mr  Bernhardt continued to lobby for the Westlands Water District even after he filed official papers saying that he had ended his lobbying activities  Federal law requires lobbyists to disclose their activities  Lawmakers have also sought a formal inquiry into the findings of a report in the Times in March showing that Mr  Bernhardt had intervened to block the release of a scientific report revealing the threat presented by three widely used pesticides to hundreds of endangered species  including the kit fox and the seaside sparrow The inspector general s office has not confirmed that any investigations of Mr  Bernhardt are underway For more news on

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William P  Barr said on Wednesday that even after he released a partly blacked out copy of the Mueller report  most likely next week  he would work to share with Congress some of the more sensitive information that he redacted Mr  Barr also told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that while he intends to black out derogatory information about  peripheral third parties   he would not take out criticisms of public office holders  including President Trump Democrats have attacked Mr  Barr for releasing only a four page letter on March 24 with what he called the report s  bottom line findings   that the evidence the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  gathered did not show any conspiracy between Mr  Trump s associates and Russia  and that while the special counsel took no position on whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed justice  Mr  Barr deemed him cleared Lawmakers have demanded to see the unredacted report  a request Mr  Barr tried to address on Wednesday  I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees  the chairmen and ranking members of each  what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that   Mr  Barr told the senators His assurance did not mollify them  Senator Patrick J  Leahy  Democrat of Vermont  told him that any attempt to hide pieces of the report would  only fuel suspicions that the Justice Department  which represents the United States  is playing the role of President Trump s defense team  Even while Mr  Barr sought to reassure lawmakers that he would treat the report in a transparent and fair manner  he also made a startling statement sure to please the president   that investigative steps by the F B I  in 2016 to understand links between the Trump campaign and Russia amounted to  spying  on Mr  Trump s campaign  a portrayal law enforcement officials have vehemently denied  Read about the attorney general s assertion that intelligence agencies spied on the Trump campaign  The attorney general was testifying about the Justice Department budget for the second straight day  But as happened on Tuesday  when he appeared before a House panel  questions about the Trump Russia investigation led by Mr  Mueller and his still secret full report dominated the hearing Mr  Barr glancingly addressed a mystery raised by his March 24 letter  which did not explain why Mr  Mueller had rendered no judgment on whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed justice   a silence that left open possibilities  including that the special counsel had wanted Mr  Barr to make the call  and that Mr  Mueller had intended for Congress to receive the evidence without the department weighing in On Wednesday  Mr  Barr said that he had talked to Mr  Mueller about why he made no conclusion  and that the special counsel had not mentioned either of those possibilities to him  But the attorney general hinted that the answer might be known soon  saying that Mr  Mueller  has a fuller explanation of that in the report that I ll be making available hopefully next week  Mr  Barr again declined to say whether he had recently briefed the White House on details of the report  even though Justice Department officials had previously said it had not been shown to the White House ImageJeffrey A  Rosen  whom President Trump has nominated to be Mr  Barr s deputy  had a confirmation hearing on Wednesday where he largely sidestepped questions about the Russia investigation and the Mueller report CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThe hearing also addressed criticism of the F B I  s early decisions in 2016 to open a counterintelligence investigation into Russia s election meddling operations that included scrutinizing any links between Russia and associates of the Trump campaign  The investigation  which Mr  Mueller took over the next spring  included assigning an informant to approach members of the Trump campaign with links to Russia and later obtaining a court order to wiretap a former Trump adviser with links to Russia after he left the campaign During that part of the discussion  Mr  Barr used a startling word to describe those steps   he said he thought  spying  on the Trump campaign had occurred  But he later seemed to tone down that formulation  saying his concern was whether  illegal surveillance  had taken place that was not  adequately predicated    and conceding that he had  no specific evidence that I would cite right now  Responding to Mr  Barr s testimony  Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  said on Twitter   These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us  I ve asked DOJ to brief us immediately  In the meantime  the AG still owes us the full Mueller report  Meanwhile on Wednesday  the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing for Jeffrey A  Rosen  whom Mr  Trump has nominated to be Mr  Barr s deputy  Mr  Rosen  who is currently the deputy secretary of transportation  would succeed Rod J  Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr  Mueller Mr  Rosen largely sidestepped questions about the Russia investigation and Mueller report  saying he was not part of the department yet and did not know the facts  But Senator Amy Klobuchar  Democrat of Minnesota  noted that some criminal matters that developed from Mr  Mueller s work are continuing even though the Office of the Special Counsel is shutting down  and she pressed Mr  Rosen to commit to letting them proceed without political interference  If I am confirmed   Mr  Rosen replied   I would expect in all prosecutorial matters to proceed on the facts and the law and not any improper political influences  Ms  Klobuchar did not name which matters she had in mind  though several cases are still working their way through the court system  including the indictment of Roger J  Stone Jr   a longtime informal adviser to Mr  Trump Separately  under questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  Mr  Rosen defended his role in creating a Trump administration proposal on tailpipe pollution rules  Ms  Feinstein referred to a New York Times article that portrayed him as pushing to let cars emit more greenhouse gases  Mr  Rosen said the article had several errors  although he did not identify them He also said the issue was how to carry out a law that required annual increases in fuel economy standards through 2020  and then set criteria for decisions about whether to require any further escalations in the years after that  The Trump administration  he said  was merely proposing a  timeout  after 2020 In fact  the current regulations  put forth by the Obama administration  require automakers to keep improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles through 2025  The administration s preferred proposal would therefore allow more greenhouse gas pollution than current rules Mr  Rosen also portrayed himself as playing a  managerial  role in overseeing the drafting of the rule  such as by ensuring deadlines were met  But 11 people interviewed by The Times at the time of the negotiation said Mr  Rosen pushed forcefully for that outcome Mr  Rosen also addressed criticism that he   like Mr  Barr and Brian A  Benczkowski  the head of the Justice Department s Criminal Division   had no prosecutorial experience He noted that the department had many experienced prosecutors  and said   I would make it my job to utilize and leverage the expertise they bring to bear while combining that with my own experience and judgment

COLUMBUS  Ohio   A bill imposing one of the most stringent abortion restrictions in the nation was signed into law in Ohio on Thursday  banning abortions after a detectable heartbeat in a long sought victory for abortion opponents that drew an immediate constitutional challenge In signing the heartbeat bill  Republican Gov  Mike DeWine broke with his predecessor  Republican John Kasich  who had vetoed the measure twice on grounds that it was unconstitutional But DeWine defended Ohio Republicans  decision to push the boundaries of the law  because  it is the right thing to do   Taking this action really is a kind of a time honored tradition  the constitutional tradition of making a good faith argument for modification or reversal of existing legal precedents   he said   So that is what this is  He said it s the government s job to protect the vulnerable  The bill outlaws abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected  which doctors say can be as early as five weeks into pregnancy  before many women know they are pregnant Ohio s closely divided politics had slowed the progress of the bill as it has caught momentum elsewhere   forcing years of debate in the state where the movement originated  Of five previous states that have passed heartbeat bills  three have seen their laws struck down or blocked by the courts  another faces a legal injunction and the fifth is awaiting governor s action DeWine s action came a day after the latest version of the bill cleared the Republican controlled Legislature Even before the bill was signed  the ACLU of Ohio said it was preparing a constitutional challenge to the law on behalf of Pre Term Cleveland and three other Ohio abortion clinics The legal challenge is what the bill s backers have always wanted  They hope to provoke a legal challenge with the potential to overturn the U S  Supreme Court s 1973 Roe v  Wade ruling that legalized abortion up until viability  usually at 22 to 24 weeks  The heartbeat bill is the next incremental step in our strategy to overturn Roe v  Wade   said Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis   While other states embrace radical legislation to legalize abortion on demand through the ninth month of pregnancy  Ohio has drawn a line and continues to advance protections for unborn babies  Kellie Copeland  director of NARAL Pro Choice Ohio  said lawmakers and the governor have plunged the state into  a dystopian nightmare where people are forced to continue pregnancies regardless of the harm that may come to them or their family  The law makes no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest EMILY s List  a national group that supports candidates who favor abortion rights  also decried the Ohio bill  as did the Democratic National Committee DNC CEO Seema Nanda called it  the latest example of how the Trump administration s extremist  anti women policies have emboldened legislators across the country to attack women s access to health care  DeWine said his administration is committed to supporting pregnant women  I just want to make it very  very clear  our concern is not just for the unborn  our concern is for all individuals who need protection   he said   It is our duty  I believe  and an essential function of government  to protect those who cannot protect themselves   

RIYADH WASHINGTON   Egypt has pulled out of the U S  effort to forge an  Arab NATO  with key Arab allies  according to four sources familiar with the decision  in a blow to the Trump administration s strategy to contain Iranian power Egypt conveyed its decision to the United States and other participants in the proposed Middle East Strategic Alliance  or MESA  ahead of a meeting held Sunday in Riyadh  the Saudi capital  one source said Cairo did not send a delegation to the meeting  the latest gathering held to advance the U S  led effort to bind Sunni Muslim Arab allies into a security  political and economic pact to counter Shi ite Iran  the source said Egypt withdrew because it doubted the seriousness of the initiative  had yet to see a formal blueprint laying it out  and because of the danger that the plan would increase tensions with Iran  said an Arab source who  like the others  spoke on condition of anonymity Uncertainty about whether U S  President Donald Trump will win a second term next year and whether a successor may ditch the initiative also contributed to the Egyptian decision  the Arab source said  It s not moving well   a Saudi source said of the initiative The initiative  which Saudi Arabia first proposed in 2017  also is aimed at limiting the growing regional influence of Russia and China  according to a classified White House document reviewed by Reuters last year The Egyptian Embassy in Washington and the White House did not respond immediately to requests for comment In addition to the United States and Saudi Arabia  the MESA participants include the United Arab Emirates  Kuwait  Bahrain  Qatar  Oman and Jordan  Two days after the Riyadh meeting  Egypt President Abdel Fattah al Sisi visited Washington for talks with Trump  Before the meeting Trump said they would talk about security issues  but it was not clear whether they discussed MESA issue Two sources said the countries remaining in MESA were moving ahead with the initiative and would press Egypt diplomatically to revoke its withdrawal  with one saying that the decision did not appear to be final  We all want them back   said the other source The Arab source  however  said Cairo could not be convinced to return The withdrawal of Egypt  which has the Arab world s largest military  is the latest setback to the MESA initiative  informally referred to as the  Arab NATO  The plan already was complicated by international outrage over the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul  which Turkish officials and some U S  lawmakers have accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of ordering  Riyadh denies the allegation against Salman Other obstacles have been feuds among the Arab allies  especially a Saudi led economic and political boycott of Qatar The problems have forced several postponements of a summit meeting in the United States at which a preliminary accord on the alliance would be signed John Bolton  Trump s national security adviser  has been a key proponent of the MESA plan and an architect of the administration s strategy for containing Iran  according to U S  officials   Reporting by Jonathan Landay and Stephen Kalin  editing by Leslie Adler  

WASHINGTON   The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested on Thursday in London to face a charge in the United States of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network in 2010  bringing to an abrupt end a seven year saga in which he had holed up in Ecuador s embassy in Britain to avoid capture The Ecuadorean government suspended the citizenship it had granted Mr  Assange and evicted him on Thursday  clearing the way for his arrest  His hosts had displayed growing impatience  listing grievances including recent WikiLeaks releases they said interfered with other states  internal affairs and personal discourtesies  like the failure of Mr  Assange to clean the bathroom and look after his cat A bedraggled and shackled Mr  Assange  47  was dragged out of the embassy  At a court hearing  a judge swiftly found him guilty of jumping bail  and he was detained partly in connection with an American extradition warrant  Mr  Assange indicated that he would fight extradition  and legal experts said that process could take years  He is likely to argue that the case is politically motivated rather than driven by legitimate legal concerns Mr  Assange s arrest brought to a head long simmering tensions that have raised profound First Amendment press freedom issues  Since Mr  Assange began publishing archives of secret American military and diplomatic documents in 2010   provided by the former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning   senior officials in two administrations had weighed whether to try to put him out of business by charging him with a crime  Ms  Manning was convicted at a court martial trial in 2013 of leaking the documents The Obama administration had explored whether to bring charges against Mr  Assange but decided not to  in part because of fears of creating a precedent that could chill traditional journalism  But in November  an accidental court filing appeared to disclose that the Trump administration had secretly charged him with some unspecified offense The indictment unsealed Thursday  however  revealed that prosecutors in Northern Virginia had not charged Mr  Assange under the Espionage Act for publishing government secrets  Instead  they charged him with conspiring to commit unlawful computer intrusion based on his alleged agreement to try to help Ms  Manning break an encoded portion of passcode that would have permitted her to log on to a classified military network under another user s identity Because traditional journalistic activity does not extend to helping a source break a code to gain illicit access to a classified network  the charge appeared to be an attempt by prosecutors to sidestep the potential First Amendment minefield of treating the act of publishing information as a crime  Nevertheless  journalists should still be worried  said Barry Pollack  a lawyer for Mr  Assange  While the indictment against Julian Assange disclosed today charges a conspiracy to commit computer crimes  the factual allegations against Mr  Assange boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source   Mr  Pollack said   Journalists around the world should be deeply troubled by these unprecedented criminal charges  Spokesmen for the Justice Department s National Security Division and for the United States attorney in the Eastern

many secrets   like revealing that more civilians had died in Iraq than official estimates showed  detailing the accusations against Guantánamo detainees and airing American diplomats  unvarnished takes on what was happening around the world   vaulting WikiLeaks to fame  A grand jury in Virginia began investigating people with links to WikiLeaks Most recently  Mr  Assange has been under attack for his organization s release during the 2016 presidential campaign of thousands of Democratic emails stolen by Russian hackers   Russian intelligence officers apparently adopted the guise of a hacker calling itself Guccifer 2 0 when providing the files to WikiLeaks   But the conspiracy charge against Mr  Assange is not related to WikiLeaks  role in Russia s operations to sabotage the election The internal government debate over whether to charge Mr  Assange continued under the Trump administration and was accelerated by Jeff Sessions  the attorney general at the time  according to former officials involved in the discussions  It centered on whether Mr  Assange was a journalist or whether at least some of his actions could be deemed crimes unrelated to journalism A hacking offense cited in the indictment carries an eight year statute of limitations  which may have played a role in spurring the Trump administration to decide whether to move forward  The unsealed court papers indicated that a grand jury returned the indictment on March 6  2018   almost eight years to the day that Mr  Assange is accused of agreeing to help Ms  Manning try to crack the password  court papers showed The indictment says Mr  Assange made that agreement on March 8  2010  Had they succeeded  prosecutors said  it would have helped Ms  Manning cover her tracks by making it harder for the government to later identify who had copied files  But Mr  Assange s efforts evidently failed   he told Ms  Manning two days later  on March 10  that he had  no luck so far   according to the court filing Also on March 8  prosecutors said  Ms  Manning told Mr  Assange   After this upload  that s all I really have got left   Mr  Assange replied   Curious eyes never run dry in my experience  That exchange came at a time when Ms  Manning had copied and sent to WikiLeaks archives of logs of significant events in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and dossiers about Guantánamo Bay detainees  but she had not yet sent the group hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables from American embassies around the world  the indictment said  Weeks later  she began copying and uploading the State Department messages to WikiLeaks  it said The pair also tried to cover their tracks by removing user names from the disclosed information and deleting their chat logs  according to the indictment During her court martial  in which some of Mr  Assange s efforts to help were also discussed  Ms  Manning took complete responsibility for her actions and said that Mr  Assange had not pushed her to take them  No one associated with W L O     an abbreviation she used to refer to the WikiLeaks organization    pressured me into sending any more information   she said at the time   I take full responsibility  ImageOutside the Ecuadorean Embassy on Thursday CreditMatt Dunham Associated PressMs  Manning was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking the files and served about seven   the longest of any convicted leaker in American history   before President Barack Obama commuted most of the remainder of her sentence shortly before leaving office in 2017 Ms  Manning is in jail again  A judge held her in civil contempt last month for refusing to testify before a grand jury about her interactions with WikiLeaks If Mr  Assange is convicted on the conspiracy to hack offense alone  he could face up to five years in prison  The government could later seek to charge him with additional offenses  but because of extradition practices  any such superseding indictment would most likely need to come soon  before Britain formally decides whether to transfer custody of him Until recently  Mr  Assange s Ecuadorean citizenship  granted in 2017  presented a hurdle in President Lenín Moreno s efforts to remove him from the embassy  Ecuador s Constitution limits the government s ability to turn over citizens to a foreign justice system  especially if they could face torture or the death penalty  which are outlawed in Ecuador The country s former foreign minister  María Fernanda Espinosa  originally granted Mr  Assange s citizenship  citing a policy that allowed certain foreigners under  international protection  to be naturalized  She argued that Mr  Assange s refuge at the embassy was a case that qualified However  on Thursday  Ecuador s current foreign minister  José Valencia  said Mr  Assange s citizenship had been suspended because of irregularities  opening the door for him to be handed to the British authorities Mr  Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden  where he faced questions about sexual assault accusations  which he has denied  Sweden rescinded its arrest warrant for Mr  Assange in 2017  but he refused to leave the embassy Under a previous president  Ecuador had offered Mr  Assange citizenship and open ended refuge in its embassy  But its government soured on the relationship as the years kept passing  and it eventually began to impose limits on what Mr  Assange could say and do The Ecuadorean government said last year that it had cut off Mr  Assange s internet access  saying that he had violated an agreement to stop commenting on  or trying to influence  the politics of other countries  The government also imposed other restrictions  like limiting his visitors  He sued in October  claiming that it was violating his rights On Thursday  Mr  Moreno  who became Ecuador s president in 2017  said on Twitter that his country had decided to stop sheltering Mr  Assange after  his repeated violations to international conventions and daily life protocols   

  Attorney General William P  Barr  appearing before Congress for a second straight day on Wednesday  said the government spied on the Trump campaign and said he would look into whether any rules were violated   Mr  Barr signaled he was open to sharing more information with lawmakers about the redacted Mueller report than is released to the public and that he  hoped  to make it public  next week    Meanwhile  the Senate Judiciary Committee is considering the nomination of Jeffrey A  Rosen  President Trump s nominee to succeed Rod J  Rosenstein  who appointed and oversaw the special counsel  as deputy attorney general Barr will review potential  spying  on the Trump campaign With the Russia investigation complete  Mr  Barr said he was preparing to review  both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign   including possible improper  spying  by American intelligence agencies  I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal   Mr  Barr said  adding that he believed  spying did occur   Mr  Trump and his allies have accused the F B I  and other government officials of abusing their power and cooking up the Russia investigation to sabotage the president  I am not suggesting that those rules were violated  but I think it s important to look at them   Mr  Barr said  Later he said he wanted to ensure that there was no  improper surveillance    not suggesting there had been  but that the possibility warranted review It was not immediately clear what Mr  Barr was referring to  and he did not present evidence to back up his statement  The F B I  obtained a secret surveillance warrant on a former Trump campaign adviser  Carter Page  after he left the campaign  and reports have suggested it used at least one confidential informer to collect information on campaign associates Mr  Barr said that he will work with the F B I  director  Christopher A  Wray  to examine the origins of the bureau s counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign  and that he would soon set up a team for that effort  He noted that Congress and the Justice Department s inspector general have already completed investigations of that matter  and that after reviewing those investigations he would be able to see whether there were any  remaining questions to be addressed  Barr gave up a few more details about Mueller s report Under intense questioning from Democratic senators  Mr  Barr further pulled back the curtain on the Justice Department s handling of the special counsel investigation  though only by a few inches Mr  Barr shed some additional light on Mr  Mueller s decision not to reach a prosecutorial decision about whether Mr  Trump criminally obstructed the investigation and his own decision to conclude in his letter to Congress delivering the investigation s conclusions last month that the evidence did not meet that bar Mr  Barr said he had spoken with Mr  Mueller about why he did not reach a decision on obstruction of justice  but declined to offer details of their conversations  The attorney general said that Mr  Mueller did not explicitly ask that Congress be allowed to judge the evidence and decide for itself  nor did he say that the attorney general should  But that is generally how the Department of Justice works   Mr  Barr said  saying that the department s job is to make prosecutorial decisions   and he had  I am looking forward to explaining my decision that I briefly outlined in the March 24 letter  but I don t think I can do it until the report is out   he said The redacted Mueller report may be released  next week   Barr says On the timing of the redacted report s release  Mr  Barr said Wednesday that he  hoped  to make it public  next week   The answer differed slightly from what he told House lawmakers on Tuesday  that he intended to put out the report  within a week  He said Justice Department lawyers and members of Mr  Mueller s team  who are reviewing the report for sensitive information to black out before release  would not remove information that would harm the  reputational interests  of Mr  Trump  Mr  Barr also said that he had not overruled Mr  Mueller s team on any proposed redactions from the Mueller report  and had not discussed with the White House what he was blacking out Barr is willing to work with Congress on redacted information Democrats in the House have slammed Mr  Barr for what they view as his refusal to share the investigation s underlying evidence and material he may redact from the report  But Mr  Barr told senators on Wednesday he would be willing to re evaluate that decision to try to accommodate lawmakers  concerns  I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees  the chairmen and ranking members of each  what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that   he said Democratic lawmakers argue that they need such material so they can fully understand the implications of Mr  Mueller s findings and judge whether or not Mr  Barr had fairly represented what was found  In the House  they have already approved a subpoena to issue to try to compel the release of this kind of information Barr again refused to say if he had briefed the White House Mr  Barr again declined to say whether he had briefed the White House on the fuller Mueller report  even though Justice Department officials had previously said it had not been shown to the White House His refusal to say one way or the other raised the possibility that since then  the Justice Department may have briefed Mr  Trump or his inner circle about its contents  I m landing the plane right now   Mr  Barr said under Democratic questioning   I have been willing to discuss my letter and the process going forward  The report is going to be out next week and I m not just going into the details of the process  Trump says there is nothing to clear up   I won  Interest in the report remains intense among congressional lawmakers  President Trump  not so much Speaking to reporters as he left the White House on Wednesday  the president slammed the investigation as an illegal  attempted coup   But he said he had  won  and could care less about the report itself  I have not seen the Mueller report   Mr  Trump told reporters   I have not read the Mueller report  I won  No collusion  no obstruction  I won  Everybody knows I won  He continued   As far as I m concerned I don t care about the Mueller report  I ve been totally exonerated  The report  which runs nearly 400 pages  is likely to be less black and white  Mr  Barr has said Mr  Mueller did not find the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to undermine the 2016 election  but he has said that the special counsel s team did not reach a prosecutorial decision about whether Mr  Trump criminally obstructed the investigation  Mr  Barr  assessing the evidence for himself  concluded the evidence did not meet that bar Rosen vows to keep politics from improperly influencing his decisionsMeanwhile  at the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for Mr  Rosen  Senator Amy Klobuchar  Democrat of Minnesota  pressed the nominee to commit to allowing all pending criminal matters related to the special counsel s investigation to proceed without improper political interference  If I am confirmed  I would expect in all prosecutorial matters to proceed on the facts and the law and not any improper political influences   Mr  Rosen replied Ms  Klobuchar did not name which matters she had in mind  though several cases are still working their way through the court system  But Mr  Mueller s office obtained the indictment of Roger J  Stone Jr   a longtime informal adviser to President Trump  and is handing that matter off to regular prosecutors to bring to trial  The Mueller team also investigated other matters  like the finances of the Trump inauguration committee  which continue to be investigated elsewhere Rosen defends his role in the Trump administration s fuel efficiency proposalUnder questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  Mr  Rosen defended his role in crafting a Trump administration proposal on tailpipe pollution rules  Ms  Feinstein referred to a New York Times article that portrayed him as pushing to let cars emit more greenhouse gases  Mr  Rosen said the article had several errors  although he did not identify them He also said the issue was how to implement a law that required annual increases in fuel economy standards through 2020  and then set criteria for decisions about whether to require any further escalations in the years after that  The Trump administration  he said  was merely proposing a  time out  after 2020 In fact  the current regulations  put forth by the Obama administration  already require automakers to keep improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles through 2025  The Trump administration s preferred proposal would therefore allow more greenhouse gas pollution than current rules Mr  Rosen also portrayed himself as playing a  managerial  role in overseeing the crafting of the rule  such as by ensuring deadlines were met  But 11 people interviewed by The New York Times at the time of the negotiation said that Mr  Rosen pushed forcefully for that outcome

WASHINGTON   Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it s time to kick off bipartisan talks on a new budget pact to fund federal agencies over the next two years The Kentucky Republican told reporters that he spoke with President Donald Trump last week and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday morning  and that both support trying to reach an agreement on a new spending pact for both the Pentagon and domestic programs  We ve agreed to put together  at the staff level  a group to begin discussing the possibility of reaching a two year  spending  caps deal so we can move ahead hopefully with some kind of regular appropriations process   McConnell told reporters A new funding agreement is needed to prevent the return of spending cuts under the remnants of a failed 2011 budget and debt agreement  Trump has only reluctantly signed spending bills during his two years in office  and his acting chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  is a budget hawk who s signaling that the White House is taking a harder line this time around Trump s budget  submitted last month  would give a sharp increase to the Pentagon but would cut back domestic programs  a nonstarter for Democrats controlling the House  Any bipartisan agreement would renounce Trump s budget  which drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans when it was unveiled last month The administration gave a chilly reaction to the developments  Democrats aren t even writing a budget and are pushing for a reckless  caps deal  that would cost taxpayers over  2 trillion and explode deficits   said a senior administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions have been private   We ve made clear to Congress that type of a wasteful spending is unacceptable  Meanwhile  a revolt by liberal Democrats against a separate budget measure backed by Pelosi  D Calif   and other House party leaders led the leadership to cancel a vote on it that had been tentatively scheduled for Wednesday  That proposal would have increased spending for both the Pentagon and domestic agencies  The increases would ease the way for this year s round of annual congressional spending bills this spring Progressives said the leadership backed plan didn t contain enough money for liberal priorities  They re pushing for significantly higher spending for domestic programs  saying the Pentagon budget is bloated while domestic programs are being shortchanged  For me the big issue is freezing defense spending   said Rep  Ro Khanna  D Calif   I don t think this is an issue of divided government  This is an issue of a divided Democratic caucus on issues of defense spending  Let s go on the record and vote on whether we should be increasing defense spending or not  The guns vs  butter debate has split the Democratic caucus  pitting progressives from solidly Democratic districts against more moderate Democrats from more marginal political turf  The moderates say liberals  demands are politically unrealistic and would add too much to the deficit Even as the leadership proposal foundered  the House on Tuesday quietly adopted a resolution that would permit the chamber to begin voting on the annual spending measures  though it didn t pick winners and losers between the defense and nondefense sides of the federal ledger

WASHINGTON   Eager to jump start the stalled Keystone XL oil pipeline and other energy projects  President Donald Trump has acted to assert executive power over pipelines and such infrastructure He issued a new permit for Keystone XL and insisted this exercise of presidential authority was not subject to judicial review  Then he signed an executive order clarifying that the president alone has the power to grant permits for cross border projects such as pipelines  A separate order makes it harder for states to block pipelines and other energy projects on the basis of environmental concerns Taken together  the actions amount to a broad assertion of power that reverses more than 50 years of precedent that delegated decision making on energy projects to individual agencies Trump has shown a willingness to override his own agencies to accomplish his aims  His actions  if upheld by the courts  could consolidate power over energy projects at the White House  increasing the influence of the president s political advisers and potentially cutting out experts and career officials throughout the government  Too often badly needed energy infrastructure is being held back by special interest groups  entrenched bureaucracies and radical activists   Trump said Wednesday before signing the executive orders at an event in Texas Pipeline opponents say Trump acted illegally  They have asked a federal court to block the new Keystone permit  arguing that it is an effort to get around an earlier court ruling But one legal expert said Trump s approach might succeed  He has now created a whole new decision making structure  for cross border pipelines  said Richard Pierce  a law professor at George Washington University If the courts follow a 1992 Supreme Court ruling  they may find that action taken by the State Department in approving or rejecting the pipeline  is nonreviewable  because it doesn t qualify as final agency action   Pierce said  Further  Trump s decision would not be subject to review because of a separate law that declares the president is not an agency and therefore is not bound by rules that apply to agency actions  That s a very clever approach that might well work   Pierce said Trump s actions are  typical of this presidency   said Holly Doremus  an environmental law professor at the University of California  Berkeley  She said Trump frequently seeks to stretch the limits of his power  and she cited Trump s declaration of an emergency that he says allows him to shift more money to construction of a promised wall along the U S  Mexico border In the case of Keystone  Trump appears to be arguing that the new presidential permit  issued March 29  gets around restrictions under the National Environmental Policy Act or other laws  because the statutes apply to executive branch agencies but not to the president  Doremus said  If the president is the only discretionary decision maker  NEPA simply does not apply   she said While Trump s theory is plausible  it is unclear who is the ultimate decision maker on Keystone XL  Doremus said  The pipeline would ship crude oil from the tar sands of western Canada to U S  refineries along the Gulf of Mexico Both a 2015 rejection of the project by the Obama administration and a 2017 approval by Trump were issued by the State Department under terms of a 2004 executive order that delegated presidential authority for cross border projects to that agency Trump s executive order revokes the 2004 order  issued by President George W  Bush  Bush s action extended an executive order first issued by President Lyndon B  Johnson in 1968  It s surprising that the president would come in and single handedly try to circumvent 50 years of precedent for these types of projects by just issuing a permit himself   said Doug Hayes  a Sierra Club attorney who has sued to block the Keystone project in court In November  U S  District Judge Brian Morris in Montana ruled that the Trump administration did not fully consider potential oil spills and other impacts when it approved the pipeline in 2017  Morris ordered a new environmental review of the pipeline The White House said the new permit issued by Trump  dispels any uncertainty  about the long delayed project  which was first proposed a decade ago by Calgary based TransCanada Trump s move on Keystone XL reinforces the idea that  the presidential permit is indeed an exercise of presidential authority that is not subject to judicial review   according to the White House Under the new order  federal officials still would conduct environmental reviews of the project  but they would be carried out by agencies other than the State Department  the White House said TransCanada spokesman Matthew John said the administration s action  clearly demonstrates to the courts that the permit is  the  product of presidential decision making and should not be subject to additional environmental review  Carl Tobias  a law professor at the University of Richmond  said it was  strange  that Trump issued the executive order after granting the new permit  The White House is making the argument supposedly that he has untrammeled authority and doesn t have to obey the laws of Congress  in approving a cross border pipeline  Tobias said   I m dubious and I think a number of other people are  too  Kathryn Watts  a law professor at the University of Washington  said it s unclear what happens next  Trump s permit wades into  uncharted  unsettled  legal territory  she said    Associated Press writer Matthew Brown in Billings

WASHINGTON   One day last week  amid spiraling fallout over special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dialed up the president and requested a meeting She talked to President Donald Trump about working together on an infrastructure package It was the first phone call between the two since the testy days of the government shutdown earlier this year  and it seemed productive  They are planning to meet  she told The Associated Press in a Wednesday interview So goes the relationship between Washington s two power centers   one in the White House  where Trump is slapping almost hourly at the investigations into his administration and running headlong into a climactic moment of his presidency  the other on Capitol Hill  where Pelosi is deliberately steering her gavel toward her party s goals As the two cross the 100 day mark of the era of divided government  theirs is a relationship like almost none other in Washington Even as Trump derides Democrats as  unhinged  and claims they are a party taken over by  socialists   he pulls his punches with Pelosi  And while Pelosi criticizes Trump as  unfit  for office   and hasn t fully closed the door on impeachment   she wants to work with him on shared priorities On Thursday  Pelosi told reporters she s looking for at least  1 trillion for the infrastructure package   far more than the  200 billion Trump has proposed   and she d like to get it closer to  2 trillion  She said she expects to  meet soon  with the president to discuss it  I have pooh poohed his  200 billion mini nothing of an infrastructure bill   she said during the House Democrats  issues conference retreat in Virginia   And I think he probably knows that was not a successful path to building the infrastructure from sea to shining sea  Lawmakers said they expect to have legislation ready for consideration in the House by June or July The White House confirmed the president and the speaker  did speak last week and have agreed to meet soon to discuss working together on infrastructure   said administration spokesman Judd Deere  The President wants a bipartisan infrastructure package that rebuilds crumbling infrastructure  invests in the projects and industries of tomorrow  and promotes permitting efficiency   Deere said Thursday Launching an infrastructure investment program is the kind of big bipartisan undertaking that seems all but impossible in times like these The Trump administration s  infrastructure week  became a punchline around Washington when it fizzled amid the White House s often shifting priorities  Trump promised on election night a  1 trillion investment in new roads and other projects but has never come close to achieving it  Democrats scoff at the  200 billion requests he s made in his budget proposals as meager  Pelosi called it a  nonstarter  But infrastructure   like the effort on lowering prescription drug costs   is the kind of initiative that could benefit both of them as they head toward the 2020 campaign season  They could change the subject from the ongoing investigations that pose risks for both parties  and they could show voters they can deliver with building projects that improve communities and create jobs even at a time of divided government  with Democrats controlling the House and Republicans controlling the Senate  We want dirt to fly   Pelosi said After her talks with Trump  Pelosi thinks the president may be willing to do more than he s put on the table  Trump s latest budget proposed  200 billion in federal dollars that could be leveraged with private capital to cover the difference  I don t think the president is wedded to that proposal   she said   It s too small  She says 80 percent of their conversations  including the talk last Thursday  are about infrastructure  They re trying  she said  to find areas of  common ground   The purpose of the upcoming meeting she requested is to  get a dollar figure  as a starting point for the discussions Asked about infrastructure  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also left open the possibility of a fresh bipartisan effort  We ve all been talking about infrastructure  including the president  for a couple of years now   McConnell  R Ky   told Fox News on Wednesday   We need some straight talk from both sides on how we re going to pay for it  The day after Trump and Pelosi spoke  Trump went to California to visit the southern border  where he is trying to build a long promised border wall with Mexico after Democrats thwarted his demand for more wall funds during the shutdown That afternoon  House Democrats filed a lawsuit challenging Trump s national emergency declaration  which he invoked to circumvent Congress and to use military construction money to pay for the border wall  It s so very self evident that the president is very different from every other person that anybody ever served with   Pelosi said in the AP interview Wednesday  He is not only unique  he s     what would be the word   she said  trailing off   To be president of the United States is to have a very special personality  But there are shared values about commitment to our Constitution  to the vision of our founders to the Constitution of the United States  I don t see those features yet in this president  Associated Press writer Kevin Freking in

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Friday that he withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a  tougher  direction  a surprise decision before the president s trip to the southwestern border Ronald D  Vitiello  who was nominated last summer by Mr  Trump to run ICE  the agency that arrests  detains and deports people who are in the United States illegally  has been serving as the agency s acting director since last June  He had planned to accompany the president on his trip to California  but was left behind  Ron s a good man  but we re going in a tougher direction   Mr  Trump said to reporters as he left the White House en route to Calexico  Calif Mr  Vitiello s nomination had been awaiting approval by a second Senate committee and confirmation by the full chamber  In an email to ICE employees on Friday afternoon  he signaled that he planned to remain at the immigration agency  No replacement has yet been named  While I will not become the permanent director of ICE  I look forward to working alongside you in serving the American public with integrity  courage and excellence   Mr  Vitiello said in the email  which was read to The New York Times by an ICE employee on the condition of anonymity One person familiar with the president s thinking said that Mr  Trump believed that Mr  Vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president had proposed before backing off that threat this week Another person said that Stephen Miller  the president s chief policy adviser and a supporter of curtailing legal and illegal immigration  did not support Mr  Vitiello s nomination  The two people familiar with the president s thinking both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the internal White House decisions The president s abrupt decision came at a time when his administration considers the United States border with Mexico to be in crisis because of the flow of people trying to get into the country  making it a priority to have a confirmed appointee leading the agency to carry out the administration s policies  But some senators  including Republicans  had concerns that Mr  Vitiello was not the right person for this job Mr  Trump  who has continued to push for stronger deportation rules  had also expressed concern about whether a career civil servant  like Mr  Vitiello  would be up to the task  ICE has been led by acting directors since January 2017 Mr  Vitiello had recently been more outspoken about overflowing immigration facilities and strapped resources at the border  But that did little to assuage the National ICE Council  a union representing agency employees  which in February told the Senate it opposed Mr  Vitiello s nomination over what was described as his controversial posts on social media and his treatment of some ICE agents The request to withdraw Mr  Vitiello s nomination surprised officials on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  Even some Department of Homeland Security officials questioned whether it was sent in error  

 Reuters    A U S  judge on Monday halted the Trump administration s policy of sending some asylum seekers back across the southern border to wait out their cases in Mexico  stopping a program the government planned to expand to stem a recent flood of migrants The ruling is slated to take effect on Friday  according to the order by U S  District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco  The preliminary injunction will apply nationwide In a late night tweet  U S  President Donald Trump said   A 9th Circuit Judge just ruled that Mexico is too dangerous for migrants  So unfair to the U S  OUT OF CONTROL  The program was launched in January and was one of many policies aimed at slowing rising numbers of immigrants arriving at the border  many of them families from Central America  that swelled last month to the highest in a decade Because of limits on how long children are legally allowed to be held in detention  many of the families are released to await U S  immigration court hearings  a process that can take years because of ballooning backlogs  The Trump administration said last week it planned to expand the program of sending some migrants to wait out their U S  court dates in Mexican border cities under a policy known as Migrant Protection Protocols  or MPP The government argued MPP was needed because so many asylum seekers spend years living in the United States and never appear for their court hearings before their claim is denied and an immigration judge orders them to be deported  Seeborg said the Immigration and Nationalization Act  however  does not authorize the government to return asylum seekers to Mexico the way the government has applied it  He also said the policy lacks safeguards to protect refugees from threats to their life or freedom Justice Department data show that while the percentage of immigration court cases completed  in absentia    when the foreign citizen fails to show   has risen in recent years  the majority of immigrants show up for their hearings  A U S  Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment on Monday s ruling  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment The Mexican foreign ministry considers the ruling  an internal decision  of the United States  a spokesman said Seeborg said the government shall permit the 11 plaintiffs in the case to enter the United States beginning on Sunday  He said the government still retained the right to detain the asylum seekers pending the outcome of their case The ruling can be appealed  and the government could seek a stay of the injunction until the appeals process runs its course  LAWYERS  MIGRANTS GRATIFIEDStill  lawyers for migrants were gratified by the decision  This is a great ruling   said Judy Rabinovitz  a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union  which was one of the groups that brought the case   This is what they were planning on implementing on a large scale  That would have been a complete game changer in the way our asylum system works   she said Rabinovitz said the groups that brought the lawsuit needed to discuss what could be done for the hundreds of refugees who are awaiting their cases in Mexico  She said as their cases are heard  they will be returned to the United States  but that could take months The plaintiffs include legal service organizations and migrants who fled Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador to escape what they said was extreme violence  rape and death threats Gabriela Orellana  26  an asylum seeker from El Salvador who was scheduled to have her first hearing on Tuesday  was delighted by news of the judge s ruling  I m crying from happiness   she told Reuters  She is not one of the plaintiffs in the case Orellana said she fled El Salvador with her 8 year old daughter and 6 year old son after she was shot by a gang member  She has been in Tijuana since January and has waited nearly two months for her first interview with U S  immigration authorities Others in Tijuana were more cautious  Will I be allowed to go or do I have to stay   asked Veronica Galdamez  who said she fled San Salvador in 2018 after gang members stole her food cart and  pointing a gun at her  told her she had 24 hours to get out of the city  I feel real happiness  but also uncertainty  because I don t know if this applies to me   Galdamez said MPP was based on a decades old law that says migrants who enter from a contiguous country can be returned there to wait out their deportation case  although the provision had never been used in the way the administration has applied it Civil rights groups sued  arguing the policy violated U S  and international law by returning refugees to dangerous border towns where they would be unable to get legal counsel or notices of hearings Kirstjen Nielsen resigned as Secretary of Homeland Security  the department that oversees immigration  on Sunday A congressional official familiar with the matter said some in Congress believe Trump forced out Nielsen in part because she was trying to obey laws on treatment of refugees  granting of amnesty and separation of families  This story corrects spelling of last name of migrant in

WASHINGTON   Temporary status is a seemingly permanent condition of the Trump administration The resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen as homeland security secretary on Sunday means that another cabinet officer who reports directly to President Trump will have the word  acting  next to the official title at a major department of government Interim secretaries are also in place at the Departments of Defense and of the Interior  and at the Office of Management and Budget  the Small Business Administration and ambassador s office at the United Nations  Mick Mulvaney  Mr  Trump s chief of staff  is also serving in an acting capacity  I like acting  It gives me more flexibility  Do you understand that   Mr  Trump told reporters in January before departing to Camp David   I like acting  So we have a few that are acting  We have a great  great cabinet  But there are concerns about having men and women in such high level jobs without having been subjected to Senate confirmation for those posts  Leaving cabinet secretaries unconfirmed in their roles could give the president even more leverage over them  or could leave them without full authority in the job  The Senate grappled with this question in the very first Congress when it ordered George Washington to send nominations to the Hill at a reasonable pace   said Paul Light  a professor of public service at New York University who has written extensively on the appointment process   Senators rightly worried that presidents might use acting appointees to evade oversight and institutional prerogatives  Yet  we haven t heard a word from the Senate on the Trump administration s abuse of its acting authority  Justice Clarence Thomas argued in a concurring opinion in a 2017 case that there was seemingly no constitutional basis for having  acting  cabinet members and that there needed to be limits on a president s power to fill the highest positions without Senate confirmation The Constitution requires that the president obtain  the advice and consent of the Senate  before appointing cabinet officials  Legal scholars also questioned the president s power to use the  acting  authority in replacing Ms  Nielsen  To me  the real difference is avoiding Senate confirmation   either because the individuals he wants running these agencies can t be confirmed even by a Republican controlled Senate  or because he s worried about the kinds of questions they d have to answer and or concessions they d have to make in order to be confirmed   said Stephen Vladeck  a law professor at the University of Texas   Either way  that s an alarming argument for bypassing a Senate controlled by his own party  Mr  Trump announced in a tweet on Sunday that Kevin McAleenan  47  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  will be Ms  Nielsen s replacement  as  acting  homeland security secretary at a time when the president has said there is a security crisis at the border with Mexico because of a flood of migrants trying to gain entry into the United States The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other Some acting officials like Patrick M  Shanahan  the acting defense secretary who had been deputy defense secretary  have been confirmed by the Senate but not in the post in which they serve  David Bernhardt  the acting interior secretary  had already been confirmed as the department s deputy and is undergoing confirmation by the Senate for the top job Mr  Trump had long publicly said he was satisfied with the performance of Ms  Nielsen  He expressed similar optimism for her acting successor  I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job   Mr  Trump said in his tweet No matter whom Mr  Trump selected  it would take time to get fully operational  Government agencies  Mr  Light noted  must  wade through piles of internal paperwork assigning responsibilities and signature authorities to one acting after another  Career government officials  wonder when vacancies will be filled  how long the actings will stay and whether they ve got the right name on the organization chart to move forward on major issues such as the Max 8 groundings   he said  referring to the airliner involved in two fatal crashes Oversight by ethics and accountability agencies within the government is also constrained   The result is a fundamental collapse in ordinary accountability   Mr  Light said In her resignation letter  Ms  Nielsen said she hoped the incoming secretary would  have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse  But the support of Congress may be difficult to obtain  notably among Democrats  who have said Mr  Trump is usurping the role of a coequal branch of government  Without confirmation hearings  there s less of a chance for the Senate to meaningfully play a role in identifying who will be in charge of these critical government functions  and thus less accountability for episodes like Acting Secretary Shanahan s ties to Boeing   Mr  Vladeck said   Second  an acting secretary may have the same control over his or her own agency as someone who is Senate confirmed  but traditionally  Senate confirmed officers have more pull in any interagency conflict  and so it has the effect of skewing the authority of different agencies toward those with permanent heads  What is more  Mr  Trump has relentlessly said there is a  crisis  on the border  yet the two cabinet departments most directly responsible for dealing with the situation  Homeland Security and Defense  do not have permanent leaders  It s striking how many of the secretaries of the largest departments of this government are acting at this point   Senator Chris Coons  Democrat of Delaware  said Monday on CNN  

TRIPOLI BENGHAZI  Libya   A warplane attacked Tripoli s only functioning airport on Monday as eastern forces advancing on the Libyan capital disregarded international appeals for a truce in the latest of a cycle of warfare since Muammar Gaddafi s fall in 2011  Casualties were mounting in fighting that also threatens to disrupt oil supplies  fuel migration to Europe and wreck U N  plans for an election to end rivalries between parallel administrations in the country s east and west The eastern Libyan National Army  LNA  forces of Khalifa Haftar   a former general in Gaddafi s army   said 19 of its soldiers died in recent days as they closed in on the internationally recognized government in Tripoli A spokesman for the Tripoli based Health Ministry said fighting in the south of the capital had killed at least 25 people  including fighters and civilians  and wounded 80 Mitiga airport  in an eastern suburb  was bombed and closed  authorities said  The U N  envoy to Libya  Ghassan Salame  condemned the air strike as a  a serious violation of humanitarian law  A spokesman for the LNA confirmed the strike  saying his force had not targeted civilian planes  only a MiG parked at Mitiga The closure left Misrata airport  200 km  125 miles  to the east down the coast  as the closest option for Tripoli residents  Haftar s LNA  which backs the eastern administration in Benghazi  took the oil rich south of Libya earlier this year before advancing fast through largely unpopulated desert regions toward Tripoli Seizing the capital  however  is a much bigger challenge  The LNA has conducted air strikes on the south of the city as it seeks to advance along a road from a disused former international airport Witnesses said on Monday afternoon the LNA had lost control of the old airport and withdrawn from positions on the airport road  Forces allied to the Tripoli administration were seen inside the airport  while clashes with the eastern forces were raging south of the airport  a Reuters reporter at the scene and residents said On Sunday evening  LNA forces had moved up from the airport  coming as close as 11 km  7 miles  from the city center before retreating  residents said MACHINE GUNS ON PICKUPSThe government of Prime Minister Fayez al Serraj  59  is seeking to block the LNA with the help of allied armed groups who have rushed to Tripoli from Misrata in pickup trucks fitted with machine guns A Reuters correspondent in the city center could hear gunfire in the distance southwards Serraj has run Tripoli since 2016 as part of a U N  brokered deal boycotted by Haftar  U N  envoy Salame met Serraj in Tripoli on Monday to discuss  ways the U N  can assist with this critical and difficult juncture   U N  spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York Dujarric said 3 400 people had been displaced by violence in and around Tripoli  emergency services had been blocked from reaching casualties and civilians  and electricity lines had been damaged  We re calling for a temporary humanitarian truce to allow for the provision of emergency services and a voluntary passage of civilians  including those wounded  from the areas of conflict   Dujarric said The violence has jeopardized a U N  plan for an April 14 16 conference to plan elections and end anarchy that has prevailed since the Western backed toppling of Gaddafi As well as the United Nations  the European Union  United States and G7 bloc have all urged a ceasefire  a halt to Haftar s advance and return to negotiations Haftar casts himself as a foe of extremism but is viewed by opponents as a new dictator in the mold of Gaddafi  whose four decade rule was marked by torture  disappearances and assassinations MIGRANTS AND MILITANTSSince NATO backed rebels ousted Gaddafi  Libya has been a transit point for hundreds of thousands of migrants trekking across the Sahara in hope of reaching Europe across the sea Migrants and refugees held in detention are especially vulnerable in the current fighting  said aid agencies MSF  Doctors without Borders  and the International Rescue Committee The LNA says it has 85 000 men  but this includes soldiers paid by the central government that it hopes to inherit  Its elite Saiqa  Lightning  force  numbers some 3 500  while Haftar s sons also have well equipped troops  LNA sources say Analysts say Haftar has swelled his ranks with Salafist fighters and tribesmen as well as Chadians and Sudanese from over the southern borders  claims dismissed by the LNA  France  which has close links to Haftar  said it had no prior warning of his push for Tripoli  a diplomatic source said  France established close relations with Haftar under the Socialist government of former President Francois Hollande and his defense minister  Jean Yves Le Drian When President Emmanuel Macron named Le Drian his foreign minister  Paris increased support for Haftar  in close alignment with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates  which see him as a bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily  according to U N  reports France s stance has created tensions with Italy  which has sought a leading role to end the turmoil in its former colony Serraj received a phone call from Macron on Monday  the Tripoli based government said  adding they discussed security developments   Reporting by Ahmed Elumami and Ayman al

JERUSALEM   Struggling to rally right wing voters before Tuesday s elections  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he would start to extend Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if given a fourth consecutive term Such a move has been ardently sought by the settler movement but resisted until now by Mr  Netanyahu  and by more moderate Israelis  as a potentially fatal blow to a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  In the eyes of most of the world  it would also be a violation of international law that bars the annexation of land seized in war But Mr  Netanyahu trailed his main challenger  Benny Gantz  a former army chief of staff  in final polls of the campaign published Friday  And he has been frantically trying to mobilize conservative Israelis to vote for his Likud party rather than for other  more extremist parties whose leaders have joined his government but have often portrayed him as more of a brake on the settler movement than an accelerator Mr  Netanyahu was pressed in a live television interview Saturday night over why he had not already annexed settlement blocs like Maale Adumim and Gush Etzion  two large Jewish communities built on occupied territory on the outskirts of Jerusalem  He vowed to begin the effective annexation of those and other  more isolated areas under Jewish control  The question you re asking is an interesting one  Will we move on now to the next stage   he said   And the answer is  yes  We will move on to the next stage  Asked by his interviewer if that meant he would annex the settlement blocs  Mr  Netanyahu said yes  but that he would not stop there  I m going to apply sovereignty  but I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlement points  because from my perspective every such point of settlement is Israeli   he said   We have a responsibility as the Israeli government  I won t uproot anyone and I won t place them under Palestinian sovereignty  I ll look out for everyone  The West Bank is home to about 2 8 million Palestinians and more than 400 000 Jewish settlers Mr  Netanyahu did not say whether he would seek to annex areas now under Palestinian control under the Oslo Accords Applying sovereignty to Israeli settlements on West Bank land that the Palestinians demand for a future state  presumably along with the roads and infrastructure tethering those places to the rest of Israel  would leave the Palestinians at best with an archipelago of disconnected territory  The West Bank is now under Israeli military jurisdiction  though settlers are subject to civilian law  as Israeli citizens ImageA Palestinian family tending their vineyard in the West Bank with the the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the background  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he will begin extending Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if re elected CreditTomas Munita for The New York TimesThe chief negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization  Saeb Erekat  responded to Mr  Netanyahu s statements by attacking both him and the Trump administration  The White House has long promised a proposal for a  deal of the century  to end the Israeli Palestinian conflict But in the meantime  it has showered Mr  Netanyahu with priceless political gifts   from last year s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital to last month s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights   while battering the Palestinians with aid cuts and public scoldings  Such a statement by Netanyahu is not surprising   Mr  Erekat said on Twitter   Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity  particularly with the Trump administration s support and endorsement of Israel s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine  He added   We ll continue to pursue our rights through international forums  including the international criminal court  until we achieve our long overdue justice  Shalom Lipner  a former aide to Mr  Netanyahu and several other prime ministers  said Mr  Netanyahu might well believe the Trump administration could allow him to proceed with annexation  But he called the promise  the ultimate Hail Mary pass   and one that came with little political risk  The only reason it s even credible now is because of what he s been able to coordinate with Trump   said Mr  Lipner  an analyst at the Atlantic Council   Maybe he can actually get Trump to sign off on that as well  But if it became clear it s not in the cards right now  then he can just say   Sorry  I can t swing it  Conditions change    Read our guide on Israel s elections  In the television interview  Mr  Netanyahu vowed not to divide Jerusalem or  uproot any settlement   and said he would  ensure that we will control the territory west of the Jordan River   meaning the entire West Bank When asked if he would push through before Tuesday the much delayed evacuation of Palestinians living in Khan al Ahmar  a Bedouin village near the Maale Adumim settlement bloc  he reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state on the West Bank  I don t know whether it will be before the elections   he said of the Khan al Ahmar expulsion  which set off intense international criticism after being marked for demolition to make way for an expanded Jewish settlement But  he added   We have to control our destiny  and that is going to be impossible if we place there an independent  Arab entity   an Arab state  for all intents and purposes  A Palestinian state  That will endanger our existence   

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is wholly mispresenting the immigration detention policy he introduced that forced migrant children from their parents at the border  President Obama had child separation   Trump said Tuesday   I m the one that stopped it  In fact  he stopped   or at least suspended   family separations that spiked as a result of his own  zero tolerance  policy A look at his remarks to reporters before meeting Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el Sissi TRUMP on family separations   President Obama had the law  We changed the law  and I think the press should accurately report it but of course they won t  THE FACTS  This is false  Trump did not achieve any change in the law Operating under the same immigration laws as Barack Obama  Trump instituted a zero tolerance policy aimed at detaining everyone who was caught crossing the border illegally and criminally prosecuting all the adults The policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department  In the face of a public uproar  Trump suspended most separations in June  About 2 400 children were taken from parents at the height of the separations  During the Obama administration and before Trump s zero tolerance policy was introduced  migrant families caught illegally entering the U S  were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings  not requiring separation  unless they were known to have a criminal record Trump repeatedly but without specifics rails against a  Democrat  law that he wrongly claims to have changed  He appears to be referring to one that passed unanimously in Congress and was signed by Republican President George W  Bush  It was focused on freeing and otherwise helping children who come to the border without a parent or guardian and does not call for family separation    TRUMP   Just so you understand  President Obama separated the children  THE FACTS  Not in widespread fashion  Then and now  immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases  such as serious criminal charges against a parent  concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns  The Obama administration also contended with a surge of minors who came to the border without parents and were held in short term Border Patrol detention It did not seek to criminally prosecute all who crossed the border illegally  without regard to whether those who were caught had committed crimes other than illegal entry Family separations were the exception before Trump made them the rule    TRUMP on family separations   Once you don t have it  that s why you see many more people coming  They re coming like it s a picnic  because  let s go to Disneyland   THE FACTS  It s not been proved that people are discouraged from coming to the U S  when they know their children will be taken from them if they are caught Apprehensions did fall last summer  after the June suspension of separations  but they decline most summers because of the extreme heat in much of Mexico and the border region U S  Customs and Border Protection officials announced on Tuesday that they apprehended about 53 000 parents and children at the southern border in March  The officials declined to answer a question about whether they believed family separation was an effective deterrent    Merchant contributed to this report from Dallas    Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

WASHINGTON   The House passed legislation on Wednesday that would guarantee broadband internet users equal access to online content  in a crucial step toward bringing back so called net neutrality regulations overturned at the start of the Trump administration In a 232 to 190 vote  divided along party lines  the Democratic majority made good on a promise that became a rallying cry in many progressive circles during the 2018 election  It is also expected to be held up as an issue by Democrats in 2020 But the legislation  the Save the Internet Act  faces long odds in the Republican led Senate  The Senate leader  Mitch McConnell  said this week that the legislation would be  dead on arrival   Earlier this week  the Office of Management and Budget advised the White House to veto the law if it reached the president s desk  The office said in a letter that since the law had been overturned  the broadband industry had thrived  a good sign of how deregulation helped the economy The legislation would prohibit blocking and throttling web traffic and would categorize broadband as a service open to heavy regulation  Supporters say the regulation would prevent companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of content like videos  Opponents say it would strap broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast with heavy handed restrictions  and could lead to price controls  We need a law that puts a cop on the beat who will enforce the laws  because we can t just rely on internet providers to say this will be a free and open internet   Representative Frank Pallone  Democrat of New Jersey  said in an interview   No one believes them  ImageAjit Pai  chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  rolled back net neutrality rules in 2017 CreditJacquelyn Martin Associated PressThe Federal Communications Commission rolled back the country s net neutrality rules in November 2017  Shortly after  internet companies and public interest groups sued to overturn the action  which was led by Ajit Pai  the agency s chairman In addition  more than two dozen states have raced to create their own net neutrality laws  The Justice Department and telecommunications companies have  in turn  sued to block the state efforts Net neutrality  a regulatory idea hatched by academics  has been a decade long battle pitting Silicon Valley and consumer groups against the telecommunications sector  Companies like Google  Mozilla and Facebook have argued that without rules  telecommunications companies can become gatekeepers of online content by choosing the quality of the delivery of web services in a way that could hurt rivals and consumers  The Obama administration sided with their argument  with the F C C  approving new regulations in 2015 Now  the companies are pushing for a law on the issue  A group of 120 start ups  including Stripe  Medium  and GitHub  wrote a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders in support of the bill  Net neutrality is fundamental to guaranteeing that every American has unencumbered access to the internet   the companies wrote   This access is also essential to a competitive  free market for the technology economy to thrive as well as entrepreneurship in this country  The biggest disagreement between Republicans and Democrats is whether broadband should be considered a utility like phone service  Republicans say that doing so could lead to the possible regulation of broadband rates  Democrats say the categorization is an important update that recognizes the importance of broadband to the economy  culture and education  Some in Congress are trying to give the government more control again  applying utility style regulations that would threaten the internet as we know it  We should reject these efforts   Senator Roger Wicker  Republican of Mississippi  said on the Senate floor last week  

Good Wednesday morning  Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today                        President Trump has adopted a blunt new message in recent days for migrants seeking refuge in the United States   Our country is full   But an aging population and declining birthrate among the native born population   as well as underpopulated cities and towns   signal the complete opposite   At Mr  Trump s luxurious resorts in Florida  young foreigners on temporary visas work poolside  in bars and in spas  Workers without papers have maintained the golf course  hired through staffing agencies that protect the Trump Organization from liability   The Trump administration denied that it would bring back the president s policy of separating migrant families  It instead plans to push for tougher screening of asylum seekers  making it vastly more difficult for migrants to win protection in the United States   In his first 100 days as the president s acting chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney has assumed a central role in Mr  Trump s circle  by encouraging  rather than restraining  the president s conservative instincts   Attorney General William P  Barr vowed on Tuesday to release a redacted version of the Mueller report  within a week    The Justice Department s inspector general intends to complete his own investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry by May or June  including whether law enforcement officials abused their powers in surveilling a former Trump campaign aide   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo s silence on a potential Israeli move to annex the West Bank was a break with previous administrations  which had discouraged any such action   Israelis went to the polls Tuesday to elect a prime minister  According to preliminary results  Benjamin Netanyahu  who is facing likely indictment  appeared  poised to beat his chief rival  Benny Gantz   A congressional request for Mr  Trump s tax returns has put one of his most loyal aides  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  at the center of what is shaping up to be an extraordinary legal battle between two branches of the United States government   Senator Bernie Sanders said that he would release 10 years of tax returns by Tax Day on Monday  And he acknowledged his best selling book threw him into the ranks of the millionaires he has denounced for years   How is a presidential campaign different from a presidential  movement   It s not really clear  But the latter is in vogue in the 2020 race   Today s Democratic Party is perceived as dominated by its left wing  But the views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those of the wider Democratic electorate  Here s a data driven look at the party s true  though underrepresented  ideology   Facing opposition from both the Democratic Party s liberal wing and fiscal hawks  House Democrats delayed voting on a two year budget that would increase military and domestic spending   In white words against a black backdrop  the frames scroll by   First They Ignore You    Then They Laugh at You    Then They Call You Racist   But the video  which Mr  Trump shared on Twitter on Tuesday   before it was taken down because of an apparent copyright complaint   was not a product of his 2020 campaign  Officials said it was made by a supporter                      Today s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York Were you forwarded this newsletter  Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox Is there anything you think we re missing  Anything you want to see more of  We d love to hear from you  Email us at onpolitics nytimes com

PHOENIX   An idea floated by President Donald Trump to send immigrants from the border to  sanctuary cities  to exact revenge on Democratic foes could end up doing the migrants a favor by placing them in locations that make it easier to put down roots and stay in the country The plan would put thousands of immigrants in cities that are not only welcoming to them  but also more likely to rebuff federal officials carrying out deportation orders  Many of these locations have more resources to help immigrants make their legal cases to stay in the United States than smaller cities  with some of the nation s biggest immigration advocacy groups based in places like San Francisco  New York City and Chicago  The downside for the immigrants would be a high cost of living in the cities The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University announced this week that an analysis found that immigrants in sanctuary cities such as New York and Los Angeles are 20  less likely to be arrested out in the community than in cities without such policies  With immigrants being less likely to commit crimes than the U S  born population  and with sanctuary jurisdictions being safer and more productive than non sanctuary jurisdictions  the data damns this proposal as a politically motivated stunt that seeks to play politics with peoples  lives   said George Gascon  district attorney for San Francisco Trump has grown increasingly frustrated over the situation at the border  where tens of thousands of immigrant families are crossing each month  many to claim asylum  His administration has attempted several efforts to stop the flow and he recently shook up the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security The idea to ship immigrants to Democratic strongholds was considered twice in recent months  but the White House and Department of Homeland Security said the plan had been rejected  But Trump said Friday he was still considering the idea  Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws  we are indeed  as reported  giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only   Trump tweeted  He added that   The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders  Open Arms policy   so this should make them very happy  Wilson Romero is an immigrant from Honduras who chose to settle in the San Francisco Bay Area Romero  27  was separated from his daughter  now 7  by federal authorities at the U S  border at El Paso  Texas  last year and jailed for three months before being released and making his way to live with his mother in San Jose  California  There he was reunited with his daughter  who attends public kindergarten Romero says he goes about daily errands in public without worry of discrimination  His daughter has made friends and has playdates with the children of Mexican American families  It s a far cry from his hometown in the violence plagued outskirts of San Pedro Sula  Honduras  that he fled after his brother in law was killed To him  the biggest problem with being in the Bay Area is the high cost of living  The former textile factory worker relies on his mother s income from waitressing for food and clothing  and he s started thinking about asking legal permission to move to North Carolina  where an uncle resides and says it s cheaper to live and work  To tell the truth  it s a little tight now  financially speaking   said Romero  a former textile factory worker  who said he doesn t know of any charities that may be willing to help The plan discussed by Trump would also have financial  logistical and legal issues The transportation of immigrants who are arrested at the border to large and faraway cities would be burdensome and costly at a time when Immigration and Customs Enforcement is already stretched thin  having released over 125 000 immigrants into the country pending their immigration court since Dec  21  They are currently being released mainly in border states Flights chartered by ICE cost about  7 785 per flight hour  according to the agency  and require multiple staffers  including an in flight medical professional  The agency also uses commercial flights  Doing longer transports would increase liability for the agency  especially considering that many of the immigrants in its care are families with young children And despite the consideration given to releasing the immigrants on the streets to sanctuary cities  the Trump administration actually has plenty of jail space to detain families  As of April 11  the nation s three facilities to detain immigrant families were nowhere near capacity  including a Pennsylvania facility housing only nine immigrants It s also unclear how long the immigrants would stay in these cities because they are required to provide an address to federal authorities   typically of a family member   as a condition of their release  It s illogical   said Angela Chan  policy director and senior attorney with the San Francisco based Asian Law Caucus   It s just alarming that they are spending so much effort and so much time to engage in political theater  The Trump administration has long pushed back against cities with sanctuary policies  which generally prohibit local authorities to cooperate with federal immigration police  often by refusing to hold people arrested on local charges past their release date at the request of immigration officers  Over 100 local governments around the country have adopted a variety of these polices New York City will always be the ultimate city of immigrants   the President s empty threats won t change that   New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio said in a statement But Trump seemed ready to step up his fight with the cities  vowing to  give them an unlimited supply  of immigrants from the border    Associated Press writer Karen Matthews contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   President Nicolas Maduro s government in Venezuela poses a threat to the United States  U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday  referring to the increased involvement of Russia  Iran and Cuba in the country  I don t think there is any doubt that     the Maduro regime presents a threat to the United States of America   Pompeo told a U S  congressional hearing He added   It is clearly     a true threat to the United States  The United States is among more than 50 countries that have recognized Venezuela s opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country s interim president and imposed sanctions against Maduro and government officials Guaido invoked the constitution to assume the interim presidency in January  saying Maduro s re election was not legitimate The Trump administration has said that Maduro has surrounded himself with Cuban security and intelligence officials  and told Moscow to withdraw some 100 Russian troops that arrived in Venezuela in March Iran has joined China and Russia  which have flown supplies into Venezuela in support of Maduro An Iranian delegation landed in Venezuela this week to discuss launching direct commercial flights between the two countries  Venezuela s foreign minister said   Reporting by Lesley Wroughton and Patricia Zengerle  editing by Jonathan Oatis  

WASHINGTON   The Justice Department told a lawmaker this week that it had stopped defending a federal prohibition on female genital mutilation because of flaws in the law  two weeks after it also began fighting the Affordable Care Act in court rather than defend it The department  reluctantly determined  that it could not appeal a federal judge s decision to throw out a female circumcision case because the statute outlawing the practice needed to be rewritten  the solicitor general  Noel J  Francisco  wrote in a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein of California  the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee The decision by law enforcement officials to step back from advocating two statutes is highly unusual  Defending laws on the books is a principal function of the Justice Department  and only about once a decade since World War II has it declined to support a law enacted by Congress  according to Walter E  Dellinger III  who served as the solicitor general during the Clinton administration While there are important differences between the two cases   Republicans have attacked the Affordable Care Act in the courts for years  while legal experts are debating whether the circumcision law is defensible   critics were troubled by what they fear is an emerging view inside the Justice Department that it is up to the Trump administration  not members of Congress  to decide whether a law has merit and should be enforced  Imagine a world where an administration of one party passes a law and then a different president effectively invalidates it by having the Justice Department refuse to defend it in court   said Joshua Geltzer  the executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law School  You want elected lawmakers to draft laws  not lawyers at the Justice Department   Mr  Geltzer said In 1996  Congress outlawed female circumcision on minors  except in cases where the operation is medically necessary  The statute was tested for the first time last year when federal prosecutors charged four mothers who brought their daughters to a clinic in Livonia  Mich   and had them circumcised  Doctors and others involved in the procedures were also charged The government presented evidence that the defendants contributed to mutilating nine children in their care  but a Federal District Court judge threw out the case  citing flaws in the law that he said made it impossible to find the defendants guilty The Justice Department declined to pursue an appeal as it typically would  Mr  Francisco wrote  because Supreme Court rulings handed down after the law was passed prevented the government from mounting  a reasonable defense of the provision  as currently worded  Mr  Francisco s letter came on the heels of the Justice Department s request in March that an appeals court validate a December ruling by Judge Reed O Connor of Federal District Court in Fort Worth  Tex   that struck down the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that its mandate requiring people to buy health insurance was unconstitutional Democrats quickly condemned the Texas ruling  which jeopardized the health coverage of millions of Americans  and it prompted debate as well among legal scholars across the spectrum  who disagreed as to whether an entire law must fall if one part of it is flawed The decision to urge the appeals court to side with Judge O Connor was controversial inside the Justice Department as well  Only political appointees and a lawyer on a brief loan to the Securities and Exchange Commission signed the letter to the appeals court  not career department lawyers who are experts on the health care law The Justice Department generally defends any federal statute if a reasonable argument can be made in court that it is lawful  That position ensures that the department and the executive branch cannot usurp Congress s lawmaking powers by defending only certain laws Department lawyers often have informal discussions with lawmakers and their aides about language they believe could strengthen a law  particularly when Congress first considers a bill or after a Supreme Court ruling changes the judicial landscape and has an effect on existing legislation  Such a ruling affected the law prohibiting female genital mutilation In drafting that law  Congress relied on its power to regulate interstate commerce  Lawmakers had increasingly used that authority to overcome the fact that they cannot simply make local crimes federal matters  no matter how evil  unless they violate some federal power that Congress wields  For this to work  Congress has to show that there is some connection between the criminal conduct and interstate commerce   said Mr  Dellinger  now a partner at the O Melveny   Myers law firm But in 2000  four years after the female circumcision law was enacted  the Supreme Court examined Congress s use of the Interstate Commerce Act in drafting the Violence Against Women Act  In that case  United States v  Morrison  the government lost in part because the court had greatly narrowed Congress s ability to use its power over interstate commerce to draft criminal laws Last year  in the first court case involving the genital mutilation law  the judge in Michigan cited the Morrison case to rule that Congress had failed to clearly draw a connection between interstate commerce and the practice of female genital mutilation In his letter to Ms  Feinstein  Mr  Francisco sent a list of possible changes to the law to strengthen the connection with interstate commerce and keep the ban on female circumcisions in place  like outlawing the use of the banking or telecommunications systems to perform the act  Essentially  the Justice Department is urging Congress to fix the law before a case gets to the Supreme Court  where there is a good chance it would be struck down   Mr  Dellinger said  adding that the government s action in this case was appropriate   The constitutional fix is relatively straightforward  and should be uncontroversial  Mr  Geltzer called on the department to present fixes to Congress while defending the law in court rather than set it aside completely  Lawyers at the Justice Department often find that a law could have been written more clearly   he said   but it s rare that one is written so poorly as to be completely indefensible   

BEIJING   When a cross country rail line was unveiled in 2017  the Malaysian prime minister hailed it as a  game changer   a major transportation upgrade that would be built and financed by Chinese money and Chinese companies  It was a showcase project for China s effort to expand its geopolitical influence around the world through a vast infrastructure program A year later  the country s new leader slammed the deal as a corrupt  costly venture that would burden the country with too much debt  Calling the project  unfair   he postponed the rail line and vowed to renegotiate with China Now  China has agreed to cut the price tag on the project by one third to  11 billion  in a tacit acknowledgment that the economics of the original deal did not make financial sense The concession to Malaysia is part of a broad reassessment of China s ambitious infrastructure program  known as the Belt and Road Initiative  as concerns mount that countries are being saddled with billions of dollars of debt for spates of unnecessary projects  Since the summer  China has been rethinking Belt and Road  both the size and the speed at which capital is being deployed and the overall aggressiveness with which they were pursuing these projects   said Andrew Polk  a founder of Trivium  a consulting firm in Beijing   They ve come in throwing around their weight in these places and not taking stock of local politics  and it s blown up in their face  To China s president  Xi Jinping  the program provided a way to use the country s economic clout to build trade ties and win friends across Asia  Africa and Europe  Since it was announced six years ago  China has spent tens of billions of dollars on projects as far as Djibouti  Sri Lanka and the Solomon Islands  creating overseas opportunities for its domestic companies But China has increasingly faced criticism of debt trap diplomacy  for lending huge sums of money to vulnerable countries and then taking over valuable assets when they cannot pay  Last year  Sri Lanka had to hand over a port after it fell behind on Chinese loans With pressures mounting at home and abroad  Beijing has started to adjust its approach  trimming spending on projects and toning down what it says  China needs allies more than ever  as its economy slows and trade tensions with the United States and Europe simmer  We re in a period of China making tactical adjustments based on a deeply unpopular reputation   said Jude Blanchette  an expert on Chinese policy at Crumpton Group   This accommodation was made in context of China recognizing that the Belt and Road Initiative is less popular than China wished it was  Malaysia has been an important ally for China  Its prime minister  Mahathir Mohamad  was among the first foreign leaders to sign up to its coming Belt and Road Summit  a lavish two day affair  The United States said this month that it would not send high level officials to the conference  on concerns about the financing behind the plan But even for Malaysia  the original price tag for the rail deal with China Communications Construction Company was too much to stomach  The new administration saw the splashy Chinese infrastructure projects like the East Coast Rail Link and a  2 5 billion gas pipeline deal as opportunities for corrupt senior politicians to plunder government coffers When Malaysia signed the agreement for the rail line  the Chinese state backed company was under a World Bank ban for doing certain kinds of work because of a corruption scandal in the Philippines  Mr  Mahathir cited Sri Lanka s experience to justify his decision to suspend the East Coast Rail Line project Mr  Mahathir  93  came out of political retirement last year  riding a groundswell of opposition to the prime minister at the time  Najib Razak  amid allegations of large scale corruption At the heart of the scandal was a state investment fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad  or 1MDB  Officials and prosecutors have called 1MDB a slush fund  alleging that Mr  Najib siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars at the expense of the Malaysian people   He went to trial last week in what is expected to be the first of multiple corruption trials  After taking over from Mr  Najib last spring  Mr  Mahathir s administration discovered the country was in worse financial shape than previously understood  A  170 billion debt pile turned out to be closer to  250 billion  amounting to 80 percent of Malaysia s gross domestic product at the time As the new government began to pare back the debt  Mr  Mahathir announced that the administration would halt the East Coast Rail Link project and the gas pipeline deal  citing the high costs In an interview with The New York Times in January  Malaysia s finance minister  Lim Guan Eng  said the government was  looking for some cost rationalization  in regard to various projects the previous government had undertaken with China Under the original terms of the deal  Malaysian officials estimated that the country would have to make annual interest payments of  488 million  Once built and running  the rail was also expected to lose about  122 million a year  We want to reduce costs   Mr  Lim said For months  the Malaysian Finance Ministry closely examined a document published by an online news outlet  The Sarawak Report  that appeared to be a term sheet for the East Coast Rail Link project  The document  whose authenticity was not confirmed by The Times  indicated that the price quoted by China Communications Construction Company had been intentionally inflated to allow for kickbacks Under Mr  Lim  the ministry tried to authenticate the document but could not find the original   For us to be able to initiate any investigation  we need the documents  and until then there is not much we can do   he said in the January interview The rail project  meant to connect ports on Malaysia s east and west coasts  is now expected to cost  11 billion  roughly two thirds of the most recent projected price tag of  16 billion  This reduction will surely benefit Malaysia and lighten the burden on the country s financial position   Mr  Mahathir s office said in a statement on Friday At a news conference on Friday at the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing  Daim Zainuddin  a special envoy for the prime minister  said the savings from the new deal would be enough to build two more Petronas Twin Towers  a landmark in Kuala Lumpur  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump said on Friday he was considering sending illegal immigrants in the country to so called sanctuary cities  prompting U S  mayors to accept such an offer as the battle over border security raged Frustrated by rising numbers of undocumented immigrants arriving at the southern border and a failure to get Congress to fully fund a U S  Mexico border wall  Trump taunted Democrats by dangling the possibility of an influx of illegal immigrants into their communities  Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws  we are indeed  as reported  giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only   Trump wrote on Twitter Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney responded in a statement   While the Trump administration s proposal shows their disdain to basic human dignity  the City  Philadelphia  would be prepared to welcome these immigrants just as we have embraced our immigrant communities for decades  In February  a federal appeals court said the Trump administration could not terminate federal grants to Philadelphia for its refusal to cooperate with immigration agents seeking to deport immigrants  In Chicago  Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement  We would welcome these migrants with open arms  just as we welcomed Syrian refugees  just as we welcomed Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria and just as we welcome Rohingya refugees fleeing genocide in Myanmar   Sanctuary cities are local jurisdictions that generally give undocumented immigrants safe harbour by refusing to use their resources to help enforce federal immigration laws that could lead to deportations Those localities argue that it is not their responsibility to get involved in federal enforcement and that doing so could hinder policing efforts within communities  The Washington Post first reported on Thursday that the White House has been considering a plan for transporting immigrants in detention and releasing them into sanctuary cities that are Democratic strongholds The newspaper reported there was resistance from some high level Department of Homeland Security officials concerned about several aspects of such a plan  including the potential costs Nevertheless  Trump  speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday  said of sanctuary cities   We can give them an unlimited supply  of immigrants White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said these would be  illegal aliens that are already set for release   which likely would include families with children  House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi s hometown of San Francisco is another sanctuary city In remarks to reporters on Friday  Pelosi  a Democrat  said she was not aware of the newspaper report  But she added   it s just another notion that is unworthy of the presidency of the United States and disrespectful of the challenges that we face  as a country  as a people  to address who we are  a nation of immigrants  Pelosi was in Leesburg  Virginia  where House Democrats were wrapping up a three day retreat One immigration expert  who asked not to be identified  noted that undocumented immigrants in federal custody could be at one of several stages of the adjudication process and that Trump likely has the power to have them sent to different jurisdictions from where they are being held But the source added   This is a stunt  It doesn t enhance the efficiency of the process  Trump s challenge to Democrats came one day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  a Republican like Trump  told reporters that he wanted to launch bipartisan negotiations to seek solutions to the nation s immigration woes In March alone  103 492 undocumented immigrants have been taken into custody along the southern border or turned away  Many of them are from El Salvador  Honduras and Guatemala and are seeking asylum in the United States away from high levels of violent crime and illegal drugs at home   Reporting by Mohammad Zargham and Richard Cowan in Washington and Susan Cornwell in Leesburg  Virginia  editing by Richard Chang and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump said Friday the United States should not nationalize its 5G network and said private companies should move quickly to deploy the faster next generation network  In the United States our approach is private sector driven and private sector led  The government doesn t have to spend lots of money   Trump said   Leading through the government  it won t be nearly as good  nearly as fast   The White House mulled the idea of nationalizing the 5G network for more than a year  In March Politico reported that Trump s reelection campaign supported a government role in managing the 5G networks even as White House officials including top economic adviser Larry Kudlow have said for months they oppose the idea Trump spoke alongside Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai who disclosed Friday the agency plans to hold its third 5G spectrum auction on Dec  10  the latest effort to make more spectrum available that could transform significant sectors of the U S  economy Pai said Trump s comments opposing nationalization was an  important signal  to the private sector that is investing tens of billions of dollars in the 5G networks CTIA  an industry trade group  said Friday that Trump s statement  puts an end   once and for all   to any misguided notions of nationalizing spectrum resources or government mandated wholesale 5G markets  Pai is also proposing to invest  20 4 billion over 10 years to build out high speed broadband networks in rural America The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund aims to provide funding through a reverse auction to service providers in areas without access to high speed service and aims to connect up to four million rural homes and small businesses to high speed broadband networks 5G networks are expected to be at least 100 times faster than the current 4G networks  cut delays and allow for innovations in a number of fields  Pai spoke on a call with reporters ahead of the White House event with Trump and rural residents who could benefit from faster networks to tout the administration s efforts to boost 5G wireless networks and funding for rural broadband Since November  the FCC has auctioned 1 550 megahertz of spectrum to be used by commercial wireless providers for 5G connectivity  The third 5G spectrum auction will be the largest  with the FCC selling 3 400 megahertz in three different spectrum bands The FCC voted on Friday to seek comments on bidding procedures for the next auction  Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said the auction is a good step but the commission must also pivot  to mid band  spectrum  or risk falling behind other countries  Verizon Communications Inc  AT T Corp  Sprint Corp and T Mobile US Inc are beginning to deploy 5G service in U S  cities and are working to extend their networks as 5G compatible phones slowly become available  The Republican administration has also been warning other countries against adopting 5G systems from Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  citing security concerns For more than a year  the White House has been mulling an executive order that would direct the Commerce Department to block U S  companies from buying equipment from foreign telecommunications makers that pose significant national security risks  Reuters reported in December The FCC since March 2018 has also been considering rules to bar the use of funds from a government program to purchase equipment or services from companies that pose a security threat to U S  communications networks  Pai said that proposal is still pending   Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington  editing by Dan Grebler and James Dalgleish

circumstances  like a bad thing  In the Trump administration  though  some have seen it as the only way out while saving your reputation  Take Ms  Nielsen  for example  Though her legacy is likely linked with the president s policies on separating migrant families at the border  her dismissal allows her to argue that she objected internally   and lost the fight   over some of the president s most extreme positions on immigration  Mr  Trump is pushing to restart the practice of family separation  Read more about that here  The cabinet  Ms  Nielsen s departure means there will be five

said had been unfairly affixed to him in 2016  The rhetoric allowed Mr  Sanders  sardonic side to shine as he argued that his policy ideas were  in fact  far from radical  as evidenced by the increasingly warm embrace from the Democratic mainstream That theory seemed to have some traction with several of the undecided voters I talked to  I stumbled upon two outside a rally in Fairfield who were marveling over the sheer number of policy areas Mr  Sanders had covered in the span of an hour  Compared to his first run  he s in the right timing   Sandra Glickman  a Democrat  said   The country has changed   we ve been tenderized  we ve been outraged  and people are ready to receive what he s talking about  Now his political revolution doesn t seem so wild  As a result  Ms  Glickman  who is  a few years older  than Mr  Sanders  said she thought he actually sounded more confident compared with four years ago Kathleen Johnson  66  an independent who had been talking with Ms  Glickman when I approached  agreed And although Ms  Johnson said she is also hoping to meet candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar  she said she appreciated that Mr  Sanders seemed to be looking at the  big picture  rather than one issue In that vein  she had a homework assignment for me  Maybe  since you re a reporter  you could list all of the topics   Ms  Johnson said   I want to have a gauge  Is everybody else going to talk about all those same topics  or narrow their scope                      What to read tonight  Years ago  lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers

WASHINGTON DUBAI   President Donald Trump said on Monday he would name Iran s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization  in an unprecedented step that drew Iranian condemnation and raised concerns about retaliatory attacks on U S  forces The action by Trump  who has taken a hard line toward Iran by withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and re imposing broad economic sanctions  marks the first time the United States has formally labeled another nation s military a terrorist group The U S  step  which takes effect on April 15  prompted an immediate response from Iran  whose Supreme National Security Council in turn designated U S  military forces as a  terrorist organization   Iranian state run TV reported  The U S  military bases and their military forces in the region will be considered terrorist bases and terrorist forces that will be dealt with and confronted accordingly   Iran s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Iranian state TV  calling the U S  decision  a major strategic mistake   The IRGC is the Iranian government s primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign   Trump said in a statement  His administration has long criticized Iran for its influence in Iraq  Syria and Yemen  Critics of Trump s decision said it was largely symbolic because U S  law already carried penalties of up to 20 years in prison for U S  persons who deal with the IRGC because of its designation under another U S  sanctions program  the U S  Specially Designated Global Terrorist list POTENTIAL BACKLASHSenior U S  military commanders share Trump s concerns about Iran and the IRGC but long opposed the designation due to concern over a potential backlash against U S  forces in the Middle East and the problems it could create for U S  partners who have a relationship with Iran  U S  officials say The Pentagon declined to discuss what the U S  military was doing to protect American troops from any retaliation by the IRGC or Iran aligned militia in places like Iraq  U S  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the designation did not mean the U S  military would start treating the IRGC like al Qaeda  Islamic State or other militants that it can target at will  This is not about going to war with Iran or killing a bunch of Iranians  Absolutely not   said one  adding the U S  military had not been given any new direction to  go after  Iranian forces Three Iranian officials said that despite Tehran s harsh rhetoric  Iran s reaction will be  diplomatic and mild  Jason Blazakis  a former State Department official who oversaw the process for labeling foreign terrorist organizations  said he believed the IRGC designation was done for purely symbolic and domestic political reasons that could have deadly consequences for U S  troops He said it could prompt Qassem Soleimani  the powerful commander of the Quds Force  the IRGC s elite foreign espionage and paramilitary contingent  to allow IRGC controlled Shi ite Muslim militias to retaliate against U S  forces in Iraq  I imagine that tight leash he  Soleimani  has had on them  Shi ite militias  will be less tight  He could call for them to take actions against U S  assets in places like Baghdad s Green Zone   he continued  referring to the Iraqi capital s diplomatic and governmental enclave The only  theoretical benefit  the designation could provide is to make it slightly easier for the Justice Department to prosecute people for providing  material support  to the IRGC  he said  The Department already has the authority for similar prosecutions under an executive order signed by President George W  Bush soon after the Sept  11  2001  attacks by al Qaeda GUARDS  HUGE INFLUENCEThe IRGC is in charge of Iran s ballistic missile and nuclear programs  Tehran has warned that it has missiles with a range of up to 2 000 km  1 242 miles   putting Israel and U S  military bases in the region within reach  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  who is up for reelection on Tuesday  warmly welcomed the designation and tweeted  Thank you  my dear friend  U S  President Donald Trump    for meeting another of my important requests   Set up after Iran s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi ite clerical ruling system  the Guards have great sway in Iran s political system  controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces Their involvement in Iran s banking and shipping industries could complicate matters with U S  allies including the European Union  The new designation makes it easier to prosecute EU or other companies or individuals that do business with Iran The Iranian currency weakened on Monday  falling to 143 000 rials to the U S  dollar from Sunday s rate of 138 000 rials  according to the website Mesghal com  The United States has already blacklisted dozens of entities and people for affiliations with the IRGC  but not the organization as a whole  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  a strident critic of Iran  has pushed for the change in U S  policy as part of the Trump administration s tough posture toward Tehran   This designation is a direct response to an outlaw regime and should surprise no one   Pompeo said The State Department said on Monday the IRGC has been engaged in terrorist activity since its inception  including the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 Americans  and a foiled plan to attack the Saudi ambassador to the United States on U S  soil  Previous administrations considered designating the entire IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization but decided the risk to U S  forces overseas was too great  former U S  officials said   Reporting by Lesley Wroughton in Washington and Parisa Hafezi in Dubai

JERUSALEM   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he would annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he wins another term in office  a last minute pre election promise likely to enrage Palestinians and the Arab world In an interview with Israeli Channel 12 News three days ahead of the April 9 poll  Netanyahu was asked why he had not extended sovereignty to large West Bank settlements  as Israel did without international recognition in east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights  both captured in the 1967 Middle East war   Who says that we won t do it  We are on the way and we are discussing it   Netanyahu said   You are asking whether we are moving on to the next stage   the answer is yes  we will move to the next stage  I am going to extend  Israeli  sovereignty and I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlements  The veteran right wing Israeli leader  who has dominated Israeli politics for a generation  is fighting for his political survival against former top general Benny Gantz  a political novice campaigning on a centrist platform Netanyahu has cast Gantz as a weak leftist who would endanger Israel s security by giving territorial concessions to the Palestinians But Netanyahu  who has fought the election campaign under the shadow of corruption allegations  is also competing for votes with far right parties who advocate annexation  His comments are likely to appeal to hardline voters  who oppose ceding lands Palestinian leaders immediately reacted with anger Saeb Erekat  the chief Palestinian negotiator and a close aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  said   Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity  particularly with the Trump Administration s support and endorsement of Israel s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine  In Gaza  Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri urged Abbas s western backed Palestinian Authority to halt its security cooperation with Israel in the occupied West Bank  Netanyahu s dreams of annexing the West Bank will never be achieved and we will not allow that to happen   he said  It is time for  the PA  to stop security coordination with the occupation  and to get united in the face of the challenges  WEST BANKSettlements are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart Israeli Palestinian peace talks  frozen since 2014 After decades of settlement building  more than 400 000 Israelis now live in the West Bank  according to Israeli figures  among about 2 9 million Palestinians according to the Palestinian Statistics Bureau A further 212 000 Israeli settlers live in East Jerusalem  according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs The Palestinians and many countries consider settlements to be illegal under the Geneva conventions that bar settling on land captured in war  Israel disputes this  citing security needs and biblical  historical and political connections to the land The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank  east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip  all territory Israel captured in 1967  Israel has annexed east Jerusalem and withdrawn from Gaza  The West Bank remains under Israeli military occupation with limited Palestinian self rule Netanyahu s remarks follow a series of announcements and policy changes by U S  President Donald Trump that were seen to favor Israel In March  Trump broke with decades of international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  territory Israel captured from Syria That followed his December 2017 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel  and to move the U S  embassy there  Both moves delighted Israel  infuriated Palestinian and Arab leaders  and were opposed by most U S  allies With Trump s moves on Jerusalem and The Golan  the Israeli leader may feel emboldened to advocate for annexation  U S  officials have said they would unveil a long awaited Trump administration Middle East peace plan after the Israeli election  but prospects to restart negotiations appear dim The Palestinians have been boycotting the Trump administration over its Jerusalem moves and other recent decisions they view as pro Israel bias ELECTION CAMPAIGNThe U S  State Department declined to comment about Netanyahu s remarks  which were viewed in the Israeli media as an attempt to draw right wing votes rather than an immediate change of policy Netanyahu has been plagued by corruption allegations throughout the election campaign  after Israel s attorney general publicly announced in February that he intends to indict Netanyahu Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in three cases of alleged bribery and fraud  but the allegations could cloud his political future and that of any government he might head  possibly leading to a new election His main election rival  Gantz  has vowed to pursue peace with the Palestinians  but he has also stopped short at embracing their quest for statehood A spokeswoman for Gantz declined comment on Netanyahu s remarks  On Friday  the last day polling is allowed  Gantz s centrist Blue and White party was projected to take 30 seats  more than the 26 forecast for Netanyahu s right wing Likud  according to a poll in Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper But this and other polls also projected a majority of the Knesset s 120 seats will go to the parties in Netanyahu s right wing bloc  giving Netanyahu a slim but workable majority A few days before the previous Israeli election in 2015  Netanyahu vowed there would never be a Palestinian state under his watch but then backtracked on that statement after a rebuke from Trump s predecessor  Barack Obama  Last year  however  Netanyahu told members of his right wing Likud party that Israel and the United States were discussing the possibility of Israel annexing settlements  The White House swiftly denied that  While vowing that he would not evacuate settlers from their homes  Netanyahu has also said in the past that the future of the settlements should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians   Reporting by Maayan Lubell additional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah  Editing by Stephen Farrell  Peter Graff and Diane Craft

It was never like this before The migrants come now in the middle of the night or in the bright light of day  Men and women arrive by the hundreds  caked with dirt  with teens and toddlers in tow  They jump the small fences in remote parts of Texas  and they gather on the hot pavement at the main border crossing in California  Tired and fearful  they look for the one thing that they pray will allow them to stay in the United States  at least for a while  a Border Patrol agent Gone are the days when young  strong men waited on the Tijuana River levees for their chance to wade across the water  evade capture and find work for the summer  These days  thousands of people a day simply walk up to the border and surrender  Most of them are from Central America  seeking to escape from gang violence  sexual abuse  death threats and persistent poverty  The smugglers have told them they will be quickly released  as long as they bring a child  and that they will be allowed to remain in the United States for years while they pursue their asylum cases The very nature of immigration to America changed after 2014  when families first began showing up in large numbers  The resulting crisis has overwhelmed a system unable to detain  care for and quickly decide the fate of tens of thousands of people who claim to be fleeing for their lives  For years  both political parties have tried   and failed   to overhaul the nation s immigration laws  mindful that someday the government would reach a breaking point That moment has arrived  The country is now unable to provide either the necessary humanitarian relief for desperate migrants or even basic controls on the number and nature of who is entering the United States ImageMigrants seeking to turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents wait behind a portion of the U S  Mexico border fence in El Paso CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesThe immigration courts now have more than 800 000 pending cases  each one takes an average of 700 days to process  And because laws and court rulings aimed at protecting children prohibit jailing young people for more than 20 days  families are often simply released  They are dropped off at downtown bus stations in places like Brownsville  Tex   where dozens last week sat on gray metal benches  most without money or even laces on their shoes  heading for destinations across the United States At the current pace of nearly 100 000 migrants each month  officials say more than a million people will have tried to cross the border in a 12 month period  Some of those arriving today will have a strong legal case to stay under international refugee treaties and federal asylum laws  but most won t have a formal asylum hearing until 2021 The flow of migrant families has reached record levels  with February totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year  As many as 27 000 children are expected to cross the border and enter the immigration enforcement system in April alone  So crowded are border facilities that some of the nearly 3 500 migrants in custody in El Paso were herded earlier this month under a bridge  behind razor wire In recent days  officials have grasped for ever more dire ways to describe the situation   operational emergency    unsustainable    systemwide meltdown  One top official said simply   The system is on fire  An ineffective  not welcome  messageFor President Trump  the situation at the border has generated red hot fury  It erupted again on Sunday as he abruptly forced out Kirstjen Nielsen  his long embattled homeland security secretary  for what he considered her failure to put an end to the surge of migrants In recent days  the president has landed on a dark new message that  if taken literally  could mean an end to all immigration   legal and illegal   across the Mexican border  ImageAt the bus station in Brownsville  Tex   city officials took over a section of empty counter space to manage the intake of migrants  who wait in line after being dropped off by ICE CreditIlana Panich Linsman for The New York Times The system is full   the president said in California on Friday  standing in front of the rusting iron slats of the border wall that he wants to expand for hundreds of miles across the country s southern border   Whether it s asylum  whether it s anything you want  it s illegal immigration  We can t take you anymore  Yet  perversely  the president s own anti immigrant rhetoric has helped supercharge the pipeline of migrants from Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador  Smugglers lately have been buying radio ads in Central America  warning that Mr  Trump is about to shut down all immigration  If you ever want to go to the United States  they say  go now   They said they would take us by bus  We would be safe   said Jeremias Pascoal  16  who crossed into Texas earlier this month after paying  3 200 for a  guide  who showed his group to a road where he said they could surrender to the Border Patrol  Experts say the president is not wrong when he says that  legal loopholes  in America s immigration system are partly responsible for encouraging migrants to bring children like Jeremias on a dangerous journey that in some cases ends in tragedy  In December  two migrant children died in Customs and Border Protection custody after becoming gravely ill during

detainees that don t have anything  ImageA volunteer physician assistant examines a sick Guatemalan teenager in the medical clinic at Casa Oscar Romero  a migrant shelter in El Paso CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesBut the president has not chosen to prioritize a surge of new resources to the border  which could help ease the overcrowding and suffering that have gripped the migrants and the border communities where they arrive  Instead  Mr  Trump has insisted on simply trying to stop people from getting into the country in the first place   a policy of deterrence that not only has failed but has made the problem worse In an effort to send a  you re not welcome  message  the administration has tried a series of strategies  prosecuting everyone who crosses illegally  taking their children from them  tightening asylum standards  slowing down the number of people allowed to apply for asylum each day  forcing asylum applicants to remain in Mexico while they wait for court dates  In some cases  this approach has proved too cruel for the American public to tolerate and has run up against the protections enshrined in the Constitution  which the courts have decided protect migrants as well as citizens  Some of the president s agenda has been blocked by Congress or the courts  None of it has fixed the problem To the contrary  these policies have forced migrants to divert from well staffed border stations like the one in San Ysidro  Calif   where agents deliberately slowed down the number of migrants they would allow to cross each day  toward remote areas of West Texas and New Mexico  where the two migrant children died in December And the administration has done little to speed up the immigration courts  though that could be just the deterrent the president has sought  The backlog has been allowed to build to the point of a crisis   said Doris Meissner  the immigration commissioner in the Clinton administration and now a fellow at the Migration Policy Institute   They do not accept the basic proposition that this is a population where there are people qualified for protection and that enabling the systems we have is an answer  Seeking asylum  with childrenIn a series of international human rights agreements  beginning with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees  nations agreed to allow anyone to seek asylum  even if they entered a country illegally  The agreements defined a refugee as someone with a well founded fear of persecution based on  race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion   Determining whether an applicant receives asylum was left up to individual nations  but in the United States  the international obligations and the standards for asylum were largely incorporated into American immigration law beginning with the Refugee Act of 1980 Only about 20 percent of asylum seekers ultimately win the right to live and work in the United States by proving that they would face persecution in their home countries  Just wanting a better job doesn t qualify  Applicants have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or compelling testimony that establishes the  well founded  fear that they would face danger if they return home Some have won asylum  for example  by proving that their membership in a religious minority singles them out for harassment or threats  In the past  women suffering domestic abuse have qualified  as have some victims targeted by gangs  Generalized fear of violence does not qualify  Neither does poverty How Migration Is

2008 fiscal year          2018         Sources  U S  Customs and Border Protection and Department of Justice    Note  Apprehensions are shown as a 12 month rolling average By Denise LuThe asylum process begins with a  credible fear  screening to see if an applicant is likely to succeed in the first place Out of nearly 100 000 credible fear interviews during the year that ended in September of 2018  an asylum officer confirmed a credible fear 74 677 times   a nearly 75 percent approval rate  A senior Trump administration official vowed on Tuesday to dramatically reduce that rate by making the standards tougher  But it is what happens after the credible fear interview that is at the heart of America s bitter immigration debate In 2017  11 292 immigrants who had been released on bond or on their own recognizance were ordered deported because they failed to show up for their immigration proceedings  a 26 percent increase over the previous year  according to Justice Department data  ImageMigrants gathered outside of a motel in El Paso where they are being housed by a local nonprofit CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesBlanca Vasquez  who fled Honduras after gangs killed her husband and torched their home  passed a credible fear interview at the border in 2013  She was released and settled in northern Texas  where she got a janitorial job and waited for her day in court  About a year later  she said  she unintentionally missed her first hearing and was most likely ordered deported for failing to appear She s not sure  because she stopped going to court at all   I got confused   she said   I ask God to look after me  There are too many problems in my country  I want to stay here  Maria Perez  a Honduran who joined a caravan with her 8 year old son  Yunior  in November  waited two months in Tijuana for the chance to apply for asylum after her son s father was killed by a man who continued to threaten her family  When her number   1 506   was finally called  she and her son were soon released to await their court hearings under the juvenile protection laws  She lives now with a friend in Northern California  but she does not have a lawyer and isn t sure how to proceed with her case  I am very worried  I don t know what to do   she said Families like Ms  Perez and her son are the biggest targets of Mr  Trump s fury  The president and his aides blame the nation s immigration laws   the president derisively calls them  Democrat laws    for creating an incentive for migrants to bring a child with them to improve their chances of getting into the United States  One of them is the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  a 2008 bill signed into law by President George W  Bush that requires immigration authorities to treat migrant children differently than they do adults  The other is a 1997 legal settlement in a case known as Flores  which prevents the government from holding children or families in secure detention facilities for longer than 20 days It was trying to get around those legal limits that prompted the administration last spring to begin forcibly separating migrant children from their parents   detaining parents indefinitely while sending children to shelters and foster care  The fierce political backlash forced Mr  Trump to abandon that approach The president s most recent initiative was the one calling for many migrants to remain in Mexico for the months or years it could take for an American judge to hear their case  that policy  too  ran afoul of the courts when a federal judge in California blocked its implementation  ImageA young boy clings to his mother as they wait in a line of asylum seekers at the bus station in San Antonio CreditCallaghan O Hare for The New York TimesFor some migrants  the policy effectively meant no asylum case at all Miguel Aquino  29  who fled El Salvador in a caravan in October after being shot in the leg and hand by MS 13 gang members  waited for weeks in Tijuana to apply for asylum at the sprawling San Ysidro port  the biggest on the border  He was interviewed and sent back to Mexico to wait for a court date In March  when he arrived for a preliminary hearing without an attorney  the judge gave him more time to find one   and sent him back to Mexico to wait  Mr  Aquino said he has called eight lawyers  and they all said they couldn t represent him because he is in Tijuana  At this point  he is tired of waiting  The next time  if I don t go with a lawyer and they don t give a clear answer   he said   I m going to look for another way to get in   The source of the problemMr  Trump often says he plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt illegal immigration  But when the standoff over funding for the wall led to a 35 day government shutdown in December and January  it actually made things worse  Many immigration judges were furloughed  and tens of thousands of deportation and asylum cases were delayed  in some cases for years  There is another problem with the wall  Slowing the exodus of migrants from Central America would need to start in those countries first Central America s economies are still weak  and residents face drug and gang violence at levels largely unseen in other countries  Many are subject to deep poverty  a situation that recently reached a crisis with the collapse of coffee  corn and maize crops  M C   a 23 year old Guatemalan woman who asked to be identified by her initials for safety reasons  received an anonymous letter recently in her hometown  San Marcos  warning her that she would be killed if she did not give the letter writers 65 000 Guatemalan quetzals  nearly  8 500 M C   who is three and a half months pregnant  went to the police in San Marcos  Then she got a second letter  warning her to never go to the police again  After she received a third letter  she made the decision to leave for the United States  I didn t want to come here at first  but then I think it s the best thing for the baby   M C  said as she sat in a migrant shelter in the South Texas border city of Brownsville   Here  he s going to grow without crime  He can go to school  American diplomats say the best way to confront that kind of lawlessness is with the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid that has been flowing to Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras for several years  designed to bolster the rule of law and improve the economy ImageAt the Good Neighbor Settlement House in Brownsville  migrants rest  exhausted  after a meal CreditIlana Panich Linsman for The New York TimesLast week  Mr  Trump abruptly abandoned those efforts  ordering the State Department to scrap about  500 million in aid to the three countries  Mr  Trump s decision has been criticized by members of both parties  who call it shortsighted Likewise  critics say that Mr  Trump s repeated denigration of Mexico over the years   including his insistence on building a border wall   risks undermining Mexico s willingness to help to keep Central American migrants from traveling to the United States  This is the first Mexican administration that has even been oriented toward doing that   Ms  Meissner  the Clinton administration immigration commissioner  said  But blaming other countries and painting those coming across the border from Mexico as a national security threat has never failed to animate Mr  Trump s core supporters   the ones who helped deliver him the White House in 2016  It s an invasion   Mr  Trump declared in February  after Congress denied him money to build a wall   We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country  In fact  the migrants are mostly victims of the broken immigration system  They are not  by and large  killers  rapists or gang members  Most do not carry drugs  They have learned how to make asylum claims  just as the law allows them to do  And nearly all of them are scared   of being shipped off to Mexico  separated from their children

UNITED NATIONS   The United Nations on Friday urgently appealed for the release and evacuation of more than 1 500 detained refugees and migrants caught in the crossfire of escalating fighting sparked by a self styled Libyan army commander s military campaign to take the capital The U N  refugee agency said the refugees and migrants are believed to be trapped in detention centers where hostilities are ranging The oil rich North African country is now governed by rival administrations   a U N  backed government in the capital Tripoli and the west  and the self styled Libyan National Army in the east led by Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter who launched the major offensive earlier this month U N  spokesman Stephane Dujarric said fighting continued Friday on the outskirts of Tripoli  with reports of increased use of heavy artillery He said U N  humanitarian officials report that almost 10 000 people have fled their homes in areas affected by the ongoing fighting  We are concerned about the impact of these clashes on the already difficult living conditions of ordinary Libyans   he said Dujarric said local evacuation teams have received requests to move some 3 800 people to safer areas   but only 550 people have been evacuated so far due to access restrictions caused by hostilities  U N  High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said the refugees and migrants in detention centers are  in the most vulnerable and dangerous of circumstances   They have fled conflict or persecution in their own countries only to be trapped as conflict engulfs them again   he said in a statement   The risks to their lives are growing by the hour  They must be urgently brought to safety  Simply put  this is a matter of life or death  UNHCR said detention centers in proximity to the fighting include the Ain Zara  Qasr Bin Ghasheer and the Abu Sleim facilities  all located south of Tripoli Because of security and access issues  UNHCR said it has only been able to relocate 150 refugees from the Ain Zara center UNHCR said it tried to relocate all 728 refugees and migrants detained in the Qasr Bin Ghasheer facility to the Zintan detention center away from the clashes on Thursday but they refused  asking instead to be evacuated out of Libya But the refugee agency said currently  evacuation possibilities from Libya are extremely limited  We call upon the international community to advocate with all parties to the conflict to respect international legal obligations and to support measures to put an end to detention  while also providing solutions for people trapped in Libya  including humanitarian corridors to evacuate those most vulnerable out of the country   UNHCR said in the statement Dujarric said U N  envoy Ghassan Salame met with mayors from conflict affected areas on Friday to discuss the humanitarian situation  including ways to help trapped civilians Libya slid into chaos after a NATO backed uprising that toppled and later killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011  Elections were held shortly after Gadhafi s demise  but failed to bring stability In addition to being governed by rival administrations  Libya has also become a haven for armed groups  including several from neighboring countries and a major conduit for African migrants hoping to reach Europe Hifter s offensive has led to clashes with rival militias that support the U N  backed government in Tripoli The escalation has threatened to plunge the fractured nation deeper into chaos A spokesman for Hifter s Libyan National Army said that ousted Sudanese president Omar al Bashir and his associates had been supplying the U N  backed militias with arms and fighters Ahmed al Mesmari said in a televised statement late Friday that two military planes took off from Sudan s capital Khartoum on March 28 carrying insurgents   weapons and ammunition  and landed at Tripoli s Matiga air base controlled by the militias Al Mesmari expressed support for the Sudanese military  which detained al Bashir in a military coup and took power

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today in your inbox  With an aging population and declining birthrates  the country is far from  full   as President Trump has claimed  And yet  our immigration system has been pummeled by record numbers of migrant families flooding the border The administration has pushed to make it much tougher for those seeking asylum to win protection in the United States  And yet  the federal government wants to issue more visas to foreign workers in fields like landscaping and housekeeping Now  as my colleagues reported from San Ysidro  the immigration system may actually be reaching a breaking point Here are the top takeaways The situation isn t new Experts have been warning for years that the immigration system was heading for a major failure  as trends shifted  Instead of a migrant population of mostly young men crossing the border in search of temporary work  it s been largely families since 2014 That has placed more strain on systems meant to aid children and others who say they re fleeing from violence And while members of both political parties have called for overhauls over the years  none have been successful  Read the full story here  The people coming to the U S  are coming for different reasons That shift from men seeking work to families seeking refuge has taken place alongside other changes in the population of migrants crossing the border Many more are seeking asylum than in years past  which means they say they re fleeing their home countries   increasingly in Central America  rather than Mexico   over fears for their safety One of the biggest pressure points is a backlog in immigration courts The influx of migrants means immigration courts have been flooded with cases  which can drag out for years Immigration courts now have more than 800 000 pending cases  They take an average of 700 days to process  Read about another difficulty in backlogged immigration courts  the lack of interpreters who speak indigenous languages  The president s efforts at deterrence aren t working The Trump administration has tried a series of strategies to communicate that migrants aren t welcome  including prosecuting everyone who crosses illegally and taking their children from them Most recently  the administration implemented a policy of forcing those seeking asylum to stay in Mexico while their cases are resolved  but that was blocked by a California judge None of those efforts have worked  the president s talk about shutting down all immigration   legal and illegal   has actually spurred smugglers to advertise by claiming that now is the time to try to enter the United States  Want to read more about the border each week  Read Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter

WASHINGTON   U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that Treasury Department lawyers had held  informational  discussions with the White House about an expected request from House Democrats for President Donald Trump s tax returns Democrats are pursuing Trump s returns under a legal authority that aims to prevent interference from the White House on the Treasury s decision whether to release the tax returns  in what the White House chief of staff has called a  political stunt  Mnuchin said at a House Appropriations subcommittee budget hearing that the conversations had taken place before House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal s request last week for six years of Trump s tax returns But in a second hearing later in the day  Mnuchin said the department had never sought permission from the White House on the issue regarding the release of the tax returns  As a presidential candidate in 2016  Trump defied decades of precedent by refusing to release the tax documents and has continued to keep them under wraps as president  saying his returns were  under audit  by the Internal Revenue Service White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on Sunday that Trump s tax returns would never be handed over to Democratic lawmakers  in defiance of their efforts to learn more about the former real estate mogul s personal finances An attorney for Trump on Friday blasted the request from Democrats as  a misguided attempt  to politicize the tax laws  accusing lawmakers of harassment and interference in IRS audits  The Democrats  request is expected to lead to a long court battle Representative Mike Quigley  the Democrat who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on financial services and general government  pressed Mnuchin on Tuesday for more detail about the contact between Treasury and White House lawyers  I think this committee would like to know if in those communications  the White House had expressed their desire to you or anybody else at Treasury what their views  are  or how you should act on this matter   Quigley said   So if you would pass that on  it would be greatly appreciated  Mnuchin said he personally has had no conversations with anyone in the White House about the request  and was not briefed on the contents of the prior conversations between Treasury and White House lawyers  I believe that was purely informational   he said of those discussions   We had obviously read in the press that we were expecting this  I personally wasn t involved in those conversations   FOLLOW THE LAW Speaking at a separate hearing of a hearing of the U S  House Committee on Financial Services  Mnuchin said   We would not ever ask for the White House s permission on this nor did they give us the permission  At both hearings  Mnuchin said the Treasury would  follow the law  regarding Neal s request for Trump s tax returns  adding that was being reviewed by the Treasury s legal department Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney said the communication between Treasury and the White House over the request for Trump s returns was  deeply troubling    We need to get to the bottom of this   she said Democrats are relying on a provision in the Internal Revenue Service code enacted in 1924 after the Teapot Dome oil leases scandal rocked President Warren Harding s administration  They say it requires the Treasury secretary to turn over any tax returns to the chairmen of the congressional tax committees who request them for investigative purposes But if Congress takes the administration to court over Trump s taxes  little case law would be available to help guide judges  legal experts say  That is both because the statute cited by Neal to obtain the returns has hardly ever been contested  and because most document disputes between the legislative and executive branches of government are resolved by negotiation   Reporting by David Lawder  Additional reporting by Chris Prentice  Editing by Dan Grebler and Peter Cooney  

An Iranian diplomat who helped to negotiate the 2015 nuclear agreement will be Iran s ambassador to the United Nations  state media said Tuesday  filling a vacancy that had lasted five months The appointment of the envoy  Majid Takht Ravanchi  60  was considered a sign that Iran will try to preserve the agreement  even though the Trump administration has renounced it  reimposing onerous sanctions and taking other steps to isolate the country Iran s supreme leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  also has increasingly criticized the nuclear agreement for showing what he called the mistake of trusting the United States and other Western powers that were parties to the accord  But Ayatollah Khamenei has not repudiated the accord  which was meant to end Iran s economic isolation in return for its verified promises of peaceful nuclear work The ambassador job at the United Nations is considered Iran s most important foreign diplomatic posting  Mr  Takht Ravanchi will be the highest ranking Iranian official in the United States  which has no diplomatic relations with Iran Mr  Takht Ravanchi has held a number of posts  including serving as Iran s ambassador to Switzerland  deputy United Nations ambassador  deputy foreign minister and special assistant to the foreign minister  Mohammad Javad Zarif  His current role is as a political adviser to President Hassan Rouhani He also was a senior member of the Iranian team of negotiators in the talks that led to the nuclear agreement  and is considered close to Mr  Zarif  the American educated diplomat who was the lead negotiator for Iran in those talks and is a former United Nations ambassador Mr  Takht Ravanchi s appointment was suggested by Mr  Zarif  according to a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry  Bahram Qassemi  who made the announcement carried by Iranian news websites Political analysts said the choice of Mr  Takht Ravanchi was notable partly because it suggested that Mr  Zarif s own influence in the Iranian hierarchy  which had become murkier in recent weeks  might have rebounded When Ayatollah Khamenei invited the president of Syria  Bashar al Assad  to visit in February  Mr  Zarif was not even invited  in what was widely seen as a snub to Mr  Zarif and a victory for the hard line factions in Iran who see him as insufficiently hostile to the West  He offered to resign  but Mr  Rouhani asked him to stay  The appointment of Takht Ravanchi  instead of a fire breathing hard liner  suggests that Iran will for now stay in the nuclear deal and continue an outward looking foreign policy   said Cliff Kupchan  chairman of the Eurasia Group  a political risk consultancy  who has closely followed the nuclear agreement s uncertain future Mr  Takht Ravanchi replaces Gholamali Khoshroo  who also is a former ambassador to Switzerland and is close to Mr  Zarif  Mr  Khoshroo left the United Nations ambassador post last November after nearly four years News of Mr  Takht Ravanchi s appointment came a day after the Trump administration escalated its pressure campaign against Iran by designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps  a powerful arm of the Iranian military  as a foreign terrorist organization The designation imposed wide ranging sanctions on the Guards Corps  which is heavily immersed in a range of Iranian industries  The American step made it risky for foreign companies to engage with businesses partly or wholly owned by the Guards Corps The Iranian government responded by designating the United States Central Command as a terrorist organization  Mr  Rouhani  in a speech on Tuesday  called the United States the  world s leading terrorist  Recalling an American warship s downing of an Iranian passenger jet in the Persian Gulf in 1988  which killed all 290 aboard  Mr  Rouhani said Mr  Trump s declaration smacked of hypocrisy  You shot down our passenger plane and now you are speaking of fighting terrorism   he said The United States acknowledged errors in that episode and expressed regret for the loss of life but did not hold any service members accountable  

CARACAS   Venezuela removed eight tonnes of gold from the central bank s vaults last week  and the cash strapped socialist state is expected to sell the bullion abroad as it seeks to raise hard currency in the face of U S  sanctions  a lawmaker and one government source said  With sanctions imposed by Washington choking off revenues from exports by state oil company PDVSA  President Nicolas Maduro s increasingly isolated administration has turned to sales of Venezuela s substantial gold reserves as one of the only sources of foreign currency The government source said the Central Bank s reserves had fallen by 30 tonnes since the start of the year before U S  President Donald Trump tightened sanctions  leaving the bank with around 100 tonnes in its vaults  worth more than  4 billion At that rate of decline  the central bank s reserves would nearly disappear by the end of the year  leaving Maduro s government struggling to pay for imports of basic goods Neither Venezuela s central bank nor its information ministry responded to requests for comment  Trump s administration has declared Venezuela part of a  troika of tyranny  in Latin America  including left leaning governments in Cuba and Nicaragua  It is seeking to cut off cash flow to Maduro s government  foster dissent in the armed forces and oust him from power in the OPEC nation The United States and 50 other Western nations have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela s legitimate president  Guaido invoked the Constitution in January to assume an interim presidency  saying Maduro s May 2018 re election vote was a sham  Maduro has branded Guaido a U S  puppet and accused him of collaborating with Washington to sabotage the economy Opposition lawmakers have blasted companies buying Venezuelan gold or holding it as collateral for loans  saying they are giving Maduro a financial lifeline during an economic and humanitarian crisis Aside from the reserves held by the Central Bank in Caracas  Guaido is attempting to freeze bank accounts and gold owned by Venezuela abroad  This includes 31 tonnes in the Bank of England worth an estimated  1 3 billion BLACKOUTS AND WATER SHORTAGESVenezuela s economy is in a sixth year of recession  suffering hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods like food and medicine  Maduro eased restrictions on foreign exchange this year  but the economy remains desperately short of hard currency needed to import goods Last week s operation took place while only high level officials were present at the central bank s offices  given that most rank and file employees stayed home due to blackouts and water shortages that have plagued Venezuela in the past month  the government source said   They moved gold out while the central bank was in contingency mode   opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado said  adding that the bars would be sold abroad  though he did not know the destination A similar quantity of gold was removed from the central bank s vaults in February  Washington in January asked foreign gold buyers to stop doing business with the Venezuelan government  This prompted Venezuela to cancel a planned sale of 29 tonnes of gold to the United Arab Emirates But in February and March the central bank continued to authorize the movement of gold  the government source said  adding that it was aiming to sell small quantities  Earlier this year  Abu Dhabi investment firm Noor Capital said it bought 3 tonnes of gold from Venezuela on Jan  21  but would not buy more until the situation in the country stabilized And in March  Ugandan authorities said they were investigating the country s biggest gold refinery over imports of an estimated 7 4 tonnes of gold   valued at around  300 million   after state run media reported it could have originated from Venezuela   Reporting by Mayela Armas  Writing by Luc Cohen  Editing by Daniel Flynn and David Gregorio

WASHINGTON   The U S  government granted waivers to just 6 percent of visa applicants subject to its travel ban on a handful of countries during the first 11 months of the ban  new data reviewed by Reuters shows Trump administration officials have pointed to the waiver process embedded in the travel ban as proof it was not motivated by animus toward Muslims  as critics have charged  but rather serves to protect the United States In June 2018  after legal challenges defeated earlier iterations of the ban  the Supreme Court upheld a revised version and wrote in its majority opinion that the waiver program supported the government s claims that the ban served  a legitimate national security interest  But new data shows that only 6 percent of people subject to the travel ban were ultimately granted waivers during the first 11 months of the ban s full implementation Between Dec  8  2017 and Oct  31  2018  State Department officers ruled on nearly 38 000 applications for non immigrant and immigrant visas filed by people subject to the travel ban who otherwise qualified for the visas and needed waivers to get them They determined that just 6 percent   or 2 216 applicants   met the criteria for a waiver  Of those  670 had not yet received their visas but were expected to do so  The data was provided in a Feb  22 letter from Assistant Secretary of State Mary Taylor to Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen  The letter was received by Van Hollen s office on Wednesday  and his office provided it to Reuters  This data paints a clear   and deeply disturbing   picture of the Trump travel ban   Van Hollen said in a statement to Reuters   The administration repeatedly swore to the Supreme Court and the American people that this was not a de facto Muslim ban and that there was a clear waiver process to ensure fairness  That couldn t be further from reality  A State Department spokesman said on condition of anonymity that  a consular officer carefully reviews each case to determine if the applicant is covered  by the travel ban and  if so  whether the case qualifies for a waiver  The travel ban blocks citizens of Iran  Libya  North Korea  Somalia  Syria and Yemen  as well as some Venezuelan officials and their relatives  from obtaining a broad range of U S  immigrant and non immigrant visas  Chad was previously covered by the ban but was removed in April 2018  The latest data show a slight increase in the waiver issuance rate  Data from December 2017 through April 2018 showed that waivers were issued in 2 percent of visa applications filed by people subject to the travel ban TREMENDOUS HARDSHIPSThe ban s restrictions vary from country to country   Somalis  for instance  can receive short term visas and Iranians are allowed to get student visas  while North Koreans are blocked from all visas In addition to the almost 38 000 applications considered for a travel ban waiver  around 8 100 by people from countries subject to the travel ban were refused in the 11 month period for reasons unrelated to the ban  and nearly 2 600 applicants were found eligible for visas based on exceptions to the ban and thus did not need a waiver Critics say the waiver process is shrouded in secrecy  with vague standards and little information given to applicants about how they can qualify or apply for one  Two federal lawsuits are contesting the fairness of the process The official criteria for a waiver is a three part test assessing whether denying entry to an applicant would cause  undue hardship   if entry of the person would not pose a threat to the United States  and if entry would be in the national interest  There is no application for a waiver   the State Department says it  automatically  considers applicants for them  They  the State Department  are actually actively telling applicants   We don t want your materials in support of a waiver    said Mahsa Khanbabai  an immigration attorney in Massachusetts who has clients subject to the ban   Even in the cases where they do take them  the extraordinary amount of time that it takes to make a decision causes tremendous hardships for people     Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati  Editing by Kieran Murray and Daniel Wallis  

WASHINGTON   U S  officers arrested or denied entry to over 103 000 people along the border with Mexico in March  a 35 percent increase over the prior month and more than twice as many as the same period last year  according to data released by U S  Customs and Border Protection on Tuesday The steady increase in migrant arrivals  which has been building over the past several months  is driven by a growing number of children and families  especially from Central America Children and people traveling as families made up 67 percent of those arrested by U S  Border Patrol agents between official ports of entry in the month of March  officials said  In March 2018  the same category made up one third of arrests U S  President Donald Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with the rising number of Central American migrants attempting to cross the southern border  and his ire has been directed at his own officials  Congress  and Latin American countries  who he says have not done enough to stop their citizens from traveling to the United States On Sunday  Trump s top homeland security official  Kirstjen Nielsen  said she was stepping down  and a senior administration official said other agency leaders had not done enough to crack down on the surge in immigration Immigration experts believe more migrants are likely to attempt to cross in the coming months  as numbers typically peak around May   Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati  Editing by Rosalba O Brien  

President Trump stopped short of announcing a final trade deal with China on Thursday  saying in an Oval Office meeting with the Chinese delegation that it may take another four weeks or more to secure an  epic  trade agreement Negotiators had originally aimed to secure a deal this week during a visit from Liu He  the Chinese vice premier and special trade envoy  and announce a presidential summit meeting between Mr  Trump and Xi Jinping of China  But after more than a year of tit for tat tariffs  on and off negotiations and threats of additional punishment  the United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues  including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed  and when  We re talking intellectual property protection and theft  We re talking about certain tariffs   Mr  Trump said  referring to issues that remain unresolved People familiar with the negotiations had said that the president was poised to announce a summit meeting with China  But those plans spurred a backlash among some of the president s trade advisers  who argued that announcing a meeting before the deal was struck would weaken the United States  hand and give it less leverage to force changes it is seeking In remarks at the White House  Mr  Trump said that the deal was  very complete  and that the two sides had  agreed to far more than we have left to agree to   I think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to   he continued But he said there would be no summit meeting until a final deal was made   If we have a deal then we ll have a summit   the president said The date and location of a summit meeting have also proved controversial  The United States had initially proposed holding one at Mar a Lago  Mr  Trump s Florida resort  but China has been pushing for an official state visit in Washington or a neutral location in a third country  people familiar with the matter said Lawmakers had publicly fretted about announcing a summit meeting before the deal was inked  suggesting that Mr  Trump was surrendering his leverage in his eagerness to sign an agreement Both Republicans and Democrats have urged Mr  Trump to hold out for a tough deal to combat Chinese practices that American businesses have long seen as problematic  including the coerced transfer of foreign technology as a condition of doing business in the country and the ample government subsidies for Chinese firms  Last week  POTUS told us he would not sign a  good  trade deal with  China he would only sign a  great  one   Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  said in a Twitter post on Thursday morning   I believe him  But to be a  great  deal it must allow us to do in China what they can do in US   it must have real enforcement mechanisms  The United States has pressed China to make commitments on purchasing American goods  opening markets to foreign business and increasing protections for foreign intellectual property in a bid to rebalance an economic relationship that Mr  Trump says is unfair for American workers  It remains to be seen how sweeping and significant any agreement will be  and whether it will achieve the lofty promises Mr  Trump has made about resetting the economic relationship with Beijing But the White House is also facing pressure to resolve the trade war  which has begun to hurt American farming  manufacturing and other sectors  and caused wild swings on Wall Street  Industries including automaking  technology manufacturing and farming have anxiously awaited reduced tariffs and details of a new agreement  which will have huge implications for their businesses The president s tariffs have been successful at bringing the Chinese to the negotiating table  and his advisers have insisted they will not squander an opportunity to press China for substantial economic reforms that past administrations were unable to secure  Still  the Chinese have balked at making any reforms that could be viewed as infringing on their sovereignty or undercutting the Communist Party s control of the economy  If you and I are making a deal  and you have to drag me kicking and screaming the whole way  what are the odds the deal is going to hold   asked Derek Scissors  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute   I don t find that the slightest bit convincing  American negotiators have pushed for an enforcement mechanism that would allow tariffs on Chinese goods to snap back if China violated the terms of the deal  and that would forbid China to retaliate  But Chinese negotiators have resisted such an idea  describing it as a potential infringement on their sovereignty Myron Brilliant  the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  said foreign stakeholders would be scrutinizing the deal to see whether it contained a strong enforcement mechanism that would hold the Chinese accountable to their obligations  That is what would separate this agreement from previous agreements   he said The two sides spent the past two months drawing up more than 120 pages of an agreement covering issues including forced technology transfer and cybertheft  intellectual property rights  currency and nontariff barriers to trade  The Trump administration has also pressed China to commit to hundreds of billions in purchases of American products  including agricultural products  energy and airplanes The administration has been eager to front load China s purchases of American products to help bolster farm country and other important constituencies and try to bring down the bilateral trade deficit before the 2020 election  Mr  Trump s advisers would prefer to keep the tariffs in place as long as possible  an arrangement the Chinese oppose In recent weeks  Beijing has introduced a steady drumbeat of other reforms intended to please American constituencies and win Mr  Trump s favor  China has resumed purchases of American soybeans and announced it would reclassify fentanyl  which has fueled the American opioid epidemic  as a controlled substance  Beijing also approved a sweeping rewrite of a foreign investment law that may help foreign companies avoid unequal treatment  And it approved a request by JPMorgan Chase to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country and floated the idea of expanding access for foreign cloud computing companies China experts have cautioned that the long running economic stresses between the countries are unlikely to be entirely put to rest with this round of negotiations  The negotiations  no matter what anybody says  will not end at the end of this phase   said David Lampton  a fellow at Stanford University s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies   We ve got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead   

WASHINGTON   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers on Tuesday that White House lawyers had been in touch with his department about a congressional request for President Trump s tax returns but said he had not personally spoken to Mr  Trump or those lawyers about how the matter was being handled Mr  Mnuchin s disclosure is the first public acknowledgment of communication between the White House and the Treasury Department related to Mr  Trump s tax returns  It comes as the president has made clear he has no intention of handing over his personal financial records without a fight Mr  Mnuchin  in testimony on Tuesday before two congressional committees  acknowledged that White House lawyers had been in touch with his department before the formal request was made last week  But he said that he had not been briefed on those discussions and described them as  informational   Our legal department has had conversations prior to receiving the letter with the White House general counsel   Mr  Mnuchin said   I acknowledge there were conversations  I am not briefed on the full extent of those conversations  During a marathon set of hearings that lasted more than four hours  Mr  Mnuchin parried multiple questions about how he would handle a request for the president s taxes  Mr  Mnuchin both defended Mr  Trump s right to keep his tax returns private and tried to assure lawmakers that he would not allow politics to interfere with Treasury s decision about whether to provide the records to Congress  Democrats appeared largely unsatisfied  at one point questioning Mr  Mnuchin about whether he was putting his job security before his legal obligations  It is our intent to follow the law   Mr  Mnuchin said   It is being reviewed by the legal departments and we look forward to responding to the letter   I am not afraid of being fired at all   he added Still  Mr  Mnuchin suggested he believed that Congress was overreaching its authority and defended Mr  Trump s right not to release his tax returns  The general public when they elected President Trump made the decision to elect him without his tax returns being released   Mr  Mnuchin said  adding that the president complied with requirements to release a financial disclosure form Mr  Mnuchin said it would be  premature  to comment on how his agency would respond to the formal request by House Democrats for six years of Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns The request for Mr  Trump s tax returns is putting Mr  Mnuchin  one of his most loyal aides  at the center of what is shaping up to be an extraordinary legal battle between two branches of government A decision on whether to hand over the financial records is expected to fall to the Internal Revenue Service and Mr  Mnuchin  whose Treasury Department oversees the tax collection agency  While Mr  Mnuchin has been fairly cautious in discussing the request  Mr  Trump and his top advisers have made it increasingly clear that they will not allow the president s tax returns to be released without a fight On Friday  Mr  Trump s personal lawyer asserted Mr  Trump s right as a citizen to keep his tax returns private and told the Treasury Department not to hand the returns over to House Democrats Mr  Mnuchin said that he believed it was  appropriate  for the Treasury and White House legal departments to have spoken generally about a potential request  but he emphasized that he would not be taking direction from the president on the decision  We would not ever ask for the White House s permission on this  nor did they give us permission   Mr  Mnuchin said His statement that the White House had reached out to Treasury about the congressional request sent Democratic aides scrambling to assess whether those conversations represented political interference and violated the law But Lawrence B  Gibbs  a former I R S  commissioner and counsel during the Nixon administration  said he was aware of no legal statute that prohibited such dialogue Mr  Mnuchin s turn in the spotlight comes at a delicate moment for him  One of the longest serving members of the president s cabinet  he has been dogged in recent weeks by questions over his financial ties to the film industry  as well as questions surrounding the Treasury Department s removal of sanctions against three companies controlled by an influential Russian oligarch  Mr  Mnuchin has also been at the center of Mr  Trump s growing frustration with the Federal Reserve  which he publicly blames for slowing American economic growth  Mr  Trump has aimed much of his criticism at the Fed chairman  Jerome H  Powell  whom the president installed to the top job on the recommendation of Mr  Mnuchin VideoRepresentative Maxine Waters and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had a tense exchange during testimony on Tuesday before two congressional committees  As the hearing went into the evening  Mr  Mnuchin said he needed to attend a meeting with an official from Bahrain CreditCreditZach Gibson Getty ImagesMr  Mnuchin s handling of the matter will be watched closely by Mr  Trump  who has kept his tax returns closely guarded despite promises as a candidate to eventually release them  Democrats are using a little noticed provision of the tax code to request the documents  and the Trump administration has asserted that those efforts are outside the bounds of congressional authority and that the request is nothing more than political harassment  Last week  Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  who leads the House Ways and Means Committee  requested that the I R S  hand over six years of Mr  Trump s tax returns  The Democrats will never be satisfied  no matter what they get  how much they get  or how many pages they get   Mr  Trump said on Monday in a Twitter post   It will never end  but that s the way life goes  Mick Mulvaney  the president s acting chief of staff  said over the weekend that Democrats would  never  obtain the president s taxes and called their efforts  a political hit job  Mr  Mnuchin suggested that an attempt to obtain tax returns for political purposes could ultimately harm both parties and give lawmakers discretion to obtain financial records of political enemies  Mr  Mnuchin noted that Representative Kevin Brady of Texas  who was the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means committee during the Obama administration  did not make such requests  I am sure there are many prominent Democrats who are relieved that when Kevin Brady was chairman of the committee that he didn t request specific returns   Mr  Mnuchin said As Mr  Mnuchin s second hearing of the day drifted past 5 p m   he erupted in frustration at Representative Maxine Waters  who oversees the House Financial Services Committee  saying he needed to go so he could attend a meeting with an official from Bahrain When Ms  Waters refused to conclude the hearing and said he could leave if he wished  Mr  Mnuchin advised her to use her gavel and dismiss him  If you wish to keep me here so that I don t have my important meeting and continue to grill me  then we can do that   Mr  Mnuchin said   I will cancel my meeting and I will not be back here  I will be very clear  if that s the way you would like to have this relationship  Mr  Mnuchin and the I R S  have until the end of Wednesday to comply with Mr  Neal s request  based on a deadline the lawmaker outlined last week  What comes next depends on their answer  The Treasury secretary told reporters after the hearing that it would be a  good guess  that his department would respond to the request by the deadline If the I R S  complies  Mr  Neal is unlikely to immediately say anything else to the public  If the agency objects to the request or does not answer  Mr  Neal could press his case and warn the agency that House Democrats will view not handing over the documents as a violation of the law At that point  Mr  Neal is likely to turn to the courts to try to enforce his request  teeing off a legal battle that could take months or years to sort out and could wind up at the Supreme Court Charles Rettig  the I R S  commissioner  under questioning by Democrats in another House hearing room  did his best to avoid divulging internal deliberations over Mr  Neal s request  but said that he and the I R S  general counsel had been  interactive  with the Treasury Department in sorting out how to respond  He did not clearly state who he believed should have a say in the outcome  There was a discussion about who is going to handle the response   Mr  Rettig said   There is no conclusion on that  Mr  Rettig said he was not aware of anyone at the I R S  having communicated with the White House about the matter While Mr  Mnuchin might try to defer a decision on Mr  Trump s taxes to the department s lawyers  he may ultimately have to weigh in Former I R S  officials have suggested that privacy will be Mr  Mnuchin s strongest argument and that the administration will probably look to undercut the nature of the House Democrats  request for the returns as part of the committee s oversight of  the extent to which the I R S  audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president  Mr  Gibbs noted that the provision Democrats were using to seek Mr  Trump s returns was drafted when the tax code was being rewritten to improve protection of taxpayer privacy  Despite the language in the code  which appears to clearly give Congress the power to access anyone s tax returns  a request that is political in nature could ultimately be shot down by the Supreme Court  This goes way beyond the president   Mr  Gibbs said   If our politicians  at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue  can obtain taxpayer information  taxpayers have to wonder if there really is confidentiality anymore   

LONDON   Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is still looking for ways to take control of Debenhams  he said on Monday after the ailing retailer rejected his rescue plan only hours before it was due to fall into the hands of its lenders  Billionaire Ashley  who has compiled a string of stakes in retailers after building up Sports Direct  had offered to underwrite a 150 million pound   196 million  rights issue in exchange for the Debenhams CEO role and a pledge by lenders to write off a similar amount of debt  Debenhams  once the country s biggest chain of department stores  rejected the offer on Monday afternoon  Sports Direct has also offered to buy Debenhams outright  but the strained relations between the two sides make it more likely that Debenhams will enter a form of administration on Tuesday that would wipe out all shareholders  In the continued absence of any such engagement from the board of Debenhams and Debenhams  lenders  there is a likely significant and negative impact on Debenhams  current shareholders and other stakeholders  including suppliers and employees   Sports Direct said  Debenhams declined to comment  Its shares were down 10 percent at 1 8 pence  Despite its long history  Debenhams has been battling for survival after a consumer shift online and to cheaper outlets destroyed 90 percent of its share value in the past year The company  which had 19 million customers and 2 9 billion pounds in sales last year  has said it needs to refinance its balance sheet and restructure the business to make it more sustainable  It plans to close about 50 underperforming stores  putting about 4 000 jobs at risk With a deadline looming that would give the lenders full control of Debenhams  Ashley has stepped up efforts to beat them to it  Owning 30 percent of the group  he has already forced the chairman out of the company and the CEO off the board As well as the underwritten rights issue  Sports Direct said it is still considering its options regarding the 61 million pound takeover offer it made at the end of March  It has until April 22 to make a firm offer or walk away  LACK OF TRUST However  a source familiar with the situation said that there is a lack of trust between the two sides  with Debenhams fearing that Ashley could renege on his investment offer after he takes control  If no solution can be found  Debenhams will fall into the hands of its lenders at the close of business of Monday  It is then likely to be put in a so called pre pack administration that enables stores to keep operating while its lenders restructure the operations and seek to cut rents   Ashley becoming CEO is a major sticking point for the lenders  there is a major trust deficit here   the source said  declining to be named because the talks are private For its part  Sports Direct said Debenhams and its advisers had undertaken a  sustained program of falsehoods and denials  and called on board members Terry Duddy and David Adams to take a lie detector test  The company added that Ashley had taken his own lie detector test  after the companies clashed in a meeting  and said   Mike Ashley s score  for example  was so significantly high as to be considered rare in comparison to others   Laith Khalaf  a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown  said the strings attached to Ashley s offer looked too much for the lenders to swallow   In theory  a deal could be struck  but relations seem far from cordial and the Debenhams management look set on giving the lenders control   he said  Ashley  who also owns Premier League soccer club Newcastle United  made his fortune from building retailer Sports Direct into a dominant presence on Britain s shopping streets and online The 54 year old businessman said in March that he was willing to step down as CEO of Sports Direct if he could take an executive position at Debenhams In recent years he has pounced on other weak retailers  including department store chain House of Fraser  and analysts have speculated that he could put the two together and could also use Debenhams  excess store space to sell brands he already owns    Reporting by Kate Holton  Editing by Keith Weir and David Goodman

reported that a careful analysis of data collected by the European Space Agency s Mars Express orbiter revealed a plume of methane rising above Gale Crater near the Martian Equator in June 2013  The measurement occurred just one day after NASA s Mars rover  exploring inside that crater  had also detected elevated levels of methane But now  a newer European spacecraft  the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter  has found no methane at all  It s really hard to reconcile   said Oleg Korablev of the Space Research Institute in Russia and principal investigator of the Trace Gas Orbiter instrument that probed the Martian atmosphere for methane  The newer spacecraft entered orbit around Mars in 2017 and carries more sensitive instruments than Mars Express  which arrived in 2003  While the Trace Gas Orbiter has so far failed to find methane  that does not mean Mars Express and the Curiosity rover were wrong  Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar  Methane  if it is there in the thin Martian air  is significant  because sunlight and chemical reactions would break up the molecules within a few centuries  Thus any methane detected now must have been released recently  On Earth  almost all methane is produced by living organisms  although it is also generated by geothermal reactions devoid of biology Dr  Korablev and his colleagues reported their findings on Wednesday at a meeting of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna  and in an article published in the journal Nature In the Nature article  the scientists said that first batch of scientific data  from April through August 2018  showed no signs of methane  Dr  Korablev said that readings since have also come up empty The orbiter s instrument is sensitive enough to conclude the air contained less than 50 parts per trillion of methane  That appears to contradict Curiosity s readings  which did detect methane  at levels 10 times higher The 2013 plume observed by Curiosity and Mars Express was even more striking  about 100 times as much methane as what the Trace Gas Orbiter data says is not there  So what s going on   said Dorothy Z  Oehler  a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute  based in Tucson   Nobody really knows  Dr  Oehler was involved with the Mars Express research but not the Trace Gas Orbiter findings Researchers first reported the detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere a decade and a half ago based on measurements by Mars Express and telescopes on Earth  But because those claims were at the edge of what the instruments were capable of measuring  many scientists remained skeptical The Trace Gas Orbiter uses a different technique  From behind Mars  it looks at sunlight passing through the planet s atmosphere  Specific colors of light absorbed by the air provide fingerprints that identify specific molecules So far  the fingerprint for methane is missing However  the orbiter and Curiosity are looking at different places  The orbiter has yet to make a measurement directly over Gale Crater  Because clouds and dust block sunlight  the Trace Gas Orbiter is peering at least several miles above the surface  while Curiosity is measuring what is at the surface In addition  Mars was enveloped by a giant dust storm much of last year   the same one that ended the mission of NASA s Opportunity rover  In 2018  the Curiosity rover only made a single methane measurement  in June  Some scientists think that the methane in the atmosphere at that time could have stuck to the storm s dust particles  speeding up its cleansing from the air Still  scientists had expected that any releases of methane would mix throughout the Martian atmosphere  much as a drop of food coloring diffuses in a glass of water  In an email  Christopher R  Webster  a scientist at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who leads Curiosity s methane measurements  said the new results  show that the Curiosity background levels are not representative of the planet as a whole  and this is a big surprise  Dr  Oehler said at first she wondered whether there might be something wrong with the instrument aboard the Trace Gas Orbiter  But scientists working on the mission persuaded her that it was correctly identifying other molecules in the atmosphere  Methane does seem to waft episodically into the atmosphere  she said  pointing out that both Curiosity and Mars Express observed methane in the same place at the same time in 2013   That kind of tipped the balance to me   she said   That s just too coincidental  The mystery has scientists brainstorming outlandish possibilities that cannot be entirely ruled out Not only that there might be methane producing microbes living in the rocks of Mars  but  maybe there s a methane utilizing bacteria that is gobbling it up the minute it s produced   Dr  Oehler said   She noted that it would hard to explain how methane gobbling bacteria underground could suck methane out of the air  Lisa M  Pratt  NASA s planetary protection officer who is responsible for limiting human contamination of Mars  is also intrigued   The mysterious appearance and disappearance of methane in the Martian atmosphere remains the most compelling hint of possible life in the subsurface of Mars   Dr  Pratt said   What is needed now is a carefully planned and coordinated set of observations between the Trace Gas Orbiter and Curiosity  More news from MarsSomething on Mars Is Producing Gas Usually Made by Living Things on EarthApril 1  2019Watch Two Tiny Moons Eclipse the Sun on MarsApril 4  2019Hear the Sounds of Wind on

earners  to delay their taxes indefinitely  and in some cases  to avoid paying tax at all  Challenges to the plan include how to value gains in complex assets  how to handle declines in value  and how

WASHINGTON   In an indictment that seized the attention of the capital s K Street lobbying corridor  Gregory B  Craig  a White House counsel in the Obama administration  was charged on Thursday with lying to the Justice Department and concealing information about work he did in 2012 for the government of Ukraine The indictment of Mr  Craig  74  stemmed from an investigation initiated by the office of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III The charges represented a continuation   and an expansion   of a new focus on a long neglected law governing foreign influence operations in the United States  which the Justice Department has begun prioritizing in part because of scrutiny related to Mr  Mueller s investigation Mr  Craig  in a video posted on YouTube on Thursday night  called the charges against him  unprecedented and unjustified   and expressed confidence  that both the judge and the jury will agree with me   Read the indictment  The Foreign Agents Registration Act  or FARA  had been the basis for charges brought against several people who had been investigated by the special counsel  The 1938 law requires Americans to register with the Justice Department when they lobby or do public relations in the United States for foreign politicians  parties or governments Before Mr  Craig s indictment  the recent charges brought in cases initiated by Mr  Mueller had accused people of failing to disclose their lobbying work The charges against Mr  Craig  on the other hand  stem from public relations  rather than lobbying  While Mr  Craig was not charged with failing to register under the law  the indictment accuses him of lying to  and withholding information from  the Justice Department officials who oversee FARA in order to avoid registration Before the indictment  Mr  Craig s lawyers asserted that the case against their client was flimsy  pointing out that Mr  Mueller s team had referred it to federal prosecutors in Manhattan last year for potential prosecution related to foreign lobbying laws  but that they did not bring charges  Instead  the case was moved in January to Washington  Mr  Craig had no interest in misleading the FARA Unit because he had not done anything that required his registration   Mr  Craig s lawyers  William Taylor and William Murphy  said in a statement on Thursday  referring to the part of the Justice Department that oversees the law   That is what this trial will be all about  The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III By Thursday afternoon  the indictment and its implications were a hot topic for Washington s lucrative lobbying and communications consulting industry The charges will prompt even more diligent review of possible compliance obligations by consultants who represent foreign clients  said Thomas J  Spulak  a partner at the King   Spalding law firm who advises on lobbying compliance  It s pretty significant   he said   It s not just trying to influence the government  it s trying to influence the American public   He added  of Mr  Craig s case   If they can establish the facts  then I think it s a pretty serious violation  Mr  Craig s indictment also attracted notice because he is the first person who made his name in Democratic Party politics to be charged in a case linked to the special counsel s investigation  An Ivy League educated lawyer  Mr  Craig held prominent positions in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama The charges  undermine the narrative of President Trump and congressional Republicans that the Mueller probe was a Democratic witch hunt meant to bring down Trump and the G O P    said Carl Tobias  a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law The indictment said Mr  Craig  did not want to register as an agent for the government of Ukraine  partly because he believed doing so would make it less likely that he and others at his firm at the time  Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher   Flom  would be appointed to federal government posts  Mr  Obama had put rules in place restricting the work that former lobbyists could do in his administration The indictment said Mr  Craig also wanted to hide the identity of the Ukrainian oligarch who paid  4 million to fund the overwhelming majority of the fees received by Skadden Arps for the Ukraine work In his YouTube video  Mr  Craig identified the oligarch as Viktor Pinchuk  a steel magnate who has portrayed himself as pro Western  and who has donated millions to the Clinton Foundation  as well as  150 000 to Mr  Trump s since shuttered charitable foundation Mr  Pinchuk s representatives have said that  he had no connection to the project either professionally or personally  and  was not the source of any funds used to pay fees of Skadden in producing the report  The work was done on behalf of the government of Viktor F  Yanukovych  then the president of Ukraine  and consisted primarily of producing a report on the prosecution and jailing by Mr  Yanukovych s government of one of his rivals  the former Prime Minister Yulia V  Tymoshenko  The Skadden Arps team also agreed to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case The work was steered to Mr  Craig and his firm by Paul Manafort  who at the time was a political consultant earning tens of millions of dollars for his representation of Mr  Yanukovych  Mr  Manafort intended to use the report to quell Western criticism of Mr  Yanukovych Everyone Who s Been Charged in Investigations Related to the 2016 ElectionSix Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel Mr  Manafort  who went on to become Mr  Trump s campaign chairman in 2016  was sentenced last month to seven and a half years in prison on charges brought by Mr  Mueller s team related to obstruction of justice and violations of FARA  as well as banking and tax laws stemming from his work in Ukraine Mr  Craig is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday In his video statement  Mr  Craig said his team at Skadden Arps  researched the requirements for registration under FARA and agreed that the law firm did not need to register   He also said that the report the team produced  was critical of important aspects of the trial  which we found to be flawed  After the report was released  and Mr  Craig was quoted discussing it in an article in The New York Times  the Justice Department reached out to Skadden Arps to ask why the firm and its lawyers had not registered as foreign agents for the Ukrainian government The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was required to register  But it reversed itself the next year after Mr  Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine After the initial determination  Mr  Craig told the Justice Department that he and Skadden Arps did not proactively reach out to news outlets to disseminate and promote the report  Rather  he claimed he distributed the report only  in response to requests from the media   according to a letter he sent to the department at the time In the indictment  prosecutors presented evidence that Mr  Craig did reach out to The Times and was involved in the media rollout strategy for the report A spokeswoman for The Times said   To date  we have not received a subpoena in the investigation and have not provided information to the government  Mr  Craig left Skadden Arps last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr  Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work on the effort Skadden Arps reached a settlement in January with the Justice Department that allowed the firm to avoid prosecution in the matter in exchange for an agreement to pay  4 6 million  to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA  to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on behalf of Ukraine Taken together  the indictment of Mr  Craig and the settlement with Skadden Arps suggest that the Justice Department is trying to  make an example of this prominent lawyer and law firm so that parties receiving D O J  inquiries in the future will take them more seriously   said Matthew Sanderson  who advises clients on compliance with FARA and other lobbying laws for the firm Caplin   Drysdale  In the past  the department would send letters of inquiry to organizations that would receive only a cursory response or be disregarded altogether   he said   That  apparently  will no longer be tolerated

WASHINGTON   The fewest people in nearly 50 years sought unemployment benefits last week  a sign of a strong job market and an unusually low level of layoffs Yet the decline in applications for jobless aid isn t due solely to a tight employment picture  Many states have imposed stricter rules on their unemployment insurance programs   from making it harder to qualify to reducing the duration of benefits to cutting payouts The combined effect has been to reduce the number of unemployed people who apply for and receive aid  economists say  Nationwide  just 30  of people out of work now receive unemployment insurance  down from about 40  before the Great Recession The historically low level of people seeking aid  tells us we have a strong labor market  and that we ve made policy changes that mean fewer people can qualify for benefits   said Martha Gimbel  research director at job listings website Indeed Weekly applications for unemployment benefits dropped 8 000 to a seasonally adjusted 196 000 last week  the Labor Department said Thursday   That is the lowest level since 1969  The four week average  a less volatile measure  fell to 207 000  the also lowest point in 50 years The decline is all the more remarkable once you take into account population growth  The size of America s workforce has doubled since the late 1960s to 162 million Still  dwindling unemployment claims send a signal of strength about the job market and the economy  Applications for jobless aid typically track layoffs  So the continuing decline   applications have tumbled for four straight weeks   shows that most businesses are confident enough about future customer demand to keep their staffs intact That confidence is spurring more hiring  too  Job growth rebounded last month after a sharp slowdown in February  suggesting that the economy remains resilient in its 10th year of expansion Early this year  many analysts were concerned that growth was stalling  with the global economy weakening  the Trump administration and China locked in a trade war  and consumers reining in their spending  as the benefits of the Trump administration s tax cut have faded  Most Americans got a financial boost last year from the tax cut  but it was a one time bump But falling applications for jobless aid indicate that employers foresee an economic slowdown anytime soon Another reason for the decline is that long term unemployment remains much higher than in previous periods when the unemployment rate fell as low as last month s figure of 3 8   People who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more aren t eligible for unemployment insurance In March  21  of the unemployed were out of work for 27 weeks or more  The last time the unemployment rate fell below 4   in 2000  the proportion was about half that  And in 1969  less than 5  of those out of work were long term unemployed Policy changes have also played a role  Nine states   Florida  Michigan  Kansas  Georgia  North Carolina  South Carolina  Idaho  Missouri  and Arkansas   have cut the number of weeks recipients can receive aid  Florida and North Carolina have reduced it to as low as 12 weeks  Before the Great Recession  every state provided at least 26 weeks And some states have taken steps to make it easier for them to cut off people s unemployment benefits  Michele Evermore  a senior researcher at the National Employment Law Project  an advocacy group for low income workers  says nearly a dozen states now require that recipients be cut off if they refuse to take drug tests when they apply for job Four states   South Carolina  Pennsylvania  Maryland and Nebraska   have also increased the amount of income people must have previously earned to be eligible for unemployment insurance when they lose their jobs Other steps make it less likely that people will even apply in the first place  Most states are pushing people to request benefits online and cutting back on staffing at local unemployment benefit offices where someone could get help in person  the employment law project says  That makes it harder for people without internet access to apply Research by Moody s Analytics last year found that reducing the duration of benefit payments discourages people from seeking aid  When North Carolina cut the maximum length of benefits to 12 to 20 weeks  depending on the unemployment rate  from 26 weeks  applications for jobless insurance fell 12 000 a month  Moody s concluded The impact of these steps is evident in the disparity between layoffs and unemployment insurance claims  According to the government s Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey  layoffs have hovered around 1 7 million a month since 2013  Yet the number of people seeking unemployment benefits each week has fallen by roughly half since then  This is more than just a strong labor market story   Dante DeAntonio  an economist at Moody s Analytics  wrote in a report last year   Fewer claims are being initiated for every laid off worker   

WASHINGTON   U S  prosecutors announced charges on Thursday against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  accusing him of conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to a government computer as part of one of the largest compromises of classified information in U S  history Assange  arrested by British police and carried out of Ecaudor s embassy in London  faces up to five years in prison on the American charge  the U S  Justice Department said in a statement  His arrest paved the way for his possible extradition to the United States Assange s indictment arose from a criminal investigation dating back to former President Barack Obama s administration  It was triggered in part by WikiLeaks  2010 publication of hundreds of thousands of U S  military reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and American diplomatic communications  a disclosure that embarrassed Washington and caused strained relations with allies The Justice Department said Assange  47  was arrested under an extradition treaty between the United States and Britain and was charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion The indictment  filed in March 2018 and unsealed on Thursday  said Assange in March 2010 engaged in a conspiracy to help Manning crack a password stored on Defense Department computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network  SIPRNet   a U S  government network used for classified documents and communications Manning had access to the computers as an intelligence analyst and was using them to download classified records to transmit to WikiLeaks  the Justice Department said  Cracking the password would have enabled Manning to log on under a username other than her own  making it harder for investigators to determine the source of the illegal disclosures  it said Manning  formerly named Bradley Manning  was jailed on March 8 after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury in what is widely believed to be related to the Assange investigation Manning was convicted by court martial in 2013 of espionage and other offenses for furnishing more than 700 000 documents  videos  diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to WikiLeaks while she was an intelligence analyst in Iraq  Obama commuted the final 28 years of Manning s 35 year sentence   Journalists around the world should be deeply troubled by these unprecedented criminal charges   Barry Pollack  a lawyer for Assange  said in a statement  saying the allegations  boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source  A law enforcement official close to the case refused to discuss whether additional charges could be filed against Assange  Mark MacDougall  a former federal prosecutor  said on Thursday he believes the government s case against Assange looks like a  placeholder indictment   They had to thoroughly investigate the Manning case   he said   I think what you are seeing in this short indictment is a small sample of the fruit of that investigation   Representatives for Manning had no immediate comment The indictment said Manning downloaded four massive U S  government databases containing some 90 000 Afghanistan war reports  400 000 Iraq war reports  800 Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs and 250 000 State Department cables  U S  officials said the leaks endangered the lives of American troops SPECIAL COUNSEL INQUIRYSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller scrutinized the actions of WikiLeaks in his 22 month investigation into Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election  The website published emails damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that Mueller and U S  intelligence agencies have said were stolen by Russia in a bid to boost Republican Donald Trump s candidacy The Obama administration decided not to prosecute WikiLeaks and Assange on the grounds that the website s work was too similar to journalistic activities protected by the U S  Constitution s guarantee of freedom of the press The indictment quoted from a conversation in which Assange encouraged Manning to provide more information  Manning told Assange that  after this upload  that s all I really have got left   with Assange replying that  curious eyes never run dry in my experience  WikiLeaks has faced criticism from U S  officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  who when he was CIA director in 2017 called Assange a  fraud  and WikiLeaks a  hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia  But Trump praised the website during the presidential campaign  At a rally shortly before the election  Trump said  I love WikiLeaks  after it released the hacked Democratic emails that harmed Clinton s candidacy Assange  who took refuge in Ecuador s embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden in a sexual assault investigation  has said he did not know the source of Democratic Party related emails WikiLeaks published before the election  but said he did not get them from Russia   Reporting by Mark Hosenball and Sarah N  Lynch in Washington  Nathan Layne in New York  writing by

WASHINGTON   The top federal ethics watchdog said on Thursday that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s sale of his stake in a film production business to his wife did not comply with federal ethics rules  and it would not certify his 2018 financial disclosure report as a result Although Mr  Mnuchin will not face penalties for failing to comply  he has been required to rewrite his federal ethics agreement and to promise to recuse himself from government matters that could affect his wife s business Mr  Mnuchin in 2017 sold his stake in StormChaser Partners to his then fiancée  Louise Linton  as part of a series of divestments before becoming Treasury secretary  Since they are now married  government ethics rules consider the asset to be owned by Mr  Mnuchin  potentially creating a conflict of interest for an official who has been negotiating for expanded access for the movie industry as part of trade talks with China The controversy over Mr  Mnuchin s finances has become an unwanted distraction in recent weeks as the Trump administration has been engaged in intense negotiations with China on a wide range of trade matters  While Robert Lighthizer  President Trump s top trade official  has been leading the talks  Mr  Mnuchin has been the point person for promoting the film industry because of his background as a Hollywood producer and investor Mr  Mnuchin said last month at a Senate hearing that he was told by Treasury ethics officials that he was allowed to sell his stake in StormChaser to Ms  Linton  an actress and producer  However  the Office of Government Ethics was not made aware of that guidance and had not approved it In a letter to Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Finance Committee  the ethics office said that it could not certify Mr  Mnuchin s report but that because he had modified his ethics agreement and agreed to recuse himself from matters that might affect StormChaser s film business  he and Ms  Linton could continue to hold the asset Several Trump administration officials have faced red flags and ethical questions over their financial holdings  In February  the ethics office declined to certify the 2018 financial disclosure of Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  because of an inaccuracy in his report The Treasury s assistant general counsel  Brian J  Sonfield  said that the department s former top ethics official had cleared Mr  Mnuchin s arrangement  according to a letter he wrote this week to Emory Rounds  the director of the ethics office  He said that the Treasury believes that Ms  Linton s ownership of the business is  consistent with all applicable ethics laws and regulations  In a separate letter to Mr  Sonfield this week  Mr  Mnuchin wrote that  unless he receives a written waiver  he will recuse himself from any government activity that could benefit StormChaser s movie business  He added that StormChaser did not own or have financial interests in films that are being marketed internationally  He also said he would recuse himself from any tax policy matters that could affect the kinds of independent films that StormChaser holds  If while I am secretary the nature of StormChaser s business practices or the types of films it owns or produces changes  I will seek further guidance from the department s ethics official  who will consult with O G E    Mr  Mnuchin wrote A Treasury spokesman  Tony Sayegh  tweeted a statement saying that the ethics issue was the result of a technical difference between federal ethics officials and Treasury s ethics staff  We are pleased that OGE has approved an updated ethics agreement recognizing that he may hold an interest in that asset   Mr  Sayegh said It is extremely rare for cabinet officials to not have their financial records certified  said Virginia Canter  a former senior ethics counsel at the Treasury Department  In 2001  Paul H  O Neill  President George W  Bush s Treasury secretary  divested his holdings in Alcoa  an aluminum producer  because of conflicts of interest Ms  Canter said she was surprised that Mr  Mnuchin was blaming Treasury s ethics officials for the lapse  arguing that it was ultimately his responsibility to meet the government s requirements  What s he doing being involved in intellectual property matters that could affect the entertainment industry in the negotiations with China   Ms  Canter said   It raises an appearance issue  The explanation from Mr  Mnuchin did not satisfy some Democrats on Thursday Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the top Democrat on the Finance Committee  said that he remained baffled by how the Treasury and the ethics office handled the matter and that he planned to review Mr  Mnuchin s modified ethics agreement  Before being confirmed by the Senate  he signed an ethics agreement that said he would divest from StormChaser Partners L L C    Mr  Wyden said   Rather than divest  he violated the spirit of his ethics agreement by selling his interest to his then fiancée and then he violated the letter of the agreement when he reacquired the assets upon their marriage   

President Trump earlier this year asked Senator Mitch McConnell  the majority leader  to prioritize a confirmation vote for his nominee to be the chief counsel of the Internal Revenue Service  indicating that it was a higher priority than voting on the nomination of William P  Barr as attorney general  a person familiar with the conversation said White House aides insisted for months that the confirmation of the nominee  Michael J  Desmond  a tax lawyer from Santa Barbara  Calif   was a top priority after passage of the tax bill in 2017 But the request by Mr  Trump  made to Mr  McConnell on Feb  5  raised questions about whether the president had other motivations  For months  the president has seethed over vows by congressional Democrats that they would move to obtain his tax returns from the I R S  And this week  the House Ways and Means Committee chairman  Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  formally asked the I R S  for six years of the returns  using an obscure provision in the tax code to do so On Thursday  asked if he would direct the I R S  not to disclose his tax returns  Mr  Trump said Democrats would have to talk to his lawyers  They ll speak to my lawyers   Mr  Trump said during remarks at the Oval Office   They ll speak to the attorney general  In July  when Mr  Desmond was first being considered by the Senate Finance Committee  Bloomberg reported that he had briefly advised the Trump Organization on tax issues before Mr  Trump took office  James Wilkinson  a spokesman for Mr  Desmond  told Bloomberg that Mr  Desmond had helped with  a discrete reporting matter for a subsidiary company that was resolved with no tax impact  In private practice  Mr  Desmond worked for a time alongside William Nelson and Sheri Dillon  who currently serve as tax counsels to the Trump Organization The I R S  chief counsel advises the agency director on  all matters pertaining to the interpretation  administration and enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code  as well as all other legal matters   according to a description on the agency s website  The chief counsel reports jointly to the director of the I R S  and the Treasury Department s general counsel The Senate did not immediately act on Mr  Trump s request  It first moved ahead with Mr  Barr s nomination  Mr  Desmond was confirmed two weeks later  on Feb  27 Mr  Trump and his team have been warily anticipating the probing demands of House investigators since Democrats won control in November  The message to Mr  McConnell came around the time that Mr  Trump  eyeing a torrent of new House investigations led by Democrats  told reporters that he was unfairly under fire He appeared to take particular umbrage at an inquiry by the House Intelligence Committee focused on potential ties to Russia  as well as accusations of potential money laundering by Mr  Trump s businesses and his associates  It s called presidential harassment   he said   And it s unfortunate  And it really does hurt our country  The president directly relayed his concern about the prompt confirmation of Mr  Desmond to Mr  McConnell around the time that Mr  Trump was preparing to deliver his State of the Union address  the person said Hogan Gidley  a White House deputy press secretary  declined to discuss the specifics of the conversation between Mr  Trump and Mr  McConnell  Democrats have obstructed and delayed a record number of President Trump s well qualified nominees  so it shouldn t be surprising to anyone that he regularly communicates with Majority Leader McConnell about how to increase confirmations in the face of Democrats  ridiculous behavior   Mr  Gidley said David Popp  a spokesman for Mr  McConnell  also declined to comment But according to a person familiar with what took place  Mr  Trump told Mr  McConnell that Mr  Desmond was growing frustrated with the holdup and was contemplating withdrawing from the process Democrats in the House are relying on a little known provision of the federal tax code to try to view Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns  The provision  added in the 1920s  gives the chairmen of Congress s tax writing committees   including the Democrat led Ways and Means Committee in the House   authorities to request information on any filer to review privately The text of the law does not give the Trump administration clear grounds to deny a request from Mr  Neal  saying only that when requested  the Treasury secretary  shall  furnish the information  But Treasury Department officials are making preparations to challenge any requests coming from Mr  Neal  They would most likely argue that his action is politically motivated  not related to real matters of policy and therefore illegitimate Mr  Trump  asked on Wednesday about the request by reporters during an Oval Office event  maintained that he was still being audited  a claim he has made for years to defend not releasing his tax returns  as previous presidents have done

RIO DE JANEIRO   The assassination squad created by Argentina s military dictatorship to target dissidents during the 1970s had  like other state programs  its own bureaucratic rules  Employees punched in at 9 30 a m  and were entitled to a two hour lunch  They received a  1 000 clothing allowance during their first overseas mission  And they were required to submit expense reports Representatives of the ultrasecret directorate  which included intelligence officers from Chile and Uruguay  settled on their next victim through a  majority vote  These details of the assassination program  which pursued enemies in the region and in Europe as part of the Cold War intelligence alliance known as Operation Condor  have been found in a 1977 Central Intelligence Agency report  part of a trove of newly declassified United States government documents that shed new light on the repressive tactics of military regimes in South America and on American awareness of their actions The exchange of over 7 500 records   which the United States formally delivered to the Argentine government on Friday as part of a deal struck during the final months of the Obama administration   is one of the largest transfers of declassified documents from one government to another The records contain many new insights  such as confirmation that dozens of people who disappeared at the time were assassinated at the hands of the state  Prosecutors and human rights activists in Argentina are hopeful that the newly available records will aid continuing prosecutions  More than 1 500 former officials in the country have been put on trial for crimes including torture  thousands of forced disappearances and executions and the abduction of hundreds of babies ImageImages of people who disappeared during Argentina s military dictatorship on a window inside a compound used in that era as a secret detention center in Buenos Aires CreditMauricio Lima for The New York TimesThe information will vastly enhance the public record of a grim era  said Carlos Osorio  the director of the Southern Cone Documentation Project at George Washington University s National Security Archive  The amount of information the intelligence agencies had sends shivers through one s spine   he said   Imagine what it meant to know about atrocities in real time  The United States provided varying degrees of support to military juntas that came to power in Latin America during the Cold War  Latin American military officials received training on harsh counterinsurgency techniques at the United States Army School of the Americas as Washington leaned on allied governments to stem the appeal of communism in the region Officials also shared information with military dictatorships that resulted in the detention  torture and in some instances  killing of American citizens  according to these records and separate court findings The newly released documents also suggest that some senior American intelligence officials grew unnerved by the brutality of the regimes the United States backed during that era  particularly when they learned about plans to carry out assassinations in European countries Operation CondorThese details of an assassination program  which pursued enemies as part of the Cold War intelligence alliance of autocratic South American governments known as Operation Condor  were revealed in a 1977 CIA report       target embedded interactive markup that we don t create ourselves     section data id  100000006458487    interactive header    shared ui

warned a supervisor that the assassination task force s plans to  liquidate  suspected leftist militants abroad  poses new problems for the agency  and should prompt a debate about what actions the United States could take to  forestall illegal activity of this sort  Mr  Warren wrote that  every precaution must be taken to ensure that the agency is not wrongfully accused of being a party to this type of activity  The time consuming declassification review process was ordered in March 2016 as part of the Obama administration s quest to set a new tone in Washington s relationship with Latin America  There was a desire to look at past actions on our part in Latin America with openness and a willingness to confront darker chapters of our policy   said Benjamin Gedan  a former Obama White House official who worked on Latin America policy Mr  Gedan said he was surprised the Trump administration did not scrap the process  since it has taken a radically different approach toward Latin America   endorsing the Monroe Doctrine  which takes an interventionist view of the hemisphere ImageFormer Lt  Col  Emilio Guillermo Nani  right  and his lawyer  Guillermo Fanego  at Mr  Nani s apartment in Buenos Aires  where he is serving home confinement with an ankle bracelet CreditMauricio Lima for The New York TimesThe newly released cache includes an F B I  report about the execution of Marcos Osatinsky  a prominent leader of the Montoneros  an armed leftist movement that fought Argentina s dictatorship  American officials learned that Argentine officials brutally tortured and killed Mr  Osatinsky  lied about the circumstances under which he died and disposed of the body before an autopsy could be conducted  The purpose of stealing his body was to prevent the body from being subjected to an autopsy  which would have clearly shown he had been tortured   F B I  agent Robert S  Scherrer wrote   It is doubtful that Osatinsky s body will ever turn up  The documents also disclosed new facts about the abduction and assassination of Jesús Cejas Arias and Crescencio Nicomedes Galañena Hernández  two employees of the Cuban Embassy in Buenos Aires  who vanished on Aug  9  1976  The Associated Press received an envelope that included the credentials of one of the men along with a note saying they had deserted  to enjoy the freedoms of the Western world  However  American officials soon learned that the Cubans were bundled into an ambulance as they were leaving work and sent to a notorious detention center operating out of a car mechanic shop  where they were tortured for 48 hours  Their bodies were later dumped in the Paraná River  according to a C I A  report The agency also learned that the mysterious assassination of Hector Hidalgo Sola  Argentina s ambassador to Venezuela  which occurred in Buenos Aires in July 1977  was a rogue operation by Argentine intelligence agents who were seeking to extort the diplomat s family for money ImageVisitors

about American citizens who were detained and tortured in Argentina  including Gwen Bottoli  who was taken into custody in April 1976 after leaving banned political pamphlets on a bus stop bench in Rosario F B I  records show Ms  Bottoli had been under investigation by American law enforcement officials for her activism in the Socialist Youth Alliance  A United States document about her activities  written in Spanish  suggests American officials may have shared their concerns about the group with the Argentines before her arrest  according to Mr  Osorio In a phone interview from her home in Minnesota  Ms  Bottoli recalled being smacked across the face during her initial interrogation  She was then led to a room where she was blindfolded  undressed and shocked with an electric prod as her captors asked about associates  I was really afraid I would be dismembered and go through further pain   Ms  Bottoli  77  said Ms  Bottoli said she saw the declassification process as a positive step   I appreciate that I may have a chance to tell my story so that we don t allow history to repeat itself   she said Argentina has done more than any of its neighbors to investigate

records declassified by the United States have been valuable in corroborating evidence and identifying new culprits  With about 40 percent of cases still awaiting judgment  she said her team has high hopes the latest batch of records will advance their work  These documents will undoubtedly help answer a lot of questions that are still pending   Ms  Ramos said   This will continue to bring truth to the victims  President Mauricio Macri of Argentina  who is regarded with disdain by many human rights activists focusing on the dictatorship era  expressed hope recently that the new documents will bring more victims a measure of justice  They will be essential for there to be justice in past cases  still pending  from one of the darkest periods of Argentina s history   he said last month  The release comes amid a raging debate in neighboring Brazil about its own period of military rule  President Jair Bolsonaro  a far right politician who served in the Army early in his life  last month called on the armed forces to commemorate the 1964 coup that installed a repressive military dictatorship for 21 years Peter Kornbluh  a senior analyst at the National Security Archive  argued that declassifying documents earlier than the government ordinarily would makes a meaningful contribution  These documents remind us of the ugly reality of the military coups and the regimes that followed   he said  Access to them is  the strongest bulwark against the reactionary revisionism that is attempting to paint a pretty picture of the military regimes in the southern cone

meant being detained while waiting for asylum  I prefer 1 000 times being jailed   he said last week at a shelter south of the United States border   than being dead  Instead  as part of a newly

The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a delicate diplomatic issue About 633 Central American asylum seekers have been turned away since January  unable to prove sufficient fear

into Tapachula  Mexico   I ll have to give up everything  For the most part  the policy has been rolled out slowly and quietly When it began at the San Ysidro port of entry in California in late January  only men traveling by themselves from Central America were told to wait in Mexico as their asylum cases wound through the American legal system  The policy has since expanded to stop entire families from waiting in the United States  although unaccompanied children and Mexican citizens will be allowed to enter It is now being enforced at border ports at Calexico  Calif   where President

crossings are nowhere as high as in the early 2000s  when as many as 220 000 migrants crossed the border in a month  Ms  Nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100 000 migrants in March  up from 76 000 in February A State Department report released last month acknowledged the possibility that the migrants were no safer in Mexico from the same gangs that threatened them in Central America than they had been at home That is constantly on the mind of Daniel Nuñez  who was working as a security guard in Honduras when gang members opened fire in October

judges who insist they find legal counsel before their cases can move forward Denis Rostran  of Honduras  said he called 10 lawyers who were listed on a document that Department of Homeland Security officials gave to him when he was sent back to Tijuana  None answered  Mr  Rostran said he has slept some nights on the street and has been robbed twice A Department of Homeland Security official said it was committed to ensuring migrants have legal assistance at no cost to the government  The agency also is not forcing migrants to return to Mexico who would  more likely than not  be persecuted or tortured there  the official said Twenty shelters and churches in Tijuana are housing around 3 000 migrants   and have almost reached their limit  said Esmeralda Siu  the executive coordinator of the Migrant Defense Coalition  in the Mexican state of Baja California  Many of the migrants are awaiting their court dates  she said  and do not expect to leave soon That means that newly arrived and future migrants will have few  if any  options for shelter  There s no city  no state  that has sufficient resources to prepare for this   said Gustavo Magallanes Cortés  the director of migration affairs for Baja California   They ve allowed these people to return  but cut the resources for migrants  which has led to chaos  Every day a shelter calls me and says   I ve run out of food   But many of the waiting migrants are determined to keep hope  Many people say they re doing this just so we get tired and give up on our cases   said Daniela Diaz  19  who said she left El Salvador after a member of the MS 13 gang threatened to rape and kill her  She has been living in a shelter in Tijuana since late January She is frustrated that following the rules and asking for asylum at a legal port of entry   instead of sneaking into the United States   have resulted in a system of immigration purgatory  There s a lot of people throwing themselves over the wall   Ms  Diaz said   and we re doing this the fair way   

BEIJING   Whatever deal Washington and Beijing reach over the trade war  President Trump has already scored a big victory  Companies are rethinking their reliance on China  The two sides are nearing an agreement  with Mr  Trump saying on Thursday that an  epic  trade pact could be weeks away and that he may soon meet with President Xi Jinping  China s top leader  But already  spurred by tariffs and trade tensions  global companies are beginning to shift their supply chains away from China  just as some Trump administration officials had wanted  The move  known as decoupling  is a major goal of those who believe the world has grown far too dependent on China as a manufacturing giant  As Beijing builds up its military and extends its geopolitical influence  some officials fear that America s dependence on Chinese factories makes it strategically vulnerable  Now companies in a number of industries are reducing their exposure to China  GoPro  the mobile camera maker  and Universal Electronics  which makes sensors and remote controls  are shifting some work to Mexico  Hasbro is moving its toy making to the United States  Mexico  Vietnam and India  Aten International  a Taiwanese computer equipment company  brought work back to Taiwan  Danfoss  a Danish conglomerate  is changing the production of heating and hydraulic equipment to the United States Mr  Trump s victory in this department is not unalloyed  Despite his promises to bring jobs back to the United States  most of the work is shifting to other countries with lower costs  Reshaping global supply chains also takes time  and China will remain a vital manufacturing hub for decades to come Still  chief executives say the trade war has prompted a fundamental reassessment of China as the dominant place to make things  Even Chinese companies are expanding overseas  although they still have most of their production in China   China was the factory of the world   said Song Zhiping  the Communist Party chief at the China National Building Materials Group  a state owned giant   Things are changing  That s why Chinese companies are going out of China  A spokeswoman for the United States trade representative s office declined to comment While Mr  Trump portrays his trade fight as a clash over jobs  proponents of decoupling within the administration see the effort as a way of contending with a stronger  more aggressive China   Epic  China Trade Deal Near Completion  Trump Says  but Haggling ContinuesApril 4  2019Already  China dominates the market for items like solar panels  and has emerged as the world s largest producer of cars  car parts and many other sophisticated products  It plans to build jetliners  advanced computer chips  electric cars and other goods of the future Any deal is likely to leave in place new American tariffs on cars  aircraft parts  equipment for nuclear power plants and other items that administration officials see as essential for economic and security reasons  But more broadly  the trade hawks hope companies in other industries will also find friendlier countries in which to do business China emerged as a manufacturing powerhouse over the past two decades  The work force was low cost and relatively skilled  The Communist Party prevented the emergence of independent labor unions  Subcontractors abounded  meaning companies could strongly negotiate for lower supply costs  China built an extensive network of highways and rail lines  It has a vast and growing local customer base  meaning companies don t have to go far to sell their products  Businesses flocked there  China accounted for one quarter of the world s manufacturing by value last year  up from 8 percent in 2000  according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization The value created in China by manufacturing last year was bigger than in the United States  Germany and South Korea combined  But wages and other costs in China have been rising for years  A growing number of businesses complain that Chinese officials too often favor local competitors or don t do enough to stop intellectual property theft The prospect of more trade fights only adds to the reasons to diversify  which also include threats elsewhere like Mr  Trump s threat to close the border with Mexico and Britain s troubled exit from the European Union  Localization will matter more   Joe Kaeser  the chief executive of Siemens  one of Germany s largest conglomerates  said in an interview late last month on the sidelines of the China Development Forum in Beijing   You re more resilient to political discussions  China may not necessarily oppose some of the efforts to decouple  Beijing has long hoped to shed low skilled  polluting manufacturing jobs and move higher up the value chain   The total size of the work force is falling  the labor cost is rising and we are losing our competitive advantage in low cost industries   Miao Wei  China s minister of industry and information technology  said at the China Development Forum  He added that the country would focus instead on high tech  innovative industries  Still  Chinese officials must walk a fine line  As the country s economy slows  an abrupt shift of work out of China could lead to job losses and instability ImageCompanies around the world are trying to diversify their supply chains  which means relying less on Chinese exports CreditChinatopix  via Associated PressDecoupling efforts appear to be in their early stages  A broad survey by UBS of chief financial officers at export oriented manufacturers in China late last year found that a third had moved at least some production out of China in 2018  Another third intended to do so this year  The typical company was moving the production for about 30 percent of its exports  UBS found Companies now want to depend less on one place  which means looking for an alternative to China  Bill Winters  the chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank  said at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  this year   People who are concerned at the prospect of greater tariffs on Chinese exports  for example  are looking to move export facilities from China to other countries  including Chinese companies   Mr  Winters said  Countries seeking to displace China have begun pointing out that exports from their countries are less likely to face tariffs  For companies with operations in China   the trade war between the United States and China creates a new uncertainty   Airlangga Hartarto  Indonesia s minister of industry  said in an interview in Davos The ability to diversify depends on the industry  Some auto parts companies have run their American factories more hours each day to avoid tariffs on Chinese made goods  said Razat Gaurav  the chief executive of LLamasoft  a supply chain management company in Ann Arbor  Mich  By contrast  he said  manufacturers of smartphones and smartphone components   which have generally not been hit by Mr  Trump s tariffs   have found few places to move work because China dominates that supply chain  Still  some in that industry are shifting too  such as Sony s closure of a Beijing smartphone factory last month after expanding production in Thailand ImageChinese companies play a key role in the solar panel industry CreditGilles Sabrie for The New York TimesFor now  companies are looking for alternatives  Steve Madden  the shoe company  is moving production to Cambodia  Hasbro  the world s leading toymaker  has a goal for the end of next year  to be 60 percent out of China   by shifting production to the United States and elsewhere  Brian Goldner  the company s chairman and chief executive  said in a recent conference call  Though much of the work leaving China is going to other low cost countries  some companies are following Mr  Trump s suggestion that they move production to the United States Danfoss  a Danish maker of heating and cooling systems as well as sensors and transmitters  has seen rising costs in China  especially for skilled labor  said Kim Fausing  the company s chief executive and president  It is also looking for ways to reduce transportation related emissions of global warming gases When Danfoss bought an American heating systems company a year ago and found that the company had recently shifted some work to China  it acted quickly   The first thing we did after we acquired it was we moved everything back  to the United States  where Danfoss already had a dozen factories  Mr  Fausing said The first round of 25 percent tariffs that Mr  Trump put in place last July included hydraulic parts long manufactured by Danfoss in northeastern China  The company transferred production of these parts to the United States as well  There is not much of a difference between the costs in China and the United States   Mr  Fausing said   You have to have a very good case today to justify producing something in China and shipping it to the U S  Ana

WASHINGTON   Newly elected Rep  Sharice Davids is most proud of setting up a congressional office in part of her Kansas district she said hadn t seen one for years  For Georgia Rep  Lucy McBath  her biggest victory was passing the gun background checks legislation she advocated for after her son s shooting death  And for New York Rep  Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  her top achievement was the introduction of the landmark Green New Deal  As the Democratic freshmen lawmakers round the first 100 days of their new majority in the House  they re taking stock of their accomplishments  noting the stumbles and marking their place as a front line of resistance to President Donald Trump  When I came here  I said the days of business as usual in the Congress are done  and I think that s what we ve seen   said Rep  Lauren Underwood  D Ill   a nurse and former Obama administration official  who took over a GOP held seat in the Chicago suburbs The first 100 days is often a milestone for a new Congress   an automatic  if arbitrary  moment to assess the workings of the legislative branch  This year  it s even more noteworthy because of the historic nature of the freshmen class  It is two thirds Democrat  with more women than men on that side of the aisle  It s also the most diverse ever   with many newbies swept into office in a blue wave that followed two years of Trump House Democrats set out an ambitious agenda with legislation on the kitchen table priorities that helped them win the majority   protecting the Affordable Care Act  imposing new ethics rules   while engaging in aggressive oversight of the Trump administration  Their investigations extend well beyond special counsel Robert Mueller s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election as they dig into the president s business dealings and push for Trump s tax returns  But with the spotlight comes high profile setbacks  Democrats splintered over Ocasio Cortez s climate change proposal and exposed party divisions over Israel s treatment of Palestinians  One new lawmaker  Rashida Tlaib of Michigan  stunned some when  on Day One  she told supporters   using an expletive   that the new majority would impeach Trump Moreover  few of their bills will ever be signed into law  In fact  most are simply resolutions that are being panned by the Senate  where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is providing backstop with his Republican majority to keep the measures from ever making it to Trump s desk McConnell said Pelosi s challenges resemble those Republicans have keeping their right flank in line   I was almost tempted to call up my friend the speaker and say   Congratulations  you ve got a Freedom Caucus on your hands    he told reporters Thursday  referring to the House s conservative group House Republicans gathered on the Capitol steps for their own 100 day event  ridiculing the new majority for catering to the liberal left and failing to keep their campaign promises  I have one question for the Democrats after their first 100 days  What have you accomplished   Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  R Calif   said on Wednesday   Name me one problem you have solved  Another Republican  Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana  warned that Democrats are veering toward socialism  As he did  a passer by among the crowds of tourists outside the Capitol shouted   I stand with Ilhan     a reference to outspoken freshman Rep  Ilhan Omar of Minnesota Democrats know they face challenges ahead  not only in avoiding the internal divisions that stymied House Republicans when they were in power but also in delivering on their campaign promises  For me personally  the biggest frustration has been that we re working on a lot of different things  But if you re just looking at the media  the narrative is not showing that   said freshman Democratic Rep  Katie Hill of California   It makes it seem like all we re focusing on is the president and responding to whatever tweet of the day or the investigation and so on  but we re actually working on the issues that we were elected to do  Tlaib said the most surprising thing to her so far has been the  lack of urgency  among some in Congress  As few joined her push to impeach  she said she thinks  we re going to look back and say we wish we did more  Freshman Rep  Tom Malinowski  a Democrat who will face a potentially tough re election in New Jersey  says part of the majority s job is to at least show voters what s possible  There will be some things that stand no chance of enactment  and we knew that  but that s OK   Malinowski said   Because one of our jobs is to give people hope that something better is possible if we do in 2020 what we did in 2018  At House Democrats  retreat this week in Virginia  Ocasio Cortez said their power lies in being able  to come in as a class  Many of them say they know theirs is a historic moment  even amid the everyday challenges of being new on the job Underwood  who gathered the freshmen to make a video showcasing what they were most proud of  acknowledged the hurdles ahead  Moving forward  we will need to continue to work not just to pass bills in the House but do things that can gain broad support so that they can get enacted into law   she said  People in my community are looking for impactful change   they can feel a difference

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s announced plan to name economic commentator Stephen Moore and businessman Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve board has come with assertions by the president the central bank is undermining economic growth and with demands from him for lower interest rates Both Moore and Cain are more overtly partisan than most previous nominees to the Fed  and Trump has been unusually critical of recent Fed decisions  Here are the top issues at the heart of Trump s beef with the Fed and his own hand picked chairman  Jerome Powell Q  Is the Fed trying to slow the economy  A  No  Policymakers say the U S  economy is healthy enough to stand on its own  without the explicit central bank help reserved for more fragile economic conditions  Trump has been frustrated that the Fed raised rates four times in 2018 as his signature tax policy went into effect  In all  seven of the Fed s nine rate hikes since 2015 occurred after Trump took office in January 2017 If not for that  he says  the economy would be performing like a  rocket ship  today instead of likely ebbing from last year s 3 percent growth rate  Still  the current level of interest rates in a range of 2 25 and 2 5 percent remains low relative to historical norms  Fed officials regard that level as near  neutral   meaning it isn t explicitly discouraging spending and investment  and from their perspective the rate hikes are not meant to impede the economy  Q  Inflation is weak  so why did the Fed raise rates at all A  While inflation control is at the center of the Fed s mission  Fed officials also set monetary policy in anticipation of other factors that can affect the outlook for the economy  In the middle of last year it seemed the economy was poised to grow faster than expected for a while  A majority of Fed policymakers reasoned that keeping rates too low in that environment could pose other risks even if inflation remained tame  A chief concern was that low borrowing costs could create financial bubbles  which remains a core concern for policymakers after the financial crisis a decade ago To Powell and other officials  the issue is not just hitting the highest level of growth possible in any given year or quarter  it is hitting the highest level of growth that seems sustainable over time Q  Is the Fed overlooking different risks  like weaker overseas growth or financial market volatility  that would argue for lower interest rates  A  Administration officials  and most recently White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow  said the administration is worried the Fed was ignoring other issues  such as slowing growth in China or the state of financial markets But throughout last year there was a growing group of officials inside the Fed concerned about just those problems That group reached critical mass in December as falling stock prices and widening credit market spreads fueled a rapid tightening of financial conditions  Even as the Fed raised rates that month  the central bank also began to shift gears and put further interest rates on hold Q  Is the Fed wedded to an outmoded economic view in which growth and low unemployment cause inflation A  Moore has said the Fed is stocked with  growth phobiacs   while Kudlow has argued the Fed holds a mistaken allegiance to the  Phillips curve    an economic model measuring the relationship between employment levels and inflation  In their view  the Fed is overly concerned that if U S  unemployment   currently near its lowest in five decades   falls too far that inflation will spike  The tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is the subject of a longstanding debate at the Fed  Current officials now appear more open to seeing just how low the jobless rate can go without wages and eventually prices rising too fast  Such a less rigid approach comes with risks  however  and today s Fed leaders remain mindful of past episodes when the Fed allowed unemployment to get too low for too long  as it did under political pressure in the 1960s That choice  when jobless rates were far below what was considered  full employment   helped spark the runaway inflation of the 1970s  and forced subsequent Fed officials to impose some of the most punishing  and recessionary  interest rates ever  Q  The president has been critical about more than just interest rates  What does that mean for things like  quantitative easing  and  quantitative tightening  A  Trump recently urged the Fed to return to the  quantitative easing  policies used during the crisis years  Under QE  the central bank gobbled up trillions of dollars in government securities to flood the financial system with cash and hold down long term interest rates  The policy was controversial at the time  and the Fed has since winnowed its holdings down  While that process   nicknamed  quantitative tightening    will soon end along with the rate hikes  no one at the central bank thinks they should fire QE up again  Indeed  with unemployment below 4 percent and the economy still growing  Trump s call for additional QE has more in common with policies championed by some of the further left Democrats   those he brands socialists   than with the typical views of the Republican party   Reporting by Howard Schneider  Editing by Dan Burns and Chizu Nomiyama  

  Attorney General William P  Barr said he will deliver the Mueller report to Congress and the public within a week  reiterating his earlier promise to release it by mid April   Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday  Mr  Barr said he would be transparent about redactions in the report  But he demurred when asked whether he has briefed the White House on it   The Justice Department inspector general expects to finish an examination of aspects of the Russia investigation by May or June  Mr  Barr revealed   Mr  Barr has tried to keep the appropriations hearing focused on the department s proposed  29 2 billion budget  which includes money for 100 new immigration judges as President Trump hardens his stance on immigration along the southwestern border Barr says Mueller report is coming  within a week  Mr  Barr  hit immediately with questions about his handling of the Mueller report by Democrats  reiterated his vow to be as transparent as possible and said that he will turn over a redacted version of the report to Congress and the public within a week Mr  Barr went over the categories of information he says he must black out   like information that is subject to grand jury secrecy rules   and said that whatever he censors in the report  he will identify the reason  This process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid April stands   he said   And so I think that from my standpoint  within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public  Representative José E  Serrano  Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department  pressed Mr  Barr to say whether the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  or his staff had played any role in drafting or reviewing two letters that Mr  Barr sent to Congress late last month about the report  Mr  Barr said that the special counsel had not participated in writing those letters  nor seen them in advance  though he gave Mr  Mueller the chance to see his letter summarizing the investigation s main findings  The letter of the 24th  Mr  Mueller s team did not play a role in drafting that document  although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that   Mr  Barr said   The letter on the 29th  I don t believe that that was reviewed by Mr  Mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter  Barr won t say whether the White House was briefed on the report Representative Nita M  Lowey  Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee  pressed Mr  Barr to say whether the White House has seen or been briefed on the contents of the Mueller report beyond what was in his letters about it to Congress  But Mr  Barr refused to answer  I ve said what I m going to say about the report today   he said   I ve issued three letters about it  I was willing to discuss the historic information of how the report came to me and my decision on Sunday   March 24  when he wrote a four page letter to Congress laying out the special counsel s top line findings  But I ve already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week   he added   I m not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it  In the past  Justice Department officials have said that Mr  Barr had not shown the White House any part of the Mueller report or briefed Mr  Trump s team about its contents  His demurral on Tuesday raised the possibility that the situation has shifted and the White House knows more than the public or Congress about what Mr  Mueller said Democrats press Barr on Mueller Democrats who lead the House Appropriations Committee were eager to press Mr  Barr on what one called  the elephant in the room   his handling of the highly anticipated special counsel s report  The American people have been left with many unanswered questions  serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter  and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report   Mr  Serrano said in his opening remarks  I think it would strike a serious blow to our system and yes to our democracy if that report is not fully seen   he added Democrats have criticized Mr  Barr s decision to share Mr  Mueller s top line findings in a four page letter that quoted sparingly from the report itself and his declaration that Mr  Trump had not committed an obstruction of justice offense after Mr  Mueller declined to make a prosecutorial judgment  They renewed their complaints after The New York Times revealed last week that some of Mr  Mueller s investigators have complained that Mr  Barr failed to fully represent their findings and that they were more damaging for the president than the attorney general indicated On Tuesday  they had their first chance to level criticism in person  Ms  Lowey called Mr  Barr s handling of the Mueller report  unacceptable  and questioned how quickly he summarized the findings in his March 24 letter  Even for someone who has done this job before   she said  referring to Mr  Barr s first stint as attorney general in the 1990s   I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive  Barr renews his own public defense Batting back Democrats  criticism  Mr  Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the  bottom line  conclusions of the special counsel s investigation in his letter to Congress and warned that attempting to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism Asked about The Times s reporting on frustrations among some of Mr  Mueller s investigators about the narrow scope of his letter laying out their findings  Mr  Barr appeared unswayed  I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize   Mr  Barr said   because I think any summary  regardless of who prepares it  not only runs the risk of being under inclusive or over inclusive  but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once  Each page of the report was marked that it might contain secret grand jury material and could not be readily released anyway  he said  He also said he had asked the intelligence community to review the report for any information that might compromise their sources and methods of intelligence gathering and would thus need to be redacted But he did not address his decision to step in and make a judgment on whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed justice after Mr  Mueller s team conspicuously did not Republicans tried to help Mr  Barr hammer home the report s top line findings  The conclusions were simple  no collusion  no obstruction   said Representative Tom Graves  Republican of Georgia  ignoring Mr  Mueller s statement that the investigation did not  exonerate  Mr  Trump of obstruction and that it found no criminal conspiracy between any Trump associates and Russia s election interference Mr  Graves added   Is there anything new you have seen that would change your conclusions  Mr  Barr responded   There is nothing to suggest to me  that the conclusions have changed   The letter speaks for itself   Congress waits as Barr blacks out parts of the Mueller report  Barr won t ask a judge to let him reveal secret grand jury details One of the key reasons Mr  Barr has said he must black out portions of the Mueller report before showing it to Congress is a federal rule of criminal procedure that forbids Justice Department officials from disclosing grand jury information to outsiders On its face  that rule   known as 6 e    makes no exception for Congress  There are exceptions to the rule  however  particularly if a judge issues an order permitting the material to be disclosed  That happened in 1974  when a judge overseeing the Watergate grand jury permitted the evidence it gathered to be sent to the House Judiciary Committee  which had opened an impeachment inquiry into President Nixon But the executive branch in 1974 supported sending the evidence to Congress  Mr  Barr was asked whether his Justice Department would be willing to join a similar motion to allow Congress to see the grand jury material that Mr  Mueller gathered But Mr  Barr said he has no such intention  He said if House Judiciary Committee members want to see that material  they can ask the judge  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is free to go to court if he feels one of those exceptions is applicable   Mr  Barr said  adding   My intention is not to ask for it at this stage  I mean  if the chairman has a good explanation of why 6 e  does not apply and his need for the information  I m willing to listen  Barr recalls Democrats  anger over the publication of the Starr report Under pressure to give Congress the entire text of the Mueller report  Mr  Barr repeatedly reminded his critics that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Whitewater Monica Lewinsky scandal  where Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence  including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president Mr  Barr s point seemed to be  If you have a problem with this process  blame the Clinton Democrats  This whole mechanism for the special counsel  as I said  was established during the Clinton administration in the wake of Ken Starr s report   Mr  Barr said   That s why the current rule says the report should be kept confidential  because there was a lot of reaction against the publication of Ken Starr s report and many of the people who are right now calling for release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report  Mr  Starr  the independent counsel leading the Clinton investigation  was operating under a now defunct law that gave him the authority to send a report directly to Congress  The Republican controlled Congress promptly made the whole thing public That experience helped persuade members of Congress of both parties that the independent counsel law should be permitted to lapse in 1999  But there was still a need for some kind of mechanism for prosecutors with a degree of independence to investigate potential high level executive branch wrongdoing Under then Attorney General Janet Reno  the Clinton administration issued the special counsel regulation that governed Mr  Mueller s investigation  Among other things  it called for the special counsel to write a  confidential  report for the attorney general  who would then relay his own report to Congress saying the investigation was over  In short  those rules did not envision a lengthy report from Mr  Mueller going to Congress and being published for the public to read   in any form  You will recognize that I m operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report   Mr  Barr said   But I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can  Barr  Don t worry about defense of health care law  The government will likely lose in court Representative Matt Cartwright  Democrat of Pennsylvania  assailed Mr  Barr and the Justice Department for declining to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal court in Texas  where a judge recently struck down the sweeping health care law as unconstitutional Mr  Cartwright accused Mr  Barr of putting the weight of the Justice Department behind a political effort to invalidate the law and warned that it could result in millions of people losing their health care coverage Mr  Barr did not dispute that he had decided to no longer defend the law but told Mr  Cartwright that he had  nothing to worry about  if he thought that the department had taken  such an outrageous position  because the government was likely to lose the case in question   Let the courts do their job   Mr  Barr said Republicans have challenged the law in various court cases since it was passed nine years ago  Late last year  a federal judge in Texas struck down the law on the grounds that its requirement that Americans buy health insurance was unconstitutional  The Justice Department had said last summer that it would no longer defend that mandate  and broadened its attack on the law last month  telling a federal appeals court that it believed the entire law should be invalidated If the court accepts that argument  millions of people could lose health insurance  Mr  Barr declined to speculate about the impact of the Justice Department s decision not to defend the law  though he acknowledged that it could end with no plan in place for those who depend on the law to maintain coverage The exchange underscored Mr  Barr s sweeping view of executive power and that the attorney general ultimately answers to the president  Though the Justice Department generally defends the law in any challenges to it  Mr  Barr indicated he was willing to make an exception in a case where the president asked for something different so long as it was legally defensible Barr seeks immigration spending for Trump s priorities Mr  Barr is requesting an additional  72 1 million for immigration enforcement   an amount that would fund 100 new immigration judges   at a time when Mr  Trump has hardened his stance against illegal immigration and asylum seekers  Over the past two days  he has purged top immigration and security leaders to accelerate that goal While the additional judges will  provide some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts   Mr  Barr said  he also said that an influx of cases  constrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases  and other reforms are necessary  The Justice Department oversees the nation s immigration judges  who are separate from the judicial branch Mr  Barr also said that  attacking those transnational criminal organizations is a high priority  for the department and noted that the Justice Department is asking for more than  140 million in budget increases at the F B I   the Drug Enforcement Administration and elsewhere to address drug crimes A review of the Russia investigation will be done in the coming months The Justice Department inspector general intends to complete by May or June his investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry  including whether law enforcement officials abused their surveillance powers to spy on a Trump campaign aide  Mr  Barr said The inspector general  Michael E  Horowitz  has been examining how the F B I  and Justice Department obtained a secret warrant in October 2016 to wiretap Carter Page  a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser  Republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the warrant because they relied in part on Democratic

MADRID   The administration of President Jair Bolsonaro is considering a dramatic change in the council that oversees Brazil s environmental policy  replacing a broad based panel of independent voices with a small group of political appointees  according to documents obtained by The Associated Press Activists say they fear the move  which reflects Bolsonaro s oft stated skepticism about environmental organizations  could lead to more deforestation and less oversight in the nation that holds about 60  of the vast Amazon rainforest  which scientists see as crucial for efforts to slow global warming and for the world climate systems A policy roadmap drafted by Bolsonaro s transition team before he took office Jan  1 proposes a decree creating a  government council  to replace Brazil s National Council of the Environment  which has almost 100 members  including representatives of independent environmental and business groups  The new body would consist of five presidential appointees plus Environment Minister Ricardo Salles  who is one of the authors of the plan The documents  first published by the Brazilian Climate Observatory environmental group  were obtained and verified by the AP Brazil s Environment Ministry did not reply to a request for comment Part of the transition plan has already come into force  The country s forestry service  aimed at promoting  knowledge  sustainable use and widening of forestry coverage   was transferred to the Agriculture Ministry on Bolsonaro s second day in office  On the same day  the Agriculture Ministry was given the power to determine the limits of indigenous lands  rather than Brazil s official indigenous rights agency As a congressman and candidate  Bolsonaro often questioned the reality of climate change and cast environmental groups as foreign influenced meddlers restraining Brazil s economic growth by holding back mining and agriculture   stances that resemble those of U S  President Donald Trump  who before taking office described the U S  Environmental Protection Agency as a  disgrace  that largely should be dismantled The authors of Bolsonaro s transition plan say the current Environment Council  known as CONAMA  is a  confusing  body that  acts emotionally  without due technique  being subjected to ideological interference  In another transition team document  lawyer Antonio Fernando Pinheiro Pedro argues that CONAMA s decisions have led to  the emission of norms and standards that are far from reality  In an interview shortly after his election  Bolsonaro complained that it could sometimes take a decade to get an environmental license   That will not continue   he said While officials haven t yet formally proposed the smaller council  there has already been increased friction over CONAMA  Security guards blocked alternate members of the council from joining the main meeting at a March 20 session in the capital of Brasilia  breaking a long tradition of wide open debate in Brazil s top environmental council Carlos Rittl  executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory  which includes several nonprofit groups  said he believes that chaotic meeting was  more evidence that the plan  for a smaller council  is indeed being implemented   Deforestation ended 2018 on the rise  It is on the rise in 2019  but we haven t heard a word from the minister about that  We have heard about limiting the access to civil society so we can t have a fair discussion   Rittl said Former Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero speculated the new administration may have delayed creating the new council due to public anger over the collapse of a mine dam near the city of Brumadinho in January that killed at least 223 people  with 70 still missing Ricupero noted that Bolsonaro s chief of staff suggested closing the environmental ministry during the campaign  but said that the powerful agribusiness lobby is afraid such a move would damage trade and has prevented any such move  Then Brumadinho showed that our problem is not excessive care in environmental licensing   it is the lack of it   Ricupero said He added that hopes Bolsonaro would engage with environmentalists have not come to pass Bolsonaro recently defended his environmental ideas at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  saying that Brazil  is the country that most preserves the environment  and that  those that criticize us actually have a lot to learn from us  The Bolsonaro transition plan also suggested closing the federal agency that oversees conservation zones such as national parks and biological reserves and issues fines for violation of environmental laws there  Many of those penalties are never paid  but several Brazilian agribusiness leaders have complained about them over the years Pinheiro Pedro  the transition team lawyer  wrote that the agency should be folded into the Environment Institute  which enforces other environmental legislation and aims to promote the sustainable the use of natural resources  He said the two have  the same objective  and streamlining environmental governance is key to  avoid international interference  Rittl  of the Brazilian Climate Observatory  said he believes that change would reduce oversight in key areas by diluting the focus of regulators Environmentalists also took umbrage at the language used in the transition documents  though the tone echoes Bolsonaro s own pronouncements The plan says NGOs involved in climate change discussions are  uncontrollable organisms  that need to be stopped so the system is  closer to ministerial control   It also contends Brazil s environmental governance is crafted to give jobs to political appointees  describing that as  a risk to national sovereignty  Emilio Bruna  a tropical ecologist focused on the Amazon who is based at the University of Florida  said the transition plan shows the  worst fears  about Bolsonaro s presidency  are starting to come true   Scientists are not only concerned about the government not creating new protected areas  but also the downgrading of existing protections in the rainforest   he said   There was already a culture of impunity  but now it s being reinforced     Associated Press science writer Christina Larson and EPA reporter Ellen Knickmayer in Washington contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   The Treasury Department allowed the influential Russian oligarch Oleg V  Deripaska to satisfy the terms of his divorce by transferring tens of millions of dollars in stock to benefit his children as part of a deal to lift United States sanctions on his corporate empire  according to the Trump administration and an interview with Mr  Deripaska The deal  announced by the Trump administration in December without publicly disclosing its details  included a clause providing for the completion of a transfer of 10 5 million shares of Mr  Deripaska s main holding company  EN   to a trust fund for the two teenage children he had with his former wife  Polina Yumasheva The couple divorced last year  and their settlement  which called for him to provide funds for their children  was finalized before Mr  Deripaska and his companies were sanctioned in April 2018  according to representatives of the Treasury Department  Mr  Deripaska and EN  The transfer has drawn the ire of Senator Ron Wyden  Democrat of Oregon  who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee  which has jurisdiction over the Treasury Department  He said in a letter sent late last month to Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  that the transfer of the EN  shares   which had a value of more than  78 million at the close of business on Monday    constitutes a clear benefit to Deripaska and his children   and conflicts with Treasury Department claims that neither would benefit from the sanctions relief deal The sanctions were intended to punish seven oligarchs and their companies   including Mr  Deripaska  EN  and the giant aluminum company it controls  Rusal   for their affiliations with a Russian government that  engages in a range of malign activity around the globe   including election interference  Mr  Mnuchin said at the time When the Treasury Department announced the deal with Mr  Deripaska s companies to lift the sanctions  it cast the move as an effort to stabilize global aluminum markets roiled by the sanctions  and said that Mr  Deripaska would not personally benefit  As part of the deal  he agreed to relinquish control of the companies and sell off a significant portion of his ownership  with proceeds going into blocked accounts that he would not be able to access But members of Congress on both sides of the aisle blasted the deal as soft on Russia  and unsuccessfully tried to block it from going into effect  Those concerns were inflamed further when it was revealed that the confidential  legally binding document detailing the agreement showed that Mr  Deripaska and his allies would retain majority ownership of EN  The agreement specified that 1 64 percent of the shares of EN  would be transferred to an entity called the Liberi Foundation  for which there was no easily traceable public record  After receiving inquiries from journalists  EN  officials said Liberi was a trust fund for Mr  Deripaska s children But when asked by Mr  Wyden at a Senate Finance Committee hearing late last month about the arrangement  Mr  Mnuchin said of Mr  Deripaska that  his children did in no way benefit from sanctions relief  A Treasury Department spokeswoman sought to clarify Mr  Mnuchin s statement last week  saying that  Deripaska s children were legally entitled to shares stemming from a divorce settlement that predated the sanctions  Larissa Belyaeva  a spokeswoman for Mr  Deripaska  said in a statement that he  disclaimed all rights to claw back those shares  She added   Nor did his children benefit as all that was honored was a pre existing legal entitlement to settle shares as part of a divorce settlement  She said the votes from the shares would be cast by independent trustees appointed by the Treasury Department Independent trustees also will control the votes associated with shares owned by other people or entities with connections to Mr  Deripaska  They include his charitable foundation  his former wife  her father and a family linked firm called Orandy Capital Limited  as well as shares being transferred to VTB  a Russian government owned bank under limited United States sanctions that had lent Mr  Deripaska large sums of money And in a rare interview late last month  Mr  Deripaska said of the transfer to Liberi   It s a small portion of the shares  And it was part of my settlement with my wife  which was set long before  Last month  Mr  Deripaska sued the Treasury Department and its officials  including Mr  Mnuchin  to reverse the sanctions that remain in place on him personally  claiming that he was deprived due process and that the sanctions cost him billions of dollars and made him  radioactive  in international business circles In the interview with The New York Times  he blasted the sanctions as targeting him solely because he was a prominent Russian who has  a popular brand in the U S  He accused the Treasury Department of misrepresenting him in its justification for the sanctions  In announcing the sanctions  the department had noted that  Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state  Mr  Deripaska explained the statement to mean that  it was just who I am   I am Russian   he said   And unfortunately  I was sanctioned because I am Russian  He added   I m not planning to leave Russia to buy a hockey club  a football club  to spend crazy money on luxury things outside my country  I spend most of my time here  My kids are here  And my future also will be in Russia   

WASHINGTON   FBI Director Chris Wray on Thursday defended the Trump administration s decision to abandon plans to relocate the bureau s crumbling and outdated headquarters to Virginia or Maryland  saying he prefers to build a new state of the art facility at its current location in downtown Washington  D C  It is the FBI s view that the best balance of equities for the men and women of the FBI is to be here downtown  ideally in our current location   Wray said in testimony during a U S  House of Representatives appropriations hearing   Building a new building in that location gives us both the ability to have a level five security facility to significantly grow the number of people we can have there but also     make sure our folks are within close proximity to the hundreds and hundreds of meetings that they have with their partners every day all within about a mile and a half of our current location  Democrats in the U S  House have been probing the abrupt move by the FBI in 2017 to abandon long standing plans to relocate its headquarters outside of the capital At the heart of their concerns is whether President Donald Trump may have improperly intervened in the FBI s decision making out of self interest  in order to protect the nearby Trump Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue from any potential competition by developers who may want to erect a new hotel at the FBI s current location Prior to taking office in January 2017  Trump supported the FBI s relocation plans  according to Democrats involved in the probe Last fall  Congressional Democrats released an email which revealed that a White House backed proposal for a new FBI building at the agency s existing headquarters would result in a  less secure facility  and have a  higher per seat cost  than an earlier plan to move the FBI to the suburbs The decision to abandon the FBI s relocation plans preceded Wray  who became director last August  When I came into this job  the previous project had already been canceled   he testified   I wasn t involved in that part of it  I came into it with a blank slate     Reporting by Sarah N  Lynch  Editing by Alistair Bell  

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump will increase pressure on Iran  U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday  but he declined specific comment on whether the administration would continue sanctions waivers for countries that import Iranian oil Pompeo told a U S  Senate committee he had  no announcements  on whether Washington would continue waivers to some countries that import Iranian crude  or for Iran s civilian nuclear program  now that Trump has withdrawn the United States from the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran and reimposed sweeping sanctions  I can assure the rest of the world that President Trump will continue to ratchet up the pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran so that their behavior will change   Pompeo said Senator Ted Cruz and some other Republican members of the Foreign Relations Committee urged Pompeo not to continue the oil waivers when a deadline comes up next month  saying Iran s exports are generating billions of dollars in revenues for its government In response  Pompeo said   We ve been clear about our objective in getting Iran to zero  imports  just as quickly as we possibly can  and will continue to do that  When Trump withdrew from the nuclear pact in November  he gave a six month waiver to eight nations  allowing them to import some Iranian oil until early May  India  Iran s top oil client after China  was allowed to buy about 9 million barrels a month Reuters reported on Tuesday that Indian refiners are holding back from ordering Iranian oil for loading in May while they wait for word on the sanctions waiver Separately  Trump said on Monday he would name Iran s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization  an unprecedented step that drew Iranian condemnation and raised concerns about retaliatory attacks on U S  forces Pompeo said he foresaw a significant impact from that decision   If you re the general counsel of an Asian bank or a European bank  your world changed when that designation came out yesterday   he said   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Lesley Wroughton in Washington  Editing by Phil Berlowitz and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   U S  Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday a Democratic bid to restore the 2015 net neutrality rules is  dead on arrival in the Senate  The U S  House of Representatives on Tuesday debated a Democratic plan to reinstate the Obama era rules and overturn a December 2017 decision by the Federal Communications Commission to reverse the rules and hand sweeping authority to internet providers to recast how Americans access information Late Tuesday  the House opted to delay a vote on the measure and a series of amendments until Wednesday because of an unrelated issue over a separate budget measure The net neutrality bill mirrors an effort last year to reverse the FCC s order  approved on a 3 2 vote  that repealed rules barring providers from blocking or slowing internet content or offering paid  fast lanes  The reversal of net neutrality rules was a win for internet providers such as Comcast Corp  AT T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc  but was opposed by companies like Facebook Inc  Amazon com Inc and Alphabet Inc On Monday  the White House told Congress that if the bill were approved  President Donald Trump s advisers would recommend he veto it  The White House  strongly opposes  the measure that would  return to the heavy handed regulatory approach of the previous administration   it said in a statement The bill would repeal the order introduced by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  bar the FCC from reinstating it or a substantially similar order and reinstate the 2015 net neutrality order  The House will also consider a series of amendments Representative Mike Doyle  a Democrat  said Tuesday the bill  puts a cop on the beat to make sure our internet service providers aren t acting in an unjust  unreasonable or discriminatory way  Republicans called a bid to restore internet protections akin to a  government takeover of the internet  and said it would open the door to the FCC eventually setting internet rates or imposing new taxes on internet service similar to levies on cable or telephone service  Democrats say polls show Americans overwhelmingly back net neutrality and want protections that providers will not interfere with their internet access   Reporting by David Shepardson  Additional reporting by Amanda Becker  Editing by Dan Grebler and Lisa Shumaker

The secrets came directly from the phones of President Lenín Moreno of Ecuador  intimate pictures of him and his family on vacation  text messages from his wife  even a photograph of the president himself in a posh bedroom  eating a lobster in bed The material  published last month on an anonymous website  was particularly embarrassing because Mr  Moreno was in a bruising national fight over his austerity measures  But rather than mount a defense  the president played the victim  He blamed WikiLeaks  whose founder  Julian Assange  had spent the last seven years holed up in the country s London embassy WikiLeaks  actions were  despicable   said the country s vice president on television  vowing to take action  The group denied leaking the information  but on Thursday Ecuador made good on its threat   opening the door to British police officers who carted away Mr  Assange With that  Mr  Assange s long refuge inside the Ecuadorean Embassy finally came to an end  the capstone of an international cat and mouse game involving stolen document dumps  promises of more to come  failed efforts to contain him and accusations of blackmail Even as Ecuador harbored Mr  Assange from international prosecution  he and WikiLeaks wielded the threat of releasing damaging information against the Ecuadorean government In October 2016  as WikiLeaks was releasing thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D  Podesta  the chairman of the Clinton campaign  Ecuador restricted Mr  Assange s access to the internet  citing his interference in a foreign election The United States may have played a central role in the effort to corral Mr  Assange  On Oct  14  with the emails upending the campaign and the election just weeks away  a confidante of the Clintons and a top aide to Secretary of State John Kerry showed up at a dinner party hosted by the Ecuadorean ambassador before a ball  lingering with him as other guests left  several attendees said VideoOver the years  the WikiLeaks founder has been embraced by everyone from Lady Gaga to Sean Hannity  But he s also made enemies along the way  Our video shows how his anti secrecy agenda has attracted  and repelled  people across the political spectrum CreditCreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesMr  Assange s internet was curtailed by the Ecuadorean Embassy the very next day But WikiLeaks quickly retaliated  issuing a cryptic message that a leak against Ecuador was on its way  The tactic seemed to work  Two months later  Mr  Assange said in an interview that his internet had been restored Mr  Assange has been hailed by many around the world as a champion of transparency and a casualty of his own success at revealing secrets In Britain  the leader of the opposition Labour Party  Jeremy Corbyn  said this week that his country should oppose the extradition of Mr  Assange to the United States   where he faces a charge of conspiring to hack a Pentagon computer network in 2010   because the WikiLeaks founder was being pursued for  exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan  Diane Abbott  another Labour Party official  made the same assertion  arguing that Mr  Assange  is not being pursued to protect U S  national security  he s being pursued because he has exposed wrongdoing by U S  administrations and their military forces  But Ecuadorean officials contend that the expulsion comes from an extensive list of transgressions by Mr  Assange that soured their long   and often strained   relationship In explaining his decision  Mr  Moreno accused Mr  Assange of installing electronic distortion equipment in the embassy  blocking security cameras  confronting and mistreating guards and gaining access to security files without permission On Thursday  the government said it had also arrested a computer programmer in Ecuador in connection with the Assange case  contending that WikiLeaks had interfered in Ecuador s domestic political affairs WikiLeaks insisted it was not involved in the hack of Mr  Moreno s phones  and that the Ecuadorean government was using the episode as a false pretext to toss out Mr  Assange ImageJulian Assange after his arrest in London on Thursday  He had been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy there since 2012 CreditHenry Nicholls ReutersIt was no secret that the United States wanted him removed  It was also clear that Mr  Moreno is eager for international loans and better relations with the United States after the tensions that festered under his leftist predecessor  who granted Mr  Assange shelter in the embassy  I inherited this situation   Mr  Moreno said in a video address this week Fernando Cutz  a former senior adviser to H R  McMaster  the former national security adviser  and a Latin America policy specialist at the White House  acknowledged that American officials regularly spoke with their Ecuadorean counterparts about handing over Mr  Assange But Mr  Cutz argued that Ecuadorean officials did not simply cave to American demands  They wanted Mr  Assange gone as well  he said  We would definitely raise it with Ecuador   Mr  Cutz said   It was a bilateral irritant  without a doubt  But I don t think the U S  pressure ended up being the reason for this move  Bettering relations with the U S  was just the icing on the cake for Moreno  Assange was his own worst enemy  Mr  Assange s odyssey with Ecuador began in 2012  when he skipped a bail hearing to avoid being extradited to Sweden  where he was wanted for questioning in connection to accusations of  rape  sexual molestation and unlawful coercion  Ecuador s president at the time  Rafael Correa  had been criticized in his own country for a crackdown against the press  But in Mr  Assange  the Ecuadorean president found a symbol of his challenge to the United States  which he called an imperialist power  Mr  Assange was free to stay in the embassy as long as he pleased  Mr  Correa said But by 2016  a change in power was afoot in both the United States and in Ecuador  Hillary Clinton  who had run the State Department during the enormous leak of information by WikiLeaks in 2010  was running for president  Mr  Assange also had reason to worry about the coming election in Ecuador  where his stay in the embassy was becoming a campaign issue as well On Oct  7  2016  a tape was leaked showing Mrs  Clinton s opponent  Donald J  Trump  boasting of sexually harassing women while filming a segment for the show  Access Hollywood   sending Mr  Trump s campaign into a major crisis ImageHillary Clinton in 2016  WikiLeaks published thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of the chairman of Mrs  Clinton s presidential campaign CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesLess than an hour later  WikiLeaks began publishing the first of thousands of hacked emails from Mr  Podesta s account  creating a different controversy in the Clinton camp WikiLeaks continued to release the emails throughout October on a daily basis  American intelligence agents later concluded that the documents had been hacked by Russian operatives and laundered through WikiLeaks When Ecuador restricted Mr  Assange s internet access in response  Mr  Correa s administration said that it had acted on its own accord  not because of pressure from the United States  A spokesman for Mr  Kerry also denied that the Obama administration played any role But during the encounter on Oct  14   the night before Mr  Assange s internet access was restricted   Patsy Thomasson  a veteran of the Clinton White House  and a senior aide to Mr  Kerry attended a dinner at the Ecuadorean Embassy hosted by Francisco Borja  the ambassador of Ecuador Attendees interviewed said it struck them as odd that such high powered players would decide to attend a party hosted by a small country s ambassador  They noted that neither Ms  Thomasson nor the Kerry aide was dressed in black tie for the ball  and that both stayed behind with the ambassador after other guests left for the event Ms  Thomasson  reached by phone  said she had been invited at the very last minute by someone whose wife couldn t come  and that she did not recall having any conversations with the ambassador   much less about Julian Assange  WikiLeaks struck back soon after  On Oct  16  the day after Mr  Assange s internet was restricted  WikiLeaks tweeted a code  known in its parlance as an  insurance file   and signaled that an upcoming leak involving Ecuador was imminent According to former WikiLeaks insiders  Mr  Assange had damaging information about Ecuador and wasn t bluffing ImageMr  Assange on a balcony of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London in 2017 CreditMatt Dunham Associated PressMr  Assange certainly seemed to have acquired compromising material  In 2015  Cynthia Viteri  a prominent Ecuadorean politician  and Fernando Villavicencio  an Ecuadorean political journalist  had gotten secret documents showing that Ecuador was running a surveillance program  using an Italian company to spy on journalists and political enemies  in addition to spying on Mr  Assange at the embassy Mr  Villavicencio said he sent the material to a WikiLeaks email address  hoping the organization would publish the information  He eventually published the documents himself  WikiLeaks never did  though it is clear from leaked 2015 chat group logs that Mr  Assange and his inner circle were aware of them Mr  Villavicencio said he believed the documents he sent to WikiLeaks may have been among those that Mr  Assange had threatened to publish  There was very valuable information  information of millions of dollars in expenses  tens of millions of dollars in contracts to foreign companies to do illegal hacking   and it surprised me it didn t get out   he said   It was information of international and national interest  Nothing ever came of the Ecuador related  insurance file  WikiLeaks tweeted about in October 2016  From 2011  WikiLeaks did not leak relevant information regarding Correa s government   Mr  Villavicencio said   That certainly shows hypocrisy and a double standard  contradicting journalism principles  The controversy was just the beginning of Mr  Assange s difficulties  Mr  Moreno took over as president in May 2017 and soon broke with the policies of his predecessor Advisers to Mr  Moreno met with Paul Manafort  who had served as President Trump s campaign chairman  and raised the possibility of releasing Mr  Assange in exchange for concessions like debt relief  Mr  Moreno said repeatedly that Mr  Assange s time in the embassy should not be forever Then  Mr  Moreno s government was hit by a familiar disruption  more leaks In March  an anonymous website  INApapers org  published around 200 private emails related to Mr  Moreno  text messages written by his wife and photos of the president and his family taking luxurious vacations in Europe Mr  Moreno s government was quick to blame the release on WikiLeaks  which it says Mr  Assange still controls On Thursday  Mr  Moreno repeated the claim  telling Ecuadorean journalists that Mr  Assange didn t have the right to  hack private accounts or phones

Widespread peaceful protests have forced Sudan s long serving military ruler  President Omar Hassan al Bashir  out of office  But a transition to democracy is going to be far more difficult and will need prompt international support During his 30 years in power  Mr  al Bashir built a hydra headed military and security apparatus  On Thursday  a cabal of his henchmen in the military replaced him and took over  Gen  Awad Ibn Auf  Sudan s minister of defense  appeared on state television and announced the end of Mr  al Bashir s era and the beginning of a two year transition period during which the army will rule  Though he promised  representation of the people   many Sudanese will see this as betraying their demand for democracy ImageOmar al Bashir in February CreditAshraf Shazly Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesFor four months there have been widespread protests across Sudan s major cities  which began in response to high food prices and soon became a unanimous demand that Mr  al Bashir  who has ruled since 1989  step down  The protests gained momentum without losing their peaceful  carnival like nature  culminating in five days of relentless demonstrations surrounding the army headquarters  which is also the location of Mr  al Bashir s personal residence The coalition of generals  security chiefs and Islamist politicians within the ruling National Congress Party could not decide how to respond  The hard liners pressed for a brutal crackdown  but army commanders argued for restraint  Those internal divisions spilled into public view on Tuesday and Wednesday when militia forces and units of the feared National Intelligence and Security Services fired heavy tear gas and bullets at the protesters  but army units intervened to protect the crowds On Thursday  General Auf explained the coup by saying that Mr  al Bashir had ordered the army to disperse the protests by force but the army had refused  There is some truth to this  A massacre would have been not only an atrocity but also a dead end  giving Mr  al Bashir and his lieutenants no way out except fighting to the bitter end  Ten years ago  the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Mr  al Bashir for crimes committed in Darfur  and since then he has believed that he was safe only in the presidential palace The demonstrators  slogan  Leave  period  doesn t mention the I C C   leaving just enough space for Mr  al Bashir to depart peacefully  Thursday s army statement said that Mr  al Bashir would be taken to  a safe place  ImageGen  Awad Ibn AufCreditAshraf Shazly Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesGeneral Auf was Mr  al Bashir s heir apparent  Trained in Egypt  he remains close to his classmates at the Cairo military academy  among them President Abdel Fattah el Sisi  Whatever his words  many Sudanese will hear his master s voice Another member of the cabal is the ruthless and ambitious chief of the intelligence services  Salah Abdallah Gosh  who controls powerful forces in the capital  Mr  Gosh has close links to intelligence services  including the C I A   and has recently been particularly associated with the United Arab Emirates The biggest of the dozen or so paramilitaries are the Rapid Support Forces  which grew out of the infamous janjaweed militia responsible for massacres in Darfur 15 years ago  Their leader is Mohamed Hamdan Daglo  also known as Hemeti  who also has a stake in today s bargain  More than 7 000 of his troops are deployed in Yemen  on the Saudi Arabian payroll The combination of General Auf  Mr  Gosh and Mr  Daglo can prevent a civil war on the streets of Khartoum  And they have moved against the ruling National Congress Party  which grew out of the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood  Dozens of veteran N C P  leaders were reported arrested Thursday morning  the party has been disbanded  and the N C P  militia neutralized  This will be a blow to Qatar and Turkey  for which Sudan was the last bastion of Islamist government in the Arab world It will be tempting for the United States  the United Nations and the African Union to congratulate General  Auf on the overdue removal of Mr  al Bashir and the promise of stability  and leave democratic change to news bulletins  That would be a mistake  The work of solving Sudan s problems is only just beginning The first challenge of preventing civil war among the branches of the security apparatus has been averted  at least for now But the economy remains in free fall  The main reasons are mismanagement  corruption  unchecked spending on the security sector and the loss of oil revenues after the secession of South Sudan in 2011  The economic malaise was so deep it could not be fixed by the United States  easing of sanctions on Sudan  Nor could it be fixed by an injection of Arab cash  which might ease the crisis for a few weeks but cannot fix the fundamentals Without serious progress toward democracy and a resolution of the continuing wars in Darfur and the Nuba Mountains  Sudan will remain at the precipice of bloodshed and turmoil  The Sudanese must deliver this for themselves  but today they need active international engagement to move in the right direction The best chance lies with the same formula that brought an end to the 20 year old war between north and south in 2005  a combination of African and American mediation Sudan s biggest African neighbors are Egypt and Ethiopia  both of which have deep interest in its stability and prosperity  The African Union envoy for Sudan  former President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa  is a veteran of the negotiated transition to democracy in his own country Sudan has long been a bipartisan issue in Washington  Under the Bush administration  Republicans and Democrats came together to condemn the atrocities in Darfur and South Sudan and to support the peace deal with South Sudan  One of the rare continuities between the Obama and Trump administrations was sticking with the policy of lifting sanctions on Sudan with the aim of preserving stability There is still a dangerous vacuum in Sudan  An American African coalition must fill it Alex de Waal is the executive director the World Peace

President Trump s older sister  Maryanne Trump Barry  has retired as a federal appellate judge  ending an investigation into whether she violated judicial conduct rules by participating in fraudulent tax schemes with her siblings The court inquiry stemmed from complaints filed last October  after an investigation by The New York Times found that the Trumps had engaged in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s  including instances of outright fraud  that greatly increased the inherited wealth of Mr  Trump and his siblings  Judge Barry not only benefited financially from most of those tax schemes  The Times found  she was also in a position to influence the actions taken by her family Judge Barry  now 82  has not heard cases in more than two years but was still listed as an inactive senior judge  one step short of full retirement  In a letter dated Feb  1  a court official notified the four individuals who had filed the complaints that the investigation was  receiving the full attention  of a judicial conduct council  Ten days later  Judge Barry filed her retirement papers The status change rendered the investigation moot  since retired judges are not subject to the conduct rules  The people who filed the complaints were notified last week that the matter had been dropped without a finding on the merits of the allegations  The decision has not yet been made public  but copies were provided to The Times by two of the complainants  Both are involved in the legal profession Judge Barry did not respond to emails or telephone messages left at her Manhattan apartment Judicial council reviews can result in the censure or reprimand of federal judges  and in extremely rare cases  a referral to the House of Representatives for impeachment In retirement  Judge Barry is entitled to receive annually the salary she earned when she last met certain workload requirements  Though the exact figure was not immediately available  it appears to be between  184 500 and  217 600 The Times investigation focused on how the profits and ownership of the real estate empire built by the president s father  Fred C  Trump  were transferred to Donald J  Trump and his siblings  often in ways designed to dodge gift and estate taxes A lawyer for the president  Charles J  Harder  said last fall   The New York Times s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false  and highly defamatory  Judge Barry had been a co owner of a shell company   All County Building Supply   Maintenance   created by the family to siphon cash from their father s empire by marking up purchases already made by his employees  The Times investigation found  Judge Barry  her siblings and a cousin split the markup  free of gift and estate taxes  which at the time were levied at a much higher rate than income taxes VideoBy the end of 1997  Donald Trump and his siblings owned nearly all of Fred Trump s empire  free and clear of estate taxes  How did they do it  A special type of trust with a clunky acronym  GRAT  short for grantor retained annuity trust  It is one of the tax code s great gifts to the ultrawealthy On a financial disclosure form filed in 1999  Judge Barry noted that her share of the All County profits for the previous 17 months totaled just over  1 million The family also used the padded invoices to justify higher rent increases in rent regulated buildings  artificially inflating the rents of thousands of tenants  Former prosecutors told The Times that if the authorities had discovered at the time how the Trumps were using All County  their actions would have warranted a criminal investigation for defrauding tenants  tax fraud and filing false documents Similarly  Judge Barry benefited from the gross undervaluation of her father s properties when she and her siblings took ownership of them through a trust  sparing them from paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes  The Times found  For years  she attended regular briefings at her brother s offices in Trump Tower to hear updates on the real estate portfolio and to collect her share of the profits  When the siblings sold off their father s empire  between 2004 and 2006  her share of the windfall was  182 5 million  The Times found Judge Barry was nominated to the Federal District Court in New Jersey by President Ronald Reagan in 1983  after several years as a federal prosecutor  She was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by President Bill Clinton in 1999 In February 2017  shortly after her brother s inauguration  she notified the court that she would stop hearing cases and give up her staff and chambers  She was then considered a senior inactive judge  a status that did not entitle her to salary increases  but that left her still subject to conduct inquiries  Judge Barry did not announce a reason for the change at the time Following confidentiality requirements  Judge Barry s name does not appear on the order ending the investigation or the correspondence with the complainants  The order identifies the judge in question as a senior inactive judge  about whom complaints were filed in October 2018  Under court rules  all complaints are reviewed by a judge  and those with an allegation of misconduct or disability are generally referred to a panel of judges for investigation  The complaints allege  on the basis of a news article  that the then inactive senior circuit judge may have committed misconduct relating to tax and financial transactions   says the order  dated April 1 The complaints had been transferred to the Second Circuit to avoid conflicts with judges who knew Judge Barry Scott Shuchart  a lawyer who filed one of the complaints  said he had done so as a concerned member of the legal profession  He said he found it  galling  that Judge Barry  while still receiving her federal pension  was now immune from judicial misconduct proceedings  just because she changed from one form of retired status to another  In an opinion article last October for The Washington Post  Mr  Shuchart wrote that he had quit his job at the Department of Homeland Security  where he had served since the Obama administration  because he believed that the Trump administration s family separation policy at the southern border was unconstitutional Around that time  Mr  Shuchart joined the Center for American Progress  a left leaning public policy and advocacy group  as a senior fellow focused on immigration issues  But  he said  he filed the complaint against Judge Barry on his own  independent of any organized effort

WASHINGTON   Lawyers for Gregory B  Craig  a White House counsel in the Obama administration  expect him to be indicted in the coming days on charges related to his work for the Russia aligned government of Ukraine The case against Mr  Craig  74  stemmed from an investigation initiated by the office of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III An Ivy League educated lawyer who held prominent positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations  Mr  Craig would become the first person who made his name in Democratic Party politics to be charged in a case linked to the special counsel s investigation Mr  Craig would also become the first person to be charged in a case connected to the special counsel after Mr  Mueller finished his investigation into the 2016 presidential election  In a summary of the inquiry  Attorney General William P  Barr said that the special counsel s team had concluded that there was no evidence that President Trump or his aides  conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities  The case against Mr  Craig is related to the Foreign Agents Registration Act  or FARA  which the Justice Department is prioritizing in part because of scrutiny related to Mr  Mueller s investigation The law requires Americans to disclose detailed information about lobbying and public relations work for foreign governments and politicians  and it has been the basis for charges brought against several people investigated by the special counsel Mr  Craig s lawyers do not necessarily expect him to be charged with violating the act Rather  they expect him to be charged with making false statements to the Justice Department officials examining whether he was required to register under the law for work he did in 2012  while he was a partner at Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher   Flom The work  on behalf of the government of Viktor F  Yanukovych  then the president of Ukraine  was linked to Paul Manafort  who at the time was a political consultant earning tens of millions of dollars for his representation of Mr  Yanukovych Mr  Manafort  who went on to become Mr  Trump s campaign chairman in 2016  was sentenced last month to seven and a half years in prison on charges brought by Mr  Mueller s team related to obstruction of justice and violations of FARA  as well as banking and tax laws stemming from his work in Ukraine Mr  Manafort arranged for Skadden Arps to be paid more than  5 2 million in 2012 and 2013  primarily from a Ukrainian oligarch  to assist the Ukrainian Justice Ministry  Specifically  Mr  Craig and his team produced a report that Mr  Manafort intended to use to quell Western criticism of the prosecution and jailing by Mr  Yanukovych s government of one of his rivals  the former prime minister Yulia V  Tymoshenko  and to train Ukrainian prosecutors handling matters related to the case After the report was released  and Mr  Craig was quoted discussing it in an article in The New York Times  the Justice Department unit that oversees FARA reached out to Skadden Arps to ask why the firm and its lawyers had not registered as foreign agents for the Ukrainian government The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III The department initially concluded in 2013 that Skadden Arps was obligated to register  But it reversed itself the next year after Mr  Craig made the case that the law did not apply to his work on behalf of Ukraine After the initial determination  Mr  Craig told the Justice Department that he and Skadden Arps did not proactively reach out to news outlets to disseminate and promote the report  Rather  he claimed he distributed the report only  in response to requests from the media   according to a letter he sent to the department at the time Prosecutors cast doubt on Mr  Craig s claim in a settlement reached in January between the Justice Department and Skadden Arps  Under that settlement  the firm avoided prosecution in the matter in exchange for an agreement to pay  4 6 million  to retroactively register its Ukraine work under FARA  to beef up its compliance processes and to cooperate with government investigations of the work on behalf of Ukraine But the settlement did not exonerate Mr  Craig  and in fact it signaled that he was in prosecutors  cross hairs  It quoted emails showing Mr  Craig reached out to a journalist to offer to provide the report and discuss it Neither Mr  Craig nor the journalist are identified by name in the settlement  The journalist  David E  Sanger of The New York Times  is an author of the article in which Mr  Craig is quoted Mr  Craig s lawyers have argued that he was not required to register his work under FARA because he was not doing public relations for the Ukrainian government In a statement on Wednesday  they said he  repeatedly refused requests that he participate in Ukraine s media and lobbying campaign to promote the Tymoshenko Report  Rather  they say he spoke to The Times to correct the Ukrainian Justice Ministry s claims that the report cleared Mr  Yanukovych of accusations that he directed the prosecution of Ms  Tymoshenko for political purposes The report  was critical of the Tymoshenko trial and caused unhappiness in the Ministry of Justice   the lawyers said in their statement Mr  Craig s lawyers asserted that the case against their client was flimsy  pointing out that Mr  Mueller s team referred it to federal prosecutors in Manhattan last year for potential prosecution related to FARA  but that they did not bring charges  Instead  the case was moved in January to Washington It is being handled by the United States attorney s office in Washington  and the Justice Department s National Security Division  which enforces FARA Mr  Craig s lawyers said in the statement   We expect an indictment by the D C  U S  attorney s office at the request of the National Security Division   But they added   Mr  Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government s stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr  Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion  Mr  Craig left Skadden Arps last year as scrutiny of his work with Mr  Manafort escalated and after a former associate of the firm pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his work on the effort  

TAIPEI  Taiwan   President Tsai Ing wen of Taiwan welcomed American dignitaries on Wednesday in the face of rising tensions with China  saying the self ruled island needed to protect itself  from new  sophisticated threats coming from across the strait  Ms  Tsai made the remarks at a dinner at the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei in honor of the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act  the law that has guided the United States  unofficial relationship with the island s government  The dinner was but the latest round of signaling of Washington s resolve to stand by Taiwan as tensions mount with Beijing In the past two weeks  Washington  Taipei and Beijing have traded words over Chinese jet incursions  Taiwan s requests for American made fighter jets  the American military presence in its unofficial embassy in Taipei  and Ms  Tsai s recent stop in Hawaii  We must make sure Taiwan s economic and security position remains on the right track   Ms  Tsai told a group largely comprising American businesspeople  emphasizing the need to continue diversifying Taiwan s economy from reliance on mainland China The Communist government in Beijing seeks to assert sovereignty over Taiwan  potentially through military force  The United States considers Taiwan s political status to be undetermined  while opposing attempts by China to coerce unification ImageA Chinese fighter jet

the Taiwan Strait  which separates mainland China and Taiwan  for the first time since 1999  The incursion came days after a United States Navy destroyer and a United States Coast Guard cutter traversed the strait  which  like the South China Sea  is considered to be international waters under international law  but Beijing claims as its territory Taiwan jets scrambled and repelled their Chinese counterparts  which came within 115 miles of the island s coast  These actions by China are not only unilateral changes to the cross strait status quo  even more  they are a brazen provocation to regional security and stability   Ms  Tsai said in a Facebook post the following day  in her first public comment on the events Ms  Tsai warned China against further provocations  Our military protects our territory without rest  as president I assure our citizens that I will fight together with our soldiers to the very end   she wrote   We will not yield an inch of our territory  The last sentence echoed widely publicized exhortations by the Chinese president  Xi Jinping  who has threatened Taiwan with war should it formalize its functional independence  The Chinese Communist Party claims Taiwan as its territory  but it has never controlled the island  which is still officially ruled by the Republic of China government overthrown in the mainland in 1949 ImageA flag lowering ceremony in Taipei CreditDavid Chang EPA  via ShutterstockThe dinner on Wednesday was stocked with American business officials  many of whom have expressed concerns about saber rattling from Beijing  David Meale  the deputy assistant secretary of state for trade policy and negotiations  who was the event s special guest  pledged that  the United States will remain steadfast in all of its commitments to Taiwan  Washington broke ties with Taiwan s government in 1979 as a prerequisite for establishing formal relations with the People s Republic of China in Beijing  Months later  President Jimmy Carter signed the Taiwan Relations Act  which calls for Taiwan s status to be determined by peaceful means  and for the United States to provide the means for Taiwan to defend itself In late February  Taiwan asked to buy 66 F 16V fighter jets from the United States  If approved it would be the first aircraft sale since 1992 and a major reversal of the trend under previous administrations  which avoided large arms deals to Taiwan out of fear of angering China Chen Chung chi  a spokesman for Taiwan s Ministry of Defense  said the government hoped that Washington would approve the latest request  which was solely for defensive purposes in the face of a growing threat from China  which he described as a  troublemaker  Zhu Songling  the director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University  said that aside from arms sales  some members of Congress were pushing the government toward an increasingly official relationship  One such bill  the Taiwan Travel Act  signed into law by President Trump  encourages official exchanges up to the highest level  which would include presidential visits ImageThe United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan  Instead  its interests are represented by the American Institute in Taiwan CreditSam Yeh Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesChina has used economic enticements to convince Taiwan s allies to drop recognition of Taipei in favor of Beijing  The Trump administration is wary of China s gaining more footholds in the South Pacific  which the United States military views as strategically vital in the event of active warfare with China While Washington does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan  the American Institute of Taiwan serves its interests on the island  The group is preparing to move into a heavily fortified  250 million compound that was recently built in Taipei Legally a nonprofit organization headquartered in Virginia and staffed by State Department employees on leave  the institute drew Chinese criticism this month after its spokeswoman  Amanda Mansour  told Taiwan media that active duty American personnel from all four military branches had been stationed on the island since 2005 For years  the institute had sidestepped saying whether it housed American military staff  and Ms  Mansour s statement raised the question whether it was a message to an increasingly aggressive China  The personnel will move into the new compound when it formally begins operations on May 6  she said Several American senators made recorded video statements shown at Wednesday s dinner in Taipei  offering American support in the face of Chinese pressure  The lawmakers included Marco Rubio of Florida  Pat Roberts of Kansas and Cory Gardner of Colorado   all Republicans   as well as Tim Kaine of Virginia  a Democrat  The United States must continue to stand by Taiwan and encourage our democratic allies and partners around the world to maintain official relations with Taipei   Mr  Rubio said   regardless of any pressure or coercion coming from Beijing   

 Reuters    A political feud over President Donald Trump s picks for the U S  Federal Reserve Board broke into an open brawl on Tuesday even before the nominations of Herman Cain  a former restaurant chain executive  and Stephen Moore  a conservative economic commentator  have been formally submitted to the Senate Cain and Moore  both overt loyalists to the president  in recent days have waged unprecedented public campaigns for the Fed jobs  with both eagerly endorsing Trump s economic policies and Moore pledging to  accommodate  those policies once he is at the Fed The central bank s leadership prides itself on its nonpartisan stewardship over the world s biggest economy  and views political independence as key to its ability to carry out monetary policy effectively  On Tuesday  Democrats including Senator Chuck Schumer and Joint Economic Committee Vice Chair Carolyn Maloney took public aim at the pair s qualifications  with Maloney saying that Moore is  superbly underqualified for the role for which he has been nominated  And at least four Republican Senators indicated they could break ranks on Cain  enough to sink his chances for the required approval in the Senate The Trump administration is  probably going to hear from a number of our members about concerns that they have  about Cain  John Thune  the Republican whip in the Senate  told Politico  Another Republican senator  John Cornyn  said   Before the president starts floating names     we need to have a conversation about who is actually confirmable up here   according to a Twitter post by New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush  Cain and Moore are battling hard for the two vacant seats on the Federal Reserve s Board of Governors  positions that would give them a say for years on interest rate policy and bank regulation  In recent days they have taken to social media and the airwaves to promote themselves and lash out at critics and anyone they view as standing in the way of Trump s agenda or his prospects for reelection In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday  Moore trumpeted his agenda for economic growth and again took aim at critics  There are a lot of people on the left that are afraid of my ideas  They realize that they couldn t defeat me based on my ideas  because they re popular  and they re right  so that leads to this kind of smear campaign  which is ugly   Moore said   I have a pretty populist agenda that I m pursuing  which is more growth  higher wages  more transparency and more sunlight on how the Fed operates   Moore said  calling those priorities  the right things to do  and saying that he wants  to talk directly to the American people   NOT SO FAVORABLY INCLINED Cain and Moore s open politicking is a departure from past practice  with confirmation of Fed nominees typically a sleepy process of quizzing candidates  mostly economists with doctoral degrees  about their views on monetary policy and banking oversight  Lewis Alexander  chief U S  economist at Nomura Securities  said it was positive  for people s views to be known   but he added a note of caution   It is certainly not a part of the Federal Reserve s mandate to promote the chances of reelection of a particular president  Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed for raising rates  saying that rate hikes are holding back the economy  His pick of Moore and former Republican presidential candidate Cain has been seen by critics as a means to put pressure on the central bank to ease policy and help him politically Moore and Cain have kept up unusually public profiles  Cain s has included digs against Democrats   lunatic liberals   he said Monday on Facebook  and gays  a Tuesday tweet linked to a piece on Floyd Brown s Western Journal that portrays gays as unnatural   Cain has said he would not be disappointed if he does not get the Fed job  but has repeatedly brought it up on his daily show  In a video posted Tuesday  Cain said  a lot of people     do not like the fact  that he is under consideration and are trying to discourage the administration from nominating him because of his conservative political leanings   The decision s going to be made basically on the facts   he said  Cain remains co chair of the America Fighting Back PAC  which was co founded by Brown to promote Trump s reelection  Cain s photo and name were used as recently as last month in a letter raising funds to oppose a group of 12 senators if they ever  cross  Trump  Two of those senators are on the Senate Banking Committee  the first stop in a two step Senate approval process for any Fed nominee  Brown  who was the founding chairman of Citizens United  said in an interview that Cain has stepped back from day to day involvement in the PAC  Cain did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment Moore in radio and TV interviews has praised Trump s economic record and embraced easing monetary policy  a stance that Trump himself has vigorously promoted  People  are not going to vote against someone who has been this successful on the economy   Moore said on Monday  adding in another interview that day that he is  looking forward to getting over to the Fed   Cain s candidacy appeared by late Tuesday to be drawing the most political fire  Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski told The Hill that she is  not so favorably inclined  on Cain  whose 2012 run for president was derailed by claims of sexual harassment  which he has denied  Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell declined to publicly endorse him  the Washington Post reported  It is not the first time a Fed nominee has faced political opposition  In 2011 Republicans scuttled the nomination by Democratic President Barack Obama of Peter Diamond  a Nobel laureate in economics and MIT professor  for what

CAIRO   Tens of thousands of protesters joined in anti government marches across Sudan on Saturday in what organizers said was one of the largest turnouts in more than three months of demonstrations calling for embattled President Omar al Bashir to step down The demonstrations began in December over price increases and food shortages  and quickly escalated into calls for Mr  al Bashir s resignation  posing one of the biggest challenges yet to his nearly 30 year rule The rallies are being led by the Sudanese Professionals Association  an umbrella group of independent professional unions Footage posted online showed thousands of protesters  mostly young people  marching toward the military s headquarters in the capital  Khartoum  demanding the army s support and chanting   One people  one military   and  Freedom  They also chanted   The people want the fall of the regime   echoing the popular slogan of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that briefly defied despotism in the region  but never made it to Sudan Sarah Abdel Jaleel  a spokeswoman for the organizers  said protesters have started a sit in around the military s headquarters  which they hope to keep in place until Mr  al Bashir resigns  In some videos  troops were seen using tear gas to disperse demonstrators Rallies took place across the country  Footage showed dozens of people marching in front of a United Nations refugee camp in Darfur and shouting   just fall  The large opposition Umma Party said security forces arrested four of its leaders ahead of planned marches in the province of Sennar  around 225 miles east of Khartoum Authorities did not issue any statements on the arrests  and a government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment Saturday s marches marked the 34th anniversary of the overthrow of President al Nimeiri in a bloodless coup The military removed Mr  Nimeiri after a popular uprising and handed power to an elected government  But the dysfunctional administration lasted only a few years until Mr  al Bashir allied with Islamist hard liners and toppled it in a coup in 1989 Mr  Al Bashir has banned unauthorized public gatherings and granted sweeping powers to the police since imposing a state of emergency last month Security forces have responded to the protest movement with a fierce crackdown  killing at least 60 people according to Physicians for Human Rights  a New York based rights group  

JERUSALEM   As Israelis get ready to go to the polls on Tuesday  a stark  fateful and long deferred choice has suddenly reappeared to confront them after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s unexpected promise to begin extending sovereignty over the West Bank if he is re elected Do voters want to make permanent their country s control over the West Bank and its 2 6 million Palestinian inhabitants  Or do they want to keep alive the possibility that a Palestinian state could be carved out there one day That question has been made newly urgent by Mr  Netanyahu  who is facing a career threatening challenge from a unified centrist party headed by a team of former army chiefs  His shocking announcement about Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank appeared to be a last ditch effort to rally his right wing base and stay in power For supporters of annexation  it is not only this week s vote that is on their minds but the American election in 2020  They call President Trump s staunch support for Israel a  historic opportunity  to proceed with annexation of some  much or even all of the West Bank   but one that comes with a ticking countdown to a possible new administration in Washington Two state proponents  while conceding that there is no way to know for sure how the Palestinians would react  say a sovereignty push would almost certainly lead to a nightmare of one kind or another for Israel  like a rise in violence and international condemnation The incremental entrenchment of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land is often called  creeping annexation   And until now it has occurred slowly enough  and piecemeal enough  to let supporters of a two state solution reassure themselves that such steps could still be undone or accounted for in future negotiations Applying sovereignty  by contrast  would be all but irreversible Whether accomplished quickly or by degrees  it is tantamount to annexation  and it would break with a quarter century old agreement  under the Oslo accords  that the status quo between Israel and the Palestinians must not be altered except through negotiations For years  Mr  Netanyahu positioned himself as a check on both sides in the debate  He placed himself to the right of supporters of a two state solution on the one hand  and to the left of those who want to annex the West Bank and see a so called Greater Israel fulfill the Zionist dream of a Jewish state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Those Israelis were once marginalized as part of the right wing fringe  But with fewer than half of Israelis still supporting a two state solution  it is the peace camp that is now out of step with the majority of society  A fast growing sovereignty movement  called Ribonut in Hebrew  has not only achieved political acceptability but has overtaken much of the powerful Israeli right wing No fewer than 60 bills pushing some form of annexation have been offered for a debate in Parliament since 2015  according to the human rights group Yesh Din  Support for declaring Israeli sovereignty over parts or all of Judea and Samaria has become the litmus test for all leaders of the right   said Michael B  Oren  a deputy minister under Mr  Netanyahu who is not running for re election  using the biblical names for the West Bank ImageThe Israeli settlement Beitar Illit in the West Bank on Sunday CreditRonen Zvulun ReutersAdherents of the sovereignty movement contend that the closer Israel has gotten to a two state solution  whether in pulling out of Gaza or in redeploying its forces out of much of the West Bank   the more death and bloodshed it has brought us  in uprisings  suicide bombings and rocket attacks  as Ribonut says on its website Every other member of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party seeking re election had already embraced annexation  Their leader was the lone holdout Saturday night  under intense pressure in a neck and neck contest with a centrist former army chief  Benny Gantz  Mr  Netanyahu gave in  Lunging further to his political right  he declared on national television that he would indeed begin to  apply sovereignty  in the West Bank  The question you re asking is an interesting one  Will we move on now to the next stage   he told an interviewer   And the answer is  yes  We will move on to the next stage  Asked if he would extend Israeli law over the so called settlement blocs   large Jewish communities built on the West Bank that even many two state supporters assume the Palestinians would give up in trade for other Israeli territory in an eventual deal for their own state   Mr  Netanyahu said he would not stop there  I m going to apply sovereignty  but I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlement points  because from my perspective every such point of settlement is Israeli   he said The morning after  few Israelis were taking Mr  Netanyahu at his word  There is a term for his 11th hour pre election surprises  the  gevalt campaign   as in the Yiddish  Oy  gevalt   used to express incredulity or weariness In 2015  Mr  Netanyahu rallied his base by sowing fears of a big turnout by Arab Israelis that would hand the government to the left  This time  many see him as trying to induce the right wing to come to his aid with a promise to fulfill a settler dream  This is Bibi being Bibi   said Daniel C  Kurtzer  a former American ambassador to Israel under Democratic and Republican presidents  using Mr  Netanyahu s nickname Mr  Gantz  along with three other leaders of his Blue and White Party  two of them also former army chiefs  all forswore any such unilateral moves on the West Bank  They said that Mr  Netanyahu was merely trying to save his political skin  and that no Israelis were foolish enough to believe him Indeed  analysts quickly speculated about the loopholes through which Mr  Netanyahu could slip free of his new commitment  dragging his feet on the promise to avoid interfering with a potential Trump peace proposal  arguing that changing circumstances made it no longer workable  or acceding only to the subtlest incremental applications of Israeli law to the territories  but nothing that equated with formal annexation Michael Koplow  an analyst for the left leaning Israel Policy Forum  likened Mr  Netanyahu s remarks to a famous 2009 speech he gave at Bar Ilan University in which  under pressure from President Barack Obama  he declared his support for a two state solution ImageIn 2009  Mr  Netanyahu  under pressure from the Obama administration  delivered a speech declaring support for a two state solution CreditGovernment of IsraelIt was a high water mark for his openness toward a Palestinian state  and he has effectively been retreating from it ever since  But the Israeli left cited it for years afterward to pressure Mr  Netanyahu to keep a two state option alive Now  Mr  Koplow said  the right will be able to squeeze Mr  Netanyahu over his televised promise to proceed with annexation moves   and I don t think he ll be able to wiggle out of it  Mr  Netanyahu is also much weaker than he was 10 years ago  He faces a likely indictment on corruption charges  including bribery  which could force him from office  He has been widely expected  if the election result gives him the chance  to try to form a governing coalition that would enact retroactive legislation preventing a sitting prime minister from being prosecuted That could set up a trade off with his coalition partners  a get out of jail free card in exchange for concrete steps on annexation  said Daniel B  Shapiro  the American ambassador to Israel under Mr  Obama  The parties he will need to form this coalition can now insist that he follow through on sovereignty  in return for protection from the indictments   Mr  Shapiro said   He ll try to provide the minimum  they ll try to extort the maximum  Mr  Shapiro added   And there s no evident check coming from the Trump administration  as there always had been under every previous administration  saying   Don t do that   In response to the rise of the sovereignty movement  two state supporters have warned loudly of a domino effect that any annexation would set in motion  whether limited to a few big settlements  the Israeli administered portion of the West Bank known as Area C  or the West Bank as a whole  It will be taken by the Palestinians  by the other Arabs and by the international community as an Israeli national decision to slam the door on a two state solution  on a negotiated agreement   said Nimrod Novik  a former senior adviser to Prime Minister Shimon Peres who sits on the executive committee of Commanders for Israel s Security  a group of retired senior military and national security officials who support a two state solution The toppling dominoes  the group predicts  would begin with a wave of West Bank violence  the refusal of Palestinian security officers to continue cooperating with Israel  the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and the necessary re occupation of the entire West Bank by the Israeli military   an operation that would take weeks and require the entire standing army  more or less Even more serious  if Palestinians in annexed territory are not granted citizenship  it could pave the way for the kind of apartheid state that two state supporters have long warned against Sovereignty proponents insist that annexation of settlement blocs like Maale Adumim or Gush Etzion would actually meet little international or Arab resistance because of the expectation that those areas would remain in Israel under a two state outcome But Mr  Koplow said this was deceptive  Once you start down this annexation road  it s not going to stop at the blocs   he insisted   And that s where the real danger comes in  If the Israeli government annexes Maale Adumim  the sky isn t going to fall  And when that happens  the next step is going to be the overreach  There ll be a big push to annex Area C  And once you do that  that s the whole ballgame   

DUBAI LONDON   Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the United States had made  a vicious move  in designating the Revolutionary Guards as a foreign terrorist organization  and Tehran vowed to take action against U S  forces in the region  They wish to plot against our Sepah  the Guard corps      it is in the front line of confronting enemies of our  1979 Islamic  revolution and has always defended the country     America has failed to block our advances   Khamenei  who controls the Guards  was quoted as saying by the state media  In spite of all the pressure over the past 40 years  Americans have failed to do a damn thing and their vicious move will bear no fruit   Khameni said  a day after a decision by U S  President Donald Trump that is likely to raise tensions in the Middle East Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also defended the corps as protectors of Iran  saying in a televised speech that the United States  holds a grudge  against the Guards who have  sacrificed their lives to protect our people  our revolution  Comprising an estimated 125 000 strong military with army  navy and air units  the Revolutionary Guards  IRGC  also command the Basij  a religious volunteer paramilitary force  and control Iran s ballistic missile programs  The Guards  overseas Quds forces have fought Iran s proxy wars in the region The United States has already blacklisted dozens of entities and people for affiliations with the Guards  but not the organization as a whole The IRGC commander dismissed Washington s decision and said the Guards would upgrade their military capabilities   This U S  move was quite laughable since the Revolutionary Guards are in people s hearts     The Revolutionary Guards will increase their defensive and offensive capabilities in the coming year   Mohammad Ali Jafari was quoted as saying by the state broadcaster The long tense relations between Tehran and Washington took a turn for the worse last May when Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers  reached before he took office  and reimposed sanctions  Tehran retaliated by naming the United States Central Command  CENTCOM  as a terrorist organization and the U S  government as a sponsor of terror The Iranian Armed Forces  general staff  Iran s most senior military body which also oversees the IRGC  said it would  use all its means to fight  against CENTCOM  and a Guards commander on Tuesday warned the U S  Navy to keep its distance  Mr Trump  tell your warships not to pass near the Revolutionary Guards boats   ISNA news agency reported a tweet from Mohsen Rezaei as saying  Saudi Arabia  Iran s arch regional rival and a Washington ally  welcomed the U S  action on Tuesday but Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said it  could have negative repercussions on Iraq and the region  Abdul Mahdi  speaking to reporters  said Baghdad had tried to head off Trump s decision and added that Iraq would do all it could to bring calm to the region since it maintained good relations with both Tehran and Washington Acting U S  Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told Fox News on Tuesday that listing the IGRC as a terrorist group was a policy decision by the administration and was meant to have  non military effects   such as pressuring the Iranian economy  We re going to continue to work in Iraq to strengthen security forces  We recognize Iraq s sovereignty  It s our role in country to build security and we ll continue to do that   Shanahan said Turkey  a NATO ally of the United States  was also critical   Such decisions will lead to instability in our region and once you start stepping outside international law  it is unpredictable where it will stop   Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a press conference in Istanbul For its part  France called for steps to avoid any escalation of tensions in the Middle East Revolutionary Guards commanders have repeatedly said that U S  bases in the Middle East and U S  aircraft carriers in the Gulf are within range of Iranian missiles  Tehran has also threatened to disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if the United States tries to strangle Iran s economy by halting its oil exports  OUR PATIENCE HAS LIMITS In a show of support  Iranian lawmakers wore Guards uniforms to parliament on Tuesday  chanting  Death to America  as Iran marked the annual National Day of the Revolutionary Guards  the semi official Fars news agency reported   America s decision to label the Guards as a terrorist group was the peak of stupidity and ignorance of the American leadership   Fars quoted parliament speaker Ali Larijani as saying  Iran has so far continued to comply with the nuclear deal  but its clerical rulers have threatened to withdraw from it and to resume the suspended Iranian uranium enrichment program if other signatories to the pact fail to protect Iran s interests   I am telling you  American leaders   if you pressure us  we will mass produce IR8 advanced centrifuges   Rouhani said in the speech marking Iran s National Nuclear Day Under the nuclear deal  sanctions imposed by the United States  the European Union and United Nations were lifted in return for Iran agreeing long term curbs on a nuclear program the West suspected was geared to developing an atom bomb The Trump administration says the nuclear deal did not do enough to curb Iranian meddling in regional affairs or restrict its development of ballistic missiles  Tehran has stated its determination to expand the missile program despite mounting U S  pressure to curb it  Co signatories Britain  France and Germany are trying to salvage the nuclear deal and set up in January a mechanism to allow trade with Tehran and circumvent U S  sanctions   Additional reporting

MILAN   The European Central Bank has pushed back a deadline to submit binding bids for troubled Italian lender Carige to mid May so as to give a specialist fund run by BlackRock more time  two sources familiar with the matter said The BlackRock fund is the only group still known to be considering a bid  One of the sources said it needed more time to study a possible offer  given all the moving parts involved  Carige was placed under special administration at the start of the year after its top investor blocked a planned capital raising  derailing an industry financed rescue plan The ECB has asked the three commissioners it put in charge of the Genoa based bank to find a buyer for Carige  which needs to fill a 630 million euro  543 08 million pounds  capital shortfall  The commissioners  mandate has recently been extended to the end of September  matching a deadline established by government decree for the state to inject up to 1 billion euros into the bank if a private solution fails The ECB has now also extended by six weeks an original April 5 deadline to submit bids  one source said  The first source said there was no new set deadline but  a process made up of several steps which is expected to conclude in the first part of May  One such step concerns a possible conversion into equity of a 320 million euro hybrid bond that healthy Italian banks bought from Carige late last year to help the bank beef up its total capital Converting the bond into equity would reduce the investment needed to fill Carige s capital gap A third source close to the matter has said that a  substantial conversion  could become necessary as part of the BlackRock fund s plan for Carige  Most Italian banks are unwilling to become shareholders in Carige via the bond conversion  however  which is also subject to a very complex voting procedure involving all banks that financed Carige s rescue Another possible hurdle is that any bidder would need to win over Carige s top shareholder  the Malacalza family  or would risk being voted down at a shareholder meeting called to approve the capital raising and any deal  The Malacalzas  billionaires who built their fortune on steel  own 27 6 percent of the lender after investing more than 400 million euros for a stake worth just some 23 million euros based on market prices before trading in Carige shares was suspended indefinitely   Reporting by Elvira Pollina and Andrea Mandala  editing by Valentina Za and Alexandra Hudson

SANTA MARIA CHIQUIMULA  Guatemala   After a U S  funded programme gave Guatemalan farmer Rigoberto Leon and his neighbours tools to plant new crops like tomatoes and chile peppers  many of them stayed to live off their drought prone lands even as droves of villagers left for the United States More programmes like the climate change adaptation scheme backed by the United States Agency for International Development  USAID  that helped Leon are in jeopardy after U S  President Donald Trump said he will end Washington s aid to Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras  He has accused the Central American countries of failing to halt an influx of migrants to the United States Leon fears an aid cutoff would make it harder for farmers to survive in villages around the small indigenous Mayan town of Santa Maria Chiquimula  in Guatemala s western highlands  which is suffering deforestation and low rainfall  Here  there s no money to invest in materials  in what s needed   he said   If there were more opportunities for work here  there would be no need to go to the United States  For decades  hundreds of programs throughout Central America have worked to slow the steady outflow

stopped the overall rise of migration  proponents of international aid say the situation would be worse without them and that the United States should invest more  not less U S  assistance expanded under former President Barack Obama  whose administration sought to tackle root causes of immigration  In his last full fiscal year in office  funds appropriated for Central America hit a high of  754 million That aid has steadily decreased under Trump  however  to  700 million  535 million pounds  the first year and to  627 million in 2018 Leon  who grows hundreds of pine tree seedlings in a greenhouse equipped with a sprinkler based irrigation system  both donated by USAID  said the number of families he knew living off the dry hillside more than doubled to 40 as a result of the programme  which ran from 2014 to 2017 Local project organizers say they still receive bare bones U S  funding to organise training  but are lobbying for more in order to buy storage tanks and tubing to bring water from a nearby river The Mayan people suffer some of the highest poverty rates in Latin America  Guatemala s paltry tax take and low public investment have contributed to worsening social indicators Sebastian Charchalac  an agricultural engineer who helped lead the climate change programme  lamented that its funding evaporated after Trump took office  saying it could have been extended to additional locations  The results are still very good  because they rooted people to their communities   he said While data is not clear on which projects have been affected by the change in government  the Trump administration has signalled a desire to shift funding away from economic aid and climate change oriented programs  in favour of security and policing USAID did not respond to a question about why funding was reduced for the Santa Maria programme  Instead  it said it was evaluating the impact of Trump s directive to end fiscal year 2017 foreign assistance funding  Approximately  450 million in 2018 funds would be affected  they said It is also unclear how much funding Trump can cut off without the support of Congress Rachael Shenyo  a former USAID coordinator in Guatemala who now runs climate change programs funded by non profit groups and the private sector  said further reductions in U S  assistance would create an opportunity for China Since 2017  El Salvador  Panama and the Dominican Republic have all forged closer ties with Beijing  Washington s strategic rival  China has been increasing its presence more or less across Latin America  You re going to see a lot more investment   Shenyo said              SELF SUFFICIENCY        Critics of foreign aid say it is not always effective  or helps only small numbers of people  while sometimes acting as a political tool and forcing an underdeveloped country to become dependent on a stronger one In El Salvador  where migration has been shrinking along with the homicide rate  President Elect Nayib Bukele said he welcomes funding  but that he wants the country to ultimately stop relying on outside help  We Salvadorans should be self sufficient   he told reporters this week   It s somewhat a sense of low self esteem to think that we can t get ahead without humanitarian aid  U S  help in El Salvador includes training police and developing strategy  Ever Manzano  the country s police spokesman  said he did not think Trump s vow to cut aid would materialise  They have a lot of interest and have had a big presence  substantial investment  and excellent relations with the police force   he said U S  Representative Eliot Engel  the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee  said ending aid would make it harder for Trump to crack down on gangs and crime During a visit last week to El Salvador  he visited a programme that teaches software coding to teens to steer them from crime  and an FBI backed anti gang project  We re cutting off our nose to spite our face  The very things  Trump s  complaining about  will make it tougher for us to do   said Engel   Reporting by Daina Beth Solomon in Mexico City  additional reporting by Milton

ST PETERSBURG MOSCOW   Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday commented for the first time on Special Counsel Robert Mueller s completed report into Russian interference in the 2016 U S  presidential election  saying Moscow had always said it would find nothing U S  Attorney General William Barr said in a summary released last month that Mueller had found no evidence of collusion between Trump s campaign and Russia in the election Putin  speaking at an Arctic forum in the Russian city of St Petersburg  said on Friday that Mueller s findings were predictable for Moscow  That it  Mueller s inquiry  would finish in that way   like a mountain giving birth to a mouse as they say   was clear to us in advance  I ve been telling you this all along   We said from the start that this infamous commission of Mr Mueller s would not find anything because nobody knows this better than us  Russia did not meddle in any elections in the United States  There was no collusion  as Mr Mueller said  between Trump and Russia   Putin said the original allegations of collusion were  complete nonsense  that had been invented for domestic U S  political consumption and as part of what he described as America s internal political struggle The U S  Attorney General told lawmakers on Tuesday that he intends to release the Mueller report to the public within a week While the Mueller report cleared Trump of colluding with Russia it did not clear Moscow of trying to meddle in the 2016 vote  U S  intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia did interfere  with a campaign of email hacking and online propaganda aimed at sowing discord When asked at the same event whether he wanted to see Trump re elected next year  Putin declined to express a view  citing a long list of disagreements with the Trump administration and saying that the question of Trump s possible re election was purely a matter for the American people But Putin  who has praised Trump in the past  said he hoped Moscow and Washington would be able to work together to try to resolve their many differences on the international stage once what he described as the U S  political crisis was over Putin in July last year said he had wanted Trump to win the 2016 U S  presidential election because Trump had spoken of wanting to repair U S  Russia relations Overshadowed by the Mueller report and disagreements over everything from Syria to Ukraine  relations between Russia and the United States have in fact got worse under Trump    Additional reporting by Maria Tsvetkova  Writing by Andrew Osborn  Editing by Christian Lowe  

LONDON   An end to austerity in Britain does not mean all government departments will see their budgets keep pace with inflation  Conservative finance minister Philip Hammond said on Friday Last year Hammond announced that years of self enforced thrift over government spending was coming to an end  a claim parliament s Treasury Committee criticised as  imprecise  and lacking in detail On Friday he spelled out more about what an end to austerity would mean for a multi year review of government spending due towards the end of the year alongside his annual budget  All Spending Reviews are about prioritisation and efficiency  and it would be odd to define ending austerity as meaning that every department sees an annual real terms increase in its budget   Hammond said in a letter to the chair of the Treasury Committee  Nicky Morgan Day to day spending on public services was likely to rise 1 2 percent a year above inflation over the coming years  compared with an average real terms fall of 1 3 percent a year between 2015 and 2020  and double that in the five years before The last spending review before the financial crisis  conducted by a Labour government in 2007  envisaged real terms cuts to spending on foreign affairs  justice  and the administration of pensions and social benefits  Delivering faster job growth  a higher minimum wage and lower income tax bills for many workers also counted towards ending austerity  Hammond added Morgan said Hammond s comment was  noteworthy  Britain s budget deficit looks on track to drop to its lowest since 2001 02 at just over 1 percent of national income in the 2018 19 financial year that has just ended  down from 10 percent just after the global financial crisis in 2009 10 Last month  Hammond said he could free billions of pounds for extra public spending or tax cuts  as long as parliament resolves its Brexit impasse Britain could ask the European Union for a long Brexit delay next week if crisis talks between Prime Minister Theresa May s government and the opposition Labour Party fail to find a way out of the impasse over the divorce from the European Union It is nearly three years since the United Kingdom shocked the world by voting 52 percent to 48 to leave the bloc  Supporters of Brexit fear betrayal and opponents are pushing for another referendum Hammond last month repeated his forecast that there would be a Brexit deal  dividend  as companies regained confidence  despite criticism from the Treasury Committee over his use of the phrase   Editing by David Milliken

On April 17  roughly 193 million Indonesians will cast their votes to elect representatives to the national parliament  provincial and district legislatures  and directly elect the president President Joko Widodo is running with the senior Islamic cleric Mar uf Amin  A coalition of nine parties representing more than half of the current House of Representatives is backing Mr  Joko  He is campaigning on his achievements in office  particularly infrastructure development  welfare benefits  economic competitiveness and bureaucratic reform Mr  Joko is being challenged by Prabowo Subianto  a former special forces commander and head of the Great Indonesia Movement Party  Four parties  controlling almost 40 percent of the seats in the House  are backing Mr  Prabowo s run with the former fund manager Sandiaga Uno Mr  Prabowo has a controversial military record  from human rights abuses to behaving outside the chain of command  and a combustible personality  and emphasizes  strong leadership  and economic populism in his campaigns  During the last presidential debate  he went on a boisterous tirade about the country s weaknesses  rather than countering Mr  Widodo s vague proposals with specific ideas  When questioned about his lack of trust in Tentara Nasional Indonesia  the Indonesian military  also known as T N I   Mr  Prabowo loudly claimed  I am more T N I  than many within T N I  More telling is Mr  Prabowo s party s manifesto  which seeks a return to Indonesia s 1945 Constitution   a move that would abolish direct elections  remove presidential term limits and  correct liberal democracy  in Indonesia  His party also seeks to eliminate the distinction between defense and security   in an echo of the authoritarian regime of his father in law  former President Suharto   which could be used to justify the military s omnipresence  The current distinction that led to the separation of the police from the military was hard fought during the democratic reform This is partly why analysts see the role of the Indonesian military  sidelined after the end of Mr  Suharto s authoritarian order in 1998  as one of the key stakes in the election  There are growing concerns that whoever wins  the military will make a comeback  Mr  Joko s tolerance if not appeasement of the military s growing public role has added to these fears  During his term in office  the Indonesian military reinserted itself into nonmilitary policies  such as counterterrorism  antidrug campaigns and civic action programs  Research by the Jakarta based Centre for Strategic and International Studies  where I work  shows that between 2014 and 2017  the military and defense ministry signed 133 deals with ministries  social organizations and universities on various programs  from basic military training to rural development projects Mr  Joko also appointed retired generals as his chief of staff  defense minister and two coordinating ministers  He recently wanted to send more active duty officers to civilian agencies and ministries to provide  temporary jobs  to hundreds of colonels and dozens of generals currently without billets Mr  Joko is not seeking to actively bring back the military to dominate the government  but he lacks the political capital  interest and experience to closely manage the military  He prefers to leave its management to his closest advisers   mostly retired generals   and to the military leadership A former furniture businessman who became the mayor of Solo  a city in central Java  and governor of Jakarta  Mr  Joko neither held a national position nor hailed from the military backed Suharto establishment  But his qualities as an  outsider  candidate have also been his undoing as president  Without his own strong political machine and network  and having to balance a fragile coalition of parties  Mr  Joko relied on the support of the security establishment The Indonesian military   one of the most popular institutions in the country   retains a territorial command structure that parallels civilian governments from the national level down to the villages  The military s public support goes a long way in governing the country Mr  Joko has largely allowed the military leadership to protect its corporate interests   from arms spending to autonomy over organizational policies   even as it encroaches on the civilian public domain The new generation of Indonesian military officers who rose through the ranks in the 1990s and 2000s privately disapprove of Mr  Suharto s New Order style expansive political presence  As junior officers at the forefront of the New Order in the late 1980s and early 1990s  they were often castigated by members of the public for every government failure  which they detested Yet the Indonesian military continues to struggle with organizational challenges going back to the democratic transition in 1998  Back then  the military was plagued with internal rivalry  sluggish organizational procedures and antiquated arms  Thousands of officers previously assigned to nonmilitary posts such as district chiefs or local parliamentarians had to compete for scarce military positions  As a consequence  the officer corps has been suffering from a lack of professional growth for over a decade  Hundreds of serving colonels and dozens of generals had to wait for years for their billets  exacerbating internal tension and rivalry But rather than overhauling the military s internal institutions   from doctrinal precepts to personnel management and education and training   to meet the new realities  successive administrations focused on depoliticizing the military and compensating its loss of power with arms modernization and budgetary increases Without effective guidance and control from Mr  Joko  the military s solution to its professional mobility was to expand its nonmilitary roles  albeit within the limits of existing laws  The recent growth in the military s public role reflects President Joko s passive tolerance and the military s efforts to redefine its post authoritarian role and address internal challenges Whoever wins the election  the Indonesian military will not disappear from the political scene but its role will be sharply different from one administration to another If Mr  Joko wins  his passive tolerance of the military will continue and the civilian leadership will not drive defense policy  The military will encroach on civilian domains but it won t bring back the New Order and end democracy  There will be democratic debates  freedom to criticize both Mr  Joko and the military  and pushbacks when civil rights are threatened The same cannot be said of Mr  Prabowo  who is more likely to overturn democratic foundations and promote the military as the backbone of a strong leadership  He is likely to entertain the idea of bringing back a New Order style military rule  even though many within the military may disagree  If that happens  we should see more civil military conflicts and political instability in the years to come Evan A  Laksmana is a senior researcher at the Centre for Strategic and

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  The news last month that only seven black students were offered seats at Stuyvesant High School  New York City s most selective public high school  incited a national uproar about merit  race and class in education This week  officials said the percentage of black and Hispanic students at the school would increase   though only by a tiny amount   as the city makes use of a program that exploits a loophole in the admissions process for the elite schools But even the modest change has ignited a new debate  with the program turning into an unexpected flash point in the discussion over affirmative action Admissions into the city s eight specialized high schools are dictated by a standardized test protected by state law  The fate of that exam has become one of the most divisive issues in city politics  making it difficult for Mayor Bill de Blasio to adopt even minor changes to the admissions process  The battle now includes the program Discovery  which was designed in the 1970s to help funnel more low income students  including black and Hispanic children  into elite schools  The fight over Discovery has thrust New York City into the middle of a debate that is playing out at private universities across the country  including Harvard  over whether admissions policies aimed at enrolling more black and Hispanic students in elite schools discriminate against Asian Americans  Opponents  led by the Pacific Legal Foundation  a prominent libertarian law firm that has challenged affirmative action policies  claim that the expansion of Discovery violates the Constitution s equal protection clause because it could prevent some Asian American students from being admitted into the specialized schools  John C  Yoo  a member of Pacific Legal Foundation s board and a former official in the George W  Bush administration  said in February that an expanded Discovery program could be a tipping point for efforts to boost diversity in admissions across the country  If the courts allow New York to get away with this  it will be open season on the use of race in every school district in the country   he said at an event at the Harvard Club of New York City   The bureaucrats who run these school districts have swallowed hook  line and sinker the idea of racial diversity  as an essential part of education in America  added Mr  Yoo  who is best known as the legal architect of Mr  Bush s so called torture memos Mr  de Blasio s administration and critics of the admissions process have pointed out how minimally the program changes demographics at schools  even though the city expanded Discovery this year as part of a broader plan to diversify them  Under Discovery  students from low income families who barely miss the cutoff score for admission take summer classes to prepare for the schools   We re using every tool at our disposal to increase diversity at the specialized high schools  but despite the incremental progress we re making through the Discovery program  the status quo remains the same   schools chancellor Richard A  Carranza said  Now that opponents of affirmative action have set their sights on Discovery  civil rights groups  including the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union  have joined the city s legal fight to defend the program on behalf of black and Hispanic students  The city s new policies are not nearly enough to dismantle the unacceptably stark racial disparities in these schools   said Rachel Kleinman  a senior counsel at the Legal Defense Fund   But it s a first step that must be first fiercely defended and then further expanded upon  New data released Wednesday laid bare how little an expanded Discovery program will diversify the specialized schools  The number of seats reserved for students who gain entry through Discovery doubled to 500 this year  from about 250 seats last year  across the eight specialized schools  Black and Hispanic students received about 100 more Discovery offers compared to last year Under the expanded Discovery program  the total number of offers for black and Hispanic students for the eight specialized schools will creep up to 14 percent from about 10 percent  and will increase to about 16 percent next year when the growth of the program is complete  Asian American students are benefiting most from Discovery  which makes the program a curious target for those who believe it discriminates against Asian Americans  who now make up a majority of the student body at the schools  Asian American students received about 54 percent of total Discovery offers this year  up from 43 percent last year  Roughly 6 percent of the schools  freshman classes were filled by Discovery students last year  under the mayor s plan  each school will be required to reserve 20 percent of its seats for students in Discovery by next year  Discovery s numbers will likely change before July  when students enter classes  because some may accept offers at other public and private high schools or move out of the city The program is one of the few parts of the specialized school admissions process that the city actually controls  which is likely why the decades old program has gotten recent attention Mr  de Blasio s plan to scrap the admissions exam  which must be approved by the State Legislature  and create a new system that enrolls the top performers at each city middle school into elite high schools has been met with a fierce backlash  Alumni say it would water down the schools  quality and Asian American parents argue the plan is biased against their children The city has projected that eliminating the exam would transform the specialized schools  demographics from about 10 percent black and Hispanic to about 45 percent  and an independent analysis found that offers to Asian American students would drop from about 60 percent to 30 percent The schools  alumni organizations  which have strong ties to state politicians  generally support Discovery as a way to integrate the schools without eliminating the exam While the mayor s plan to eliminate the test appears all but dead in Albany  the battle over Discovery is ongoing  Earlier this year  a federal judge in Manhattan denied Pacific Legal s request for a preliminary injunction against the expansion of Discovery  setting up a longer battle over the program  It is not likely that the Discovery program changes were motivated by discrimination   the judge wrote in his opinion  and the plaintiffs were therefore  not likely to succeed on their equal protection claim  Challengers of Affirmative Action Have a New Target  New York City s Elite High SchoolsDec  14  2018Only 7 Black Students Got Into Stuyvesant  N Y  s Most Selective High School  Out of 895 SpotsMarch 18  2019

ALBANY  N Y    The Environmental Protection Agency declined for now to make General Electric restart dredging in the Hudson River  triggering a wave of condemnation Thursday from New York officials and environmentalists who say contaminant levels from its industrial pollution remain too high The EPA issued a certificate to Boston based GE saying that it has completed its remedial action under the federal Superfund program  Critics of the cleanup wanted the EPA to withhold the certificate and to demand further dredging  EPA Regional Administrator Peter Lopez said more time and testing are needed to fully assess the  1 7 billion cleanup that GE has done  and he stressed that the company can still be compelled in the coming decades to do more work  including additional dredging  GE is not off the hook   Lopez told reporters during a conference call   If new information comes in that causes EPA to conclude that more work is needed to protect public health and the environment  we can and will require GE to take that action  Gov  Andrew Cuomo and state Attorney General Letitia James  both Democrats  promptly announced they intend to sue the EPA over its decision  They claim levels of the contaminating polychlorinated biphenyls  or PCBs  remain unacceptably high in the river sediment and in fish  Scenic Hudson and Riverkeeper  two environmental groups lobbying for additional dredging  said they would support litigation  Since the EPA has failed to hold GE accountable for fulfilling its obligation to restore the river  New York state will take any action necessary to protect our waterways and that includes suing the EPA to demand a full and complete remediation    Cuomo said in a written news release   Anything less is unacceptable  Cuomo accused the Republican Trump Administration of putting corporations  interests ahead of public health and the environment  EPA officials said their decision was guided by Superfund law and science The EPA said in a  five year review  of the river released Friday that there is not enough testing data on fish  water and sediment yet to determine if the cleanup will succeed in its goal of protecting human health and the environment  Lopez said that will take more time and monitoring before a conclusion could be reached The review found some signs of progress in removing highly contaminated sediment  though it found three spots in the upper river with slightly elevated levels of PCBs Until the mid 1970s  GE factories discharged more than 1 million pounds  450 000 kilograms  of PCBs into the river  The probable carcinogen  used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment  was banned in 1977 GE said the EPA s decision confirms the success of the project  GE will continue to collect environmental data to assess ongoing improvements in river conditions and to work closely with EPA  New York State  and local communities on other Hudson environmental projects   the company said in a written statement  

CALEXICO  Calif    President Trump traveled to this small border town two hours east of San Diego on Friday to highlight what he and his aides say is an out of control crisis caused by a surge of Central American families who have overwhelmed law enforcement facilities at the border Just a day after retreating from his threat to shut down the entire border with Mexico  Mr  Trump accepted a plaque from border agents and sheriffs in front of a 30 foot tall section of border wall   the physical embodiment of his immigration agenda   and met with border officials  lawmakers and administration officials at the Border Patrol station here  We re really making progress at letting people know this is an emergency   the president said   It s a colossal surge and it s overwhelming our immigration system and we can t let that happen  Critics argue that the wall is not a solution to the surge of families that have arrived in recent months since most of the families are not trying to sneak into the country undetected  On the contrary  most are seeking Border Patrol agents to turn themselves in  either at the ports of entry or between them But Mr  Trump insisted on Friday that his efforts to seal off the border from undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers was necessary because  we don t have room  That means you can t take  em   I don t think anyone has ever expressed it like that but I am expressing it like that   Mr  Trump added   When it s full  it s full  Asked on Thursday night why the president was not using the national emergency he recently declared to seek funds to provide humanitarian relief to the families who have been apprehended recently  Kirstjen Nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  conceded that the focus on the wall is  partly  a stunt  Well  I think part of that is just a   it s an optic   she told Chris Cuomo  the host of  Cuomo Prime Time  on CNN   To have the president stand in front of the wall indicates immediately to any viewer that he s at the border  But I think his message will be about the dual crisis and how we need Congress to act  to give us the authorities to address  Mr  Trump  however  hailed what he called the  tremendous impact  of the wall in Calexico and said that his administration expected to build 400 miles  worth of wall in the next two years In fact  the small section of wall that Mr  Trump stood in front of   next to a field of solar panels   is not evidence that the president is building the wall he repeatedly called for during his 2016 presidential campaign but merely an upgrade to an existing section of fencing  The two mile section was completed in October  Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Weeks after declaring a national emergency at the border because Congress refused to fund construction of his border wall  Mr  Trump recently threatened to close the legal ports of entry between Mexico and the United States   potentially disrupting billions of dollars  worth of trade and halting the travel of a half million people each day But on the eve of his trip here  Mr  Trump backed down in the face of hard criticism from the business community and top officials in his own party  Senator Mitch McConnell  the Republican leader  predicted that a complete border shutdown would have a  potentially catastrophic economic impact  on the country Mr  Trump responded on Thursday by initially saying he would give Mexico a year to stop Central American migrants from traversing Mexico on their way to the United States  He added that if Mexico did not do its part  he would first impose tariffs on Mexican cars before shutting down the border Later in the day  Mr  Trump denied that he had put off a border shutdown for a year  saying that it could still happen if he decided that Mexico was not doing enough to keep migrants from traveling to the United States  We ll start with the tariffs and see what happens   he said In his visit here  Mr  Trump thanked Mexico for deporting migrants at its southern border  which he said  they have never done before  in three decades  and suggested he had delayed closing the border because of their heightened efforts But it is false that Mexico only recently began enforcing its southern border at Mr  Trump s urging  according to data  experts and the Mexican government  Marcelo Ebrard  Mexico s foreign minister  told reporters on Tuesday that Mexico had been consistent in its immigration policies It deported 40 000 to 190 000 migrants every year from 2011 to 2016  data from Segob  Mexico s internal affairs agency  shows  In 2016  Mexico deported nearly 150 000 migrants from Honduras  El Salvador and Guatemala compared with 107 000 deportations of migrants from those three countries in 2018  In the first two months of 2019  Mexico deported more than 13 000 migrants from the countries Contrary to Mr  Trump s repeated claims this week  Mexico s immigration laws are not harsher or  stronger  than the United States  illegal crossing are decriminalized in Mexico and considered a minor offense  Experts said they were not aware of any changes in the laws or enforcement practices  On the contrary  the discourse of President López Obrador has been more humanitarian than that of the former president  granting work permits and making efforts to find last minute shelters   said Karla A  Valenzuela  a professor at Ibero American University in Mexico City who specializes in migration Dr  Valenzuela said an uptick in detentions and removals in recent weeks was not necessarily indicative of intensified enforcement  but rather more linked to increased flows from Central America Meanwhile  the president s re election campaign released a video on Friday blasting Democrats for their position on the border  a clear indication that Mr  Trump intends to use the issue of border security for his political benefit  no matter the facts on the ground The video shows leading Democratic presidential candidates  including Beto O Rourke  Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren  mocking the idea of a wall at the border  We do not need any walls   Mr  O Rourke is shown saying  The headline in the video says  bluntly   Democrats do not want to keep Americans safe  and adds   It s time for Democrats to stop playing political games with national security  A response from the Democratic National Committee assailed the president s visit as nothing more than a photo opportunity  to try and build nonexistent support for his unnecessary and ineffective border wall   Instead of doing anything to address the issues that matter most to the people of Calexico  Trump is actually making things worse   the committee said

MEXICO CITY   Mexico s efforts to calm critics of its newly formed National Guard received a boost Tuesday in the form of an agreement from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist in the force s training High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet said that her office will offer technical assistance to ensure that Mexico s new security force respects human rights  Experience shows us that you can t have security without full respect for human rights and you can t enjoy human rights without security   Bachelet said U N  human rights experts had been outspoken in their criticism of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador s efforts to reform the constitution to give the military a formal role in the country s policing  He eventually agreed to place the National Guard under the civilian public safety minister  but has insisted that it will be led by an active duty military officer López Obrador said he will name the force s commander Thursday  It will initially be made up of military police from the army and navy  as well as some federal police  but recruitment is underway Mexico is coming off its most murderous year in at least the past 20  Previous administrations used the army and marines to combat the drug cartels in many parts of the country after determining that local police forces were hopelessly corrupt  Human rights abuses ensued by soldiers not trained for police work  from torture to extrajudicial killings López Obrador took office in December ready to scrap the Federal Police  which he said never came together as expected and replace it with the National Guard  The leftist president has lavished praise on Mexico s military  surprising some  insisting that only the military has the necessary discipline and respect of the public to get a handle on the country s internal security  We are going to carry out this change to guarantee security without violating human rights   López Obrador said   We want Mexico to open to international observation  Bachelet sidestepped questions about the essentially militarized nature of the new National Guard  whose officers will apparently be given military training and be under military discipline Bachelet said  the creation of the National Guard could open the opportunity to create a new civilian police force capable of fighting the overwhelming challenge of organized crime   without explaining how Bachelet called Mexico s crime numbers  terrifying   noting  Mexico has numbers of violent deaths worthy of a nation at war  252 538 since 2006  She also mentioned the murders of nine human rights activists and four journalists so far in 2019  coming on top of a dozen journalists murdered each year in 2018 and 2017 Bachelet said the U N  would be willing to help Mexico integrate its forensic files on the country s 40 000 missing people  and strengthen its capacity to find clandestine graves and identify bodies

WASHINGTON   China s lengthy approval process for genetically modified crops remains a sticking point in talks to end the trade war between China and the United States  according to two sources with knowledge of the talks Beijing has taken years to approve new strains of GM crops  which U S  companies and farmers have complained stalls trade by restricting the sales of new products from companies such as DowDuPont Inc  Bayer AG  and Syngenta AG  The issue is one of a host of U S  complaints that the administration of President Donald Trump is demanding China address if it wants to end trade disputes that have cost both countries billions of dollars and slowed the global economy Trump on Thursday said the two sides were getting very close to a deal that could be announced in about four weeks  though there were still differences to be bridged GM crops and the approval process are still a  big issue  in the discussions  said one of the sources  who spoke on condition of anonymity  The issue has been a source of tension between the two countries for years  China is the biggest buyer of U S  soybeans  the bulk of which are genetically modified  If it does not approve new strains  then farmers in the United States cannot plant them because China may reject shipments that include them Seed companies cannot fully commercialise sales of new strains without those approvals  The two sides had appeared to make some progress on the issue in January  when China approved a handful of GMO crops for import  They were the first in about 18 months  The move did not address the core U S  concerns over delays to the process A spokeswoman from the Office of the U S  Trade Representative  who is leading the Washington team in the discussions  did not respond immediately to request for confirmation or comment China s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not immediately respond to faxed questions on Friday  which was a public holiday in China It is unclear what differences on the issue remain  The United States wants China to accelerate its approval process and make it more similar to Washington s Beijing allows imports of GMO soybeans and corn for use in animal feed  even though it does not permit planting of them China bought about 60 percent of U S  soy exports  worth about  12 billion  before the ongoing U S  China trade war and could reject shipments of unapproved varieties Beijing promised to speed up its review of applications during previous trade talks with the United States in 2017  In the past  Beijing has held back approvals of imported GMO products amid concerns about anti GMO sentiment in China The trade deal  should it be agreed  is expected to include a six year time frame for purchases of more than  1 trillion in U S  goods  including commodity products   Reporting by Chris Prentice in Washington  Additional reporting by Tom Polansek in Chicago and Andrew Galbraith in Shanghai  Editing by Simon Webb and Grant McCool  

WASHINGTON   The Democratic led U S  House of Representatives is set to vote on Tuesday on a bill to reinstate landmark net neutrality rules repealed by the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  under President Donald Trump Republicans oppose the effort arguing it would grant the FCC too much authority over the internet and deter private sector investment The bill mirrors an effort last year to reverse the FCC s December 2017 order approved on a 3 2 vote that repealed Obama era rules barring providers from blocking or slowing internet content or offering paid  fast lanes  The reversal of net neutrality rules was a win for internet providers such as Comcast Corp  AT T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc  but opposed by companies like Facebook Inc  Amazon com Inc and Alphabet Inc Late on Monday  the White House told Congress that if the bill were approved Trump s advisers would recommend he veto it  The White House  strongly opposes  the measure that would  return to the heavy handed regulatory approach of the previous administration   it said in a statement The bill would repeal the order introduced by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  bar the FCC from reinstating it or a substantially similar order and reinstate the 2015 net neutrality order  Representative Mike Doyle  a Democrat  noted polls suggest most Americans back net neutrality  The bill  he said   would restore popular  bipartisan  common sense net neutrality protections  and put a cop back on the beat to protect consumers  small businesses  and competitors from unjust and unreasonable practices  by internet providers Pai  who expressed regret last month about how much attention the net neutrality debate has consumed  suggested restoring FCC oversight would lead to an internet  that works as quickly as your DMV  that runs as reliably as Amtrak and ultimately is as popular as your post office  House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy dubbed the effort the  Democrats plan to take over the internet  and suggested the FCC could impose new taxes on internet service like telephone and cable bills The FCC in 2015 in reclassifying internet service said it had significant oversight authority  including the ability to set rates for internet service  but said it was opting not to use it Gigi Sohn  a former senior aide to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler  who ran the agency when the net neutrality rules were adopted  said the rules ensure  internet users  not broadband providers  decide winners and losers on the Internet  The Senate  which is controlled by Republicans  voted in May 2018 to reinstate the rules  but the House did not take up the issue before Congress adjourned  It is unclear if proponents will be able to force a vote in the Senate   Reporting by David Shepardson  Editing by Susan Thomas and Tom Brown

SAN ANTONIO   President Trump used the backdrop of a Texas fund raiser on Wednesday to warn of the dangers and tragedy of migrants flowing across the Mexican border   an issue he predicted would play well for him in his 2020 re election campaign With high dollar donors standing behind him  Mr  Trump said migrants pouring across the southwestern border were dying in great numbers while gang members arriving from Central America were marauding and threatening American ranchers  And he made clear that he was going to try to put the blame on Democrats  I think they re going to pay a very big price in 2020   Mr  Trump said here  before heading to Houston for another fund raiser   I think the border is going to be an incredible issue  And they re on the wrong side  They want to have open borders  But Julián Castro  the former mayor of San Antonio and a Democratic candidate for president  fired back at Mr  Trump  accusing him of using such talk as a political tool to energize his voters with dark threats about immigrants  It was predictable that he would start beating the drum of this again as he gets closer to re election   Mr  Castro said in an interview   What I ve noticed is that any time he gets into political hot water  he goes back to the issue of immigration to drum up support  Mr  Castro  who served as housing secretary in the Obama administration  is uniquely positioned to take on Mr  Trump on the immigration issue  The grandson of a Mexican immigrant  he is the only Latino candidate in the race for the Democratic nomination As the sun set Wednesday evening  Mr  Castro held an immigration focused rally of his own in San Antonio  His campaign had billed the event as an opportunity for the city  with its significant Mexican American population  to show its resistance to Mr  Trump s immigration policy Before a modest crowd  Mr  Castro denounced Mr  Trump s anti immigrant message in no uncertain terms  calling the president s policies  downright stupid   When it comes to immigration   Mr  Castro said   this president and his policies have been an absolute failure for our country  The president s decision to weigh in on the border was a clear signal that he did not intend to let the issue fade  At the fund raiser  he told reporters that he wanted to call attention to a situation that he said has been ignored in the news media  the plight of migrants who cross illegally into the United States and then die of thirst or hunger  This doesn t come out in the fake news   Mr  Trump said as he recounted the stories about migrants that about a dozen donors told him  At Mr  Trump s urging  several of the donors described finding the bodies of migrants   including pregnant women and children   in the vast brush of their property The president said he had never heard such stories of migrants dying  even from his top immigration and border patrol officials  In fact  immigrant advocates have for years documented the grim fate of some migrants who grow sick and die trying to make it into the United States  The advocates say Mr  Trump s policies have made the problem worse by limiting the number of migrants who can legally claim asylum at ports of entry  pushing more to cross at remote areas of the border ImageJulián Castro  the former secretary of housing and urban development  declared his candidacy for president in San Antonio in January  He has planned a rally Wednesday as Mr  Trump visits Texas CreditIlana Panich Linsman for The New York TimesSeveral of the donors also told of how afraid they had felt when migrants from Central America  dressed in black  turned up at their homes  Dangerous people are coming here  and the good people are dying   Mr  Trump said  adding that the donors had all told him that the answer to the problem was to build the wall that has become the symbol of his approach to immigration The president  who was joined at the round table with donors by Brad Parscale  his 2020 campaign manager  denied that the unscheduled remarks to reporters about the border were part of a campaign message  But immigration and border security has been a defining issue of his presidency  And Mr  Trump is betting that portraying the crisis that he says now exists on the Mexican border will be just as effective in his re election campaign as the issue was in 2016 In the past several days  Mr  Trump has forced out Kirstjen Nielsen  his homeland security secretary  and several other top immigration officials for being too timid about shutting down the border and changing asylum rules to deny entry to migrants seeking protection in the United States One of those officials  Ronald D  Vitiello  the acting chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  resigned on Wednesday after Mr  Trump pulled back his nomination for the permanent position  saying he wanted someone tougher  In a statement issued on her last day in office  Ms  Nielsen called Mr  Vitiello  an unwavering advocate for the dedicated men and women who enforce our immigration laws  A top administration official said Tuesday that the staffing changes were meant to make way for more aggressive immigration actions  Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  But the president faces challenges of his own  His campaign promises have mostly gone unfulfilled  He has largely failed to build the  big beautiful wall  along the southwestern border as he promised  And the recent surge of migrant families from Central America is a vivid demonstration of his inability to stop what he has called an  invasion  There was also significant evidence during the 2018 midterm elections that the president s immigration attacks backfired in some Republican districts around the country  For example  several House Republicans  including some of the party s leaders in Congress  complained to Mr  Trump that his announcement right before the election that he was considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship might have cost several moderate Republicans their seats And as he sets out for the re election campaign  Mr  Trump is certain to face several challengers among the Democrats who are determined to make the president s immigration agenda a key part of their reason for running  In February  Beto O Rourke  a former congressman from El Paso who has since declared his own candidacy for president  outlined his opposition to Mr  Trump s immigration policies at a rally held at the same time the president spoke in that Texas border city  We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls   Mr  O Rourke told supporters even as Mr  Trump was pressing to  finish the wall  The dual candidacies of Mr  Castro and Mr  O Rourke are almost certain to place Texas squarely at the center of the increasingly heated immigration debate  Texas is a Latino state  and we have two Texans on the ballot who are going to be turning out and galvanizing people from Texas   said Mayra Macias  a vice president of the Latino Victory Project   But it s also helping galvanize people  Latinos in particular  across the country because they are seeing these candidates talk about issues that affect us  But if immigration is at once a key campaign issue in Texas and other states  including California and Arizona  Republicans are betting that Mr  Trump s anti immigrant message will also resonate far from the border  

 Reuters    Attorney General William Barr has provided only a glimpse of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report on the inquiry into Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election  with many details expected to emerge when the document is finally released Barr on March 24 sent a four page letter to lawmakers detailing Mueller s  principal conclusions  including that the 22 month probe did not establish that President Donald Trump s 2016 campaign team conspired with Russia  Barr said he found insufficient evidence in Mueller s report to conclude that Trump committed obstruction of justice  though the special counsel did not make a formal finding one way or the other on that The attorney general has pledged to release the nearly 400 page report by mid April  but has said portions will be blacked out to protect certain types of sensitive information Here are five things to look for when the report is issued OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE  WHY NO EXONERATION Perhaps the biggest political risk for Trump is the special counsel s supporting evidence behind Mueller s assertion that while the report does not conclude the Republican president committed the crime of obstruction of justice it  also does not exonerate him  on that point According to Barr s March 24 letter  Mueller has presented evidence on both sides of the question without concluding whether to prosecute  Barr filled that void by asserting there was no prosecutable case  But Barr s statement in the letter that  most  of Trump s actions that had raised questions about obstruction were  the subject of public reporting  suggested that some actions were not publicly known Democrats in Congress do not believe Barr  a Trump appointee  should have the final say on the matter  While the prospect that the Democratic led House of Representatives would begin the impeachment process to try to remove Trump from office appears to have receded  the House Judiciary Committee will be looking for any evidence relevant to ongoing probes into obstruction of justice  corruption and abuse of power by the president or others in the administration Barr s comment that most of what Mueller probed on obstruction has been publicly reported indicates that events like Trump s firing of James Comey as FBI director in May 2017 when the agency was heading the Russia inquiry are likely to be the focus of this section of the report RUSSIAN  INFORMATION WARFARE  AND CAMPAIGN CONTACTSThe report will detail indictments by Mueller of two Kremlin backed operations to influence the 2016 election  one against a St  Petersburg based troll farm called the Internet Research Agency accused of waging  information warfare  over social media  and the other charging Russian intelligence officers with hacking into Democratic Party servers and pilfering emails leaked to hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton With those two indictments already public and bearing no apparent link to the president  the focus may be on what Mueller concluded  if anything  about other incidents that involved contacts between Russians and people in Trump s orbit  That could include the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York in which a Russian lawyer promised  dirt  on Clinton to senior campaign officials  as well as a secret January 2017 meeting in the Seychelles investigated as a possible attempt to set up a back channel between the incoming Trump administration and the Kremlin while Democrat Barack Obama was still president Any analysis of such contacts could shed light on why Mueller  according to Barr s summary   did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities  MANAFORT  UKRAINE POLICY AND POLLING DATAIn the weeks before Trump s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was sentenced in March to 7 1 2 years in prison mostly for financial crimes related to millions of dollars he was paid by pro Russia Ukrainian politicians  Mueller s team provided hints about what their pursuit of him was really about Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told a judge in February that an Aug  2  2016 meeting between Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik  a consultant Mueller has said has ties to Russian intelligence   went to the heart of  the special counsel s investigation The meeting included a discussion about a proposal to resolve the conflict in Ukraine in terms favorable to the Kremlin  an issue that has damaged Russia s relations with the West  Prosecutors also said Manafort shared Trump campaign polling data with Kilimnik  although the significance of that act remains unclear  One focus will be on what Mueller ultimately concluded about Manafort s interactions with Kilimnik and whether a failed attempt to secure cooperation from Manafort  who was found by a judge to have lied to prosecutors in breach of a plea agreement  significantly impeded the special counsel s work NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNSWhile Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy with Russia  according to Barr  there is a chance the report will detail behavior and financial entanglements that give fodder to critics who have said Trump has shown a pattern of deference to the Kremlin One example of such an entanglement was the proposal to build a Trump tower in Moscow  a deal potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars that never materialized  Michael Cohen  Trump s former personal lawyer  admitted to lying to Congress about the project to provide cover because Trump on the campaign trail had denied any dealings with Russia In the absence of criminal charges arising from Mueller s inquiry  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has shifted his focus to whether Trump is  compromised  by such entanglements  influencing his policy decisions and posing a risk to national security Some legal experts have said the counterintelligence probe Mueller inherited from Comey may prove more significant than his criminal inquiry  though it is not clear to what degree counterintelligence findings will be included in the report  Barr also has said he planned to redact material related to intelligence gathering sources and methods MIDDLE EAST INFLUENCE AND OTHER PROBESAnother focus is whether Mueller will disclose anything from his inquiries into Middle Eastern efforts to influence Trump One mystery is what  if anything  came of the special counsel s questioning of George Nader  a Lebanese American businessman and consultant to the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia who started cooperating with Mueller last year Nader attended the Seychelles meeting  He also was present at a Trump Tower meeting in August 2016  three months before the election  at which an Israeli social media specialist spoke with the president s son  Donald Trump Jr   about how his firm Psy Group  which employed several former Israeli intelligence officers  could help the Trump campaign  according to the New York Times  Mueller s interest in Nader suggested the special counsel looked into whether additional countries sought to influence the election and whether they did so in concert with Russia A lawyer for Nader did not respond to a request for comment Barr has said he will redact from the Mueller report information on  other ongoing matters   including inquiries referred to other offices in the Justice Department  That makes it unclear if any findings related to the Middle East will appear in the report   Compiled by Nathan Layne in New York

WASHINGTON CHICAGO   The Federal Aviation Administration met for three hours on Friday with representatives from the three major U S  airlines that own now grounded Boeing 737 MAX jets and their pilots  unions to discuss two fatal crashes and the path forward More than 300 Boeing 737 MAXs have been grounded worldwide after a total of 346 people died in a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October and in an Ethiopian Airlines crash outside Addis Ababa last month American Airlines Group Inc  United Airlines and Southwest Airlines Co officials attended the meeting  where FAA Acting Administrator Dan Elwell said he wanted to know operators  and pilots  thoughts before the agency decides to return the 737 MAX to service Elwell said the meeting participants   operational perspective is critical input as the agency welcomes scrutiny on how it can do better  American said in a statement it was  confident in the direction the FAA is heading  and would continue to work collaboratively in this process Pilots from American and Southwest  the two largest U S  MAX operators  said they welcomed the meeting but noted that many issues still needed to be discussed and debated before the MAX flies again  We have to unground the confidence in this airplane   Dennis Tajer  spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association which represents American s pilots  told reporters outside FAA headquarters  We take off our watches and put the calendars in the drawer   he added  suggesting that rebuilding confidence in the aircraft could take some time American and United have removed the 737 MAX from their schedules through early June  while Southwest on Thursday extended the removal of its 34 MAX jets through Aug  5  leading to around 160 daily flight cancellations during the revised summer schedule Boeing is reprogramming software on the 737 MAX to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti stall system known as MCAS that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose down crashes The FAA said the meeting covered a review of the preliminary findings of the two crash investigations and an overview of Boeing s anticipated software enhancements and pilot training  The plane s certification and training have been questioned following a 2004 decision by Congress to allow manufacturers an expanded role in the FAA s aircraft oversight  Captain Jon Weaks  president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association  said in a letter he was concerned that this concept  may be too ingrained to reverse  and complicated by federal budget and personnel shortfalls  but called for continued scrutiny of Boeing The FAA has convened a joint review with aviation regulators from China  Europe  Canada  Brazil  Indonesia  Ethiopia and other countries Federal prosecutors  the Transportation Department inspector general s office and a blue ribbon panel are also reviewing the plane s certification  The first and most important goal of all of the entire process should be to protect the lives of our passengers and the traveling public in general   said Weaks   Reporting by David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski  Editing by Alistair Bell and Tom Brown  

COLUMBIA  S C    Federal officials this week oversaw the test at a South Carolina prison of a cellphone signal jamming technology that some hope will help combat the threat posed by inmates with smuggled cellphones  officials told The Associated Press The test took place over the course of five days in a housing unit at Broad River Correctional Institution  a maximum security prison in Columbia  South Carolina  according to Department of Justice officials  Assistant Attorney General Beth Williams told AP it s the first time federal officials have collaborated with officials at a state prison for such a test Officials did not release the results of the test  which will be included in a later report to be done by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration The test marks progress on the state level quest to stamp out contraband cellphone use  which officials have long said represents the top security threat within their institutions  Micro jamming technology was tested last year at a federal prison   where officials said they were able to shut down phone signals inside a prison cell  while devices about 20 feet  6 meters  away worked normally   but a decades old law says state or local agencies don t have the authority to jam the public airwaves South Carolina Corrections Director Bryan Stirling  who for years has spoken out on the dangers posed by the devices smuggled into institutions by the thousands  told AP he was recently deputized as a special deputy U S  Marshal  thus giving him the federal status needed to conduct the jamming test  I m very encouraged by what we witnessed at Broad River this week   Stirling told AP on Friday  adding that he s optimistic about federal legislation  introduced last month  that would give state prison officials the ability to jam signals In 2008  South Carolina officials received a waiver from the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a jamming test at a different maximum security prison  in a demonstration for media and other officials but not in a prison dorm Stirling and other state prison directors use other measures   like perimeter netting  monitoring by drone  and scanners   to detect cellphones but advocate a jamming technology that would shut down all signals as the best possible defense In 2017  Stirling testified at a FCC hearing in Washington alongside Robert Johnson  a former South Carolina corrections officer nearly killed in 2010 in a hit orchestrated by an inmate using an illegal phone Also that year  an inmate escaped from a maximum security prison in South Carolina  thanks in part to a smuggled cellphone  In 2018  seven inmates at a maximum security South Carolina prison were killed in what officials have said was a gang fight over territory and contraband including cellphones The FCC has shown willingness to work on the issue  holding a field hearing in South Carolina and hosting meetings with members of Congress  prisons officials and stakeholders from the wireless industry On Friday  Williams said officials are working to ensure prisons have technological options to help them combat the smuggled devices  It is very difficult to make sure that no contraband gets in   Williams told AP   We try as hard as we can  but it s really hard to stop everything      

WASHINGTON   The U S  Supreme Court exposed its bitter divisions over the death penalty yet again early Friday as the justices voted on ideological lines to reject an Alabama inmate s bid to delay his execution On a 5 4 vote with the court s conservatives in the majority  the court reversed two lower court decisions that delayed the execution of Christopher Price  46  for 60 days so he could proceed with his request to be executed by lethal gas instead of lethal injection It was the third time in recent weeks the court has divided 5 4 on a death penalty case  with the conservatives in the majority each time The court s order was released too late for the execution to take place  so Alabama will have to set a new execution date  State officials did not immediately respond to questions about their plans on Friday The court said in its order that Price had waited too long to pursue his claim  Justice Stephen Breyer  one of the liberal justices  called the litigation an example of arbitrary administration of the death penalty  He wrote that Price s claim failed because of a  minor oversight  by his lawyer when filing evidence to support his argument  To proceed in this way calls into question the basic principles of fairness that should underlie our criminal justice system   Breyer wrote He also noted that the justices were due to meet Friday morning and could have discussed the issue then instead of acting in the middle of the night  The three other liberal justices on the nine justice court joined Breyer s opinion Price was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993 for killing William Lynn  a minister  in his home in Bazemore  Alabama  on Dec  22  1991 as he assembled Christmas presents with his wife On Thursday  Chief U S  District Judge Kristi DuBose granted Price s attorneys the 60 day stay and gave the state until May 10 to respond to their arguments that the three drug protocol risked causing Price significant pain and that nitrogen hypoxia would reduce that risk Earlier this month  the U S  Supreme Court ruled 5 4 that the Constitution did not guarantee a condemned prisoner  a painless death   paving the way for the execution of convicted murderer Russell Bucklew  who sought to die by lethal gas rather than lethal injection because of a rare medical condition In that majority opinion  conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch took aim at the tactics of death penalty defense lawyers who frequently file last minute applications to delay executions The court in February voted 5 4 to allow the execution of a Muslim convicted murderer after Alabama denied his request to have an imam present  saying he waited too long to file his lawsuit In March  however  the court blocked the execution of a convicted murderer whose request to have his Buddhist spiritual adviser present at the execution was denied by Texas  Six executions in the United States scheduled during the first three months of 2019 have been stayed or rescheduled   Reporting by Lawrence Hurley  Editing by Scott Malone and Steve Orlofsky

CIUDAD JUÁREZ  Mexico   Near dawn on Friday  the line of trucks waiting to cross the border from Mexico into the United States stretched for more than three miles and wasn t moving Arturo Ornelas  a Mexican truck driver  was four places from the front  but his choice position had not come without sacrifice  He had joined the line at 8 a m  Thursday and had spent the intervening 22 hours slouched in   or stretching his legs alongside   his truck  carrying a load of copper wire from a factory in Ciudad Juárez  Mexico  to a warehouse in neighboring El Paso But now his goal was finally  seemingly within reach  and he could see the twinkling lights of the American city through the nearby border fence  on the other side of the Puente Libre  or Free Bridge  So close   he muttered   yet so far  President Trump may have relented Thursday on his threat to close the southwest border of the United States in punishment for what he has said was Mexico s failure to control illegal migration  But for a week now the border has  in effect  been partly closed because of American staffing shortages   costing businesses millions of dollars a day  according to industry officials  and causing painfully long delays for people and goods trying to legally cross the border Last week  the Trump administration announced it was pulling 750 border agents from their normal assignments at specific ports of entry on the border  and reassigning them to help process the surge in migrants who have been crossing the border illegally and seeking asylum The redeployments have caused slowdowns in inspections   for passenger and commercial traffic   at key crossings along the border  including between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso  Tijuana  Mexico  and San Diego  Nogales  Mexico  and Nogales  Ariz   and Nuevo Laredo  Mexico  and Laredo  Tex The delays  which began on March 29  have been particularly severe for trucks delivering commercial goods from Mexico to the United States  with long waits fouling up production and delivery schedules on both sides of the border  According to the United States Chamber of Commerce  nearly  1 7 billion in goods and services flow across the border every day Mexican trucking industry officials and other business leaders have reported millions of dollars a day in lost commerce and extra costs associated with the delays  Some companies in Mexico have been forced to slow or halt production as a result of the delivery delays  they said ImageMiguel Angel Segovia resting in his truck while waiting in a long line on Friday CreditJose Luis Gonzalez ReutersSome firms have even resorted to shipping their products by air despite the significantly higher costs  Manuel Sotelo  a national vice president of the National Chamber of Freight Transportation in Mexico  said Friday Business and labor leaders have warned that if the delays persist  they could lead to the cancellation of contracts and to widespread layoffs Mr  Sotelo summed up the impact in one word   Catastrophic  The hardship has been particularly severe in Ciudad Juárez  a border city and major industrial center with more than 300 assembly plants covering a range of industries  including auto parts  cellphones  computers and household electronics  In Danger  280 000 Factory Jobs   the front page headline of El Diario  a newspaper in the city  announced on Friday In a letter to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico on Friday  the Ciudad Juárez chapter of the Business Coordinating Council estimated that late deliveries would cost Mexican firms  2 1 million in overtime per day The council also estimated that delays for trucks crossing from Ciudad Juárez to El Paso had stretched to eight hours on average  But many truckers were reporting far longer waits Mr  Sotelo  who owns a trucking company  said that on Wednesday he dispatched 15 tractor trailers to one of the crossings between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso  When they arrived  at about 3 30 a m   there were already 200 other trucks in line  Twelve of his trucks were able to cross  barely making the cutoff at 11 p m  when the crossing closed for the night  The other three had to wait until the following day Under normal circumstances  he said  a truck can cross the border here within two hours Business leaders said the only other border crisis that approached this one in severity was provoked by the Sept  11 terrorist attacks   After that  we had waits of up to six hours during the following days   Mr  Sotelo said   Today we are three times worse  Luis Aguirre Lang  president of Index  a national manufacturing and export industry group  accused Mr  Trump of taking the Mexican and American private sectors  hostage  to put political pressure on Mexico   We are worried   he said ImageSome truck drivers waited more than 20 hours to cross CreditJose Luis Gonzalez ReutersThe Trump administration has characterized its redeployment of agents as a necessary step in dealing with an urgent crisis  especially in the region around Ciudad Juárez and El Paso  which has been in the vortex of the illegal migration debate The United States Border Patrol s El Paso sector   which covers a 268 mile stretch of border through the two westernmost counties of Texas  including El Paso  and New Mexico   has seen a huge surge in unauthorized migrants trying to cross This cause  and the resulting effects  came into sharp focus shortly after dawn on Friday for Héctor Núñez  a driver with a Mexican trucking company He and his rig were in the middle of the three mile line of trucks waiting to cross the Free Bridge into El Paso  He was killing time with a colleague outside their trucks  parked along a highway that runs along the Rio Grande  when suddenly they noticed something unfolding on the other side of the river  along the border fence At a gap in the fence  more than two dozen migrants were sitting in a row in the dirt  with several Border Patrol officials standing over them  In recent weeks  undocumented migrants  often seeking asylum in the United States  have waded across the river  barely a trickle of septic water in this location  and presented themselves to the American authorities permanently guarding the gap Mr  Núñez  54  understood that this sort of unauthorized crossing between legal ports of entry was precisely what was contributing to the extraordinary delays he was enduring this week But he doled out his criticisms widely  He blamed Mr  Trump for  choking us  with his brand of politics  He blamed his own president  Mr  López Obrador  for not doing enough to halt illegal migration through Mexico And he blamed the migrants for using Mexico as a  trampoline  to the United States  illustrating his remark with a bunny hop But he also said he could empathize with the migrants   It s a dream that everyone has   he said Mr  Núñez gestured toward El Paso   My dream is one day to have a tractor trailer on that side   he said   Some day I want to arrive in the United States and say   I m an American truck driver   That s my dream   

BRUSSELS   European Union countries gave initial clearance on Thursday to start formal trade talks with the United States  EU sources said  a move designed but not guaranteed to smooth strained relations between the world s two largest economies The European Commission  which coordinates trade policy for the 28 member European Union  has sought clearance for two negotiating mandates    one to cut tariffs on industrial goods  the other to make it easier for companies to show products meet EU or U S  standards The Commission presented its mandates in January and found support from most EU members  France resisted  however  insisting that agriculture should not feature in the talks but that climate change provisions should    a difficult demand given U S  President Donald Trump s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement The European Union and the United States reached a detente last July when Trump agreed to hold off from imposing punitive tariffs on EU cars as the two sides sought to improve economic ties U S  tariffs still apply to EU steel and aluminium  however  while Trump threatened on Tuesday to impose further tariffs on  11 billion worth of EU products related to a long running aircraft subsidy dispute A joint EU U S  statement in July referred to a goal of removing tariffs on  non auto industrial goods  EU sources said ambassadors agreed to the mandates at a meeting on Thursday  National ministers will still need to give final approval  although they would normally do so without debate  One source said the mandates had been added to the agenda of an agriculture ministers  meeting in Brussels on Monday  CARS  FARM PRODUCTS IN OR OUT The Commission has repeatedly said it will not discuss tariffs or barriers to trade in farm products  but is willing to discuss cars  setting it on a possible collision course with Washington The Trump administration has a wide ranging wish list  including comprehensive agricultural market access  Diplomats say Germany  whose exports of cars and parts to the United States are more than half the EU total  wants to press ahead with talks to ward off tariffs on carmakers Volkswagen  Mercedes maker Daimler and BMW France  with very few U S  car exports  had been seeking to push the issue beyond the European Parliament election in May  convinced that dealing with Trump is not a vote winner  The U S  Trade Representative has meanwhile proposed targeting a list of  11 billion worth of EU products for tariffs  ranging from large commercial aircraft to dairy products and wine  as retaliation against European subsidies for Airbus  A final list is expected this summer The European Commission said it had started to draw up plans to retaliate over subsidies for U S  planemaker Boeing Both sides have won partial victories at the World Trade Organisation in claiming the other s planemaker received unlawful subsidies but disagree on the amount involved and whether each has complied with earlier WTO rulings Some analysts see the aircraft dispute as the start of a tit for tat conflict to which Trump could add auto tariffs by mid May    Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop  Editing by Catherine Evans

PARIS SEATTLE SINGAPORE   Minutes after take off  the pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX were caught in a bad situation A key sensor had been wrecked  possibly by a bird strike  As soon as they retracted the landing gear  flaps and slats  it began to feed faulty data into the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System  MCAS   designed to prevent stalls Flying faster than recommended  the crew struggled with MCAS  But the high speed made it nearly impossible to use the controls to pull the nose up Moments later  the Boeing Co jet hit the ground  killing all 157 people onboard after six minutes of flight Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday that the pilots followed all the correct procedures in trying to keep MCAS from sending the plane into a fatal dive But the full picture of what happened in the cockpit of Flight 302 on March 10 is emerging from a preliminary report and a newly released data plot showing how crew and technology interacted The airline s youngest ever captain  a 29 year old with an impressive 8 100 hours flying time  and his rookie 25 year old co pilot may have made a crucial mistake by leaving the engines at full take off power  according to data and other pilots By the end  the aircraft was traveling at 500 knots  575 mph  926 kph   far beyond its design limits  That and some other potential missteps may have left them unable to fight flawed Boeing software that eventually sent the jet into an uncontrollable dive  experts said after studying the data   Power being left in take off power while leveling off at that speed is not a normal procedure   said one U S  pilot  who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media   I can t imagine a scenario where you d need to do that  The Ethiopian Airlines crash  and another in Indonesia five months earlier  have left the world s largest planemaker in crisis as its top selling jetliner is grounded worldwide  and Ethiopia scrambling to protect one of Africa s most successful companies Boeing is working on a software fix for MCAS and extra pilot training  which its chief executive  Dennis Muilenburg  said would prevent similar events from happening again BIRD STRIKE Sources who reviewed the crash data said the problems started barely 12 seconds after take off  A sudden data spike suggests a bird hit the plane as it was taking off and sheared away a vital airflow sensor As with the Lion Air crash in Indonesia  the damaged  angle of attack  sensor  which tells pilots what angle the aircraft has relative to its forward movement  may have set off a volatile chain of events In both cases  the faulty sensor tricked the plane s computer into thinking the nose was too high and the aircraft was about to stall  or lose lift  The anti stall MCAS software then pushed the nose down forcefully with the aircraft s  trim  system  normally used to maintain level flight The first time the MCAS software kicked in  the Ethiopian Airlines pilots quickly countered the movement by flicking switches under their thumbs   they had recognized the movements as the same type all flight crews had been warned about after the Lion Air flight  But data suggest they did not hold the buttons down long enough to fully counteract the computer s movements  At that point  they were a mere 3 000 feet above the airport  so low that a new warning   a computerized voice saying  don t sink    sounded in the cabin   When MCAS triggered again  the jetliner s trim was set to push the nose down at almost the maximum level  while the control yoke noisily vibrated with another stall warning called a  stick shaker   This time  the pilots countered MCAS more effectively  But when they turned off the system   as they were instructed to do by Boeing and the U S  Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  in the wake of the Lion Air disaster   the nose was still pointed downward  leaving the jetliner vulnerable The combination of excess speed and cutting off the system while the plane was still leaning downwards meant up to 50 pounds of force would be needed to move the control column  and moving the manual trim wheels was impossible   PULL UP  PULL UP The captain called out  pull up  three times  The co pilot reported problems to air traffic control In the meantime  the aircraft s speed remained abnormally high  The bird strike and loss of airflow data would have affected airspeed information too  In such cases  pilots know to turn off automatic engine settlings and control thrust manually But the report says  the throttles did not move   without elaborating  Data confirms the engines stayed at nearly full power  Other 737 pilots say that made the crew s job tougher by making the controls much harder to move Some experienced pilots said there were an array of stressful factors sapping the pilots  attention  which Muilenburg addressed on Thursday   As pilots have told us  erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment   Muilenburg said   It s our responsibility to eliminate this risk  We own it and we know how to do it   Among the distractions was a  clacker  warning telling the pilots their aircraft was going too fast As the nose gradually fell  the pilots turned to a last resort device to adjust the plane s trim  The captain asked the young co pilot to try to trim the plane manually using a wheel in the center console to lift the nose and make it easier to recover from the dive  But it was too hard to move the wheel  Both men then tried to pitch the nose up together  The captain  according to the report  said it was not enough  MCAS RE ACTIVATESIn a possible last ditch attempt to level the plane  data suggests the pilots turned MCAS related systems back on  That would also reactivate the electric trim system  and perhaps make it easier for the pilots to force the reluctant nose higher Reactivating MCAS is contrary to advice issued by Boeing and the U S  Federal Aviation Administration after Lion Air  The report did not address that The pilots managed to lift the nose slightly using the electric thumb switches on their control yokes  But data suggest they may have flicked the switches too gingerly  With its power restored  a final MCAS nose down command kicked in  eventually pushing the nose down to a 40 degree angle at an airspeed of up to 500 knots  far beyond the plane s operating limits As the 737 MAX plunged  G forces turned negative  pulling occupants out of their seats and possibly inducing a feeling of weightlessness as the plane hurtled toward the ground Just six minutes after take off  the plane crashed into a field    Additional reporting by Jason Neely in Addis Ababa  Tracy Rucinski in Chicago  David Shepardson in

JERUSALEM   Israelis vote in an election on Tuesday that could hand conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a record fifth term or see him dethroned by an ex general who has pledged clean government and social cohesion  Dubbed  King Bibi  by both Time and Economist magazines  Netanyahu has rallied a rightist camp hardened against the Palestinians and played up Israeli foreign policy boons that are the fruit of his ties with the Trump administration But the 69 year old Likud party leader s hope of overtaking Israel s founding father  David Ben Gurion  as longest serving premier in July has been dented by a looming graft indictment  He denies any wrongdoing Critics warn of  Bibi fatigue  and argue that the parliamentary election should bring fresh faces to high office Stalking Netanyahu in the opinion polls has been Benny Gantz  a former chief of the armed forces and centrist political novice  Buttressed by two other former generals at the top of his Blue and White party  Gantz  59  has sought to push back against Netanyahu s self styled image as unrivalled in national security  This is a choice between a strong right wing government under Netanyahu or a weak leftist government under Gantz   Likud said in a statement  Gantz told Reuters in response   Netanyahu is not the messiah  nor an irreplaceable legend  The people of Israel long for something else  With little policy daylight separating the two candidates on Iran and the Palestinians  or on Israel s humming economy  much of the voting will by guided by the question of their character In vitriolic campaigns waged largely over social media rather than in town squares or street corners  they have exchanged escalating allegations of corruption  of fostering bigotry and even of conspiring with Israel s adversaries  Netanyahu casts himself as the victim of media bias and judicial overreach  Gantz casts himself as a salve for Israel s religiously and ethnically riven society and its relations with liberal Jews abroad  This election is about one thing   whether or not Netanyahu should remain in office  It s the only thing that really defines 12 out of the 13 parties which will be in the next Knesset   said Anshel Pfeffer  author of the biography  Bibi  The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu  Which man wins is unlikely to be decided when the polling stations close at 10 p m   1900 GMT   No party has ever won an outright majority in the 120 seat parliament  meaning days or even weeks of coalition negotiations will lie ahead Israel s president  Reuven Rivlin  will consult with the leaders of every party represented in the Knesset and choose whoever he believes has the best chance of forming a government Although both Netanyahu and Gantz have publicly ruled out a future alliance in a  national unity  coalition  some analysts predict a rethink   especially if the candidates agree to tackle together a widely expected U S  plan for Middle East peace That plan s sponsor  President Donald Trump  offered an unusually clement observation on the election  telling his Republican Jewish supporters on Saturday   I think it s going to be close     Two good people    Writing by Dan Williams  Editing by Alison Williams and Diane Craft  

WASHINGTON   U S  officials are  not satisfied yet  about all the issues standing in the way of a deal to end the U S  China trade war but made progress in talks with China last week  a top White House official said on Monday The United States and China have been embroiled in a tit for tat tariff battle since July 2018  roiling global financial markets and supply chains and costing both of the world s two largest economies billions of dollars U S  officials are pressing China to make changes to address longstanding concerns over industrial subsidies  technology transfer and intellectual property rights The two sides wrapped up the latest round of talks in Washington late last week and will be resuming discussions this week remotely   We re making progress on a range of things  and there s some stuff where we re not satisfied yet   Clete Willems  a top White House trade official  told Reuters on the sidelines of a U S  Chamber of Commerce event on Monday He declined to get into specifics on which issues remained unsettled  Last week  President Donald Trump said a deal could be reached in about four weeks  Willems also declined to specify a timeline for the pact  noting   It should be a good sign for people that we re not rushing into this we want to get it right and we need to nail down specifics  Willems said that the two sides were still trying to settle on how to handle existing tariffs  The United States has slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods  and the Trump administration sees those as leverage to ensure Beijing keeps any promises made in the deal  Chinese officials want the levies removed The United States and China have agreed on an enforcement structure that would give Washington the right to retaliate if Beijing was not honouring the terms of the agreement  Willems said European Union leaders did not take issues with Chinese trade policy as seriously as they should have in the past  but the United States and the EU are now  working hand in hand  at the World Trade Organization on China s non market economic policies  Willems said earlier in remarks at the Chamber of Commerce The United States and the EU want to work together on joint projects that provide market based alternatives to state led initiatives  that can come with strings attached   he said This month China is hosting its second summit for its Belt and Road initiative  which envisions connecting China with Asia  Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending  but the United States will not be sending high level officials to the event Washington views Beijing as a major strategic rival  The United States has said it views the initiative as a way of spreading Chinese influence overseas and saddling low income countries with unsustainable debt using opaque projects Willems  who has been a key figure in negotiations with China  said last month he will be leaving the White House in the coming weeks to spend more time with his family after the birth of a new baby  This story corrects timing of Belt and Road summit to this month  not next month  in paragraph 12   Reporting by Chris Prentice  Writing by Makini Brice  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Tom Brown

PARIS   France has banned several types of textured breast implants that have been linked to a rare form of cancer The ban  which covers macro textured and polyurethane implants  took effect on Friday  It was announced  this week by France s National Agency for Safety of Medicines and Health Products  or ANSM  in a letter to manufacturers The implants  characterized by a textured  Velcro like surface that adheres to the breast tissue  are suspected of being linked to anaplastic large cell lymphoma  a rare form of cancer  Since 2011  59 cases have been recorded in France  according to the ANSM  and most women affected by the disease had textured breast implants Although the safety agency did not find a causal link between the cancer and the implants  it said it was imposing the ban as a  precautionary measure  In December  Allergan  one of the makers of textured implants  halted European sales after its certification expired  The French safety agency had asked for additional data on the implants  but the company said it could not provide it before the expiration date At the time  the ANSM said it had not  identified any immediate risk for the health of women carrying the implants concerned   and it did not mention the unusual cancer France s decision this week has set off a chain reaction in regulators across continents  with Canada and the Netherlands announcing similar plans to suspend the sale of textured breast implants In the United States  the Food and Drug Administration held public hearings on the subject on March 25 and 26  It said it would announce a decision  in the coming weeks  The prohibition followed a series of media investigations last year  coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists  that found poorly designed breast implants had led to health issues for patients globally In the ANSM letter this week  which the French newspaper Le Monde published on its website  Dr  Christelle Ratignier Carbonneil  deputy director general of the agency  asked manufacturers to remove their implants from the market   in view of the rare but serious danger that their implantation is likely to constitute  Nearly 500 000 women have breast implants in France  In 2018  macro textured and polyurethane implants represented 27 percent of sales  according to the ANSM  Over the past five years  some 70 000 women are thought to have received the implants  which do not slip out of place or rotate  unlike smooth ones  They are also less likely than smooth ones to cause thick scarring around the implant  which is common and requires more surgery Joëlle Manighetti  a French activist who started a blog on breast implants after suffering from faulty ones  praised the decision as going  beyond our recommendations   I now hope that there will be a serious follow up of the other breast implants still on the market   she said Breast implants came under scrutiny in France in the last decade  in a landmark case involving the company Poly Implant Prothèse  which was accused of selling hundreds of thousands of defective implants in 65 countries After a trial that involved more than 7 000 defendants  the company s founder  Jean Claude Mas  and four former employees were found guilty of aggravated fraud in 2012  Mr  Mas  who died Thursday at age 79  was later sentenced to four years in prison

WASHINGTON   The United States and the European Union are preparing to impose tit for tat tariffs on each other s products  the latest escalation in a 14 year fight over government aid given to Boeing and European rival Airbus  The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States  which will now put Tariffs on  11 Billion of E U  products   President Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday morning   The E U  has taken advantage of the U S  on trade for many years  It will soon stop  The office of the United States trade representative said on Monday night that it was preparing a list of European products to tax as retaliation for European subsidies to Airbus  which the World Trade Organization ruled were illegal in May 2018  That prompted the European Union to announce that it was also readying a list of tariffs to counter American subsidies to Boeing The moves come amid tense trade relations between the United States and Europe  which are engaged in a battle of tariffs after Mr  Trump s decision last year to tax European steel and aluminum  Mr  Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs on European cars and car parts if the European Union does not agree to better trade terms for American products  and Europe has said it will retaliate on American goods if Mr  Trump follows through on that threat The announcement of new tariffs stems from a dispute that began in 2004 related to government subsidies that Europe provides to Airbus Last May  the W T O  found that Airbus had received illegal funding for several of its aircraft models  The United States requested the authority to impose retaliatory tariffs of  11 2 billion per year  and the two sides are awaiting a decision on the level of tariffs that the United States will be authorized to levy on the European Union In preparation for that decision  which is expected this summer  the United States announced Monday night that it was beginning to identify European products to tax  so it could impose the duties as soon as the organization ruled  The initial list  would cover  11 billion of trade in products including airplanes  cheese  fish  wine  clothing  nails  pipes and clocks   the same dollar amount of harm that the United States trade representative estimated European subsidies cause each year  This case has been in litigation for 14 years  and the time has come for action   Robert Lighthizer  the United States trade representative  said in a statement  Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the E U  to end all W T O  inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft   Mr  Lighthizer said   When the E U  ends these harmful subsidies  the additional U S  duties imposed in response can be lifted  The European Commission indicated on Tuesday that it considers the  11 billion in retaliatory measures to be overblown and not justified by any findings by the World Trade Organization  The figure quoted by the U S  trade representative is based on U S  internal estimates that have not been awarded by the W T O    Daniel Rosario  a European Commission spokesman  said during a press briefing in Brussels Tuesday  reading from a prepared statement In a statement  Airbus called the American tariff announcement  totally unjustified  and said that the European Union would take  far larger countermeasures against the U S  Mr  Rosario said the commission  the European Union s administrative arm  would ask W T O  arbitrators to authorize retaliatory measures  which would be in response to a W T O  finding last month that Boeing received tax breaks in Washington State and incentives in South Carolina that amounted to subsidies The European Commission has begun drawing up a list of products that would be covered by retaliatory tariffs  but is awaiting a W T O  decision before specifying which products would be targeted and how much trade they would encompass In a statement  Boeing said that it supported the United States trade representative and hoped that the draft tariff list would encourage the European Union  to comply with past W T O  rulings against it  and  end all illegal government support for Airbus  The escalation comes at a difficult moment for Boeing  which is in the midst of a crisis after two of its 737 Max jet planes were involved in fatal crashes in five months  The company announced last week that it would begin slowing production of the jet  which represents billions of dollars of outstanding orders in the coming years  Stock markets in the United States were slightly lower on Tuesday  with the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index down 0 6 percent  Shares of Boeing were down 1 5 percent The United States  arguments at the W T O  have centered on billions of dollars of  launch aid  that the European Union has given Airbus to develop new products  The United States has long argued that such aid gave Airbus an unfair advantage  allowing it to gain market share in Europe  Australia  China  South Korea and elsewhere at Boeing s expense European criticism of the American aviation sector has mostly focused on government research contracts granted to Boeing through agencies like the Defense Department and NASA  as well as tax breaks at the federal  state and local levels While the subsidy dispute predates Mr  Trump s trade war by many years  the conflict has recently taken on some of the same tone that has characterized relations between the United States and Europe during the last two years  including reciprocal threats  radically different interpretations of the same facts  and an undercurrent of hostility among the NATO allies The two governments announced plans in July to negotiate an agreement that would reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade on both sides of the Atlantic  but have since disputed exactly what would be included in the agreement Chad Bown  a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute  said the list being drawn up by the United States was notable because it targeted European aircraft sales  which have not typically been included on past retaliation lists   If Trump goes first  expect the E U  to respond by hitting Boeing s sales in Europe   Mr  Bown said He added that tariffs on Airbus would also affect American companies  since it purchases many components for its aircraft from the United States Trade experts suggested the organization was likely to decide in the United States  favor on the tariffs  which they described as significant but not surprising Jennifer Hillman  a professor at Georgetown Law  said the Trump administration s tariffs appeared to be compliant with W T O  rules  as long as the United States waited for the organization s final decision before imposing its tariffs   If U S T R  wants to impose the tariffs as soon as the arbitration amount is announced  they need to start the public process now so as to be ready with a specific list of products as soon as arbitrator says the amount  Matthew Gold  an adjunct professor of law at Fordham University  said   The W T O  dispute settlement body will likely authorize the United States to impose retaliatory tariffs in the magnitude we re asking for  or close to it  Mr  Trump and his advisers have fiercely criticized the World Trade Organization for infringing on trade decisions that they insist should be the purview of the United States  and for failing to police unfair behavior by China However  they also have been quick to publicize the organization s decisions when it finds in their favor In its statement Monday  the Trump administration emphasized that its latest measures against the European Union would comply with the rules of the World Trade Organization  And Mr  Trump

NAIROBI  Kenya   Two Cuban doctors were abducted near Kenya s border with Somalia on Friday  in a bold attack that left one police officer dead and that officials say was probably linked to the Shabab militant group The abduction took place early Friday when the doctors were on their way to work  They left their residence and were traveling to Mandera County Referral Hospital  less than two miles from the border  in a government vehicle with two police officers escorting them  when two vehicles boxed them in  the police said One police officer was shot and killed  and the attackers spirited the doctors across the border in their own vehicle  The car was later recovered  along with a driver  who was taken in for questioning  the police said A spokesman for the police  Charles Owino  said the attackers might be linked to the Shabab militant group  an Al Qaeda affiliate  but he left open the possibility that it could be another group While the Kenyan authorities did not release the names of the doctors  Cuba s Ministry of Public Health identified them as Assel Herrera Correa  a general practitioner from the province of Las Tunas  and Landy Rodríguez Hernández  a surgeon from Villa Clara In a report that aired on Kenya s Citizen TV last July  the doctors said they were concerned when they first learned of their posting to the hospital in Mandera  My reaction was bad when I checked the internet   Dr  Rodríguez said in the interview  He said his search showed that the Shabab had carried out attacks in the area  Dr  Herrera told the network that he had also worked in Brazil and Venezuela in  very hard conditions  Doctors are particularly needed in the region because local health workers have fled in fear of Shabab attacks  Dr  Herrera told the television network that he saw around 20 patients a day  while Dr  Rodríguez performed 10 surgeries daily The two were part of a group of about 100 Cuban doctors deployed to Kenya in June 2018  according to the country s Ministry of Health  to help the country put a universal health coverage program in place For decades  Cuba has sent doctors to countries around the world as part of a government sponsored plan to provide training and assistance Some 400 000 health care workers have been sent on medical missions in 164 nations in the past five decades  according to the Cuban government  They have worked to combat the Ebola virus in Africa and cholera in Haiti  as well as having responded to natural disasters and other epidemics The abduction comes in the wake of the State Department on Tuesday issuing an advisory urging Americans not to travel to Kenya s coastal areas and regions on the Somalia border because of the threat of terrorism Kenyan officials have condemned the abduction and vowed to find the doctors Hillary Mutyambai  Kenya s newly appointed head of police  said that the country was working closely with the government of Somalia to ensure the doctors were returned safely The Shabab claimed responsibility for a major attack on the DusitD2 hotel and office complex in Nairobi in January that left 21 people dead  and it regularly carries out attacks in Somalia The Trump administration stepped up airstrikes against the group this year  and the United States estimates 5 000 to 7 000 Shabab fighters are active in Somalia  The African Union Mission in Somalia  or Amisom  has also been actively fighting the militant group in Somalia since early 2007

WASHINGTON   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday called for bipartisan talks aimed at bolstering asylum laws and addressing border security  issuing a bid for negotiations amid a surge of migrants crossing the southwestern U S  border and daily outcries by President Donald Trump about the need to clamp down on immigration  What we need to do is sit down in a serious  adult  bipartisan basis and try to fix the problem  because the problem is pretty obvious   McConnell  R Ky   told reporters   Border security is a part of it  but that doesn t solve the asylum issue  and that can t be solved  I don t think  without some kind of statutory adjustment  McConnell s statement underscored the political pressures facing lawmakers amid a steady diet of news reports about federal agencies being overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people trying to enter the U S  from Mexico  Trump has shaken up his team atop the Department of Homeland Security  imposed new policies to curb the numbers of people being processed for entry  complained that asylum laws and too lax and asserted that the country is  full  The prospects that serious talks will be held  let alone prove successful  are murky  Congress has not approved sweeping immigration legislation in decades  Democrats believe Trump merely wants to use the border problem as an issue in his re election bid next year  and the approach of the presidential election means the curtain for substantive compromises on any issues will fall in just a few months By international law  nations are supposed to let asylum seekers stay in their countries if they have legitimate  specific fears of persecution or danger if they return home The U S  Border Patrol said it apprehended 92 607 people at the U S  Mexico border in March  That included just over 53 000 who were parents and children traveling together  largely from Central America  which it calls a record for family members McConnell said negotiators would determine if the talks would also address other issues including the status of young  Dreamers  brought to the U S  illegally as children  I would like to see some serious bipartisan discussions going on to try to solve as many of these problems as we can agree to solve   he said Asked if he d discussed possible talks with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y   McConnell said   Well  yeah  we re talking about a variety of different things  We ll see what happens  A Schumer aide asked for comment did not immediately provide the Democrat s reaction Last year talks between bipartisan senators and the White House failed to produce an immigration deal after Trump insisted on restrictions on legal immigration  which Democrats opposed In an indication of how difficult such talks might be  Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that besides making sure border agents have the resources they need  Congress must  close loopholes  that drive Central American families to seek asylum here While touring the southern border in Arizona  Pence also said the administration wants to be able to return people more quickly to Central America and have more flexibility in detaining some migrants  He did not provide specifics In the past  Democrats have had little interest in making it easier for Trump to eject or detain immigrants    Associated Press writer Astrid Galvan in Phoenix  Arizona  contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   The likelihood of a court fight over President Donald Trump s tax returns grew on Wednesday when the U S  Treasury Department said it would not meet a deadline set by Democratic legislators to provide them and Trump himself stuck to his refusal to publicly release the documents U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  in a letter to the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives tax committee  said the panel s request for Trump s tax information  raises serious issues  and Treasury needed to consult with the Justice Department  to ensure our response is fully consistent with the law and the Constitution   The Treasury Department will not be able to complete its review of your request  by the Wednesday midnight deadline  Mnuchin told House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal in the letter  The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically motivated disclosures of personal tax information  regardless of which party is in power   Mnuchin said Businessman Trump  however  in the four years since he declared his candidacy for president  has consistently refused requests by politicians  journalists and others to release his tax returns  He has said he would not do so while they were under audit  but tax and legal experts have said that an audit should not prevent their public release  a practice presidents have followed for decades In a statement  Neal said he will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response  in the coming days  Democrats want to review Trump s returns chiefly as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest posed by his continued ownership of extensive business interests even as he serves the public as president Republicans oppose release of the returns  arguing that it would politicize tax data  The returns of U S  taxpayers are generally held as confidential by the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   which is part of the Treasury Department  There is a high likelihood this ends up in the courts  which is  in a way  unusual because typically when there s a request like this by Congress  the matter is settled more politically with a compromise   said Jessica Levinson  a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who specializes in political process law   But in this case both sides have really dug in  Legal experts have said that little case law would be available to guide judges if Congress were to take the administration to court over the issue Asked about the matter on Wednesday  Trump once again said his tax returns were being audited by the IRS   I would love to give them  but I m not going to do it while I m under audit  It s very simple   Trump told reporters Neal last week requested six years of Trump s personal and business returns from the IRS  invoking a seldom used law entitling him to make such a request Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC television on Wednesday that it was appropriate for his agency to consult with the White House counsel on Neal s request  Mnuchin had said on Tuesday that Treasury Department lawyers had held  informational  discussions with the White House about an expected request for the returns  a step that Democrats criticized as uncalled for under the law Democrats say a 1924 statute requires the Treasury secretary to turn over tax returns to the chairmen of the congressional tax committees who ask for them for investigative purposes   Reporting by Ginger Gibson  Steve Holland  Jason Lange  Tim Ahmann and Richard Cowan  additional reporting by Susan Heavey  writing by Meredith Mazzilli and Eric Beech  editing by Bernadette Baum and Grant McCool  

KANDAHAR  Afghanistan   Dozens of Afghan forces and Taliban fighters were killed in overnight fighting across Afghanistan  officials said Tuesday  as violence intensified ahead of another round of peace efforts to end the 18 year old war The worst of the attacks were in Kandahar Province  where the Taliban targeted an Afghan border post late Monday  killing at least four service members  according to local officials  Kasim Azad  the secretary of Kandahar s police chief  confirmed the attack and said four members of the border forces were killed But other officials put the death toll as high as 18 and said that at least eight other people were unaccounted for  possibly taken by the Taliban  Mr  Azad said 17 Taliban fighters had also been killed  The Taliban claimed to have overrun the border post  but the Afghan defense ministry said all of the attacked border posts remained under government control The violence comes a day after three American soldiers were killed near Bagram Air Base outside Kabul  Although Defense Department officials initially said that a contractor had also been killed in the attack  on Tuesday they revised their account to say that the contractor had only been wounded That attack brought the deaths of American troops in Afghanistan this year to seven  About 14 000 United States troops are currently in Afghanistan  though President Trump has asked administration officials to prepare for cutting that number in half Fighting has intensified despite a call on Sunday from Zalmay Khalilzad  the United States special envoy for Afghan peace  for a reduction in violence in the coming weeks as another round of talks are expected to get underway in the Gulf state of Qatar Those talks will be the first time the Taliban meet with Afghan government representatives in recent years  However  they are attending as part of a larger group representing all sects of the Afghan society rather than as an official government delegation Despite several rounds of negotiations with American diplomats  where the two sides are close to reaching a deal  the Taliban have so far refused direct negotiations with the Afghan government  American and Afghan officials hope the informal meeting can pave the way for direct negotiations between the two sides The violence on Monday is part of a deadly fight in the northwestern province of Badghis for the control of the Bala Murghab district  which falls on an important smuggling route along the border with Turkmenistan  The district has faced heightened pressure in recent months and it has been almost a week since the Taliban began a major offensive there At least 30 Afghan forces were killed in the initial days of fighting and the casualties have mounted since  The Afghan defense ministry said that more than 100 Taliban fighters have been killed   although those numbers could not be independently verified and the Afghan government is known to exaggerate enemy casualties The struggle of the Afghan forces has exposed their vulnerabilities ahead of what is expected to be a tough fighting season as both sides aim for battlefield gains that will increase their leverage in the peace talks It has also raised concerns that Afghan forces will surrender or flee under Taliban pressure rather than fight  particularly with the Taliban offering them better treatment for doing so  Last month  the Taliban captured about 150 Afghan forces after they fled to Turkmenistan  which turned them back  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s tax returns will never be handed over to Democratic lawmakers  White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on Sunday  defying an effort in Congress to learn more about the real estate mogul s personal finances Asked on  Fox News Sunday  if congressional Democrats will succeed in obtaining the Republican president s tax returns  Mulvaney said   No  never  Nor should they  He dismissed an effort to obtain the returns  launched on Wednesday by U S  House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Richard Neal  as a political ploy from Democrats who will never stop attacking Trump  Democrats are demanding that the IRS turn over the documents  That is not going to happen  and they know it  This is a political stunt   Mulvaney said Democrats countered that Neal s request to the Treasury Department for Trump s returns is grounded in law and a needed inquiry  given Trump s refusal to disclose his tax records and to divest himself of his business interests  This is a legitimate authority that the Congress has  This president  by the way  is the least transparent president that we ve had in half a century   Democratic Representative Dan Kildee  a tax committee member  told ABC s  This Week  Democratic Representative Ben Ray Lujan noted that presidents for decades have voluntarily released their income tax returns   This is not political  as our Republican colleagues are making it out to be   he told  Fox News Sunday  An attorney for Trump on Friday blasted House Democrats  request for six years of Trump s personal and business returns as  a misguided attempt  to politicize the tax laws  accusing lawmakers of harassment and interference in IRS audits In a statement that mapped out the legal battlefield ahead  Trump lawyer William Consovoy said the request filed by Neal flouts  constitutional constraints  Republican Senator Mitt Romney urged Trump to release his tax returns as promised but criticized Democratic efforts to force the issue through legislative action as  moronic    The courts are not going to say that you can compel a person running for office to release their tax returns   he said on NBC s  Meet the Press  One of many investigations targeting Trump on Capitol Hill and in the U S  court system  the House Democrats  probe into the president s tax returns could pull back the curtain on his business empire and his reputation as a dealmaker As a presidential candidate in 2016  Trump broke with a decades old practice of making his tax returns public and continues to refuse to release them as president  while retaining ownership in many enterprises  ranging from golf courses and hotels and other properties If Congress takes the administration to court over Trump s taxes then little case law would be available to help guide judges  legal experts said  both because the statute cited by Neal to obtain the returns has hardly ever been contested  and because most document disputes between the legislative and executive branches of government are resolved by negotiation The losing party could appeal  ultimately to the U S  Supreme Court  If litigation extends into 2021  a judge could also force a newly elected Congress to start the process over  said Ross Garber  an attorney who specializes in political investigations   Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Kevin Drawbaugh  Additional reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco  Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Lisa Shumaker

NEW YORK   Curbing corruption could generate about  1 trillion  760 23 billion pounds  in tax revenues annually across the world  according to research from the International Monetary Fund In addition to increasing government revenue  fighting corruption can also reduce waste and even help to lift test scores among public school students  the IMF said  It also improves overall public trust in the government  Less corruption means lower revenue leakage and less waste in expenditures  and higher quality of public education and infrastructure   said the report The pattern of lower corruption perception and higher revenues is maintained across developed  emerging and low income countries  the data showed  Among advanced economies  a country in the top 25  in terms of control of corruption collects 4 5  of GDP more in revenues  on average  than a country in the lowest 25   The gap in revenue collection is 2 75  of GDP among emerging market economies and 4  of GDP among low income countries   said the report  Graphic  Bribe expectations for particular purposes  https   tmsnrt rs 2HX4Uwk TRANSPARENCY  STRONG PRESS ARE KEY Previous studies showed that extractive industries like mining and oil drilling are hotbeds for corruption  as are procurement and the administration of state owned enterprises  The Fund focuses on transparency and oversight as key elements in curbing corruption in these areas  with a strong  free press as catalyst  We expected transparency would go together with good fiscal outcomes  but what surprised us is that the effect of transparency is much stronger in countries that have a free press or a  strong  civil society   said Paolo Mauro  deputy director in the IMF s Fiscal Affairs department  And when you have those two together the effect is even stronger  Mauro and Paulo Medas  a deputy division chief in the same IMF department  co authored the study  a chapter of the Fund s Fiscal Monitor  which is being published in parts this week ahead of the IMF s spring meetings scheduled next week in Washington Among other recommendations to curb corruption  the Fund calls for the professionalization of civil service  including merit based hiring  as well as the need for simple tax rules and business codes to avoid the temptation of bribes to navigate them The report recommended technology that can fight corruption  For instance  it said  taking procurement on line is seen as a rapid and inexpensive part of the anti corruption puzzle So called e procurement  is a relatively cheap initiative that can open competition  so you can have bidders from any place in the country or the world and it makes it very cheap and transparent for companies to bid   said Medas Chile and South Korea are cited as examples in the effectiveness of e procurement  while Rwanda and Georgia show some of the highest increases in revenue collection relative to GDP  Emerging countries  dependence on extraction of raw materials for economic development gives them an added incentive to curb corruption and makes success even more important  You want to invest in very good institutions  extremely high levels of transparency and very intrusive external oversight   said Medas The trillion in added tax revenues comes on top of a previous study that stated that corruption in the public sector costs between  1 5 trillion and  2 trillion annually in bribes alone   Reporting by Rodrigo Campos  Editing by David Gregorio  

THE UNINHABITABLE EARTH Life After Warming By David Wallace WellsLOSING EARTH A Climate History By Nathaniel RichClimate change is the greatest challenge humanity has collectively faced  That challenge is  to put it mildly  practical  but it also poses a problem to the imagination  Our politics  our societies  are arranged around individual and group interests  These interests have to do with class  or ethnicity  or gender  or economics   make your own list  By asserting these interests  we call out to each other so that as a collective we see and hear one another  From that beginning  we construct the three overlapping  interacting R s of recognition  representation and rights The problem with climate change  as an existential challenge to humanity  is that the interest based model of society and politics doesn t work  Most of the people in whose interest we are demanding action aren t here  They haven t been born yet  And because the areas first and most affected by climate change are the poorest regions of earth  we are talking about the least seen  least represented group on our planet  We have to imagine these people into being  and then grant them rights  and then take unprecedented  society wide action on that basis The demand climate change makes on us is to feel empathy for the unborn poor of the global south  and change our economies to act on the basis of their needs  That s something humanity has never done before Pessimism would be an ethical catastrophe  It leads only to despair  despair to inaction  and inaction to a future world David Attenborough has described as  the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world   To avoid the most terrible possible versions of our future  we have to stay positive  it s the only moral response to this crisis  And there are grounds to do so  as David Wallace Wells argues in his brilliant new book   The Uninhabitable Earth  Life After Warming    We have all the tools we need  today  to stop it all  a carbon tax and the political apparatus to aggressively phase out dirty energy  a new approach to agricultural practices and a shift away from beef and dairy in the global diet  and public investment in green energy and carbon capture  ImageGlobal emissions could be cut by a third if the richest 10 percent of humanity cut their use of energy to the same level as affluent  comfortable Europe  One prospective technique to scrub carbon from the atmosphere would cost  3 trillion a year  a colossal amount   but significantly less than the current level of subsidies paid out globally for fossil fuel  estimated at  5 trillion  Taken all in all  solutions are  obvious  and  available   The only obstacle to implementing them is political will This litany of ideas might make  The Uninhabitable Earth  sound upbeat  That would be misleading  At the heart of Wallace Wells s book is a remorseless  near unbearable account of what we are doing to our planet  Climate change is  not just the biggest threat human life on the planet has ever faced but a threat of an entirely different category and scale   he writes  Even if collective action manages to keep us to 2 degrees Celsius of warming   a target it looks like we are currently on course to miss   we would be facing a world in which  the ice sheets will begin their collapse  global G D P  per capita will be cut by 13 percent  400 million more people will suffer from water scarcity  major cities in the equatorial band of the planet will become unlivable  and even in the northern latitudes heat waves will kill thousands each summer  But remember  he writes   this is our best case scenario   Wallace Wells takes us through a compendium of the ways in which things could get so much worse  from simple  heat death  through catastrophic storms  droughts  flooding  wildfires  pollution  plague  economic collapse and war  We will see migration on a scale the world has never experienced  United Nations and World Bank estimates of how many people will be forcibly displaced by the middle of this century range from the tens to the hundreds of millions  All of this will affect the world s poor far more than the world s rich  The innocent  who have done the least to damage the environment through the consumption of fossil fuels  will suffer more than the guilty  The Uninhabitable Earth  gives readers  emotions a thorough workout along that pessimism to despair spectrum  before we are brought round to the writer s  acceptance of responsibility   I stress the emotional aspect because it is crucial  We are facing a call to action that we are  on the evidence of our behavior so far  likely to ignore  unless we directly feel its urgency  We know this  because that s what we have been doing  The science of global warming has been settled for 40 years  but we have not just continued to pollute  we have accelerated the rate at which we ve been doing so  Most of the carbon humans have put into the atmosphere has been emitted in the last three decades  As Wallace Wells tartly puts it   We have done as much damage to the fate of the planet and its ability to sustain human life and civilization since Al Gore published his first book on the climate than in all the centuries   all the millenniums   that came before  This is part of the tragedy  It s not just that we know what s happening  it s that we ve known for years and done nothing  Nathaniel Rich observes in  Losing Earth  A Recent History  that  nearly every conversation we have in 2019 about climate change was being held in 1979   His gripping  depressing  revelatory book is an expanded version of a whole issue article that appeared in The New York Times Magazine last year  It is an account of what went wrong   of how it was that a moment of growing awareness of climate change  and an apparent willingness to act on the knowledge  was allowed to dissipate into stasis and inaction ImageThe story runs from 1979 to 1989  Rich frames his narrative through a central character  Rafe Pomerance  a Friends of the Earth lobbyist who first came across the issue of global warming in a 1979 E P A  report  In the  80s  Congress had several hearings into climate change  which was accepted as an urgent priority even by a figure as conservative and anti intellectual as Dan Quayle   The greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue  We need to get on with it  So why didn t they Rich offers a number of reasons  Scientists struggled to put across a clear message with sufficient force  for one  Pomerance looked with envy at the clarity with which the  hole in the ozone layer  was targeted for action by concerned scientists  notwithstanding the fact that  as Rich writes   there was no hole  and there was no layer   The climate scientists  honorable struggles with complexity  probability models and time lags between cause and effect helped dilute the impact of their message  A 1983 report by the Academy of Sciences   Changing Climate   was interpreted as calling for  caution not panic   Roger Revelle  one of America s leading scientists and author of a 1957 paper that was one of the first to describe the greenhouse effect  said that  we re flashing a yellow light but not a red light  It s not an unmitigated disaster by any means  It s just a change   The effect of all this was that the fight against climate change lost momentum at a critical point ImageCreditPableaux JohnsonThe greater part of responsibility for the failure  however  lies with politicians and energy companies  The big fossil fuel firms knew the realities of human caused climate change but chose to ignore them and to lobby for the right to damage the environment  the Republican Party had factions that were in league with Big Energy  overlapping with other factions in denial about the scientific realities  The Reagan administration fought hard against environmental protections of any kind  the Bush administration made rhetorical gestures but John Sununu  George H W  Bush s chief of staff  did not believe in anthropogenic climate change and fought the scientists hard  and ultimately successfully The first meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1989 ended without the thing it was convened to achieve  binding targets on global emissions  With American leadership  Rich writes   warming could have been held to less than 1 5 degrees   The United States chose to shoot down the agreement   And with that a decade of excruciating  painful  exhilarating progress turned to air   More carbon has been emitted into the atmosphere since that 1989 conference than in the preceding history of civilization Climate change is a tragedy  but Rich makes clear that it is also a crime   a thing that bad people knowingly made worse  for their personal gain  That  I suspect  is one of the many aspects to the climate change battle that posterity will find it hard to believe  and impossible to forgive  

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William P  Barr vowed on Tuesday to release a redacted version of the Mueller report  within a week   defending his handling of the special counsel investigation s findings as a bid for transparency as Democrats accused him of politically motivated behavior Mr  Barr said he would explain his redactions and was open to negotiating with lawmakers about revealing some of the delicate information that he and law enforcement officials are blacking out from the highly anticipated report before he sends it to Congress and the public  This process is going along very well  and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid April stands   Mr  Barr said at a House budget hearing   And so I think that from my standpoint  within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public   Read Mr  Barr s top takeaways from the Mueller report  But he was less forthcoming about aspects of his review  declining to say whether President Trump had been briefed on the report after Justice Department and White House officials had said for weeks that the president has not been updated on its contents  And he did not explain why he cleared Mr  Trump of committing an obstruction of justice offense when Mr  Mueller s team declined to make a decision Democrats assailed Mr  Barr s decision to send a four page letter to Congress in March outlining the main findings of the investigation by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  pointing to complaints by members of the special counsel s team that Mr  Barr failed to fully portray the extent of how damaging their conclusions might be for Mr  Trump  The American people have been left with many unanswered questions  serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report   said Representative José E  Serrano  Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department Mr  Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the  bottom line  conclusions from Mr  Mueller s inquiry into Russia s election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired  as well as whether President Trump tried to impede the inquiry  He said that Mr  Mueller declined an opportunity to read his March 24 letter before Mr  Barr sent it to lawmakers  And Mr  Barr warned that trying to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism  I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize   Mr  Barr said   because I think any summary  regardless of who prepares it  not only runs the risk of being under inclusive or over inclusive  but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once  Mr  Barr pushed back on Democrats  complaints that they did not have the report  reminding them that they would be able to read it in days  And as for his four page letter  he suggested that had he not written it  lawmakers would have bitterly complained if they were given no information or insight into Mr  Mueller s conclusions during the redaction process  In my judgment  it was important for people to know the bottom line conclusions of the report while we worked on necessary redactions to make the whole thing available   said Mr  Barr  adding that he anticipated that the redactions would take weeks The back and forth came during an unusually contentious House appropriations subcommittee hearing  where Mr  Barr also defended the Trump administration s hardening stance on immigration and the Justice Department s decision to stand down rather than appeal a federal judge s decision to strike down the Affordable Care Act Mr  Barr also revealed that the Justice Department inspector general  Michael E  Horowitz  is wrapping up an examination of parts of the Russia investigation  including accusations that law enforcement officials abused their powers to wiretap Carter Page  a former Trump campaign adviser  Mr  Horowitz could reveal the results as early as May or June  Mr  Barr said Though Democrats have for weeks demanded to see the full text of the Mueller report and all underlying investigative materials  Mr  Barr reminded them that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Monica Lewinsky scandal  In 1998  Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence  including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation Under the current regulations  the special counsel delivers a confidential report of investigative decisions to the attorney general  who is free to decide what to release  I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can   Mr  Barr said To that end  Mr  Barr repeated his promise that lawmakers would receive a redacted report in mid April and that he would testify about its contents soon afterward  He said that he would identify which of four categories redacted material fell into   secret grand jury testimony  classified information  materials that could affect current investigations and information about peripheral third parties  Those were the same types of information that Democrats have fought to protect when Republicans tried to obtain documents from the Justice Department Though Mr  Barr said he was open to negotiating whether the department could share some of the redacted details after releasing the report  he took a harder line on grand jury testimony  While Congress can request it in the context of a legal proceeding  he said he was not obligated to honor such a request Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  said that once he received the redacted report  he would issue a subpoena for the complete document and petition a court for the grand jury testimony  If it doesn t have everything we require to do our work  which is to say the entire report and underlying evidence in it  we will issue subpoenas forthwith   Mr  Nadler told reporters on Tuesday Democrats were taking other steps to try to get ahold of information pertinent to the Russia investigation  Representative Adam B  Schiff  Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  told reporters later on Tuesday that he believed requirements that the intelligence agencies regularly update their congressional oversight committees on significant developments could allow a side door view into the findings of Mr  Mueller and the investigators who worked with him Mr  Schiff said he had made a request along those lines in recent weeks but had not yet received a response Justice Department officials have said that they have not shared the report or briefed the White House on its contents  so the demurral raised the possibility that the situation had shifted  Mr  Barr is likely to be pressed on the matter on Wednesday  when he is scheduled to testify before Senate appropriators Mr  Barr visited Capitol Hill to answer questions about the Justice Department s proposed  29 2 billion budget for the next fiscal year  which includes money for 100 new judges for immigration courts  which are part of the department  not the judicial system He also echoed the president s increasingly hard line stance on immigration  which has touched off a purge of Department of Homeland Security officials who Mr  Trump believes impeded his goal of shutting the southwestern border entirely Mr  Barr called the situation along the border with Mexico  unprecedented  and said that part of the Justice Department s request for an additional  72 1 million for immigration enforcement would pay for the new immigration judges to tackle a backlog of cases Democrats  who see health care as one of their top campaign issues  also assailed Mr  Barr and the Justice Department for declining to appeal a Texas judge s decision to strike down the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that the sweeping health care law was unconstitutional Under fire for the decision  Mr  Barr said   I m a lawyer  I m not in charge of health care   But his comment belied the fact that his refusal to defend a law on the books can effectively shape policy While Mr  Barr would not disclose any discussions with Mr  Trump over the health care law  he said that he would follow the wishes of the president so long as his request was legally defensible  

Israel s parliamentary election on Tuesday brings an end to a neck and neck campaign that saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  the veteran politician of the Israeli right and one of the country s longest serving leaders  facing the strongest challenge in years  Mr  Netanyahu s tenure has been marked by a collapse of peace talks with the Palestinians  confrontation with Iran  armed conflict

on charges is likely by year s end  Under the current law  Mr  Netanyahu  if re elected  would not have to resign until a final conviction  although new legislation or public pressure could force him to step down  Mr  Netanyahu has described the charges as a baseless partisan witch hunt  But with a first sitting prime minister to be charged  Israel would be entering uncharted legal and political terrain The uncertainty has worked against Mr  Netanyahu in the prelude to the vote   The attorney general s report has done something that has never happened in Israel s 70 year history  and that is that a prime minister is under a legal cloud   said David Makovsky  an expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  The election also is the first time that three former heads of the army

NEW ORLEANS   Federal scientists say a tiny group of Bryde s whales in the Gulf of Mexico is endangered  facing threats including oil and gas exploration and development  They re the only year round baleen whales that make their home in Gulf of Mexico  and  they  have a unique and very important role in the ecosystem   said Laura Engleby  a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries  service Two other subspecies are found in tropical waters around the world  but this one is so genetically different it may even be a different species  Engleby said  The filter feeding whales known as baleen whales can be hard to tell apart by sight  she said   That makes it even more challenging to study them  in some ways   she said A Republican congressman from Florida and a marine mammal scientist in Massachusetts applauded the decision to protect the whales  There probably are about 33 of them in a deepwater area called the DeSoto Canyon  Engleby said  If there are any in the southern Gulf  she said  the total including the known population is probably less than 100  Although belated  this designation will help to protect this vulnerable species and aid in its recovery   U S  Rep  Vern Buchanan said in an emailed statement  Buchanan and Rep  Kathy Castor  D Florida  had pushed for the designation  Buchanan spokesman Anthony Cruz wrote  I think it s a great thing to declare them endangered  It s been coming for a while   said Scott Kraus  chief marine mammal scientist at the New England Aquarium s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life However   It s absolutely not too late  to save the whale  said Zac Smith  attorney for the National Resources Defense Council  an environmental group that sued the government in 2014 to get the endangered listing   This species now has a fighting chance for survival and to rebound from the brink of extinction  Engleby said the next step is to work out ways to help the whales recover  including consulting with other agencies and considering whether to designate critical habitat Such a designation would require NOAA Fisheries consultation about any federal contracts  which include oil and gas leases in federal waters Threats include noise from seismic surveys for oil and gas and ship traffic  which interfere with their subsonic communication Oil and gas companies agreed in 2013 not to use seismic surveys in an area including the DeSoto Canyon  That agreement  originally for 2  years  has been extended and will remain in effect until 2022  NOAA Fisheries spokeswoman Kim Amendola said A study released in 2015 estimated the whales  numbers at 26  It said the BP offshore oil spill in 2010 overlapped nearly half their habitat and might have killed up to 22 percent of the population  Other threats include fishing nets  oil and gas development  pollution  and even being hit by ships   a whale was hit and killed by a ship in 2009 It arrived in Tampa  Florida   on the bow of a ship   Engleby said  Since it was lactating  she noted  the calf probably died  too The name is pronounced  BROO duhs  because they were named after the 19th century Norwegian whaler Johan Bryde Whalers  records dating back to the 1700s show they once swam in the central and northern gulf  according to NOAA Fisheries  They eat crustaceans  fish and cephalopods  which they filter through baleen plates and bristles Because they were confined to the Gulf of Mexico  they probably never were as numerous as some other species  said Smith Engleby said   We don t really know much about this species   She said a study funded with money from penalties that energy giant BP PLC and others paid after the oil spill is using visual surveys  passive acoustic monitoring and tagging to learn more  including their part in the ecosystem

WASHINGTON   President Trump s personal lawyer on Friday asserted Mr  Trump s right as a citizen to keep his tax returns private and told the Treasury Department not to hand the returns over to House Democrats  foreshadowing what has the potential to be a far reaching legal fight that could reach the Supreme Court The lawyer  William S  Consovoy  argued that Democrats who have demanded to see Mr  Trump s tax information had no legitimate legislative reason to request it and that Representative Richard E  Neal s decision this week to ask for six years of the president s personal and business returns flouts  fundamental constitutional constraints   He also called it a  gross abuse of power   Even if Ways and Means had a legitimate committee purpose for requesting the president s tax returns and return information  that purpose is not driving Chairman Neal s request   the lawyer wrote  referring to Mr  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  who leads the House Ways and Means Committee   His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech   Read the lawyer s letter  Mr  Consovoy s views have no direct bearing on the case  The little known tax code provision employed by the Democrats in demanding Mr  Trump s returns says only that the Internal Revenue Service  shall furnish  the information  giving it and its parent agency  the Treasury Department  little leeway in deciding how to respond Democrats anticipate that the Trump administration could present an argument similar to the one made on Friday by Mr  Consovoy  namely that Mr  Neal s request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and  based on past court precedent  must respect Mr  Trump s right to privacy Nonetheless  the length and forcefulness of Mr  Consovoy s letter underscores what is at stake for a president who has defied modern political norms by refusing to voluntarily release his tax returns  If Mr  Neal prevails and gains access to the president s long hidden returns  it would allow Democrats for the first time to peek past Mr  Trump s public claims about his wealth and investments and into the heart of his personal and business finances The I R S  and Treasury Department have given no indication of how they view the request since it was made on Wednesday  Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  told Congress last month he would consult with his legal team and follow the law when a request was made  He will most likely face questions about the request again next week when he returns to Capitol Hill to discuss the department s budget Mr  Trump has indicated in recent days that he is ready to fight to keep his financial information private  Asked on Friday if he was confident he would succeed  Mr  Trump offered an ambiguous prediction  Oh  I don t know   he said   That s up to whoever handles it  I don t know  Hey  I m under audit  But that s up to whoever it is  From what I understand  the law is 100 percent on my side  Mr  Neal made the request through an obscure but frequently used provision of the federal tax code   Section 6103   that allows Congress s tax writing committees to view tax information on any filer  The authority is regularly used by the committee to confidentially measure how changes to the tax code would affect different types of taxpayers  It has been used for more investigative purposes  as well  most recently in 2014  when committee Republicans obtained and publicly released tax information as part of an investigation into whether the I R S  discriminated against conservative entities seeking tax exempt status But there is little precedent for using it to examine the returns of a president without his consent Mr  Neal gave the I R S  until next week to comply  If it does not  the House could go to court to try to enforce the request   a process that legal experts said could take years to sort out   The Supreme Court has flagged twice now that it is unclear as to whether a congressional committee can sue the president and force the executive branch to do something   said Andy Grewal  a University of Iowa law school professor   I think we are a very long way from getting an answer over legitimate legislative purpose  After months of speculation  the back and forth was initiated on Wednesday when Mr  Neal formally requested that the I R S  hand over six years of Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns as part of what he said was a committee oversight investigation of tax law enforcement  Even if Mr  Neal does get access to the information  it would not automatically become public because the committee would have to vote to disclose anything it sees In making his request  Mr  Neal jettisoned issues  like possible tax fraud  that Democrats have warned that Mr  Trump may be hiding  instead saying that he wanted to examine audit procedures for a president Mr  Neal worked closely with House lawyers to prepare the request to hold up against legal challenge  He framed the request as part of the Ways and Means Committee s oversight of  the extent to which the I R S  audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president   Under I R S  policy  the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year  This request is about policy  not politics   Mr  Neal said at the time   My preparations were made on my own track and timeline  entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration  Daniel Rubin  a spokesman for Mr  Neal  declined to comment on Friday s letter Mr  Consovoy said that Mr  Neal s stated justification only thinly veiled what Democrats were really after  political gain  They have demanded for years that Mr  Trump release his tax returns  Mr  Consovoy argued  and they promised to use the House majority to find out whether the president had undertaken financial fraud  Once this Pandora s box is opened  the ensuing tit for tat will do lasting damage to our nation   Mr  Consovoy wrote Though he was defending Mr  Trump s privacy rights as a taxpayer  his arguments also closely mirrored those used by Republicans in Congress who have argued against making the request  If Chairman Neal genuinely wants to review how the I R S  audits presidents  why is he seeking tax returns and return information covering the four years before President Trump took office   Mr  Consovoy asked   Why is he not requesting information about the audits of previous presidents  Mr  Consovoy s argument bears similarity to one made by other Trump lawyers throughout the course of the obstruction of justice investigation led by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  In that case  the president s lawyers repeatedly argued that he did not lose his rights as a citizen by dint of being the commander in chief  Those included his rights to free speech  his lawyers argued  a point echoed in the letter sent on Friday Mr  Grewal said he thought Mr  Consovoy raised a valid objection about the legitimacy of Mr  Neal s investigation  but cautioned that his letter was  part of public relations and advocacy  as opposed to any kind of official action  that would affect the case George K  Yin  a tax law professor at the University of Virginia  disagreed  He said Mr  Neal s argument was cleverly framed  particularly in light of a relevant past use of Section 6103 by Congress in examining whether President Richard M  Nixon had properly paid his taxes  There is an inherent conflict of interest when the agency is responsible for auditing its boss   he said Facing questions about his own tax obligations  Nixon asked Congress to investigate whether he had taken improper tax positions as president  Using materials he handed over and referencing Section 6103  Congress found that despite being audited by the I R S   Nixon had significantly underpaid After Nixon and his immediate successor  Gerald R  Ford  all American presidents until Mr  Trump voluntarily released their taxes

What s in a mushroom burger  Or a veggie sausage Perhaps worried that you may be confused  some epicures at the European Parliament have proposed a new rule  If a product does not contain meat  it cannot be called a burger or a sausage or a steak The proposed amendment was passed by the body s agricultural committee this week as part of a voluminous revision of the European Union s Common Agricultural Policy Eric Andrieu  a French Socialist member of the European Parliament  introduced the proposal  but suspicions remained that the meat lobby was behind the idea  Environmentalists said the suggested labeling rules were an effort to undermine the growing demand for plant based foods  We didn t support the proposal   said Molly Scott Cato  a British member of the European Parliament from the Green Party   We don t see any problem with calling a veggie burger a veggie burger  Mr  Andrieu  who could not be reached to comment  told The Guardian that the meat lobby had nothing to do with the amendment and that he was attempting to add some common sense to food labeling  We felt that steak should be kept for real steak with meat   he said  warning that  a lot of creativity  would be needed to come up with new names for vegetarian products   People need to know what they are eating  Some news accounts of the proposed rule reported on a search for new names  including  vegetable protein tubes  and  veggie disc  Dairy producers were the first to allege that competitors selling plant based foods were using misleading labeling such as  tofu butter  or  veggie cheese  and they won a 2017 ruling from the European Court of Justice that reserved the names of dairy products for foods with an animal source  As part of its vote last week  the agricultural committee added to the dairy restrictions with a rule that would ban the use of phrases like  yogurt style  or  butter substitute  for plant based products The proposal about meat labeling was opposed by a coalition of environmental and animal rights groups  There is no evidence of consumer confusion   Greenpeace  Humane Society International and other groups wrote in a letter dated April 1   On the contrary  consumers purchase these items because they do not contain meat or dairy  The proposal must still pass the full European Parliament  which will not take it up until after elections in May  It would then have to be negotiated and agreed on by the Council of Ministers before becoming law  according to Neil Corlett  a European Parliament spokesman Whether the proposal is a maneuver by the meat lobby or simply an attempt by the French to assert food traditions  the proposal reflected a certain defensiveness by the meat industry as more and more people reduce their meat consumption  Ms  Scott Cato said  There was no consumer demand for this   she said  adding that she would continue to oppose the amendment as  an attempt by the meat industry to make life harder for people  who prefer vegetarian diets In the United States  there has been a push by the dairy industry to require the Food and Drug Administration to enforce labeling rules for milk as more Americans switch to  alternative milks   which come from any number of plants   Pea milk  anyone   Nobody thinks their almond milk comes from a cow   said Michele Simon  the executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association in San Francisco As for efforts in some states to come up with labeling for plant based meat substitutes  there was no confusion there either  she said   People are happily buying these products not thinking they are beef   she said Ms  Scott Cato pointed to the breakout success of vegan sausage rolls this year introduced by Greggs  a British bakery chain  in January  as evidence that more people are eating vegetarian dishes   and that they know what is in them  It s not like anybody bought a vegan sausage roll and asked where is the pig   she said

Good Thursday   Want this by email  Sign up here  Bank chiefs talk regulation  Russia and recessionThe C E O s of seven huge American banks testified on Capitol Hill yesterday   the first time since

financial system is much safer today than it was a decade ago  despite recent easing of regulations Russia  Brian Moynihan of Bank of America  James Gorman of Morgan Stanley and Mike Corbat of Citigroup all said they had reviewed their account holders for potential Russian money laundering  Mr  Corbat was the only one to say he  could not comment on ongoing investigations  Guns   JPMorgan has refused to adopt a policy to ensure responsible lending to the gun industry  even though you claim that client selection is important   said Representative Carolyn Maloney   Will you commit to adopting a formal policy that ensures responsible lending in your bank s business with the gun industry   Jamie Dimon responded that JPMorgan has  a very small relationship with gun manufacturers   and added that he would be willing to consider adopting a formal policy  Mr  Gorman said Morgan Stanley had clamped down on doing business with gunmakers  Citi and Bank of America have already done so The economy  Asked about the biggest economic threat facing the U S   Mr  Corbat answered   Our ability to talk ourselves into the next recession  Diversity  Not one of the C E O s thought that his successor would be a woman or a person of color More  Lloyd Blankfein  the former Goldman Sachs C E O  who testified at the 2009 hearing  tweeted yesterday   Boy  I really miss my old job     What social media could learn from Wall StreetTo curb disinformation and hateful content  Andrew suggests in his latest column that tech giants take a page from the banking industry and make sure they know

WASHINGTON   Special Counsel Robert Mueller s probe of Russian interference in U S  politics is over  but prosecutors are investigating two prominent Washington lobbyists for their work for the former pro Russian government of Ukraine  according to three sources close to the probe In a sign that evidence from Mueller s 22 month investigation may yet ensnare more prominent Washington figures  federal prosecutors in Washington cited a former U S  congressman  working for the government of Ukraine  in charges filed Thursday against former Obama administration official Greg Craig Craig pleaded not guilty on Friday to lobbying violations and making false statements  The former congressman is not named in Craig s indictment  but other filings by his former law firm cite identical work done for the firm by Vin Weber  a lobbyist with Mercury Public Affairs  who was a U S  representative from Minnesota from 1981 to 1993  Weber disclosed his work for a Ukrainian think tank  but he did not register as a foreign agent for the government of Ukraine under a the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA   which would have required him to spell out his activity in detail  according to a Reuters review of lobbying records The Department of Justice is stepping up FARA enforcement after decades of inactivity  Mueller s investigation has not led to criminal conspiracy charges against Trump or his former associates  but it has exposed previously hidden foreign lobbying activity by some of Washington s most prominent lobbyists and prompted a flurry of new registrations since 2017  U S  Attorney General William Barr is expected to release a redacted version of Mueller s findings next week Three sources familiar with the investigation said federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining work done for Ukraine by both Weber and Tony Podesta  brother of John Podesta  a top official of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s 2016 Democratic presidential campaign and a former White House adviser  A spokesperson for Weber and for Mercury declined to comment  Tony Podesta also declined to comment  The FARA crackdown has factored in cases against Craig  Craig s former law firm Skadden Arps and Paul Manafort  the former Trump campaign chairman now serving a 7 1 2 year prison sentence for lobbying and financial crimes Other lobbyists have rushed to comply with the law  As of April  446 separate entities registered with the Justice Department  up from 387 at the end of 2016  Tony Podesta disclosed his lobbying work for a Brussels based think tank  the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine  to Congress  But he did not register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the government of Ukraine Podesta s work for the Ukrainian government came to light in 2017 after Mueller s team charged Manafort with lobbying violations  Those revelations prompted Podesta to step down in October 2017 from his Podesta Associates lobbying firm  which collapsed shortly after Sources familiar with the investigation said that investigations into Ukraine related lobbying by Craig  Podesta and Weber were all initially being pursued by the Manhattan based U S  Attorney s office for the Southern District of New York  but the probe related to Craig was transferred to federal prosecutors in Washington Craig denies misleading the Justice Department about his activity in Ukraine  saying in a statement on Thursday that the effort to prosecute him was  unprecedented and unjustified   According to the indictment  Craig was hired to write a report for the Ukrainian Justice Ministry about the prosecution of former Ukraine Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko Prosecutors say Craig concealed the fact that the project was largely funded by Viktor Pinchuk  a Ukrainian oligarch who was close to Bill and Hillary Clinton but also donated to the Trump Foundation after Donald Trump made a September 2015 speech in Kiev   Reporting by Mark Hosenball and Andy Sullivan  Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Cynthia Osterman  

WASHINGTON   One of the European officials in charge of a tough data privacy law says legislation now poised to emerge in the U S  won t be a copy of the EU s regime and will reflect American cultural values Vera Jourova  the European Union s consumer commissioner  also said Friday she assured U S  tech industry executives during a visit to Washington that the EU s sweeping  privacy shield  law will be  future proof  and won t hinder innovations such as the development of artificial intelligence Jourova met with Trump administration officials and U S  lawmakers  making the case that now that Europe has acted  the U S  must move to protect the privacy of consumers  data  I would like to see the law in the United States as soon as possible   she told reporters She is modestly optimistic that legislation will be enacted by Congress and signed into law  Jourova said Her visit came as momentum is building in Washington for a national privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of the largest tech companies to collect and make money from people s personal data  A federal law  the first of its kind in the U S   could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data  Companies would need permission to release such information At the same time  technology is galloping ahead  At a White House event Friday  President Donald Trump said the race to build 5G high speed wireless networks is one the U S  must win  The Federal Communications Commission said it will hold a massive auction to bolster 5G service  the next generation of mobile networks  with the government planning to spend  20 billion to expand broadband access in rural areas  The U S  is jockeying for position with China over 5G Behind the drive for a national privacy law is rising concern over the compromise of private data held by Facebook  Google and other tech giants that have reaped riches by aggregating consumer information Jourova had discussions with key senators working on privacy legislation  tech industry executives and the head of the Federal Trade Commission  Joseph Simons  We are fully at the disposal of the American legislators to give this feedback and experience  with the 10 month old EU privacy law  she said Friday   I fully recognize that the federal law  if there will be one  will not be copy and paste  This is another culture  another society  the citizens may want to see different solutions  It s fully in the hands of the American legislators  Jourova said questions came from senators and industry officials regarding the impact of the EU law on small and startup businesses  on citizens  ability to exercise their new privacy rights and on whether it will hinder innovation  Our answer to this is  the EU law  tries to be future proof and cover the new situations in the world of technologies which consume citizens  data   she said   We have the principle that the data can be used for research and business and artificial intelligence  after they are made anonymous Earlier this week  after discussions with European officials  Facebook changed the fine print in its terms of service to clearly explain to users that it makes money by using their data  The social media giant modified its terms and conditions to better inform users what they are signing up for  clearly explaining how it uses the data it collects on users to develop profiling activities and target advertising to score profits The EU regulators stepped up scrutiny of Facebook s terms after the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal  in which data on 87 million Facebook users was allegedly improperly harvested  The regulators also want tech companies to bring their terms in line with European consumer law Asked for her assessment of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg s recent call for tighter regulations to protect consumer data  Jourova said Friday that  whatever strong declarations  whatever commitments and declarations      we need to see real action   This can only be done by checking whether they are investigating the complaints of the people  following the cases  and this is the job of the data protection authorities in the EU   she said  

LONDON MOSCOW   Royal Dutch Shell pulled out of a project to build a Russian liquefied natural gas plant partly because Gazprom suddenly added another partner with links to an ally of President Vladimir Putin  according to five sources After three years work on the Baltic Coast project  Shell discovered that Gazprom was bringing in a company linked to Arkady Rotenberg  who is on a U S  sanctions blacklist The sudden change in the line up of partners was one of the key factors contributing to Shell s Wednesday announcement that it was pulling out of the project  according to three sources close to Shell and two other sources familiar with the project  Asked to comment on the reasons for withdrawing  a Shell spokesman said it had nothing to add to a previous statement that said its exit followed Gazprom s announcement last month of its final concept for the project  Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said the company was not commenting According to the two sources close to Shell  Gazprom did not consult with Shell about bringing in the firm  which is called RusGazDobycha  but instead presented it with the plan as a fait accompli With RusGazDobycha s arrival also came changes to the configuration of the project itself  which Shell did not feel comfortable with  all of the sources said It became untenable for Shell to stay in the project  and that was clear from the moment that Gazprom announced it was going to build the plant together with RusGazDobycha   said one of the sources familiar with the project A RusGazDobycha official did not respond to a request for comment  Asked if the presidential administration had any role in RusGazDobycha s entry into the project  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was a question for the companies involved  The sudden shift in the project underlines the unpredictability of doing business in Russia    even for a firm like Shell with a long pedigree of successful cooperation  It also shows how Rotenberg s business empire  focused mainly on construction and engineering  is expanding into the energy sector  Shell said that its other joint projects in Russia    chief among them the Gazprom led Sakhalin 2 LNG plant    would be unaffected by its exit from the Baltic LNG project  But Shell s involvement in Sakhalin expires this month  Unless the Russian government decides to extend the Sakhalin deal  Shell s portfolio of Russian projects will be left looking thin  The Russian government has given no indication as to whether it would extend Shell s Sakhalin contract   DIGGING YOUR OWN GRAVE One of the problems for Shell was that Rotenberg  a long standing friend of Putin and his former judo training partner  was under sanctions and that created sanctions risks for Shell too  according to one of the sources close to Shell and the second source familiar with the project For Shell  partnering with a Rotenberg linked firm was tantamount to  digging yourself your own sanctions grave   said that source But the other sources said the primary issue for Shell was the change in the configuration of the LNG project RusGazDobycha is 100 percent owned by a firm called National Gas Group  NGG   according to the Spark database  which collates official data from the tax agency and the state statistics agency Until November 2016  Rotenberg had a 51 percent stake in NGG  the database shows  The majority owner of NGG now is Artyom Obolensky  who is also chairman of the board of SMP Bank  controlled by Arkady Rotenberg and his brother Boris A representative of Arkady Rotenberg  asked about the Baltic LNG project  said Rotenberg  has no interests in this business  The brothers were both added to the U S  Treasury Department s sanctions blacklist in March 2014  The sanctions designation stated that the brothers had amassed enormous amounts of wealth during the years of Putin s rule  and that they had received high price contracts to carry out work for Gazprom and the 2014 Winter Olympic games in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi    Additional reporting by Maria Grabar  Vladimir Soldatkin Gleb Stolyarov and Polina Nikolskaya  Writing by Christian Lowe  Editing by Anna Willard  

NEW YORK   President Donald Trump s sister has retired as a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia  ending a civil misconduct inquiry launched after a report that she participated in Trump family schemes to dodge taxes The retirement of Maryanne Trump Barry was revealed in an April 1 order signed by a top court official in New York  where the misconduct case was assigned to prevent conflicts of interest for judges who knew Barry A judicial panel began the review in response to four citizen complaints filed in October after The New York Times published a story alleging the president and his siblings evaded inheritance taxes The April 1 order said Barry s voluntary Feb  11 retirement ends the review stemming from claims based on the news article alleging that Barry may have committed misconduct relating to tax and financial transactions that occurred mostly in the 1980s and 1990s The order said the complaint process was meant to correct conditions interfering with the  effective and expeditious  administration of court business  It said the resignation meant that Barry can no longer perform any judicial duties and thus can no longer be investigated Barry  82  was not identified by name in the order  but the facts matched her circumstances  and a copy of the order was sent to Scott Shuchart  an attorney who filed one of the complaints and had been promised by the court to be kept updated on its progress Shuchart said he was  absolutely disappointed  that Barry was able to end scrutiny of her actions by retiring  If the Times story is correct  then she participated in a decades long multimillion dollar tax fraud  That should be an impeachable offense  She gets her full salary   he said  I think it s appalling that we re continuing to pay this criminal and that she now has completely avoided consequence   Shuchart added   It s ridiculous  Barry didn t respond to an email seeking comment Chief Judge D  Brooks Smith of the 3rd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia released a statement calling Barry a  judicial giant  whose 36 years as a judge in the Philadelphia federal courts were  beyond exemplary   Judge Barry was a very hard working jurist with a sharp mind  keen instincts  and a quick wit  She was a role model for women in the law  and she took that responsibility seriously   Smith said Judge Theodore McKee  another of Barry s 3rd Circuit s colleagues  told The Associated Press that Barry was a meticulous judge who protected the court s reputation  and to the extent the complaints  may have cast aspersions on that  I know she would have been very concerned  The 15 000 word Times report last year said that Trump s father  Fred  transferred ownership of most of his real estate empire to his four living children before he died in the late 1990s The Times investigation  based in part on more than 100 000 pages of financial documents including confidential tax returns from the father and his companies  concluded that the value of the properties was vastly understated when they were reported as  41 4 million  It said the properties were later sold over the next decade for over 16 times that amount The Times reported Trump s parents transferred over  1 billion to their children  It said that the transfer should have produced a tax bill of at least  550 million  but that the children paid only about  52 2 million Trump has called the Times expose a false  hit piece  If members of the family did break any laws  the expiration of a statute of limitations makes a criminal prosecution unlikely  though lawsuits might be possible With a recently approved retroactive pay raise for federal appellate judges  Barry will receive  223 700 annually in retirement After her brother s election  Barry gave up her court staff and took inactive status in early 2017 A Republican  she was nominated for a judgeship by President Ronald Reagan and was elevated to the circuit court by President Bill Clinton    Dale reported from Philadelphia

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Friday called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and take additional steps to stimulate economic growth  his latest attempt to put the traditionally independent central bank under his thumb Speaking to reporters before traveling to the southwestern border  the president once again criticized the Fed s interest rate increases in 2018  saying  they really slowed us down   Mr  Trump  who is presiding over one of the longest sustained economic expansions in United States history  also said the Fed should do more to give the economy a lift   including resuming a stimulus program that he opposed when it began under President Barack Obama Mr  Trump s comments came on the same day the Labor Department reported strong job growth  with employers adding 196 000 jobs last month  His remarks also coincide with his efforts to install allies at the Fed as he heads into a re election campaign that will largely be a referendum on the state of the economy  While the economy is still strong and unemployment remains low  the effects of the president s  1 5 trillion tax cut are waning and his trade war has begun to hurt some American industries  as well as contributing to slower growth in China  Most forecasters see growth slowing this year  though Mr  Trump s economic advisers continue to see it speeding up But the president appears to be taking no chances  On Friday  he escalated his previous critiques of the Fed by pressing for it to resume the type of stimulus campaign it undertook after the recession to jump start economic growth  That program  known as quantitative easing  resulted in the Fed buying more than  4 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities as a way to increase the supply of money in the financial system  As the economy recovered  the Fed began to reverse that program  slowly winnowing its portfolio of bonds in a process known as quantitative tightening  Well I personally think the Fed should drop rates   Mr  Trump said   I think they really slowed us down  There s no inflation  I would say in terms of quantitative tightening  it should actually now be quantitative easing  Very little if any inflation  And I think they should drop rates  and they should get rid of quantitative tightening  You would see a rocket ship  Despite that  we re doing very well  The Labor Department s numbers signal a rebound from an unexpectedly lackluster February  It was the 102nd straight month of job gains  Wages were also up  with average hourly earnings in March 3 2 percent higher than a year earlier  And unemployment remained low at 3 8 percent  Read more about the March jobs report  which showed a return to solid growth  The president has become increasingly bold in his efforts to influence the Fed  which he and his advisers blame for economic growth falling short of the 4 percent annual rate last year as he promised  He has repeatedly criticized his handpicked Fed chairman  Jerome H  Powell  and has described the central bank as a counterweight to his economic policies The Fed raised interest rates four times last year  to the current range of 2 percent to 2 25 percent  drawing frequent rebukes from Mr  Trump  Such criticism is unusual for presidents  who typically avoid commenting on monetary policy But the Fed has since diverted from what had been a steady march of interest rate increases  in the face of stock market turmoil  growing domestic and global economic risks and pressure from Mr  Trump  The central bank does not expect to increase rates at all this year and has cut its growth projections to 2 1 percent for 2019 As he enters the 2020 campaign  Mr  Trump is banking on a much faster pace of growth than the Fed and most outside economists say is likely  Global growth is moderating  with slowdowns in Europe and China underway  And there are signs of weakness in the United States  where chief executives see investment  hiring and sales growth all slowing this year and business economists say the risks of undershooting economic growth are higher than overshooting Democrats denounced Mr  Trump s comments  saying they showed his disregard for the traditional independence of the Fed and his desire to use its powers to help him win re election  There s no question that President Trump is seeking to undermine the long term stability of the economy and independence of the Federal Reserve to boost his own re election prospects   said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the top Democrat on the Finance Committee Larry Kudlow  Mr  Trump s top economic adviser  said on Friday that the president was concerned about a global slowdown and wanted the Fed ensure the American economy continued to grow  We are facing a worldwide slowdown  You know  recession  arguably   Mr  Kudlow said in an interview on Bloomberg TV   Europe is not doing well  Germany itself may be in recession  That troubles us  Mr  Kudlow denied that the president was trying to infringe on the Fed s independence and said he simply wanted it to keep things thriving  We re not pressuring  We re not going after their independence   he said   We just don t want any threats to this rebuilding  reviving  growing economy  But in recent days  Mr  Trump has made it increasingly clear that he will do what it takes to keep the Fed heading in the direction he wants The president said on Thursday that he planned to nominate Herman Cain  a Republican who abandoned his 2012 presidential campaign in the face of sexual harassment allegations and who started a political action committee to combat what he claims is  misinformation  about Mr  Trump  to a seat on the Fed s seven member board  Mr  Trump also plans to nominate Stephen Moore  an adviser and conservative economist who has become a vocal critic of the Fed s interest rate increases Those selections are a marked shift from his previous nominations to the board  The president has tended to tap largely conventional candidates  not loyalists or those with starkly contrarian views  His choice of Mr  Powell for chairman was seen as a vote for consistency on the Fed  given Mr  Powell s approach was expected to be   and indeed has been   in line with his predecessor  Janet L  Yellen  who called for a moderate pace of rate increases Mr  Trump s three other Fed appointments have also been fairly unsurprising   Richard Clarida  whom he appointed as vice chairman  was a Columbia University economist and a scholar in monetary policy  Randal K  Quarles  who oversees bank supervision  worked in the financial industry and at the Treasury Department in previous Republican administrations and Michelle W  Bowman was the state bank commissioner of Kansas Wall Street analysts  economists and at least one Republican senator warned on Friday that Mr  Trump s choice of political actors could wind up compromising the Fed in a way that could be detrimental to the health of the economy  In our view  the selections could raise questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and could be perceived as an attempted politicization of monetary policy   researchers at Barclays wrote in a note to clients  adding   the experience of each candidate does not seem to be the main reason the Trump administration is considering their nominations  Senator Mitt Romney of Utah  who ran against Mr  Cain for the Republican nomination  told Politico that he would prefer nonpolitical appointees  I would like to see nominees that are economists first and not partisans  I think it s important that the Fed be a nonpartisan entity   Mr  Romney said   The key is that someone is outside of the political world and is an economic leader  not a partisan leader  It is unclear whether Mr  Moore or Mr  Cain  who are still undergoing background checks and have yet to be formally nominated  will be confirmed by the Senate  Mr  Trump has previously faced pushback on two of his Fed choices  neither of whom were considered highly contentious but nonetheless failed to gain traction Nellie Liang  an economist and financial regulation expert  withdrew from consideration after financial industry lobbyists worked against her nomination and Senate Republicans made clear they would not vote to confirm her  And Marvin Goodfriend  a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a former monetary policy adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond  Va   languished in the last Congress after lawmakers questioned his previous views on inflation For now  most Senate Republicans have said they will wait for confirmation hearings before determining their votes Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the Republican leader  has remained mum on both selections for the Fed  But aides and senators close to Mr  McConnell said that he had made it clear that he had no intention of moving ahead quickly with either nomination  giving the president and his staff ample time to vet both men and consider other candidates  

This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting  WASHINGTON   Seven years ago  when a former C I A  prisoner  Majid Khan  pleaded guilty at Guantánamo to being a courier for Al Qaeda  his lawyers were warned that any mention of the word  torture  would lead a court security officer to trigger a mute button so the public  listening on a 40 second delay  would not hear it This week the question of his treatment was front and center  this time in a pre sentencing hearing  Mr  Khan s lawyers asked a military judge on Monday to order prosecutors to produce evidence and witnesses about the secret prison network where the intelligence agency kept Mr  Khan incommunicado from March 2003 to September 2006  The material we seek  that is uniquely in the possession of the government  concerns Mr  Khan s torture   one of his lawyers  Katya Jestin  told the judge   The C I A  torture program in this case  your honor  appears to be the third rail  No security officer hit the mute button  A red light on the judge s bench used to signal a security breach never lit up Seventeen and a half years after the Sept  11  2001  terror attacks  and a decade after President Barack Obama ordered the C I A  to dismantle any remnants of its global prison network  the military commission system is still wrestling with how to handle evidence of what the United States did to the Qaeda suspects it held at C I A  black sites  While the topic of torture can now be discussed in open court  there is still a dispute about how evidence of it can be gathered and used in the proceedings at Guantánamo Bay  Cuba By law  prosecutors cannot use evidence gained through torture   or any other involuntary statements   at the war court  where eight of Guantánamo s 40 prisoners are accused of being complicit in terrorist attacks  Prosecutors have made clear that nothing the defendants said at the black sites will be used as evidence But defense lawyers have continued to press for details of what happened to their clients and to be able to use the information either to fight the charges or to win more lenient sentencing  And they have been aided by changing circumstances  not least the government s declassification of some details of how the prisoners were interrogated by the C I A The issue has been most intensely debated in Guantánamo s two death penalty cases  the 9 11 terror attacks that killed 2 976 people and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 in which 17 American sailors died Defense lawyers in those cases have sought for years to get access to eyewitnesses and graphic details from the C I A  sites  The lawyers want to use descriptions of torture to ask the judge to exclude some of the defendants  own statements after they left the black sites  The defense lawyers also have said they would cite torture to seek dismissal of the charges on grounds of outrageous government conduct  an extraordinary legal defense that is used in civilian courts but is seldom granted If the men are convicted  the lawyers want the details of how the defendants were treated to argue that the United States has lost the moral authority to execute men it has tortured ImageThe lawyers for Majid Khan  a prisoner at Guantánamo  say he was tortured in a C I A  black site CreditCenter for Constitutional RightsThe fight over access to evidence and witnesses from the black sites is one of the factors that has slowed progress in the cases  In the process  it has illustrated how fundamental legal issues about the rights of Guantánamo defendants remain unresolved   and how the passage of time is altering how some of them are handled The conflict is not limited to the death penalty cases  as Mr  Khan s proceedings show The topic of his torture was strictly taboo on Feb  29  2012  when he made his first court appearance since disappearing from his native Pakistan in 2003 at age 23  At that first hearing  Mr  Khan  who lived in suburban Baltimore for seven years and graduated from high school there in 1999  admitted to volunteering to work for Al Qaeda after Sept  11 and plotting with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  the accused architect of the attacks But in the intervening years  the Obama administration declassified details of what Mr  Khan said the C I A  did to him  By his account  he was beaten  hung naked from a wooden beam for three days with no food  kept for months in darkness  and submerged  shackled and hooded  into a tub of ice and water Additional details of his treatment were revealed in the partly declassified introduction to a Senate study of the George W  Bush administration s black site program  In his second year of C I A  detention  according to a cable cited in the study  the agency  infused  a purée of pasta  sauce  nuts  raisins and hummus up Mr  Khan s rectum  because he went on a hunger strike The C I A  calls this  rectal feeding   Defense lawyers call it rape Mr  Khan s lawyers now want to call witnesses and gather evidence to show his sentencing jury what happened to him The litigation over black site evidence has gone on for years  to the dismay of some family members who lost loved ones to Al Qaeda terrorists  particularly families of those killed on Sept  11  2001  when hijackers crashed four passenger planes into the World Trade Center  the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field  What our family members endured during the attacks on the airplanes and in the building was beyond torture   said Terry Strada  whose husband Thomas was killed in the World Trade Center She has campaigned for more transparency about what happened on Sept  11  But she sees the focus in the Guantánamo hearings on what happened to the defendants in the black sites as  stalling and stonewalling the process  In Mr  Khan s case  he has pleaded guilty to delivering  50 000 of Qaeda money to a Southeast Asian affiliate that was used to finance the bombing of a Marriott hotel in Jakarta  Indonesia  in 2003 that killed 11 people  He also admitted to agreeing to assassinate Pervez Musharraf  then the president of Pakistan  a plot that was never pulled off Under a plea agreement  he became what his military attorney  Lt  Cmdr  Jared Hernandez of the Navy  called  Guantánamo s sole high value cooperator  and can be sentenced to 25 years of confinement  He is being credited with time served since his plea deal  meaning he could get out in 2037 His lawyers say testimony about his years in C I A  custody could strengthen a post sentencing clemency petition  They also may ask the judge to grant him credit for those years in the C I A  prisons as pretrial punishment and reduce his sentence ImageAmerican troops standing guard outside Camp Delta at Guantánamo Bay Detention Center  By law  prosecutors cannot use involuntary statements at the war court  where eight of Guantánamo s 40 prisoners are accused of being complicit in terrorist attacks CreditRamon Espinosa Associated PressIn the military tribunal system  prosecutors are the gatekeepers of classified trial evidence  They have forbidden defense team members from independently contacting or investigating most former black site workers  The C I A  is shielding their identities as well as the nations that hosted the black sites  invoking national security  though most if not all the nations have already been identified publicly  The C I A  is not on trial   Jeffrey Groharing  a case prosecutor  told the judge at a hearing at Guantánamo on Nov  15  That same day  in a bid to persuade the judge that the prosecution had met its responsibility to provide information to the defense  Mr  Groharing stood at the war court and read aloud from documents the defense lawyers can use from a C I A  inspector general s investigation One described how  during an interrogation  Mr  Mohammed refused an interrogator s order to drink water  According to the document read by Mr  Groharing  Mr  Mohammed  was taken back to the bathing room  placed on a plastic sheet and a medical officer rehydrated Mohammed rectally  Mohammed clearly hated the procedure  When he was returned to the interrogation room  he then complied and drank water  In another document Mr  Groharing read  an unnamed senior interrogator described an unidentified black site as  good for interrogations  because it was  the closest thing he has seen to a dungeon  facilitating the displacement of detainee explanations  Spectators heard the audio on a 40 second delay from the gallery at the back of court  separated by triple pane glass   It s hard to imagine a more rich and vivid description than those statements   Mr  Groharing said Defense lawyers called the written accounts sanitized versions of the eyewitness testimony they sought Mr  Mohammed s lawyer  David Nevin  said the term rectal rehydration  is a polite way of saying rape with the insertion of a foreign object into the rectum  But how is it done  I d like to know  how is it done  One small detail can change a juror s mind about whether to vote for capital punishment  Mr  Nevin has said Eugene R  Fidell  who teaches military law at Yale Law School  said a showdown over black site evidence was foreseeable  The defense lawyers have to have the tools with which to perform their duty  especially in capital cases  No question   Mr  Fidell said   Somebody should have thought about that before they started torturing these people  He added   This was an accident waiting to happen  The only thing that surprises me is this is 2019 and the problem remains unresolved   

 Reuters    In an unusual event  U S  natural gas prices in West Texas have been trading in negative territory for more than two weeks  largely due to a lack of pipeline space  forcing some drillers to pay those with spare pipeline capacity to take unwanted gas Spot prices at the Waha hub   where prices for gas in the Permian basin are set   fell to a record low of minus  4 28 per million British thermal units last week  Prices have been negative in the real time or next day markets since March 22  WHY IS THERE SO MUCH NATURAL GAS SUPPLY The Permian is the nation s largest shale oil field  where production now exceeds more than 4 million barrels per day  bpd   But oil output also produces what is known as associated gas  seen by crude drillers as a waste product to be burned off or  flared  because there are not enough pipelines to remove it Construction of new oil and gas pipelines in the Permian has not kept up with output  which has more than doubled over the past three years as the United States has risen to become the world s largest oil producer But while oil can be stored in tanks and transported by truck or train  gas can only be transported by pipe  burned  or if special equipment is available  re injected into the ground  Recently  compressor problems on a pipeline in New Mexico exacerbated the problem  as it closed off a key artery for the gas  GRAPHIC  Texas natural gas prices turn negative  https   tmsnrt rs 2HV1CJY  HOW MUCH GAS IS BEING FLARED It depends on who you ask  Permian drillers flared a record 0 4 billion cubic feet per day  bcfd  in the third quarter of 2018 and are expected to flare at least 0 6 bcfd by mid 2019  according to Oslo based energy data provider Rystad Energy One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U S  homes for a day  Permian flaring came to 0 15 bcfd and 0 11 bcfd in 2017 and 2016  respectively  according to Texas Railroad Commission data interpreted by the Environmental Defense Fund  EDF   an environmental group EDF  however  believes drillers are burning more than the official figures  It used U S  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite data to estimate that Permian drillers burned twice as much gas in 2017   about 0 28 bcfd   than reported Officials at the Texas Railroad Commission were not immediately available for comment CAN DRILLERS BURN GAS FOR AS LONG AS THEY WANT Texas drillers can burn gas for 45 days under an initial flaring permit and get extensions for up to six months  In Texas  Rystad said it  observed an increased tendency  where gas is flared on new wells for four to six months Oil drillers that can no longer flare gas must ship it out or shut wells  but with crude prices at their highest levels in five months  drillers do not want to shut wells  DOES THAT MEAN EVERYONE WHO DRILLS IS PAYING SHIPPERS TO TAKE THEIR GAS AWAY Anyone who ships gas on a pipe must pay the pipeline company for use of the space  Normally  gas producers or their customers pay this fee  but can then sell the gas at the end of the line for a profit  And shippers with long term deals aren t affected Those that are paying negative prices are the drillers who did not in the past commit to shipments already  Because they don t have the space on the pipeline  they are paying others who already have it to take that gas  effectively losing money despite producing the gas  Several new pipelines are in the works to alleviate the constraints  but those projects will not enter service until late 2019 and later   Reporting by Scott DiSavino  Editing by Susan Thomas  

By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco CanepaFRANKFURT Reuters    The European Central Bank is all but certain to keep policy on hold on Wednesday  taking its time to evaluate whether its most recent stimulus cocktail is enough to arrest a rapid decline in sentiment With economic powerhouse Germany skirting a recession  the ECB has already been forced to backtrack on plans to tighten policy and now faces calls to do more  even though the root cause of the downturn  weak demand from abroad  is largely beyond its policy reach Meeting earlier than usual so they can attend the International Monetary Fund s spring meeting in Washington DC this week  ECB policymakers are also expected to discuss whether negative rates are still doing more good than harm But they are likely to stick to a long standing line that ultra easy policy is working as intended  and that banks remain net benefactors of record low rates so there is no acute need to compensate them for the hefty fee they pay to park their excess cash at the ECB The latter debate  simmering since 2016  is likely to intensify on Wednesday  however  as the growth slowdown suggests the ECB s  0 4 percent deposit rate could stay in negative territory even longer than now expected  ECB President Mario Draghi has already said the euro zone s central bank must consider whether it needs to mitigate the side effects of negative rates since banks transmit the bulk of the ECB s policy to the real economy One option under study is a tiered deposit rate  which would shield lenders from part of the cost  in a similar vein to moves by central banks in Switzerland and Japan   Although the ECB ruled out tiering in March 2016  the situation has since changed  and it could be implemented eventually if policy rates were to remain negative for even longer into 2020   Pictet Wealth Management economist Frederic Ducrozet said  In the end  tiering is all about the credibility of forward guidance and the ECB signalling its ability to cut rates again in the next downturn   Ducrozet added The ECB announces its rate decision at 1145 GMT  followed by Draghi s news conference at 1230 GMT CHANGES AT THE TOP But personnel changes at the ECB risk delaying the discussion about tiering or whether to push out a rate hike even further With ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet leaving in May and Draghi in October  policymakers are reluctant to decide on a fundamental revamp of monetary policy before new leaders take charge of the 19 country euro zone s most powerful institution  Draghi s successor will not even be named until after the European elections in late May  with confirmation likely only in late summer  A fresh survey of lending published on Tuesday  also eased the urgency for any mitigating measures  as lenders said they expected business credit to grow and lending standards to ease this quarter   Negative interest rates are bad for bank profits but they are also encouraging banks to make loans  which is exactly what the ECB wants to see   JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi said The ECB also needs to keep its remaining policy powder dry in case of market turbulence around Brexit and the continued escalation of a global trade war  with risks growing that the U S  administration will turn its attention to Europe Another complication with shifting to a tiered deposit rate is that it would signal low rates for longer  which is inconsistent with the bank s guidance for a growth rebound later this year and a rate hike in 2020  Should the weakness persist beyond the summer  the ECB would again need to push out the rate forward guidance  maybe until mid 2020  which could create an opportunity to introduce tiering   Societe Generale economist Anatoli Annenkov said   Editing by Catherine Evans

MERIDA  Mexico   Mexican and U S  business leaders on Friday pushed back against President Donald Trump s threats to close the U S  Mexico border and urged him to drop steel tariffs that have hindered the ratification of a trade deal brokered last year At a meeting in the eastern Mexican city of Merida attended by government officials from both countries  business lobbies united to call on Trump to drop his threats to disrupt border trade after days of hold ups on the frontier Describing the U S  Mexico relationship as a top priority  U S  Chamber of Commerce head Tom Donohue told a news conference the United States should exempt Mexico and Canada from steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by Trump last June before its Congress approves the deal struck to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement  That is why we are the first out of the gate to warn against the disastrous consequences of closing the U S  Mexican border   Donohue said  sitting next to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  who warmly applauded his speech Mexico is the United States  second biggest export market  and third biggest trading partner  U S  Mexico trade is worth about half a trillion dollars a year Mexico and Canada want Trump to drop the metals tariffs before their lawmakers approve the deal agreed in September known as the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA  Tensions over the border are further hindering the process Following a surge in asylum seekers who mostly traveled through Mexico from Central American countries  Trump last month threatened to close the border if Mexico did not immediately halt illegal immigration  His government then redeployed border agents to police the frontier  sparking delays which have cost businesses on both sides millions of dollars After Donohue spoke  Carlos Salazar  president of Mexico s powerful CCE business lobby  weighed in to say he hoped the U S  government understood the need to keep the border open  And let s not confuse migration problems with trade problems and industry problems   Salazar said  seated on the other side of Lopez Obrador  who again applauded the speech Lopez Obrador himself  as he has for months  avoided any implicit or explicit criticism of Trump  instead offering thanks to the American president for  being open to deal with our commercial  migratory and security matters with respect  Trump s Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross looked on  seated next to Salazar  but did not address the news conference The event was part of the latest iteration of a recurring business forum known as the U S  Mexico CEO Dialogue On the sidelines  Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez met Ross and again urged the United States to end the metals tariffs for Mexico  part of a set of national security measures Trump had ordered under the so called  Section 232  mechanism In addition  the minister asked that Ross push forward talks aimed at reaching a quick deal in a stop start tomato dispute between Mexican and U S  producers Marquez was able to tout a workers  rights bill that Mexico s lower house of Congress approved late on Thursday  legislation that U S  House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for to win Democratic support for USMCA U S  Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette met Mexico s Energy Minister Rocio Nahle and later said she had indicated to him that her government did not plan to roll back an energy overhaul passed by the previous administration The 2013 14 reform opened up oil production and exploration to private capital  drawing significant interest from U S  investors  At the time  Lopez Obrador roundly attacked the reform  However  he has since said he will give private operators time to show that they can increase output Lopez Obrador wants to revive state oil company Pemex and plans to build an  8 billion refinery in his home state of Tabasco  A U S  embassy spokesman said that Mexican officials hoped to help fund the project by reducing tax evasion   Reporting by Anthony Esposito and Dave Graham  Editing by Grant McCool

WASHINGTON   Erik Brunetti s four letter fashion brand starts with an  F   and rhymes with  duct   The federal government calls it  scandalous  and  immoral  and has refused to register the trademark  Brunetti has a different word for his brand and designs   thought provoking   We wanted the viewer to question it  Like  is that pronounced the way I think it s pronounced   he said of his streetwear brand  FUCT   which began selling clothing in 1991 On Monday  the Supreme Court will hear Brunetti s challenge to a part of federal law that says officials should refuse to register trademarks that are  scandalous  or  immoral   Brunetti says it should be struck down as an unconstitutional restriction on speech The government is defending the century old provision  The Trump administration says in court papers that the law encourages trademarks that are appropriate for all audiences  It argues it isn t restricting speech but rather declining to promote it Brunetti and others like him who are denied trademark registration under the  scandalous  provision can still use the words they wanted to register for their business  nonprofit or brand  They just don t get the benefits that come with registering a trademark  For Brunetti  that would largely mean a better ability to go after counterfeiters who knock off his designs Brunetti would seem to have a strong argument  Two years ago  the justices unanimously invalidated a related provision of federal law that told officials not to register disparaging trademarks  In that case  an Asian American rock band sued after the government refused to register its band name   The Slants   because it was seen as offensive to Asians In court  the justices had no trouble saying the band s name  but Brunetti s brand may be different  His lawyer  John R  Sommer  says he plans to say the individual letters of the name   F U C T   which Brunetti sometimes does too  Another possible workaround  explaining the brand is something of an acronym for  Friends U Can t Trust  Part of Sommer s argument is what he sees as the arbitrary nature of the United States Patent and Trademark Office s decisions about what gets tagged as scandalous or immoral  A lawyer working for the office who is from the South might find something  not nice  that wouldn t faze a lawyer from the Bronx  Sommer said  That means  you can register profanity if you re lucky  and you get assigned a lawyer who allows it  Sommer said Two New York University professors gave that argument substantial support in a brief they filed in the case  They showed that the office routinely refuses to register trademarks both by saying something is scandalous and  ironically  too confusingly similar to something that is already registered  For example  the office refused to register  FUK T  for being scandalous and immoral but also confusingly similar to the already registered  PHUKIT     MIDDLEFINGER  was denied after  JONNY MIDDLEFINGER  was registered  and  Ko Kane  was rejected after  Kokanee  was registered  And those are just some printable examples Brunetti said the trademark office has registered trademarks  far more offensive than my mark  The trademark office declined to comment on the case If Brunetti wins  the public is unlikely to notice a whole lot of change  his lawyer said  Retailers will decide what products are appropriate for their customers  and Target and Walmart aren t going to carry Brunetti s brand  Sommer said Brunetti hopes a victory at the high court will help him pursue counterfeiters  In the nearly 30 years since he began his company from his bedroom in Venice  California  he s produced thousands of clothing designs  Some of the best known are parodies involving the Ford logo and  Planet of the Apes  These days  he directs a staff of four from a downtown Los Angeles office  They release new clothing on their website about once a month  Some items have sold out in less than a minute  and new collections are always sold out in under three days  Brunetti said  Because of the items  scarcity  some are resold on eBay for a profit  with a T shirt that cost  40 sometimes fetching more than  100 Brunetti said he s never met anyone truly offended by his brand  Most people find it clever   he said     

 Reuters    The U S  Environmental Protection Agency will unveil a proposal to speed state level permitting decisions for energy infrastructure projects soon  the agency s chief told Reuters on Thursday  blasting states that have blocked coal terminals and gas pipelines on environmental grounds President Donald Trump is seeking to boost domestic fossil fuels production over the objections of Democrats and environmentalists concerned about pollution and climate change  On Wednesday he issued a pair of executive orders targeting the power of states to delay energy projects  We started working on it in advance  so we hope to have something out soon   EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview  He was unable to provide a precise timeline Based on Trump s orders  Wheeler s EPA has been tasked with clarifying a section of the U S  Clean Water Act that has allowed states like New York and Washington to delay projects in recent years New York has used the section to delay pipelines that would bring natural gas to New England  for example  and Washington state has stopped coal export terminals that would open the Asian market for struggling coal companies in Wyoming and other landlocked western states  They are trying to make international environmental policy   Wheeler said of Washington state  whose governor  Democrat Jay Inslee  is running for president on a climate change focused platform   They re trying to dictate to the world how much coal is used  Wheeler said New York  which amid strong public pressure denied a clean water act permit for construction of a natural gas pipeline to New England  is forcing that region  to use Russian produced natural gas   We are importing Russian natural gas which is not produced in an environmentally conscious manner  If the states that are blocking the pipelines were truly concerned about the environment  they would look to where the natural gas would be coming from    I think it s very short sighted   he said Wheeler said the EPA would not prevent a state from vetoing a project  but would clarify the parameters they should be able to consider  and the length of time they have to do so He also said that California is playing politics in its fight with the EPA to preserve its more stringent vehicle emission standards as the national standard  CLIMATE  NOT A PRIORITYWheeler said he believes climate change is a problem  but that it had been overblown by former President Barack Obama s administration   at the expense of other bigger issues like water quality  Yes  climate is an issue and we are working to address it  but I think water is a bigger issue   he said  Wheeler dismissed the findings of a report released earlier this week by EPA scientists in the journal Nature Climate Change that detailed the scale and urgency of climate change  He said while he encouraged EPA scientists to carry out and publish research  he stressed the recent paper  did not reflect EPA policy  Environmental groups say the EPA s replacement of an Obama era rule limiting carbon emissions from power plants would likely lead to increased emissions by allowing older  more polluting coal plants to operate longer  Asked whether the replacement   the Affordable Clean Energy rule  which gives states responsibility for regulating emissions   is stringent enough  Wheeler said it adheres to the parameters of federal law  I think what is effective regulation is one that follows the law and one that will be held up in court   he said Several Democrats challenging Trump in the 2020 election have made climate change a top tier issue  embracing aggressive policy platforms like the Green New Deal calling for an end of fossil fuels use  Asked whether he was concerned that the EPA may be out of synch with polls showing an overwhelming number of young people believe climate change should be a priority issue  Wheeler was dismissive   I do fear that because so many people only talked about climate change  You re right  there could very well be a new generation coming up saying that s the only environmental issue   and it s not   he said   Additional reporting by Humeyra Pamuk and David Shepardson  Editing by Dan Grebler  

LITTLE ROCK  Ark    Arkansas Gov  Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday he ll sign legislation cutting off funding to  sanctuary cities  that don t cooperate with federal immigration authorities despite the Republican s objections that the measure could open the door to racial profiling The governor announced he would sign the measure   which would also prevent cities from blocking local law enforcement from asking about a person s citizenship or immigration status  Any cities found to be in violation would be ineligible to receive discretionary funds administered by the state Hutchinson  a former federal Homeland Security official during the George W  Bush presidency who oversaw border security efforts  had asked the bill s sponsors to require probable cause before law enforcement asked about citizenship and immigration status  He said that without the change there would be too much opportunity for racial profiling  Lawmakers rebuffed the request  but Hutchinson said the sponsor assured him he was willing to change the law in a special or regular session to include that language The governor said he opposes sanctuary cities and generally supports prohibiting such policies  Hutchinson  however  repeated his concern that the bill doesn t allow cities to give law enforcement guidance and would leave it up to officers about when to ask for proof of citizenship  This would lead to profiling and indiscriminate questioning of citizens of the United States based solely on the officer s determination that the citizen looks different than what the officer thinks a U S  citizen should look like   Hutchinson wrote   This is contrary to the fundamentals of our Constitution  Hutchinson told reporters that concern wasn t enough to veto the bill since there aren t any sanctuary cities in Arkansas as defined by the bill  I don t see any change in policy going forward that would be disruptive to our society   he said The bill s opponents said the measure opens the state and cities to lawsuits and that officials need to reassure the immigrant community that they re welcome  Our immigrant community is afraid  and they are so confused  They don t even know if they can come out of their houses right now   Mireya Reith  founding executive director of Arkansas United  an immigrant advocacy group The majority Republican House earlier approved the bill by a 71 24 vote and sent it to Hutchinson s desk  Supporters have called it a preventive measure  This is not about racial profiling  This is about following the law   House Majority Leader Marcus Richmond  who voted for the bill  said on the floor Several Republican states have enacted measures prohibiting sanctuary policies  which have also been targeted by President Donald Trump Opponents have said the proposal would damage law enforcement s relationships with the immigrant community  Another opponent made a religious appeal to colleagues as she urged them to vote against the bill  We in this room are lawmakers and if we are lawmakers who claim Christ we can and should do the work of making just and fair laws that also embody the compassion of Christ and his command to welcome the stranger into our communities   Democratic Rep  Megan Godfrey said Under the bill  the state s attorney general would investigate complaints that a city had illegal sanctuary policies  If the city was found to be in violation  it would be ineligible for discretionary funds administered by the state Hutchinson announced his decision after signing two bills cheered by the immigrant community  including one that allows public colleges and universities to charge in state tuition to certain students currently paying higher  out of state rates  That includes students in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program  a program implemented during former President Barack Obama s administration allowing young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children to remain in the U S  Another bill Hutchinson signed would allow DACA recipients to get nursing licenses  We re a welcoming state and we want to be able to continue that   Hutchinson said at the bill signing ceremony   I don t want anything to overshadow the good news by these two bills and that we ll continue to be a nation of law  but also a nation of compassion

WASHINGTON   Trade disputes and tighter financial conditions are among the top threats to a slowing world economy  global finance officials said on Saturday  urging countries to take steps to shore up growth The global expansion  now seen at its most sluggish pace in three years  is likely to firm up next year  but central banks and fiscal authorities have limited policy options to drive a rebound  officials said in the joint communique of the International Monetary Fund s steering committee   While we expect to see a pickup  in growth  next year  trade tensions  geopolitical risks  political instability are among the challenges   Lesetja Kganyago  the committee s chairman and the South African Reserve Bank s governor  said at a press conference after the panel adjourned its semi annual meeting  We agreed we need to act promptly to protect the expansion   Fiscal policy for example should remain flexible and growth friendly  rebuild buffers  and strike the right chord between debt sustainability and supporting demand   Kganyago said  capping the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington The sober mood among finance leaders at the meetings this week was a stark contrast to the optimism that characterized the gathering one year ago when officials were heralding a rare period of robust and synchronized growth  This week s proceedings kicked off with the IMF cutting its global growth outlook for the third time in six months  The world economy will likely grow 3 3 percent this year  the slowest expansion since 2016 and 0 2 percentage points below the global lender s estimate from January Major central banks including the U S  Federal Reserve have responded to the slowdown by putting policy tightening efforts on hold  That has eased the pressures that global financial markets felt at the end of 2018  which contributed to the unwanted tightening of financial conditions partly blamed for the economic weakening Growth is projected to firm up in 2020  the IMF said  but some officials are worried the expected rebound will be threatened if the weakening in developed economies such as the United States  Japan and Europe worsens  Despite the expected improvement in global economic growth  if economic slowdowns in major economies feed into other economies  the prospects for growth might deteriorate  bringing uncertainty across the entire global economy   Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said in his statement to the IMF committee There is some cause for optimism  In Europe  many of the global factors weighing on growth appear to be waning  keeping alive expectations for a recovery in the second half of the year  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said at a separate press conference But he also warned that factors that undermine confidence  including the risk of a hard Brexit and a global trade war  continue to  loom large   putting growth at risk U S  CHINA TALKS Trade disputes  especially the standoff between the United States and China  have been a central talking point at the meetings this week and have been widely cited as a primary driver behind the weakening of the global economy  If you model tariffs on a large portion of the goods that are traded  you take the entire volume of goods traded between the U S  and China in particular   500 billion  you apply tariffs to that  you are putting at risk 0 8 percent of global growth   IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said Earlier  China took a swipe at U S  President Donald Trump s  America First  policies at the center of the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies  including tit for tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods  The protectionism of some countries has harmed mutual trust among countries  limited the scope for multilateral cooperation  and impeded the willingness to achieve it   Chen Yulu  a vice governor at the People s Bank of China  PBOC   said in a statement to the IMFC U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters on the sidelines of the meetings that a U S  China trade agreement would go  way beyond  previous efforts to open China s markets to U S  companies and hoped that the two sides were  close to the final round  of negotiations Japan  which will kick off its own negotiations with the Trump administration in Washington on Monday aimed at averting automotive tariffs  also bemoaned the current state of trade  The prolonging of trade tensions and policy uncertainties pose a serious risk to the global economy by undermining private investment  disrupting global supply chains and weakening productivity growth   Aso said   Reporting by David Lawder  Leika Kihara  Pete Schroeder and Balazs Koranyi  Writing by Dan Burns  Editing by Paul Simao  

 Reuters    Michael Avenatti  the combative lawyer known for his battles with U S  President Donald Trump  was indicted on charges of defrauding clients  including allegations that he withheld a multimillion dollar settlement he won for a paraplegic man  prosecutors said on Thursday The indictment came about three weeks after Avenatti  who gained national fame for representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in her litigation against Trump  was arrested in New York on separate criminal complaints filed by federal prosecutors in New York and California Federal prosecutors in California announced the indictment after a grand jury found late on Wednesday that there was probable cause to pursue charges against Avenatti  The 48 year old lawyer  a Los Angeles resident  said he planned to fight the charges and plead not guilty  I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one sided version meant to sideline me   Avenatti  who is free on a  300 000 bond  wrote on Twitter on Thursday  The federal complaint in California charges Avenatti with 10 counts of wire fraud  accusing him of misusing more than  12 million he received on behalf of clients following settlements and other negotiations   Money generated from one set of crimes was used to further other crimes  typically in the form of payments designed to string along victims so as to prevent Mr  Avenatti s financial house of cards from collapsing   Nicola Hanna  the U S  attorney for California s Central District  said at a news conference in Los Angeles Avenatti became a prominent critic of Trump and a frequent guest on cable television news while representing Daniels  whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  She sued the president over a nondisclosure agreement that in the weeks before the 2016 U S  presidential election kept her from discussing her claims that she and Trump had an extramarital affair 10 years earlier  Prosecutors say Avenatti misled clients and misused their funds to pay personal and legal expenses  finance a coffee shop business he also ran  and pay for his share of a Honda private jet  according to the indictment  Federal authorities seized the jet on Wednesday  prosecutors said  In one case  prosecutors said that Avenatti concealed a  4 million settlement won by a client in 2015 from Los Angeles County after he became paraplegic in an unspecified incident  instead giving the man periodic advances of  1 900 and paying the rent at his assisted living facility The client  referred to only as  Client 1  in the indictment  was identified as Geoffrey Johnson by his lawyer  Joshua Robbins  On Thursday  Avenatti said on Twitter that the accusation that he had mishandled clients  money was  bogus nonsense  and posted an undated testimonial signed by Johnson that praised him as an  exceptional  honest and ethical attorney   Johnson no longer stood by that statement  his lawyer said  It was signed before he was aware of the fraud   Robbins said in an interview  adding that Avenatti lied to Johnson in order to get him to sign the testimonial in March  shortly before Avenatti s arrest  Lawyers for Avenatti did not immediately return calls for comment on the statement According to the indictment  Johnson s efforts to buy a house failed because Avenatti withheld the settlement money  and Avenatti lied to the U S  Social Security Administration about the settlement to conceal the embezzlement  leading the agency to cut off Johnson s benefits  TAX CRIMESThe indictment also accuses Avenatti of various tax crimes  He is accused of failing to file personal tax returns since 2010 and to pay  3 2 million in payroll taxes on his coffee business  even though he withheld some portion of this money from employee paychecks The indictment said he defrauded a Mississippi bank of  4 1 million in loans by submitting false tax returns for 2011 to 2013 that inflated his income The most serious bank fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of 30 years per count  prosecutors said  Federal sentencing guidelines typically call for defendants to serve less than the maximum time The New York prosecutors have separately accused Avenatti of trying to blackmail athletic wear maker Nike Inc for more than  20 million Daniels  who replaced Avenatti as her lawyer last month  has said she was  saddened but not shocked  by his arrest   Reporting by Jonathan Allen  Additional reporting by Brendan Pierson  Gina Cherelus  Gabriella Borter and Daniel Wallis  editing by Frank McGurty and Leslie Adler  

HOUSTON   President Trump signed two executive orders on Wednesday that he says will speed up construction of pipelines and other projects to enhance the production and transport of oil and natural gas between states and across international borders The actions are unlikely to have much of an immediate impact  and they will probably attract legal challenges by state governments seeking to preserve control over such projects  But the orders are symbolically important for a president who likes to take credit for a boom in energy production and exports  And he delivered the message in Texas  an oil rich Republican state where Democrats recently made electoral gains One order directs the Environmental Protection Agency to review and tighten rules to make it more difficult for states to scuttle pipelines by invoking provisions of the Clean Water Act Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo of New York  an opponent of hydraulic fracturing  has blocked natural gas pipelines that would connect several Northeastern states to Pennsylvania s Marcellus shale gas field  A shortage of natural gas pipeline capacity prompted Consolidated Edison to impose a moratorium on new gas connections last month in parts of Westchester County The other executive order would transfer authority for approving the construction of international pipelines from the secretary of state to the president  eliminating a lengthy State Department review process  The goal is to speed up projects like the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico Mr  Trump issued a new presidential permit last month to Keystone XL  which has been delayed since the early years of the Obama administration  But the pipeline is being contested in the courts by environmentalists  farmers and some Native American groups  Too often  badly needed energy infrastructure is being held back by special interest groups  entrenched bureaucracies and radical activists   Mr  Trump told an audience at the International Union of Operating Engineers training center in Crosby  Tex   near Houston   This obstruction does not just hurt families and workers like you  It undermines our independence and national security  ImageMiles of unused pipe  prepared for the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline  piled up in North Dakota in 2014  An executive order by President Trump is intended to speed up international pipeline projects by eliminating State Department review CreditAndrew Burton Getty ImagesEnvironmentalists were quick to criticize the orders issued Wednesday  which they said would exacerbate climate change  President Trump is curtailing the public s voice in an attempt to force dirty energy projects on communities across America   said Joshua Axelrod  a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council   Pipelines like Keystone XL pose dangers to our water  our farms and our climate  But oil executives said the orders would give Washington greater flexibility as it tried to limit oil exports from Venezuela and Iran while keeping gasoline prices low  These are things that are good for our country and for the energy business to continue to help us be energy independent   said Dale Redman  chief executive of ProPetro  a major Texas oil service company Delays in pipeline construction have long bedeviled oil and gas companies  constraining production growth in West Texas and elsewhere  But new pipelines crossing Texas will be completed at the end of this year and in 2020 without much federal intervention In some cases  oil field economics  not federal policy  have stood in the way of new pipelines  Many energy companies have been burning gas that bubbles up with crude oil   a process known as flaring   because gas prices are so low that it would not be profitable to build pipelines to bring all of it to market But several states have put up roadblocks to Mr  Trump s efforts to champion fossil fuels like oil  gas and coal  Washington State has blocked the building of export terminals vital to the survival of the Western coal industry at a time when utilities are shutting down coal fired power plants  And Michigan last month halted an underwater oil pipeline project proposed by Enbridge  a major Canadian energy company  to import oil from Canada Mr  Cuomo said in a statement on Wednesday   President Trump s executive order is a gross overreach of federal authority that undermines New York s ability to protect our water quality and our environment  Wednesday s orders direct federal officials to pursue policies designed to expedite projects  For example  the president is telling Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta to review barriers to financing energy projects  including decisions by universities and pension funds to divest from oil  gas and coal companies  And he is instructing the Transportation Department to allow freight railroads and tanker trucks to haul liquefied natural gas  a growing export commodity

NEW YORK   The March floods that punished the U S  Midwest have trapped barrels of ethanol in the country s interior  causing shortages of the biofuel and helping to boost gasoline prices in the western United States The historic floods have dealt a series of blows to large swaths of an ethanol industry that was already struggling with high inventories and sluggish domestic demand growth  The ethanol shortages are one factor pushing gasoline prices in Southern California  including Los Angeles  to the highest in the country  and they could top  4 a gallon for the first time since 2014  according to tracking firm GasBuddy Benchmark price for ethanol used in most supply contracts initially jumped on news of the floods but has been hobbled by rising waters around the Chicago hub that have halted barges and sales  That stands in contrast to prices on the coasts  which rose dramatically   drawing in heavy imports from Brazil  the main U S  ethanol competitor  The floods inflicted billions of dollars in damage to crops and homes in the U S  Midwest  and knocked out roughly 13 percent of ethanol capacity  U S  ethanol is made from corn and required by the government to be blended into the country s fuel supply to reduce emissions  While some ethanol plants were flooded  the primary effect of the rising waters was to shut rail lines that serve as the main arteries for corn and ethanol deliveries  Ethanol prices on the coasts spiked due to shortages  but Midwest producers have been unable to take advantage because of washed out rail lines  market sources told Reuters   Unfortunately for anyone who was impacted by logistics issues it was a double whammy  You couldn t capture the rally   said one trader  At Chicago s Argo terminal  the nation s main ethanol pricing hub  the cash price for ethanol fell for an eighth straight session last week to  1 29 a gallon  the longest downward skid since April of last year  according to Oil Price Information Service  which does daily assessments  Initially  fears of widespread plant outages boosted that benchmark  but plants proved more resilient than expected  continuing to produce despite logistical challenges  U S  ethanol inventories were at 24 million barrels for the week ended March 29  just off a record hit a week earlier  according to U S  Energy Information Administration data  Chicago s price acts as the benchmark for millions of barrels bought and sold via longer term supply contracts each day  While that price faltered  ethanol prices at the coast have surged  helping plants owned by Pacific Ethanol Inc and White Energy in California and Texas to take advantage of higher prices  Ethanol delivered into Los Angeles typically trades at 20 cents a gallon higher than Chicago  but that premium rose to as high as 50 cents a gallon  traders said  The price in New York Harbor was at roughly double normal levels  traders said The tight ethanol supplies  along with refinery outages  boosted retail gasoline prices and led to some gas station shutdowns in the West as blenders there lacked the ethanol needed to blend with gasoline to make fuel that meets government regulations  Gas prices in Arizona averaged  2 89 per gallon on Monday  17 percent higher than last month  according to the American Automobile Association  Prices were even steeper in California at  3 80 a gallon  well above the national average of  2 74 a gallon Cash prices in the state s physical market suggest further increases  In Los Angeles  spot gasoline on Monday was offered 10 cents a gallon higher from where it traded on Friday  putting it at a premium of 69 cents a gallon above the NYMEX futures benchmark   Ultimately  Los Angeles could get close to seeing that average at  4 a gallon   Patrick DeHaan  head of petroleum analysis at tracking firm GasBuddy  said  adding that much of that increase will come because of refinery outages in the state  At least one county in California has already surpassed  4 a gallon  The highest recorded average price for the state was  4 67 a gallon  in October 2012  according to AAA  The high coastal prices attracted barrels from the biggest U S  competitor  Brazil  Overall ethanol imports to the United States totaled 558 279 barrels in March  the most seasonally since 2013  according to Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data  Most of the imports during the month came from Brazil  according to the tracking data   Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Stephanie Kelly  additional reporting by Erwin Seba  Editing by Lisa Shumaker and David Gregorio  

TRIPOLI BENGHAZI  Libya   After years of sabre rattling  eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar ordered his troops on Thursday to march on the capital Tripoli  escalating a conflict with the internationally recognized government Seeking to encircle the capital his forces approached from south and west  seizing one town south of the city before stopping for the night some 60 km  37 miles  south of Tripoli  eastern officials said The offensive marked a dramatic escalation of a power struggle that has dragged on in Libya since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 The capital is the ultimate prize for Haftar s eastern parallel government  In 2014 he assembled former Gaddafi soldiers and in a three year battle seized the main eastern city of Benghazi  then this year took the south with its oilfields The offensive surprised the United Nations  whose Secretary General Antonio Guterres flew on Wednesday to Tripoli to help organize a reconciliation national conference Asked about the offensive  Guterres said Libya needed a political  not a military  solution  His Libya envoy Ghassan Salame sat next to him stone faced with folded arms Guterres stayed in the fortified U N  compound on Tripoli s outskirts for the night and plans to meet Haftar on Friday  a U N  spokesman said But there was no sign that the east was willing to stop a move that was announced by Haftar in a speech full of talk about victory  To our army which is stationed at the outskirts of Tripoli  Today we complete our march   he said in an audio tape Haftar  called  Mushir  by supporters  which means  field marshal  in Arabic  has built his name by fighting Islamists  But many of his opponents see him as a new Muammar Since Gaddafi s downfall  the country has been divided between the U N  backed government in Tripoli and the parallel administration allied to Haftar Armed groups from the coastal city of Misrata  who oppose Haftar  moved to Tripoli to defend it  residents said The governments of France  Italy  the United Arab Emirates  Britain and the United States said in a joint statement that they were deeply concerned about the fighting  The offensive stared with the capture of Gharyan  a city some 80 km south of Tripoli after brief skirmishes with forces allied to Tripoli based Prime Minister Fayez al Serraj SETBACKThe offensive is a setback for the United Nations and Western countries which have been trying to mediate between Serraj and Haftar  who met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss a power sharing deal  The conference the U N  is helping to organize is aimed at forging agreement on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya  an oil producer and a hub for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara in the hope of reaching Europe Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates  which see him as bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily  according to U N  reports Haftar has also fostered ties with Saudi Arabia where he was received by King Salman last week  No details have emerged  but analysts say the visit likely helped him boost ties with ultra conservative Muslim Salafists  who are counted among his troops and follow Saudi preacher Rabae al Madkhali The Salafists are also based in the west of Libya including Tripoli  where a Salafist force controls the airport  It is allied to Serraj  but has changed sides before like other groups in the capital  Serraj has no full time troops The offensive followed the same pattern used by anti Gaddafi rebels in 2011  with the main thrust at Tripoli coming from the south  Gharyan is strategic because it is the last town before a coastal plain  and a base for fighters to fall back to if a battle for the capital drags on A group allied to Haftar also moved to take a checkpoint 27 km west of the capital  hoping to cut the coastal road to Tunisia  Tripoli s lifeline  residents said Haftar s biggest opponent is Misrata  a western city home to strong forces which also have aircraft  analysts say  It is known for resisting old regime figures  including in 2011 when forces loyal to Gaddafi besieged it for three months Evoking this spirit  members of Misrata armed groups said in video message they will they stop Haftar and his  zahaf   Arabic for crawl  a word used by Gaddafi for his popular marches   Reporting by Ulf Laessing  Ahmed Elumami  Ayman al Warfalli and Tom Miles  writing by Ulf Laessing  Editing by Andrew Heavens  Richard Chang and Daniel Wallis  

JERUSALEM   Benjamin Netanyahu s apparent re election as prime minister of Israel attests to a starkly conservative vision of the Jewish state and its people about where they are and where they are headed They prize stability  as well as the military and economic security that Mr  Netanyahu has delivered Though in many ways they have never been safer  they remain afraid   especially of Iran and its influence over their neighbors  against which Mr  Netanyahu has relentlessly crusaded  They are persuaded by his portrayal of those who challenge him  whether Arab citizens or the left  as enemies of the state  They take his resemblance to authoritarian leaders around the world as evidence that he was ahead of the curve They credit Mr  Netanyahu  whose strategic vision values power and fortitude above all  with piloting Israel to unprecedented diplomatic heights and believe still more is possible  And they are loath to let anyone less experienced take the controls  Let s be honest with ourselves   said Michael B  Oren  a former Israeli ambassador to Washington   Our economy is excellent  our foreign relations were never better  and we re secure  We ve got a guy in politics for 40 years  We know him  the world knows him   even our enemies know him  Not everyone is so enamored of him Mr  Netanyahu s coalition appears to have won 65 of the 120 seats in Parliament  But his positions on the issues differed little from those of his main challenger  Benny Gantz  suggesting that close to half of the electorate would have simply preferred someone else in the job As he assembles a new coalition  how Mr  Netanyahu manages that divide will be his first test  With a new term and an expanded Likud party  he could form an even larger right wing coalition of secular  ultra Orthodox and even some extremist lawmakers   or  if he chooses  he could to try to forge a national unity government that brings in centrists Whatever he decides  Mr  Netanyahu has been afforded the opportunity to lead Israel through a serious turning point in its history as both a Jewish and a democratic state  if his legal troubles do not topple him first An election that was all about personality and character   whether Mr  Netanyahu s likely indictment on corruption charges made him unfit to continue in the job  or whether Mr  Gantz  was up to it   left little room for issues of policy To his credit  Mr  Gantz  who conceded on Wednesday  won a record number of Parliament seats for a new party  But Mr  Netanyahu proved once again that his talents  stamina and willingness to do what it takes to win are all unmatched in Israeli politics But serious concerns for Israel that were essentially set aside in the campaign are fast approaching  As he surpasses David Ben Gurion  Israel s founding leader  as its longest serving prime minister this summer  Mr  Netanyahu will be unable to ignore any of them for long Peace with the Palestinians remains as unlikely as ever  despite the possible wild card of a long awaited proposal from the Trump administration  Mr  Netanyahu s right wing allies  to whom he may be even more beholden under his next coalition  are champing at the bit to pursue annexation of the occupied West Bank In desperation to rally the pro settler base  Mr  Netanyahu said publicly three days before the election that he would begin applying Israeli sovereignty to parts of the West Bank that the Palestinians demand for their future state  Opponents believe this would set off a new Palestinian uprising  bring to fruition the apartheid regime the Israeli left has long warned against  or both ImageConstruction in the Israeli settlement of Beitar Illit last year  Mr  Netanyahu said during the campaign that he would begin applying Israeli sovereignty to parts of the occupied West Bank CreditMenahem Kahana Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesEven without annexation in the mix  Mr  Netanyahu s settler  and ultra Orthodox dominated government  and his effusive embrace of President Trump  have rapidly alienated Israel from predominantly liberal and less observant American Jews  the largest diaspora community and a pillar of Israel s security since its founding Israel is becoming a partisan issue in the United States like never before  already forcing those seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020   including Bernie Sanders  Pete Buttigieg and Beto O Rourke   to distinguish their support for Israel from their disapproval of Mr  Netanyahu s policies Finally  though it has received little notice outside Israel  a power struggle between the judiciary   one of the country s last redoubts of assertive liberalism   and ascendant ethnonationalists has been building toward a showdown that could sharply alter the nature of Israeli democracy While conservatives have been working to curtail the Supreme Court s power through legislation  the court itself has been laying the groundwork to assert judicial review over even the so called basic laws that Parliament considers the building blocks of an eventual constitution  which Israel now lacks  Imagine the American Supreme Court judging the constitutionality of part of the Constitution itself   said Gadi Taub  a historian and Hebrew University professor who opposes settlements and annexation but supports a rollback of judicial authority Mr  Netanyahu has not led the effort to rein in the Supreme Court  but he has railed against the legal system as a whole  over the long running police corruption investigations that have led to his expected indictment on bribery and fraud charges That campaign  too  is expected to present a challenge for Israel s democratic system  Mr  Netanyahu is now almost certain to try to extract a deal from his coalition partners to pass a law retroactively granting him immunity from prosecution Israelis have grown accustomed to Mr  Netanyahu s bullish PowerPoint assessments of the country s condition  10 years of uninterrupted economic growth  its best ever credit rating  and diplomatic openings and new trading partners in Africa  Asia and Latin America  During the campaign  they also got used to clips showing Mr  Trump granting recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital and of Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights  both coveted national goals ImageMr  Netanyahu with President Trump and other officials in March  as the United States recognized Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesDorit Rabinyan  an author who calls herself left wing  said Israelis feared Mr  Netanyahu s exit as if they would be  orphaned   And she confessed to having a tinge of the same feeling herself   I m anxious about it at the very same time that I m hopeful about it   she said Critics point to a yawning income gap between those prospering in Israel s high tech industry and those in the middle class or living outside the major cities  A housing crunch  clogged highways and a crushing cost of living are keeping many young adults in their parents  homes and driving others to emigrate That gave Mr  Netanyahu s opponents on the left and even the center right ample ammunition  He s provided short term profits at a very high long term price   said Ari Shavit  a Jerusalem born journalist who has followed Mr  Netanyahu throughout his career   Netanyahu s Israel is mortgaged  And we are going to pay dearly  Mr  Shavit said the same could be said for Mr  Netanyahu s failure to use Israel s position of strength and strategic comfort    this golden moment    to take on its single most existential issue  the Palestinian conflict  and for his exploitation of Mr  Trump s largess at the cost of  endangering the relationship with Democratic America  younger America and the next administration in Washington  Mr  Taub said he expected Mr  Netanyahu to continue his decade long practice of slow walking settlement expansion  as the right complains  and sabotaging peace talks  as the left complains  Gantz  with his high talk of values  optimism  change  sounded like Obama in 2008   Mr  Taub said   But no one in Israel thinks there s

Netanyahu was best suited to reach a deal  at last  no matter how much his coalition partners fought it  It s the old adage  The left makes war  the right makes peace   Mr  Oren said   Netanyahu will be extremely loath to say no to Trump  which could prove to be the success of that program  On the West Bank  however  few share that view Ghassan Khatib  a professor at Bir Zeit University and former spokesman for the Palestinian government  said Mr  Netanyahu s long tenure had already left behind two devastating casualties  any hope for a two state solution and any support for moderate Palestinian leadership  whose investment in a diplomatic solution to the conflict Mr  Netanyahu has discredited Mr  Khatib said that Mr  Netanyahu  by politically empowering the extreme right wing in recent years  had contributed to a radicalization that has made Israelis averse to peacemaking   The Israel that we talk about now is not the Israel we negotiated with 25 years ago   he said   I think that Netanyahu s taking us into some kind of apartheid reality  It is precisely because Mr  Netanyahu has been so successful that some on the left argue that his leadership is undermining Israel s seemingly irrepressible democracy Anshel Pfeffer  the author of  Bibi   a critical biography of Mr  Netanyahu  said he believed that by campaigning as the  indispensable man   Mr  Netanyahu had  created a narrative where it s illegitimate or irresponsible to replace him  ImageCampaign posters in Rheovot  Israel  Mr  Netanyahu is on track to surpass David Ben Gurion  Israel s founding leader

solve your issues with the Palestinians and end the occupation  and resolve your outstanding issues with Arab countries  you won t realize your incredible potential     he said   You ll have a spartan lifestyle  you ll have to go to war all the time  and the world may isolate you   the diplomatic tsunami  And it s inarguable that in the last 10 years  Netanyahu has broken this paradigm  Yet  at the same time  Mr  Netanyahu has fueled and directed the right wing s animosity at predominantly liberal institutions like the courts  the police  higher education and the news media  To the left  Israeli democracy is on the defensive  To the ethnonationalist right  which succeeded last year in enshrining Israel s self definition as the nation state of the Jews in a basic law  it is in need of an

that Israel has too healthy a democracy  Some  including Mr  Gantz  have warned that Mr  Netanyahu was headed down a path toward a regime like that of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey Mr

WASHINGTON   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that he believed the United States and China were nearing the final stage of trade negotiations  moving closer to what he said would be the biggest change in the economic relationship between the countries in 40 years Mr  Mnuchin s note of optimism comes as the world s two largest economies are racing to end a protracted trade dispute that has resulted in damaging tariffs and business uncertainty and provided a drag on the global economy  We re hopeful that we re getting close to the final round of concluding issues   he told reporters on the sidelines of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Mr  Mnuchin again repeated his claim that the biggest obstacle to a trade deal   how to enforce the agreement   is nearly settled  The United States has been pushing China to agree to a mechanism that would allow Washington to impose tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing reneges on certain parts of the deal On Saturday  Mr  Mnuchin said that the United States and China would both have the authority to enforce commitments that are agreed to  indicating the ability for Beijing to exert some control in the future as well  We ve already agreed there s a big component of this that there will be real enforcement on both sides   he said   including a detailed enforcement office on both sides with significant resources  At a congressional hearing in February  Robert E  Lighthizer  President Trump s top trade negotiator  described a complex enforcement mechanism under discussion that aimed to ensure China would live up to its promises Mr  Lighthizer said at the time that China had agreed to regular meetings at the levels of office director  vice minister and minister that would allow the United States to keep tabs on China s behavior and air complaints from companies about unfair business practices  If China did not keep its promises  the United States would respond  proportionally but unilaterally   The implication was that the United States would respond with tariffs American officials have also been pressing China to agree not to retaliate against the United States if it reimposes tariffs on Chinese goods  China has been reluctant to agree to a one sided enforcement mechanism  viewing it as infringing on its sovereignty and giving Washington too much power over its economy  If complaints are real  we may have to use tariffs to deal with them  and we re asking the Chinese not to retaliate   Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  told the Fox Business Network in March when discussing enforcement of a deal People who have been closely tracking the talks cautioned that enforcement continued to be an obstacle that remained unsettled because China and the United States had not agreed on the specifics of penalties  The problem with the so called enforcement issue has to do with finding a mechanism that allows punishment for violations of the agreement   said Michael Pillsbury  a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration   That hasn t been done yet  On Saturday  Mr  Mnuchin would not clarify whether the United States and China had agreed on an enforcement mechanism that would allow only Washington to respond with tariffs as punishment for violating the deal  I want to be careful in answering that because I don t want to get into the details of the negotiations and specifically on tariffs   he said But Mr  Mnuchin said that he expected enforcement of the trade pact to be reciprocal  There are certain commitments that the United States is making in this agreement and there are certain commitments that China is making  and I would expect that the enforcement agreement works in both directions   he said   We expect to honor our commitments and if we don t  there should be certain repercussions  and the same way in the other direction  Mr  Mnuchin would not specify what commitments the United States was making  Mr  Trump has been pushing China to open its economy and end practices that he says have put American companies at a disadvantage The deal under discussion would require China to end its longstanding practice of requiring American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition of doing business there and would open portions of China s economy more liberally  The two sides have discussed China s buying more than  1 trillion worth of goods over the next several years to help lower the trade gap between the countries To get China to the negotiating table  Mr  Trump slapped tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods  That punishment has begun to pinch China s economy and Beijing s negotiators are demanding that at least some of the tariffs be removed as a condition of any final deal  It remains unclear how many   and at what point   those tariffs will be lifted The Treasury secretary made clear that there were still provisions that need to be completed and that a deal was not yet certain Officials from the United States and China are in regular contact by telephone  Mr  Mnuchin said  and they are determining if additional face to face meetings are needed  

WASHINGTON   Global finance officials are pledging closer cooperation in efforts to lift the world economy out of its current slowdown  but tensions persist between the United States and other nations over trade and other issues Officials wrapped up the spring meetings of the 189 nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on Saturday  expressing hope the slowdown that began last year will be followed by stronger growth in the second half of this year and into 2020 The IMF s steering committee said all members  in order to protect the current economic expansion  would  act promptly to shore up growth for the benefit of all  At a closing news conference  the committee chairman  Lesetja Kganyago  head of the central bank of South Africa  said every country needs to be ready to address issues involving financial stability  with all available tools  Many nations were jolted last year when stock markets went into a nosedive  reversed only when major central banks  including the Federal Reserve  halted efforts to tighten credit policies Separately  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that both the United States and China were moving closer to an agreement on trade  The trade war between the world s two biggest economies and the punitive tariffs each nation has imposed on the other raised widespread concerns during the talks But Chen Yulu  deputy governor of People s Bank of China  struck a less positive stance in his remarks to the IMF policy committee  contending that rising trade protectionism in the form of punitive tariffs had already begun to disrupt global supply changes  The protectionism of some countries has harmed mutual trust among countries  limited the scope for multilateral cooperation and impeded the willingness to achieve it   he said The U S  and China have imposed tariffs on  350 billion worth of each other s goods  They are battling over U S  allegations that China deploys predatory tactics   including cybertheft and forcing foreign firms to hand over trade secrets   in a sharp elbowed effort to challenge American technological dominance In his meeting with reporters  Mnuchin said he had told the other finance officials that the US China negotiations were making progress but he would not disclose a timeframe for when they might be wrapped up  He said both sides had conducted phone discussions over the past week  but he wasn t certain whether more face to face meetings would be needed  If we are able to conclude this  it will be the most significant change in 20 years  in the economic relations between the two nations  Mnuchin said He said that the proposed agreement the two sides are working on has seven chapters and includes language that will allow both countries to set up enforcement offices to make sure the deal is followed In remarks to the World Bank s steering committee on Saturday  Mnuchin said the U S  was encouraged that the bank s private sector lending operation wanted to step up support for nations  affected by fragility  conflict and violence   But he said World Bank officials must ensure such support is aimed at boosting effective private investments in poor countries David Malpass  a longtime World Bank critic  took over as president of the bank on Tuesday with the backing of the administration  Reviewing the meetings this week  Malpass said that the challenges facing the World Bank were more urgent than ever with over 700 million people around the globe still living in extreme poverty  It is critically important that we work tirelessly to foster broad based growth  raise median incomes  create jobs and fully incorporate women and young people in economies   Malpass said in a statement President Donald Trump said in a newly published interview that he had considered his daughter Ivanka  a White House adviser  for the job of World Bank president  She would have been great at that because she s very good with numbers  She s got a great calmness      I ve seen her under tremendous stress and pressure   he was quoted as telling The Atlantic When Jim Yong Kim resigned suddenly as bank president earlier this year  reports said that Ivanka Trump along with Malpass were being considered for the job  which has always gone to an American Before the meetings of the policy setting panels of the IMF and World Bank  finance ministers and central bank presidents of the Group of 20 major economies held discussions Thursday and Friday G 20 officials agreed with a downgraded IMF forecast released this week  It predicted global growth would be 3 3  this year  the slowest since the Great Recession ended in 2009  but would regain momentum and advance to growth of 3 6  in 2020       This story corrects spelling of last name of South Africa s central bank chief to Kganyago  not Kganyuago  

WASHINGTON   The risk that global economic growth could slow more than expected spurred a call on Friday from top finance officials for countries to overcome trade differences and opt for multilateral cooperation and  timely policy action  Policymakers from the Group of 20 industrialized countries are worried that the weakness evident in key economies could spread  especially if elevated trade tensions  such as those between the United States and China  escalate further   The balance of risks remains skewed to the downside   Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said at a news conference following a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers   We recognise the risk that growth prospects might deteriorate if weakening in key economies feed into each other  Aso s remarks dovetail with those of other officials gathered in Washington for the spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  many of whom fret that self inflicted wounds from protectionist trade policies are to blame for the weakness  The week s proceedings kicked off with another downgrade of global growth estimates from the IMF Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda emphasised the need for countries to take steps to foster a more dynamic global economy  There was a shared understanding among the G20 members that each country needs to take timely policy action   Kuroda said at the news conference As the chair country of this year s G20 proceedings  Japan wants to deepen talks on global imbalances   an effort to divert Washington s attention from bilateral trade imbalances and stave off U S  pressure to negotiate two way trade deals German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz  speaking at an event on the sidelines of the meetings in Washington  said the rules based order of multilateralism is increasingly under threat and leaders must uphold international cooperation Scholz called on the United States to overcome trade differences with Europe  which erupted again this week when U S  President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on  11 billion worth of European Union products  including commercial aircraft  I believe this is a matter of principle  it s not just about achieving some short term economic gain  It s not about the art of the deal   Scholz said in reference to the best selling business advice book credited to Trump Scholz s consternation is understandable given the global downshift in growth is most evident at the moment in Europe  where the outlook has been further clouded by the uncertainty over Britain s departure from the European Union An internal European Central Bank model presented to policymakers on Wednesday indicates euro zone growth was just above 0 2 percent in the first three months of the year and could be somewhat weaker in the second quarter  two sources told Reuters on Friday IMF FUNDINGThe Trump administration was also at odds with other IMF stakeholders on the need to boost the global lender s resources and update its governance  although it does support extending a portion of the IMF s  254 billion crisis fund Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeated the U S  opposition to increasing overall funding and shareholding quotas  likely meaning the effort to lift IMF funding and reshuffle voting rights was a dead issue at this week s meetings The voting quotas were last altered nearly a decade ago  In our view  the IMF currently has ample resources to achieve its mission  and countries also have considerable complementary resources should a crisis emerge   Mnuchin said in a statement for the IMF s steering committee meeting that was posted on the IMF s website on Friday Without U S  backing for an update to the IMF s stakeholding weights  there was little prospect for a change at this week s meetings  There is no majority in sight for any changes regarding IMF quotas   a German official said on condition of anonymity The IMF s last quota increase was agreed in 2010  boosting the shareholding and influence of major emerging markets including China and Brazil The IMF has current total lending capacity of about  1 trillion  including the New Arrangements to Borrow crisis fund that was greatly expanded in 2009 at the depths of the last financial crisis That fund is set to expire in November 2022  Mnuchin said it was important for the IMF to maintain sufficient financial resources to respond to potential crises  British finance minister Philip Hammond expressed concern the lack of a funding boost could hamper the IMF s ability to step in to help Venezuela respond to its worsening humanitarian and economic crisis   This set of meetings is crucial to the debate about IMF quotas and funding for the IMF   Hammond said  We all anticipate that as events unfold in Venezuela  at some point there will be a need for a major programme to support Venezuela  So the UK is very keen to ensure that the IMF in particular is properly funded  Oil rich Venezuela is embroiled in political and economic turmoil as socialist President Nicolas Maduro battles to retain power in the face of U S  and Western powers  backing of opposition leader Juan Guaido IMF and World Bank shareholders  meanwhile  are still undecided on whether to recognise Guaido as the South American nation s leader   Reporting by David Lawder  David Milliken  Jason Lange  Leika Kihara  Michael

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  Vaccine skeptics were planning a lawsuit against New York City  A Hasidic woman was heckled when she boarded a public bus  Family members were avoiding weddings for fear of encountering unvaccinated relatives  When Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday an emergency health order requiring measles vaccinations  he said the step was necessary to curtail the large measles outbreak in the ultra Orthodox Jewish community  But as health officials plunged into Brooklyn s Williamsburg neighborhood to enforce the mandate  tensions only escalated  Mr  de Blasio s effort seemed to mobilize an already well organized network of vaccine skeptics  Their latest tactic  circulating court affidavits for community members to sign so they can express opposition to mandatory vaccinations ahead of a planned lawsuit   I am a religious Jew  whose religious convictions are being blatantly violated by the vaccine Diktats  which are a clear violation of the Nuremberg Code  which forbids forcing medical procedures on anyone without their fully informed consent   the form says  It continues   Childhood diseases  like measles and chickenpox  unlike smallpox and ebola  are not a legitimate public health menace  and do not justify an emergency declaration   On Tuesday  Mr  de Blasio said unvaccinated residents in certain ZIP codes in Brooklyn must receive a measles vaccination or face a  1 000 fine  The next day  20 city health inspectors began auditing vaccination records at yeshivas  and 15 disease detectives started interviewing those who had potentially been exposed to the highly contagious virus  the Health Department said  But many who support vaccines say they worry that the city is missing the mark by not addressing the crucial issue  the misinformation flooding Hasidic communities that tells them to be wary of vaccines  Literature and hotlines spread debunked theories about immunizations  falsely warning that they cause autism and lead to other health problems   Monkey  Rat and Pig DNA   How Misinformation Is Driving the Measles Outbreak Among Ultra Orthodox JewsApril 9  2019Blima Marcus  an ultra Orthodox nurse practitioner at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  said she understood the city s actions  but she raised concerns about whether they would be effective  In the last week alone  60 new cases of measles were confirmed in New York City  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  and suburban Westchester County reported its first eight cases   It s a public health problem   Ms  Marcus said   But ultimately  I don t think it will help in the long term because this doesn t get to the root of the problem  which is widespread misinformation and no corresponding education  Ms  Marcus said she and other Hasidic health professionals were putting the finishing touches on a pro vaccination magazine and creating a hotline to dispel myths promulgated by the anti vaccine movement  The magazine  which will be called Parents Informed and Educated  or Pie  is a direct response to Peach  a 40 page publication that is a main vehicle of misinformation  We re seeing a lot more interest in people wanting to get involved   Ms  Marcus said   They re really angry at the anti vax movement  They re ashamed  City officials say countering the anti vaccine movement is a priority  and they are holding meetings with rabbis  doctors and community members  Health care providers have distributed 8 000 more vaccines between October and April than they did in the same period in the previous year  officials said  But Dr  Peter Hotez  the director of the Texas Children s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development  echoed Ms  Marcus s concerns  saying the city s efforts could fall short   Unless you begin dismantling this anti vaccine media empire  you re not going to have a big impact on any specific public health measure   he said  In the wake of the emergency order  Jewish leaders say they fear a continued rise in anti Semitism  In recent months  Hasidic neighborhoods have been the targets of a slew of anti Semitic hate crimes  and Jewish leaders reported another one on Thursday Rabbi David Niederman  the president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg  said a city bus driver tried to refuse service to a Hasidic woman in Brooklyn  The driver eventually let the woman board  Mr  Niederman said  but then shouted  measles  at her and directed her to move to the back of the bus  Maxwell Young  a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority  which oversees the city s buses  said the agency was investigating the episode and had  absolutely zero tolerance for discrimination  Mr  de Blasio s administration has also faced criticism for not reacting quickly enough to the measles outbreak  which began last fall after unvaccinated children returned from Israel   I don t think they moved fast enough  but now that they re moving  I m with them   said Arthur Caplan  a bioethicist at the New York University School of Medicine  Mr  Caplan said that the emergency order was appropriate given the scale of the

WASHINGTON   Greg Craig  who served as former President Barack Obama s top White House lawyer  was charged on Thursday with lying about work he performed in 2012 for Ukraine in a case that grew out of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation Craig  74  faces up to 10 years in prison for charges of making false statements and violating a lobbying law  the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA   He is accused of lying to the Justice Department about his work after he left the White House on a legal review that largely vindicated the prosecution of a political enemy of Viktor Yanukovych  the Russian aligned president of Ukraine at the time Craig said in a statement he headed a team of lawyers that worked on an independent report for Ukraine s justice ministry  After researching FARA requirements  they found they did not need to register as foreign agents under the law  This prosecution is unprecedented and unjustified  I am confident that both the judge and the jury will agree with me   Craig said Craig s lawyers indicated he would plead not guilty  He is scheduled to appear in the U S  District Court in Washington on Friday Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher   Flom LLP  the New York law firm that produced the report  agreed in January to turn over the  4 6 million it was paid and retroactively register as a foreign agent  as part of a settlement with the Justice Department Skadden produced the 187 page report at the behest of Paul Manafort  the former chairman of Donald Trump s presidential campaign who is currently serving a 7 1 2 year prison sentence for lobbying violations and financial crimes Manafort was apparently happy with Craig s work   You are  THE MAN    he wrote Craig in an email after the report received favorable media coverage  according to the indictment The report was meant to be an objective review of the Ukrainian government s prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko  the country s former prime minister who was convicted in 2011 on corruption charges and sentenced to seven years in prison It criticized Tymoshenko s behavior during the trial and concluded that her due process rights had not been violated  but also said that she had been improperly imprisoned during the trial The report was used by Yanukovych s government to justify Tymoshenko s pretrial detention to the European Court of Human Rights and influence U S  lawmakers  Yanukovych was one of Manafort s main lobbying clients FUNDED BY UKRAINIAN BILLIONAIREAccording to the indictment  Craig covered up aspects of his work in order to avoid registering as a foreign agent under FARA  a rarely enforced law that was enacted in 1938 to counter Nazi propaganda Had Craig complied with the law  he would have been forced to reveal that funding for the report largely came from Viktor Pinchuk  a Ukrainian billionaire  Pinchuk paid the firm  4 million for its work  according to Skadden filings made as part of its settlement The Ukrainian government only paid Skadden  12 000   an amount so low that it aroused suspicion in Ukrainian media Craig also failed to disclose that Skadden was simultaneously helping out with Tymoshenko s prosecution on other charges  prosecutors say   That would do enormous damage to the credibility  of the report  Craig wrote in an email to other Skadden attorneys  according to the indictment Craig privately had reservations about Tymoshenko s treatment but left them out of the report  the indictment said  Evidence of criminal intent   i e   that she intended to commit a crime   is virtually non existent   he wrote in a memorandum that was not included in the report  according to the charges During his tenure as Obama s White House counsel from January 2009 to January 2010  Craig led the administration s unsuccessful effort to shut down the U S  military prison in Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  He also represented former President Bill Clinton during his 1998 Senate impeachment trial  Another Skadden lawyer  Alex van der Zwaan  pleaded guilty last year to lying to investigators about the report  Craig s case stems from Mueller s 22 month investigation into whether Trump s presidential campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election That probe led to charges against 34 people  including Russian agents and former key Trump allies  but Attorney General William Barr said last month that Mueller did not find enough evidence to charge Trump or others with criminal conspiracy Barr also said he decided there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice  He is expected to release a redacted version of Mueller s final report to Congress next week   Additional reporting by Sarah N  Lynch  Tim Ahmann  Nathan Layne and Mark Hosenball  editing by Lisa Shumaker  Bill Berkrot and Chris Reese  

JERUSALEM   After a campaign widely seen as a referendum on his rule  Benjamin Netanyahu is the winner of Israel s election as he heads toward a record setting fifth term as prime minister The Likud party s apparent victory paves the way for Netanyahu to build a coalition with his ultra Orthodox and religious nationalist allies Here s a look at some other winners and losers in the election THE WINNERS THE ULTRA ORTHODOX VICTORYUltra Orthodox Jewish parties  the prime minister s key allies in the past three governments  gained a handful of seats  The Sephardi Orthodox party Shas  for example  rose to become the third largest party in parliament  Ultra Orthodox parties commanded 13 seats in the previous parliament  With most ballots counted  the two ultra Orthodox parties were projected to win a total of 16 combined seats Like the previous Netanyahu administration  ultra religious parties will likely wield outsized influence despite comprising less than 20  of Israel s Jewish population THE RIGHT WING GAMBLENetanyahu drew sharp condemnation at home and abroad for brokering an alliance of religious nationalists and ultranationalist extremists called the Union of Right Wing Parties  Representatives of a religious ultranationalist faction inspired by the banned Kahanist movement  branded a terrorist organization by the U S  for an agenda that includes forced expulsion of Palestinians  merged with a religious settler party Netanyahu s gambit paid off  and the Union scraped past the electoral threshold Their win may embolden Netanyahu to pursue a hard line agenda that could see Israel entrench its control over the West Bank  and extinguish hopes for a future Palestinian state The parties have also signaled they ll stand by the prime minister if he is indicted on corruption charges  and support him in passing immunity laws to protect him from prosecution THE NEWCOMERFormer army chief Benny Gantz proclaimed victory to an exuberant crowd at Blue and White s election party in Tel Aviv  when exit polls had him in a dead heat with Netanyahu  He woke up Wednesday to news that  though his party matched the Likud s votes  the tentative election results gave Netanyahu s potential coalition of religious and nationalist parties a clear majority in parliament The Blue and White party later conceded defeat  but vowed to  embitter  Netanyahu and his allies from the opposition The party leaders said their  exceptional outcome  proved that a broad spectrum of Israelis sought  a true alternative  to Netanyahu s 10 consecutive years in office  Gantz said that his party managed in 70 days to match the power of a party that s been a dominant force in Israeli politics since the 1970s THE LOSERS THE LANGUISHING LEFTIsrael s liberals and socialist left wing bloc suffered a major defeat  The Labor Party  which founded Israel and dominated politics for its first 30 years  plummeted to a historic low of just six seats in the 120 member parliament Several factors  including disillusionment with party chairman Avi Gabbay  contributed to Labor s fall  But most significantly  the centrist Blue and White party supplanted Labor as the main viable alternative to long ruling Likud  siphoning off support from the left The dovish Meretz party lost parliamentary seats  earning the minimum of four  The country s Arab parties  plagued by low Arab turnout and divided by infighting among faction leaders  dropped from 13 seats to just 10 Far from its heyday in Israel s pioneering age  Israel s left now appears doomed  as Yohanan Plesner from Israel s Democracy Institute said   to represent a mere niche  THE FALLEN STARSThe New Right party  led by Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked  may not win the necessary 3 25  of the vote to qualify for the Knesset  Israel s parliament The pair of popular pro settler ministers split from their religious nationalist Jewish Home party and sought greater power by drawing secular voters  That maneuver decidedly backfired UP IN SMOKEUltranationalist libertarian Moshe Feiglin s Zehut party  touted as the Cinderella story of the election  also saw its parliamentary hopes evaporate as actual votes fell short of the minimum needed to enter parliament Feiglin attracted a flurry of attention on the campaign trial by appealing to young religious nationalist voters with a platform of marijuana legalization  free market economics and annexation of the Israeli occupied West Bank   along with a slew of other contentious policies  such as rejecting American military aid and paying Arabs to emigrate if they refused to accept Jewish sovereignty Pre election polls predicted Feiglin would be a possible kingmaker  But having failed to make the cut  former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon  leery Netanyahu allies  are now poised to become coalition power brokers  

WASHINGTON   The Senate on Thursday confirmed acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to lead the department on a permanent basis  despite complaints by Democrats that the former oil and gas lobbyist has used his federal position to benefit former industry clients Senators voted 56 41 to approve Bernhardt s nomination to oversee more than 500 million acres of public lands and other resources  including national parks  monuments and wildlife refuges  He succeeds Ryan Zinke  who resigned in January amid a series of ethics investigations Bernhardt represented energy and agricultural interests until President Donald Trump picked him in April 2017 to be deputy secretary Bernhardt  who was confirmed to the No  2 position in July 2017  says he has complied with all ethics laws and rules  But Democrats and environmental groups accuse him of using his federal post to shape regulations and legislation in favor of oil and gas interests and other former clients  The Zinke ethics hurricane was bad enough  America should not be harmed again by a Bernhardt ethical typhoon   said Sen  Ron Wyden  D Ore Citing figures from the Office of Government Ethics  Wyden said at least 27 former clients representing the oil and gas industry  coal  water districts and agriculture pose  unlimited numbers of conflicts of interest  for Bernhardt  The interior secretary is supposed to be running  the department  for the benefit of the public  not for special interests   Wyden said Wyden and other Democrats said Bernhardt has taken actions to weaken the Endangered Species Act  including erosion of protections for a California fish species long targeted by a former client  the Westlands Water District  one of the largest and most politically powerful water utilities in the country Critics also say Bernhardt has acted to ease regulations holding oil companies accountable for spills and increased drilling and mining access on millions of acres of public land used by the sage grouse  a threatened bird species Sen  Lisa Murkowski  an Alaska Republican who leads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee  said Bernhardt  49  has the experience and expertise needed to lead the department  The Colorado native worked at the Interior Department for eight years under President George W  Bush  including as the department s top lawyer  He is from the West  he has great familiarity with the issues that will come before him and he has proven that he can ably lead the department   Murkowski said  She said Bernhardt  has proven to be a strong partner not only for Alaska  but states all across the country  She linked ethics allegations against Bernhardt to unspecified   pretty well funded groups that are working very hard and very energetically against his nomination  Three Democrats   Sens  Martin Heinrich of New Mexico  Joe Manchin of West Virginia  and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona   voted for Bernhardt  as did independent Sen  Angus King of Maine  who caucuses with Democrats Democrats and environmental groups also criticized Bernhardt for failing to stand up to Trump on his proposal to drastically expand offshore drilling along the East and West Coasts  including off the coast of Florida  where a moratorium on offshore drilling expires in 2022 Florida Republican Sens  Marco Rubio and Rick Scott voted in favor of Bernhardt after receiving assurances from him and other administration officials that Florida would be excluded from drilling proposals Rubio said in a statement that the department cannot legally take Florida off the table until public comments are received  But  he said   I am confident that when all is said and done the ban on oil drilling off of Florida s coasts will remain in place  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Bernhardt s refusal to rule out offshore drilling in Florida  should be a wake up call to my colleagues all up and down the coasts   Atlantic  Pacific  Gulf   that offshore drilling is a possibility despite bipartisan opposition  It is hard to imagine someone whose background is so at odds with the department s mission as Mr  Bernhardt   Schumer said   President Trump  for all his talk of draining the swamp  wants to add yet another Washington swamp creature lobbyist to his cabinet  Kieran Suckling  executive director of the Arizona based Center for Biological Diversity  said Bernhardt  will be even worse than Ryan Zinke  Bernhardt  has spent decades scheming to undercut protections for wildlife and public lands across the country   Suckling said  His confirmation  puts him in the perfect position to turn those nightmarish dreams into reality  But Randall Luthi  president of the National Ocean Industries Association  said Bernhardt s  unparalleled depth of experience and knowledge of energy and conservation policies will serve our nation s public lands and resources well   

DUBAI  United Arab Emirates   Iran s Revolutionary Guard  designated a  foreign terrorist organization  by the Trump administration on Monday  evolved from a paramilitary  domestic security force with origins in the 1979 Islamic Revolution to a transnational force that has come to the aid of Tehran s allies in the Mideast  from Syria and Lebanon to Iraq The force answers only to Iran s supreme leader  operates independently of the regular military and has vast economic interests across the country Here are key things to know about the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  or IRGC ORIGINS The Revolutionary Guard was created in parallel to the country s existing armed forces to consolidate power under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the 1979 Islamic Revolution The following year  it was called upon to defend Iran and its clerical leadership in a ruinous war with Iraq that would last eight years and strengthen the guard s ideological  economic and security footprint at home The group is estimated to have between 125 000 and 150 000 members today  but it s unclear how many of those include the Quds Force  an elite wing of the IRGC that oversees foreign operations  The group  enshrined in the constitution  answers only to Iran s supreme leader    DOMESTIC GRIP The IRGC oversees the country s ballistic missile program and has conducted several tests since the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers  While the accord does not specifically ban those tests  U S  officials have said they violate the spirit of the deal  President Donald Trump last year pulled America out of the deal and re imposed tough economic sanctions on Iran Additionally  the guard runs a massive construction company called Khatam al Anbia  with 135 000 employees handling civil development  the oil industry and defense issues  Firms operated by the IRGC also build roads  man ports  run telecommunication networks and even offer laser eye surgery  The IRGC has deployed in rescue efforts during Iran s recent devastating floods  which killed at least 70 people across the country Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last year ordered the guard to loosen its hold on the economy and privatize some of its vast economic holdings  Iran s President Hassan Rouhani has tried unsuccessfully to further restrict the group s expansive powers at home    FOREIGN REACH The Revolutionary Guard recruits and trains thousands of fighters abroad through its Quds Force  headed by Gen  Qassem Soleimani  a shadowy but prominent figure whose fighters have fought alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad s forces and against Islamic State militants who view Shiites as heretics U S  officials say the IRGC under Soleimani taught Iraqi militants how to manufacture and use deadly roadside bombs against American troops after the 2003 invasion of Iraq  a charge Iran denies The group also oversees the Basij  a volunteer force of several million that draws its members from among the poor  uneducated young men from rural areas and city outskirts  The Basij model has been exported abroad  with tens of thousands of Shiites recruited from countries like Afghanistan  Pakistan  Lebanon and Iraq to fight in Tehran s proxy wars in Syria and elsewhere One of those young Shiite men  who joined a wave of Afghans recruited and trained to fight in support of Assad s government in Syria  recently spoke with The Associated Press about the experience  saying he was driven by poverty and not by ideology or loyalty to Iran    MIDEAST MILITIAS The IRGC backs a number of Shiite militias across the Middle East  as well as the Fatimiyoun Brigade in Afghanistan  Chief among them is Hezbollah  the IRGC s oldest and most experienced force in the region  established following Israel s invasion of Lebanon in 1982  The militia  led by Hassan Nasrallah  publicly joined Syria s civil war in mid 2013  securing a string of hard won victories in defense of Syria s Iranian backed government IRGC backed Iraqi militias also fought in Syria in support of Assad s forces and against the Islamic State group in northern and central Iraq  Some of the armed groups in Iraq backed by Iran include the powerful Kataeb Hezbollah  Haraket Hezbollah al Nujaba and Asaib Ahl al Haq In Pakistan  the Zeinabiyoun Brigade is mostly comprised of Shiite fighters who have also fought in Syria  Many of the group s fighters are trained and funded by IRGC Yemen s Houthi rebels are also allied with Iran  Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  the United States and other countries have accused the guard of supplying the Houthis with long range missiles  a charge it denies  A Saudi led coalition  backed by the U S  and Britain  has been at war with the Houthis since March 2015    Mroue reported from Beirut

This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting  WASHINGTON   Pentagon prosecutors have made a renewed effort to charge three prisoners at the Guantánamo Bay wartime prison with conspiring in two deadly terrorist bombings in Indonesia in 2002 and 2003 The prosecutors have tried unsuccessfully twice before to move the case ahead  but the office overseeing military commissions never signed off on the charges  If the charges are approved this time  it would be the first new case to head toward trial at Guantánamo Bay  Cuba  since 2014 The prosecutors are seeking to charge the prisoners   an Indonesian captive known as Hambali and two Malaysian men   with murder  terrorism and conspiracy in the 2002 nightclub bombings in Bali  which killed 202 people  including seven Americans  and the 2003 Marriott hotel bombing in Jakarta  which killed at least 11 people and wounded at least 80  including three Americans The three men have been held at Guantánamo since September 2006  They were captured in Thailand in August 2003 in a joint Thai United States intelligence raid and spent about three years in the secret C I A  prison network If convicted  the men could receive a maximum sentence of life in prison because prosecutors chose not to seek the death penalty  said Brig  Gen  John Baker  the chief defense counsel for military commissions  who was notified of the charges on Friday  Each defendant has been assigned a lawyer who is a Marine Corps officer to defend him Maj  James Valentine  Mr  Hambali s lawyer  said it would be  a really big stretch  to connect his client to the two attacks  In 2008  three Indonesian men were executed by firing squad for carrying out the Bali bombings  after a 2003 trial at which  the star witness Ali Imron never connected Hambali to these crimes   Major Valentine said  Mr  Imron was the brother of two of the men who were executed  but was spared execution for his role in the bombing because of his testimony The charges dated Friday are the latest attempt in three years of efforts to bring Mr  Hambali  Guantánamo s only Indonesian prisoner  to trial  Mr  Hambali s most recent United States intelligence profile described him as  an operational mastermind  of the Southeast Asian extremist group Jemaah Islamiyah and its  main interface  with Al Qaeda  from 2000 until his capture in mid 2003   It also described him as  a mentor  to Guantánamo s other former C I A  black site prisoners ImageAn Indonesian captive at Guantánamo Bay known as Hambali is seen in a photograph provided by his lawyer  Maj  James Valentine In November 2016  the chief war crimes prosecutor  Brig  Gen  Mark Martins  traveled to Malaysia with two special envoys of the Obama administration in a failed effort to get the government there to agree to incarcerate one of Mr  Hambali s apparent accomplices  who is known as Zubair  as a war criminal convicted by the United States The idea was to get Mr  Zubair  whose name is Mohd Farik Bin Amin  to testify against Mr  Hambali and another Malaysian  Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep  who is often called Lillie  in exchange for an arrangement to serve his military commissions sentence in a Malaysian prison The Malaysians balked and military prosecutors brought charges against Mr  Hambali alone in June 2017  But the office overseeing military commissions never cleared that case for trial  Six months later  prosecutors brought new charges against Mr  Hambali and the two Malaysians  That case was also never approved The spokesman for the Office of Military Commissions  Ron Flesvig  was unable to say Wednesday why the prosecutor issued new charges  The Pentagon lawyer with the title of convening authority for military commissions  Melinda L  Perritano  can decide which charges  if any  to approve for trial  Mr  Flesvig said The latest charge sheet differs from those brought by prosecutors in December 2017 in one critical respect  It includes the crime of conspiracy in addition to charges of murder in violation of the law of war  terrorism and other war crimes  In a long running series of appeals  the Pentagon s Court of Military Commission Review recently declined to consider whether conspiracy was a lawful war crimes charge  leaving intact the 2008 conspiracy conviction of Guantánamo s lone war crimes convict  Ali Hamza al Bahlul Mr  Bahlul  from Yemen  is serving a life sentence at Guantánamo for making a recruiting video for Al Qaeda and for other activities as Osama bin Laden s media adviser before the Sept  11  2001 terrorist attacks  Mr  Bahlul s lawyers are appealing that decision at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  but prosecutors appear to have been emboldened enough by the Pentagon panel decision to add the charge of conspiracy to the Indonesian bombings case Eight of Guantánamo s 40 prisoners are currently charged with crimes In 2012  one of them  Majid Khan  a former C I A  black site prisoner  pleaded guilty to delivering  50 000 from Al Qaeda to Jemaah Islamiyah  money that was ultimately used to fund the Marriott bombing in Jakarta  Indonesia  Mr  Khan is scheduled to be sentenced in July In a March court filing  his lawyers noted   Mr  Khan s ongoing cooperation in another matter  including his possible testimony at trial in that matter   They did not specify which trial  

WASHINGTON   Payments to women who complained of sexual harassment  Accusations of groping  Allegations of a 13 year extramarital affair As President Trump moves ahead with his plan to nominate Herman Cain  a 2012 Republican presidential candidate  for a seat on the Federal Reserve s board of governors  Republican lawmakers are being forced to confront a fresh round of uncomfortable allegations of sexual misconduct against women as the 2020 campaign begins A day after Mr  Trump made the choice of Mr  Cain official  Senate Republicans expressed quiet anxiety over the prospect of another  MeToo minefield even as the White House exalted the decision  President Trump s statement that Herman Cain is  a truly outstanding individual  is a message that the president of the United States is willing to ignore the allegations of a number of women who alleged that Herman Cain either sexually harassed them or had an affair with them   said Gloria Allred  a lawyer who represented two of Mr  Cain s accusers   This message is an insult to women and should be condemned by the Republican Party and all those who care about respect and dignity for women  The choice of Mr  Cain comes as Mr  Trump s other pick to fill an open seat on the seven member Fed board  the conservative economist Stephen Moore  has been under fire for ethical and financial lapses that emerged from his divorce records  In both cases  the White House has publicly backed Mr  Trump s selections despite criticism that he was installing loyalists with questionable credentials in two of the country s top economic policy jobs  I don t buy it  we re not trying to damage the Fed s independence   Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  said on the Fox Business Network on Friday when asked about Mr  Cain But the questions surrounding Mr  Cain  who made his loyalty to the president clear with his creation of a political action committee to combat misinformation about Mr  Trump  go beyond cronyism The sexual misconduct accusations against him first emerged in 2011  when his long shot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination was gaining traction and he was briefly propelled to the top of the polls  He denied the claims  denouncing them as a political hit job that were being circulated by opponents to sink his candidacy Most of the accusations dated from the 1990s and involved employees or former employees of the National Restaurant Association  a Washington trade and lobbying organization  Mr  Cain had served on the association s board when he was the president and chief executive of Godfather s Pizza  a chain of restaurants with headquarters in Omaha  and after resigning from Godfather s  he moved to Washington to become the association s president His behavior toward female subordinates raised concern within the organization  according to former employees  board members and consultants  In interviews  they recalled learning that Mr  Cain had introduced sexual innuendo or questions into conversations with subordinates at the association s offices and events  as well as outside work  At one association conference  they said  he invited a female employee to his hotel room The association paid settlements to two female employees after they accused Mr  Cain of sexual harassment  The settlements included confidentiality provisions barring the women from discussing their complaints publicly Another former employee  Sharon Bialek  accused Mr  Cain of groping and propositioning her in 1997  when she asked for his help in finding employment after she was fired from the association s education foundation  When she protested  he responded   You want a job  right   she said at a news conference in 2011 A few weeks after Ms  Bialek detailed her account  another woman  Ginger White  alleged that she had a 13 year extramarital affair with Mr  Cain that ended shortly before he announced his presidential bid Mr  Cain categorically denied the affair  Ms  Bialek s account  the hotel solicitation and the harassment claims  dismissing them as a campaign of  character assassination  devised to force him to drop out of the race He pledged to push through  but his poll numbers plunged  and he suspended his campaign days later Two years later  after having left the political arena for a career in talk radio  he published a detailed defense on his website  again dismissing the claims  which he called a  dark cloud attached to my reputation that is not consistent with the truth  Joel P  Bennett  a lawyer who represented one of the women who was paid a settlement by the restaurant association  Karen Kraushaar  said times had changed since his former client leveled the accusation   and even since her settlement was made public in 2011   but only to a point  People are even more sensitive about this  and listening  and being sure that women are heard   Mr  Bennett said   But on the other hand  there were very serious allegations against Donald Trump and he was elected president  There were very serious allegations against Brett Kavanaugh  and he was confirmed   he said  referring to the Supreme Court justice He called for the Senate to conduct a  very thorough investigation  of the claims against Mr  Cain as part of any prospective confirmation hearing  The allegations are very serious   Mr  Bennett said   If you have one complaint  it s a  he said  she said  situation  If you have three or four complaints   the expression is where there s smoke  there s fire  Mr  Bennett said he was unsure if Ms  Kraushaar would participate in any congressional investigation  explaining that she had recently retired from a career in the federal government and was considering moving away from the Washington area It is an uncomfortably familiar spot for Senate Republicans  who were confronted with a similar dilemma six months ago after Mr  Trump nominated Mr  Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court  Mr  Kavanaugh  who was accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual misconduct  was eventually confirmed after an excruciating public hearing in which Dr  Blasey testified that he pinned her down and groped her at a party when she was in high school in the 1980s  Mr  Kavanaugh disputed the claims and denied he ever assaulted her The choice of Mr  Cain was viewed as especially perplexing in the immediate aftermath of the selection of Mr  Moore  who is dealing with his own accusations of ethical lapses related to his 2011 divorce  Since Mr  Moore was chosen  it has emerged that he owes  75 000 in federal taxes  interest and penalties stemming from his attempt to deduct child support payments  which are not eligible for a tax break  He was held in contempt of court in 2013 for failing to pay more than  330 000 for spousal support  child support and lawyer s fees to his former wife  Allison Moore While Mr  Cain was defiant amid the downfall of his 2012 presidential bid  the toll that a process can take on a nominee and his family was on display on Friday  as Ms  Moore appeared alone in a Virginia court and tearfully pleaded with a judge to keep her divorce records sealed  This is causing emotional turmoil within my family   Ms  Moore said   I never intended to be made a circus of in front of everybody  The judge declined her request  which had been challenged by multiple news organizations  including The New York Times  and unsealed the nearly 200 page record of the divorce  which detailed the terms of the couple s settlement and the breakdown of their marriage  which began with Mr  Moore s affair According to the unsealed filing  Mr  Moore opened two Match com accounts in 2009 with the intention of meeting other women  In 2010  Mr  Moore started a sexual relationship with a woman he met online  According to the court records  Ms  Moore found bills that showed him pumping gas in the morning near the woman s home and buying an airplane ticket in her name Two years after the divorce was finalized  Mr  Moore still owed his former wife more than  200 000 from their original settlement  plus tens of thousands of dollars in child and spousal support payments he was supposed to be making monthly  When Mr  Moore continued to defy a judge s order to pay the money  the judge appointed a lawyer to sell his house and distribute the proceeds in a way that fulfilled his obligations in the divorce  the court filings show On May 17  2013  the lawyer appeared at Mr  Moore s Virginia home along with four police officers  two real estate agents and a locksmith  The locksmith picked the lock so that the police and the agents could get into the house and prepare it for sale  When Mr  Moore was informed by the lawyer that his house was being sold  he became  argumentative  and said he had already paid his debt to Ms  Moore  Five days later  Mr  Moore paid  150 000 of the debt he owed and said he would get a home equity loan to cover the rest It is unclear whether Mr  Cain or Mr  Moore  who are currently undergoing background checks  could be confirmed if they are formally nominated But people close to the administration said Mr  Trump was eager for a big fight on Capitol Hill  akin to the brawl over the Kavanaugh nomination  that will unite his base and distract from the spate of investigations being undertaken by House Democrats Mr  Trump and some of his staff members believe that stirring drama in the Senate during an election will help foster the impression that Senate Republicans are taking action at a time when Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  plans to do little more than push through judicial nominations  a person close the administration said When asked about Mr  Cain on Thursday  many Republican senators ducked into elevators or onto the trains that run from the Capitol to legislative office buildings  answered calls on their cellphones  or gave noncommittal responses that made it clear the issue was not a top priority  I really don t have an opinion on that   said Senator Patrick J  Toomey  Republican of Pennsylvania  This would be instead of Stephen Moore   Senator Roy Blunt  Republican of Missouri  said shortly after word of Mr  Cain s possible appointment was made public  He was told no   I don t know anything about his past service  so I don t know what to say   Mr  Blunt said It remains unclear if Mr  Cain will pass a background check or if Senate Republicans would actually confirm him  despite his credentials as a Republican businessman who was once the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City For Mr  Cain  a circuslike atmosphere has not been something to shy away from  He parlayed his boomlet in presidential politics into the  Cain s Solutions Revolution  bus tour in 2012 and started hosting a radio show in 2013  He wrote columns for Newsmax and appeared as a commentator on Fox News During the 2016 election  Mr  Trump  who was also a bombastic businessman and outsider  drew early comparisons to Mr  Cain  In an early sign of loyalty at a time when many Republicans were skittish about Mr  Trump  Mr  Cain rebutted accusations that Mr  Trump was racist and even attacked Jeb Bush in 2015 on Mr  Trump s behalf  It s a different year  and Donald Trump is a different guy   Mr  Cain said  

JERUSALEM   There are more than a few reasons to dislike Benjamin Netanyahu  He can be smug and vindictive  He can be ruthless when going up against political enemies  He is likely to be indicted on corruption charges related to three separate cases  which  if they are accurate  indicate that he is greedy  vain and manipulative And yet last night  this dislikable prime minister appears to have won his fifth   yes  fifth    term in office  If he forms a government in the coming weeks  as he is expected to  Mr  Netanyahu will surpass Israel s founder David Ben Gurion as the country s longest serving prime minister  How is this possible To be fair  this was a close race  The main opposition party  Blue and White  is expected to get as many seats in the Knesset as Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  The coalition that he forms will probably have little more than the minimum 61 seats behind it Given Mr  Netanyahu s unsavory qualities  many people were intent on defeating him  Just a few months ahead of the election  Blue and White  a new centrist alliance led by three decorated generals and a former security minister  came together with little purpose other than to present an alternative to Mr  Netanyahu  who has been in power since 2009  They campaigned fiercely   but civilly  At rallies  General Benny Gantz  the head of Blue and White  made it a habit to thank the prime minister for his service to the nation  this was a mirror image of Mr  Netanyahu s and Likud s name calling and personal attacks  But civility and centrism weren t enough to carry the day Mr  Netanyahu may be cynical but he doesn t rig elections  He wins fairly  often against great odds  including  this time  the coming indictments against him and an understandable fatigue with his decade old leadership  not to mention various other inter  and intraparty squabbles  But he seems to have succeeded again this time for the same reason he has dominated Israeli politics for most of the past 25 years  because when it comes to Israel s national security  he is a leader with strategy and vision  And that is what many voters want RelatedMore from Opinion on Israel s electionOpinion   Hagai El AdDemocracy  Israeli StyleApril 7  2019Opinion   Roger CohenWill the Israeli  King  Be Recrowned April 7  2019Opinion   Raja ShehadehWe Are Too Weak to Stop IsraelApril 4  2019In the mid 1990s  during his first term as prime minister  Mr  Netanyahu rejected the assumptions underlying the peace process with the Palestinians  At the time this was considered daringly right wing  Today  it is considered common sense in Israel  including by Mr  Netanyahu s political rivals  Likewise  Mr  Netanyahu was one of the first politicians to recognize Iran as the main threat to Israel s survival  and fought fiercely in international forums to get the world s attention to this problem  Today  this view is also widely appreciated across the Israeli political spectrum The list goes on  In 2005  he warned that withdrawing Israeli troops from Gaza would end in disaster   and it did  He successfully resisted eight years of the Obama administration s pressure to offer concessions to the Palestinians  He quickly forged an alliance with President Trump that has already proved to be of great benefit to Israel  In two years  Mr  Trump has moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  withdrawn from the nuclear agreement with Iran  recognized Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights  and on Monday  designated Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization Blue and White tried to make this election a referendum on Mr  Netanyahu  Its campaign focused largely on the prime minister s personal failings  the corruption accusations against him  and exhaustion with his leadership  But in Israel  security trumps all other issues   A poll ahead of the election found voters rated security as their No  1 concern  Blue and White thought that by placing former Israel Defense Forces chiefs of staff at the top of the party list  it could counter Mr  Netanyahu s image and experience as a defender of Israel  diplomatically and militarily  But the public still showed that it trusts the incumbent more Has Mr  Netanyahu ever been wrong when it comes to security  The truth is  many Israelis will find it hard to think of an example  And this goes not just for voters for the Likud party  or even the right wing parties that are expected to join Likud in the next government  but even for Blue and White  which largely echoed Mr  Netanyahu s positions on important foreign policy and national security questions Those Israelis who do want Mr  Netanyahu gone   and yes  there are many   want him gone because of his personality  his coarsening of Israeli political discourse  his pettiness and  maybe  his corruption  Those Israelis who want Mr  Netanyahu to stay   and the election makes clear that there are many   want him to stay despite those same characteristics  They can forgive the prime minister for often being a small man  because they appreciate him as a great leader The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters

 Reuters    U S  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler gave Reuters a wide ranging interview on Thursday at his office in Washington  discussing issues from climate science to automobile emissions and biofuels policies The following is an edited transcript of the interview  REUTERS  President Donald Trump gave you some work yesterday with executive orders to push states to speed energy projects  How do you plan to alter the state certification guidelines and how soon will you accomplish the task WHEELER  We ve already started work  it may surprise you but we knew about the announcement before yesterday  We started working on it in advance  so we hope to have something out soon  I don t know when we will go final on it though  I m not sure of the timing on that  We can probably follow up  It s to provide more clarity around the program and provide some direction on what states should be looking at when they are doing their 401 certifications  It s a program that hasn t been updated in decades  I don t think when it was originally drafted people were really anticipating the need for these export terminals and some of these other national projects  I don t think people really anticipated that some states would kind of go beyond what was intended for their review  I m not going to pick on anyone in particular  but Washington state  I don t think they made their determination based on the impact of water in their state  they are trying to make international environmental policy  I don t think section 401 was originally intended for states to make international environmental policy  I m not just talking about U S  policy  They re trying to dictate to the world how much coal is used  and I think  outside the original intent of 401  So we re going to put some more parameters around how 401 is used  We will follow the law though  The states will still have a lot of flexibility of course  Part of it is also on timeliness  the states should be issuing their decisions  Some of these decisions have taken years for the states REUTERS  Critics say there is no way EPA can take the veto of the states out  That has to be an act of Congress WHEELER  I m not suggesting we re taking the states  veto out  What we want to do is provide more clarity around the program and provide the parameters on what states should review and how long that should take REUTERS  What are some of the most important energy projects for you to push forward WHEELER  Well  hopefully it would provide more direction to the states on looking at export terminals  LNG terminals  also some of the pipelines as well  I think it s more than a shame  I don t know how far I want to go  but it s pretty awful that we are importing natural gas to New England instead of transporting it via pipeline  natural gas  into New England  We are producing it in large quantities in the Marcellus Shale  Instead of using that natural gas  which is produced in the most environmentally conscious manner anywhere in the world  we are importing Russian natural gas which is not produced in an environmentally conscious manner  If the states that are blocking the pipelines were truly concerned about the environment they would look to where the natural gas would be coming from  and they are forcing the New England states to use Russian produced natural gas which is not as clean as U S  natural gas  I think it s very short sighted REUTERS  What is the timing on EPA work on the executive orders WHEELER  I just don t off the top of my head  I don t remember the timing REUTERS  Maybe six months WHEELER  Again  I don t want to put a date on the timing  Hopefully we will have our proposal out soon and go final shortly thereafter Can we get back to you on the timing  I just had three budget hearings and I have a lot of facts and numbers in my head and this is a new one  and off the top of my head I do not remember how long that Dave Ross  the assistant administrator for the Office of Water  told me it was going to take REUTERS  How do you respond to criticism that the Trump administration is setting policies that take aim at blue states or other states that focused on addressing climate change  or using permits to block projects they think are environmentally harmful WHEELER  We are the United States Environmental Protection Agency so we are trying to apply policies even handedly across all 50 states  What the president announced yesterday was an updated process for all 50 states  On the CAFE side we can t have a patchwork of automobile standards for some states and different standards for other states  This goes to WOTUS as well  We ve had quite a few requests to extend the WOTUS comment period  And we re not doing that for the primary reason that right now we have 22 states following one set of WOTUS regulations and 28 states following another  I really want to move as quickly as we can to finalize WOTUS so we have the same regulations applying to all 50 states  Back on the CAFE      We are looking at this issue  California just looked at it in terms of energy efficiency  Having a separate standard for California  you are talking about a rounding error talking as far as the impact on CO2 worldwide  We are looking at more than energy efficiency  We are also looking at highway fatalities  There is other public policy interest that we have as a nation  that is I believe our responsibility  We are working with DOT jointly  Last week at the Washington Auto Show I said I hope California doesn t sue us  Our final regulation is not going to be the same as our proposal  I can t go into more detail because we are still reviewing the data and information  but we took comment and the final will not be the same  We have taken constructive comments  criticisms and concerns from a whole host of different interest groups  and I hope that our final regulation is something that everyone can get behind and support  It was 24 hours after I said I hope California doesn t feel the need to sue us that they went ahead and sued us  In my mind this is so much more about politics in the state of California than it is protecting the environment REUTERS  The preferred option as you know  on CAFE  is a flatline      Is it safe to say that it is going to go up by some amount over a flatline  Is that how we should read your comments WHEELER  I really can t say at this point what it s going to look like REUTERS  There was a report out yesterday that you guys decided on a 1 percent per year increase  Is that accurate WHEELER  It s different when you have anonymous sources making comments  but when the administrator of the EPA says what we re going to do or not going to do it s premature  and I really can t say anything on the record yet about what exactly we re going to do  But we ve taken comments from a lot of different interest groups into account and we re trying to come up with a final regulation that addresses a majority of concerns REUTERS  Do you think there was ever going to be a deal with California  given how far apart everyone was  The autos said   Just  hey  pick a number anywhere in the middle as long as we have certainty about the program going forward   It looks like we are headed for sort of years of litigation WHEELER  And I hope not and I really did hope that we could reach an agreement  You know it is interesting when the auto companies came in after our proposal came out  they told me that some of the out years    our numbers are actually more stringent than the Obama numbers because Obama had more exemptions and offramps and flexibilities put in    so that some of the offyears they told us that our numbers are more stringent  So that tells me that at the end of the day our proposals weren t that far apart  but they  I think  use it more for social engineering and for politics and we re looking at it more on the technical side as far as what is feasible  what can be accomplished  One thing Obama administration did not do in their mid term evaluation was take into account real time data as far as what Americans was purchasing  The length of age of cars on the road  I think they were still looking at 2000 data saying that average age of an automobile is 8 years old  when it s actually now 12  It makes a big difference  By lowering the price of a car  we re hopefully going to get some of the older cars off the road  Getting the older cars off the road improves public safety as well as environment  The midterm evaluation by the Obama administration was a rush job  It was absolutely a rush job  They started it November 2016 after the election  they did a 15 day notice in comment and they finalized it before Jan  20th  You just can t review all the data and inputs in that sort of time and they didn t  They didn t look at the most recent data and information REUTERS  Do you think that the Obama administration was trying to disfavor fossil fuels and favor EVs WHEELER  Oh absolutely  The only way you could comply ultimately with Obama numbers is to have 30 percent electric vehicles and that s not what American consumers are buying  Right now we re   2 percent electric vehicles  I don t think this country is going to turn the fleet over to get to 30 percent electric vehicles by 2025  I just don t think that s possible  The automobile companies are paying a record number of fees for non compliance  In 2016   is the last year of data we have   I believe it was  100 million that they paid in 2015 or 2016 for non compliance with the standards and it s projected to get up to  1 billion   if the Obama regs were left in place  By the end of Obama CAFE standards  It was projected close to  1 billion that they re paying each year for inability to comply with Obama standards  We re trying to have realistic standards      There s certainly a marketplace for automobile manufacturers to go above and beyond CAFE standards      There is a market for people that went above and beyond  We don t think  number one  we re not using this for social engineering  we think we should have realistic regulations that companies can comply with  There s only three companies this year that are able to comply with Obama regulations  We re still keeping the regulations in place  we still have two years of complying but companies are not able to comply  REUTERS  Some of the critics say   Hey you re doing this for the oil industry     Because oil consumption will go up WHEELER  I have not met with a single oil company over CAFE standards since I ve been in this job  The first person who told me that I was trying to do this for the oil companies was Senator Markey  When I met with him  it actually kind of threw me  There is on that I don t remember as company  was a trade association  What they ve lobbied with me over the last year was RFS  And there was one meeting when one of them was in the room  as they were leaving they said   I don t want this to be a totally negative meeting  we like what you re doing on CAFE   We re not doing it for the oil industry  that s the extent of conversations I ve had with the oil industry on our CAFE proposals  It wasn t immediate in my mind why they like it but this is nothing to do with the oil industry  We re not doing it for the oil industry  I m not doing it for the oil industry  REUTERS  That meeting about RFS did go badly  and that CAFE ended up being the only positive thing  as you just said it  WHEELER  That was like last summer  The RFS program    I was hoping that I could get everybody to like what we re doing  At this point I am just hoping everybody dislikes me equally  We re moving forward with the E15 and RIN market reforms in our proposal  We hope to have those finalized by May 30th  in time for the summer driving season  Seriously  there are things in that that are for both sides to be very happy about  The RIN price mechanisms should help bring down and keep the price of RINs lower and stable  which the oil industry likes  And the E15 is something that the ethanol industry likes  So hopefully we are helping both sides and moving forward with some policy that everyone can get behind and like REUTERS  So there are no plans to separate them  E15 and RIN market reform  WHEELER  No  they ll come out at the same time REUTERS  What s your contingency plan in case it gets sued and a court would issue a injunction that would stop the implementation of E15 WHEELER  I don t look for that to happen  I think we re on very solid legal ground with E15  I do try to anticipate court action but we can t regulate based on what we might fear from courts  I think legally we re on solid ground with E15 REUTERS  USDA has suggested that there could be a discretionary enforcement  Once Secretary Perdue mentioned it as well  Is that still a contingency plan WHEELER  We will have it ready in time for summer driving season  We won t have to do anything like that REUTERS  On the small refinery waivers  which is the big issue  we ve heard people like Senator Grassley and Senator Ernst almost openly saying that they expect EPA under your leadership to change tack from how your predecessor was issuing the SREs  What is your response to that WHEELER  We have already changed tack in the sense that we re being much more transparent  We ve created the dashboard last fall where we re putting our information out in real time on the small refinery waivers program and we re being more upfront about what we re doing and why we re doing it  So we have changed tack  But the small refinery exemption program is authorized under the law  EPA was not implementing it  and we were sued three times and we lost three times  And we received appropriations language directing us to implement the small refinery exemptions program and we are  We will continue to  we will continue to follow the law  Under the way the process works is that they apply to Department of Energy first  and DOE reviews the information and determines whether or not there s a hardship  an economic hardship for the refineries  And they submit their recommendations to us  we review the information  we look at it  we compare it with the data that we have and we go forward with a yes or no with the small refinery waiver REUTERS  Should the market expect fewer  There is the  possibility of  full waivers  partial waivers and simply fewer waivers WHEELER  You don t get a small refinery exemption for the life of your refinery  It is based on economic data from year to year  Just looking at it from where I sit  and I have not reviewed the information from DOE yet  but the RIN prices have been relatively low and relatively calm since last spring so that would tell me that there should be less economic harm in the refining industry right now than there was a year ago  There s more than just the price of RINs for economic harm  but just by that factor alone  I d think maybe there would be fewer refinery exemptions because of that  Because we certainly do take a look at real time data on the economic harm imposed on the small refineries  So that s certainly one and that s only one of the economic indicators  but it s an important one  Last spring the RIN prices got up over a dollar and they remained under 20 cents since then  Most of the time they ve been around 10 12 cents a credit  I m not an economist but I would think that would factor into whether or not there s an economic harm for a refinery REUTERS  Has this process been slowed because of the political considerations  The market was expecting 2018 decisions before March 30 WHEELER  We still have not received the DOE recommendations yet  I m told we might start receiving by the end of this week but we haven t received them yet  We have not held up anything  We had a couple that were left over from 2017  We processed most of 2017  But we had a couple that came in late  one that required a little more analysis  but we haven t physically received  We got a list from the Department of Energy a couple weeks ago of the 2018 universe but they haven t actually forwarded their recommendations to us yet REUTERS  So if the DOE input arrives by the end of the week then what are we looking at timing wise WHEELER  Our technical guys then take a look what DOE sends us  If they send us 30 of them in one day  it may take us a while to process all of them  If we get one or two   it would be a little bit easier to process them if they re scattered  but I don t know how DOE plans on sending them over  So I can t hazard to guess on how long it s going to take us until we see what the universe is and the amount of data we have from the DOE REUTERS  Co2 emissions have gone up by the largest amount in eight years  According to some studies  Co2 emissions would go up under your proposed ACE  Affordable Clean Energy Rule   This would suggest stronger regulation is needed  What do you define as strong regulation WHEELER  Strong regulation is legal regulation  The CPP  Clean Power Plan     I get accused of rolling back the CPP by environmentalists and Democrats on the Hill  My simple answer to that is you can t roll back a regulation that never went into effect  The CPP was stayed by the Supreme Court  It is rare for the SCOTUS to stay a regulation in the environmental legal arena  I think that is very noteworthy  There was a lot of criticism at the time that it went beyond the Clean Air Act  You go back to the MATS decision  After EPA lost the MATS decision the administrator at the time said it didn t really matter since everyone has already complied with it anyway  When I read the MATS decision at the time I think I said in a blog post somewhere I thought Justice Scalia   he was writing toward the case he hadn t received yet  the Clean Power Plan      I was not completely surprised by the SCOTUS stay of the CPP  I think what is effective regulation is one that follows the law and will be held up in courts  So we took a hard look at where we believe the Obama administration was wrong on CPP and what was outside the bounds of the CAA and the fact they went outside the fenceline  I think that was one of the main sticking points and the rationale for the stay  What we did was to put forward a proposal that follows the authority Congress has given us  I believe the ACE regulation is going to stand up in court  It is going to give real reduction  We are projecting a reduction of 34 percent in the electric power sector over the life of the regulation  I think that is the responsible thing for the agency to do  I don t think it s responsible with our form of government with three branches  I don t think it s EPA s job to write the legislation on its own  We have to follow the statutory constraints Congress has given us  and I think we are doing that under the ACE proposal  I believe we are on a course of getting meaningful Co2 reduction  I think that s the responsible thing for a regulatory agency to do REUTERS  EPA scientists recently published a report looking at the impacts of climate change across 22 sectors and said early adaption could reduce its worst impacts  Some of your scientists internally continue to believe more stringent action is needed to address climate change  You have said in a hearing that climate change is not the greatest problem facing us right now  Do you trust your internal scientists WHEELER  I trust my internal scientists  I trust my career scientists  That study is not an EPA study  We encourage our scientists  we have some of the leading scientists in the world working on a number of environmental issues  We encourage our scientists to publish  But just because our scientists publish something in a journal doesn t mean that that s agency policy or all the other scientists at the agency agree with that particular study  There is a process for statement from the agency  There is a process where we go through intra agency review where we have a review by all the offices  Then governmental review  Those studies were not EPA studies  We all encourage our scientists to conduct research  but I don t think you should confuse a study published by one of our scientists as official EPA policy  I have not read that article  I just saw a news a clip about it  but I haven t read it and I haven t talked to the scientist that wrote it  But I have had several briefings from our career scientists on climate change and asked questions about climate change and that informs the decisions that I make  I can t just look at the science in a vacuum  We are not a science academy making proclamations about science  We are a regulatory agency  We have to take the science we have developed and apply it to our regulatory constraints that we have and regulatory authorities that we have and move forward  I said before I took this job that I believe in climate change and man has an impact on climate change  But I believe the number one issue facing our planet today is water  I ve been saying that for a number of years  I said that at a climate conference at MIT back in the early 2000s  It wasn t well received then and it s not always well received now  But it s the truth  When you have a thousand children that die a day from lack of drinking water  that s a crisis and that s a crisis that we   we collectively as the world   know how to solve that problem  We know what it takes but we haven t had the will internationally to solve that problem  And we do a number of pilots around the world and a number of other organizations both public and private and international do pilot programs and they work with the community on drinking water here and there  What we need to do is take those pilots to the next generation  We have a good story to tell in the United States  Our water is not perfect but 92 percent of our water systems meet the EPA standards every day  We are working on a lot of innovative ways to provide safer drinking water to the American public  Innovative financing ways  In addition to the SRF we have the WIFIA  Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act  program  It s the second year of that  We ve only issued eight grants under WIFIA loan program  We just announced the next round of grants  We just published it last Friday and communities have until July 5 to give us a letter of intent for the next round for WIFIA loans  If you could work that in  that would be great so the public knows it s out there REUTERS  Jumping onto PFAS  the kind of process how EPA addresses PFAS and PFOA      why didn t EPA set the maximum contaminant level WHEELER  This is a process under the law of setting the MCL and we started the process  I ve actually been surprised by the heat we have taken regarding the PFAS and PFOA management plan  That was a career staff document and remains the most comprehensive action plan this agency has ever developed for an emerging chemical concern  We had people from all of our program offices working on that  What I tasked everyone with was to go back and be creative and look at the authorities we have and figure out how many different ways we can address this issue and what we can do with the American public to make sure we are addressing PFAS and PFOA  And they came back with some really creative ideas  And we are moving forward  And we re moving forward not only on the MCL side but on other   on TRI  the Superfund program  the CERCLA program  We are addressing it through all of our staff  And at the time  we are conducting more research  Since the report came out we ve had this incident in New Mexico with cows and we re now working with the USDA  trying to do some cutting edge research there  I ve visited three of our labs that do PFAS and PFOA research  I was just in our Cincinnati lab and they do PFAS and PFOA research there  There is a misconception out there that we know what the problem is and we know how to fix it  There are thousands of PFAS and PFOA chemicals out there   there s long chain and short chain  We are still trying to figure out which ones are the most harmful to the public  I was under the misconception that the same treatment will work for any of the PFAS PFOA substances but it doesn t  Some of the treatment technologies work for some and they don t work for others  We have a lot of research to do  We are doing more research on identifying up front through our chemicals program as far as taking a look at significant new uses before anybody could start putting into commerce new PFAS and PFOA compounds  whether or not they pose a problem to environmental or public health  We re looking at how to detect when they are in the water easier and when to test for them  It s not the same test for all of the compounds either  At the same time we haven t slowed down on enforcing  We have taken eight enforcement actions and in addition we provided technical assistance to a couple of dozen other enforcement actions by states and local governments around the country  So some of the communities and members of Congress have complained that our state is having to clean this up without EPA assistance  Actually no  we are providing the technical assistance so they know how to clean it up  we are providing the technical assistance so they know how to detect it  We are also doing some really innovative imaging   GIS   to figure out where the problems might be before they are detected  We know where the chemicals were produced  We know where they were manufactured  We also know to some certainty where they were used the most     airports and firefighting     so we are able to use our GIS mapping to overlay that with the water systems and aquifers to go out to the communities and test before people there realize it  We are using some innovative GIS technology to try and anticipate where the next problem may occur  We are really at the forefront of this  I just applaud our career staff  many of them   pulled all nighters to get everything together REUTERS  A lot of young people look at what your EPA is doing on emissions    and they look at your comments that climate is not the most important environmental problem   WHEELER  But it s important and we are addressing it REUTERS  But they point out water issues are part of the climate change problem  especially with drought WHEELER  Oh sure  and I ve said that  that climate impacts water  But the problems we are having with water have been around long before climate was an issue  We ve had problems on water infrastructure  on waste in the oceans  and in drinking water for a hundred years REUTERS  Do you worry that concern about a lack of leadership on climate change will spur a movement that will get Democrats elected next year WHEELER  I can t look at the politics of this  that s just not my job  I can t look at the politics and how this is going to impact elections  I have to address the environmental issues and problems as I see them and as they are presented to me by the people here at the agency  Yes  climate is an issue and we are working to address it  but I think water is a bigger issue and I talk about both and continue to  But there hasn t been enough talk about water  The previous administration focused all their energies on one issue and that was climate change  You take a look at the website that we are accused of taking all the climate change information off the website  We didn t  It s on there  it s archived  but it s on there  But that s not the only environmental issue the world faces  I do fear that because so many people only talked about climate change  you re right  there could very well be a new generation coming up saying that s the only environmental issue  And it s not  I am going to have to be very careful in how I say this  because I don t want to be misrepresented here  If I could go off on plastic straws for a second  Yes  it s important to get all plastic out of the waste stream  Are plastic straws the be all and end all of this  No  By definition of the size of the straw and the amount of waste the straw makes up  My biggest concern is that in switching away from plastic straws that people are going to think that that problem is solved because they are no longer using a plastic straw  And that doesn t solve the problem  We have the same issue on recycling  We have a huge recycling crisis right now  there are not enough products for recycled material to go into  We are just stockpiling recycled materials in warehouses  When I say  we  it s not the EPA  Recycled products are being stockpiled in warehouses and loading docks around the country because China quit accepting the materials a few years ago  But most Americans think if I put my stuff in the recycling bin at the street corner the problem is solved  That doesn t solve the problem  We hosted a recycling summit last fall  the first time the agency ever did that  We brought in the people from the entire value chain  from the manufacturers of the raw virgin materials through the manufacturers of the goods  to the packagers  to the people who collect the recycle materials  to the end users who take the materials and turn it into new products  and we gave them four charges to work on  and we ve had continuing meetings with the groups since then and we are going to have another summit this fall  I have a real concern and this is part media  part politician  people talk about this issue du jour and that s all people focus on and they don t realize that that s not solving all the problems that are out there REUTERS  For your policies to be effective  you would need Trump to win WHEELER  He s going to  I m looking at a five and a half year planning horizon at this point  I m going to have five and a half years to complete everything we are trying to do  And it s why I continue to talk about water and the importance about doing something for water REUTERS  You guys told the autos on a call that you were targeting May or June to finalize rule  Is that still the case WHEELER  What I said in the auto show last week was I m targeting late spring  early summer  And I do that because seasons last lot longer than people realize  We hope to get it as quickly as possible  We re working with DOT  It s a complex rule making  We hope to get it out as quickly as possible REUTERS  On diesel  you ve gotten aggressive on enforcing the diesel cases  Do you think that the auto community got the message that you re going to catch cheating  WHEELER  I hope so  Because we are  If there is cheating we are going to catch it  It s not just the automobile manufacturers  it s the after market defeat devices  We ve taken a lot of enforcement action to get defeat devices off the roads  It s not just setting standards  you have to enforce the laws  too  And we re doing much more enforcement than we re given credit for  REUTERS  How are you going to accommodate the oil states and corn states under the RFS  Renewable Fuel Standard  WHEELER  RFS is a very important program  I worked on the legislation in 2004 and 2007  I was the staff director for both of those energy bills on the environment committee  This was an issue that went on to the environment committee  It was not in the jurisdiction of the energy committee  it s the jurisdiction of environment committee  But it s a very important program  The way it was set up  we re going to have rule makings every year  We have to do the RVO  Renewable Volume Obligation  every year  We ve done another thing on certainty  which the oil industry was very happy that we did  was to get the RVO out on time the last two years  It s the first time that s ever happened  Providing more certainty  more transparency helps the program and we re hoping to do that  We re being very transparent on what we re doing on the E15 and the RIN price mechanisms  So I think the fact that the RIN prices have been low for almost a year shows that program is working and there s transparency and the market is stabilized  It s when you have uncertainty  regulatory uncertainty  congressional uncertainty that can ripple through the RIN price markets  The program does expire and people are going to have to start talking about and thinking about what the next generation of RFS looks like  But we re not there yet  Again  I m focused on transparency  I m focused on certainty  and I think that s what we re doing by announcing we re going to have the E15 on time for driving season  by announcing that we re going to do the RVOs on time  by putting the information out on our dashboard on small refinery exemptions  The more upfront and open we can be I think the better the program is   I think we can have a program where both sides can look at and say this is what the Congress wanted  this is what they intended and EPA is doing that upfront and above board and that s my goal    Reporting by Valerie Volcovici  Humeyra Pamuk  Timothy Gardner and David Shepardson  Editing by Leslie Adler  

WASHINGTON   When President Donald Trump talks about the masses of Central Americans trying to get into the U S   he describes a horde of beefy men with ill intent   some of the roughest people you ve ever seen   and mocks them for acting like frightened babies so soft hearted Americans will take them in  Figures from his own administration tell a different story  Those coming are increasingly families and children  Among them are thousands who get a chance for a life in America because they make a compelling case that they risk persecution in their home countries Lately  Trump has settled on the bad dude image of a martial arts fighter to be the face of those migrants   How stupid can we be to put up with this   Trump marveled in a speech to a Jewish Republican group Saturday   The asylum program is a scam   That apocryphal fighter has been showing up repeatedly lately in Trump s rhetoric of disdain From his remarks Saturday TRUMP  on asylum seekers   People that look like they should be fighting for the UFC  Ultimate Fighting Championship   They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place   coaching them to say  I am very fearful for my life  I am very worried that I will be accosted if I m sent back home   Trump then mocks immigration judges or other officials   Oh  give him asylum  He s afraid  He s afraid   And he adds   We don t love the fact that he s got tattoos on his face  That s not a good sign  THE FACTS  The migrants he plays for laughs don t fit that profile  The current surge of migrants from Central America to the U S  border is characterized by large numbers of families  In several years previously  unaccompanied children made up the majority of Central Americans seeking asylum at the border Last month  Homeland Security s immigration statistics office released its latest annual report on the flow of asylum seekers and refugees  covering 2017  Among those who came from Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras and applied for asylum at the border  56 percent were unaccompanied children  The percentage was the same the year before and higher in 2015 Altogether  Homeland Security granted the asylum applications of more than 26 500 people in 2017  Almost one third were children  Nearly half were women  Close to two thirds were married Additionally  the Justice Department granted asylum to more than 10 500 people who were already in the country and made their case for refuge in their deportation hearings In total  the leading countries of nationality for people granted asylum were China  El Salvador and Guatemala    TRUMP   If they put one foot on our territory  if they start climbing a fence and they re on the Mexico side  welcome to the United States  Think of it  It s the craziest thing  THE FACTS  It s not that simple  What is lost in Trump s rhetoric is that it is legal to come to the border and ask for asylum  As for those who sneak illegally into the U S  and get caught  they  too  are entitled to apply for asylum As the Homeland Security report states   Generally  any foreign national present in the United States or arriving at a POE  port of entry  may seek asylum regardless of immigration status  Whether they ask at the border or after being caught inside the U S   most don t get it People are defined as asylum seekers when they come to the border and ask to come in or when they make that request while already inside the U S  People who are not near or in the U S  and want to gain admission on humanitarian grounds are considered refugees  Generally  they are people who are living outside their home countries  such as in refugee camps The U S  admitted 53 691 refugees in 2017  That was a drop of 37   attributed to increased security vetting  About 43  were children and women slightly outnumbered men  Among the adults  62  were married    TRUMP   They have a visa lottery  Democrats      You pick out a name  Do you think they re putting their finest  do you think they re putting their great people there  No  THE FACTS  This is one of Trump s favorite fictions   the notion that other countries place their troublesome citizens in a U S  visa lottery hoping they ll win and move to the U S  He adds to the false story by attributing the program to Democrats only  The diversity visa lottery program was signed into law by Republican President George H W  Bush in 1990 and had broad bipartisan support Under the program  citizens of countries named by the U S  can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields  Out of that pool of qualified applicants  the State Department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners  Not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly  Those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks  like other immigrants    Associated Press writer Colleen Long

delivered to your inbox Cuban migrants in Mexico find refuge in a churchBy Kirk Semple in Ciudad Juárez  MexicoIn 1994  Franklin Pupo s father fled Cuba by way of Central America and Mexico  before settling in Las Vegas Now  25 years later  Mr  Pupo is following roughly the same path  Incredible   said Mr  Pupo  40  marveling at how his family s history was repeating itself I spoke with Mr  Pupo and his wife  Yaima García  37  this week in an evangelical church that had been converted into a temporary migrant shelter  The building  a cinder block warehouse that previously served as a hardware store  was tucked in a scrappy  semi industrial neighborhood of this border city in northern Mexico The couple s journey had come to an abrupt halt here a month ago when their quest for sanctuary in the United States ran up against the cold realities of the border  They are now among many thousands who are waiting in Ciudad Juárez and other border cities for their chance to apply for asylum in the United States It s a quirk of current migratory patterns that Mr  Pupo and Ms  García also find themselves among many other Cuban asylum seekers in Ciudad Juárez  By the estimates of government officials  as many as 70 percent of the more than 3 000 migrants waiting here to apply for asylum across the border in El Paso  are Cuban In other border cities  those waiting to cross are mostly Central Americans  The Cuban always tries to be in a group   Ms  García explained   I see it as a form of protection How Ciudad Juárez came to be the preferred crossing point for Cubans remains a mystery  But migrants say that it has the reputation for being safer for migrants and less crowded with asylum seekers than other popular crossing points  Word traveled through the Cuban migrant grapevine   in WhatsApp messaging groups  by phone and on social media While Cubans have been a common sight for years on the migrant trail through Mexico  their numbers rising and falling in response to events back home and shifts in American policy  the flow appeared to pick up in recent months Officials here in Ciudad Juárez said they began registering a sharp increase in the number of Cuban asylum seekers in late fall The Cubans  by and large  say they are fleeing political repression in the Caribbean nation  Cubans seeking sanctuary used to get special treatment in the United States  Under a policy known as  wet foot  dry foot   Cubans who made it to American soil were allowed to stay and eventually apply for permanent residency  But the Obama administration halted those privileges in January 2017  and since then Cuban asylum seekers have been like everyone else In Ciudad Juárez  they have run up against a Trump administration system that limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at ports of entry  This practice has given rise to informal waiting lists in border towns So  the Cubans and others are biding their time   in migrant shelters  in budget hotels and in cheap  rented rooms   and suppressing the impulse to hire a smuggler and cross illegally ImageErnesto Velasquez Lopez  from Cuba  cried tears of joy in Ciudad Juárez after receiving notice that his asylum case will be heard by the United States CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesMr  Pupo and Ms  García left Cuba on Feb  6  flew to Panama and traveled overland to Mexico  arriving in Ciudad Juárez on March 1 and finding their way to Solus Christus Church The shelter is overseen by Lilia and Rodolfo Barraza  who opened its doors to migrants on Feb  26 after local officials appealed for help in absorbing the flow of asylum seekers into the city Mr  Barraza  65  a pastor  said that initially he had been inclined to say no  but he remembered a biblical passage that described the moral obligation to do good  And when I thought of that biblical verse  I said   Bring them    Mr  Barraza recalled   And the next day they were here  The couple has hosted as many as 74 migrants at one time  jammed into a space suitable for far less  there are currently 38  all but one of them Cubans   The exception is a Venezuelan woman  Ms  Barraza  61  said that before they had opened their doors  she had never met a Cuban   But now I think they re beautiful   she said   We love them  They are our brothers and sisters  The symbolic focus of the space is a white board on which is written the waiting list number of the last migrant allowed to cross the border and present themselves to the American authorities  A migrant s number in line has become almost as important as any other piece of data in their life When a migrant s number is called and they successfully cross  it s a bittersweet moment for those who remain behind  They lose a traveling partner but move one step closer to their own appointment  It could be a week  two weeks  a month   Ms  García mused on a recent afternoon at the shelter The number on the board was 6995  Her number is 7533  Mr  Pupo s is 7534 For now  Mr  Pupo added   this is our refuge  Kirk is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border  Each week they ll be

week   When I walked in there  it ripped your guts out   he said   It made you cry  CreditAl Drago for The New York TimesMCALLEN  Tex    The Border Patrol s largest detention center has swelled in recent weeks amid an influx of migrant families from Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador  The processing center in the border city of McAllen has frequently exceeded its capacity  leading to mass releases of migrants that have overwhelmed nonprofit shelters The building  known informally as Ursula because of its Ursula Avenue address  has been criticized by immigrant advocates for holding migrants in large pens made of chain link fencing   Manny Fernandez  the New York Times Houston bureau chief  spoke to Senator Jon Tester  a Montana Democrat who spent more than an hour touring the Ursula facility last week The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation Q  What was it like A  I was there on Sunday  March 24   I m not going to talk to you like most Democrats will talk to you  I m going to tell you that  when I walked in there  it ripped your guts out  It made you cry  It did all those things that people say it did to you  because you had children and you had mothers  I looked at them as kids the same age as my grandkids  On the other side of the equation  there were a lot of people in a fairly small area  and the ventilation had to be pretty darn good because it didn t stink How many migrants were there at the time Twenty two hundred  And their capacity is 1 500 Did it feel overcrowded or just crowded Gosh  you re asking the wrong guy  because this is the first time I ve been in that processing center  It felt crowded Can you describe it It s a metal building that s insulated  Each one of the holding areas had a bathroom and a sink  They re held by sex  of course  And then the families were held in different steel cages  basically  Everybody had a blanket that wanted one  Mylar blankets  Most of them were laying down on mats  Some of them were standing up  Some of them were sitting on benches What were Border Patrol officials saying about all this They said they were processing them through as quick as they could  They said the manpower they were using here was manpower that they d rather have on the border  but nonetheless they had to process these folks  Look  I mean  I don t like prisons  I don t like holding people up  But the bottom line is that I don t have any better idea than the way they were doing it  and I asked them if they did and they didn t either  although they were tasked with trying to find a better way to do it  They were providing food and water and baby formula  and were treating these folks as good as they could treat them  in the conditions that were there  I m simply just not critical of Border Protection in this situation because I don t know what the solution is Some Democrats were calling the mass releases a manufactured attempt to fuel the crisis at the border narrative  Do you agree I don t think I can agree with it  Look  I m not a conspiracy theorist  I think I have to go with what I saw  and what I saw literally was a bunch of families in this facility and I think it is what it is right now  The direction I would take it is  what are the push factors in these countries that are pushing these families to our southern border Was Border Patrol cooperative during the tour They were absolutely cooperative  I ve been on these trips before  and I know for a fact they show you want they want you to see  But they were very cooperative Were the conditions horrible  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder  I guess  I don t think they were horrible  but by the same token it was gut wrenching to see mothers and children sitting there in cages It sounds like it was packed but people still had some room I don t know how many square feet each person needs to determine whether it was overflowed or packed or beyond the pale  I just know as I looked there  there was some space and people could mill around  although it was very crowded  It would drive me crazy  My nearest neighbor is a mile away  It would drive me nuts The president on the borderImageMexico supplies many of the avocados eaten in the United States CreditJustin Sullivan Getty ImagesPresident Trump visited a portion of the border wall in California on Friday  a day after backing off a threat to close the border with Mexico The president  floated the idea of closing the border last week   defending it repeatedly here and here   even as economic experts warned doing so could damage the economy  The agricultural and manufacturing industries would have been especially hard hit by a closing  including a potential avocado shortage  Instead  on Thursday  Mr  Trump said he would give Mexico a  one year warning  before closing the border  If the drugs don t stop or aren t largely stopped  we re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products  in particular cars   the whole ballgame is cars   he said   And if that doesn t stop the drugs  we close the border  Read earlier installments of Crossing the Border here  Sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox  

NEW YORK   New York state officials told food growers and processors in mid December that they had the state s blessing to produce and sell tea and chocolates laced with CBD  the cannabis derivative reputed to ease anxiety and other ills without marijuana s high But since then  New York City health inspectors have seized thousands of dollars worth of CBD infused food and drinks at the Fat Cat Kitchen and other local cafes and restaurants  and warned owners to stop selling them or face penalties  The crackdown came just weeks after federal law explicitly made CBD legal across the country The New York City crackdown highlights the inconsistencies that have emerged in federal  state and local rules governing CBD  bewildering the small but growing number of businesses selling edibles in New York and other states   I m trying to be compliant with the law  but no one seems to be fully aware of what the law is and isn t   said C J  Holm  the owner of the Fat Cat Kitchen  which touts CBD coffee and cookies on a sidewalk chalkboard Consumer interest in CBD tinctures  topical creams and edibles has grown in recent years in step with the piecemeal legalization of marijuana  which is now permitted as either a medical or recreational drug in 33 states while still banned by the federal government In 2018  U S  consumers spent an estimated  300 million on CBD food and drinks  according to a report by Cowen Washington Research Group  The Coca Cola Company and other food giants have expressed interest in the sector The 2018 Farm Bill  enacted in December  was intended in part to clear up the legal status of CBD by legalizing cannabis extracts derived from strains of the plant  known as hemp  that contain very low concentrations of THC  the main psychoactive compound in marijuana  But the law also created new confusion for businesses wanting to sell CBD food or drink  For some  it is impossible to follow one set of regulations without being in breach of another  In New York  for example  officials at the state Department of Agriculture issued guidance in December saying it was legal to sell  CBD tea    chocolates with CBD drizzle  and other CBD edibles  so long as the products are made and marketed as dietary supplements  which are governed by more stringent standards than ordinary food But the department also warns that doing this will run afoul of rules issued by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  which said it was unlawful to add CBD to food or to market it as a dietary supplement  That is because the agency  for the first time last year  had approved a drug that contained CBD as the active ingredient  New York City health inspectors have taken the FDA rule seriously  At the Fat Cat Kitchen  Holm was startled when a health inspector impounded her CBD powder  honey  snacks and raw cookie dough in February  Similar scenes played out at four other eateries in the city Soon afterward  Holm and other restaurateurs received a letter from the department saying inspectors would resume the seizures after July 1 It is unclear whether the city s Health Department will allow cafes and restaurants to sell CBD edibles even as a dietary supplement  despite New York state officials saying such products are legal  When asked  Michael Lanza  a Health Department spokesman  repeated the department s position that it is following the FDA ban on CBD food and drink in any form  An FDA spokesman declined to comment on New York s regulations Colorado  Maine and other states have attempted to clarify the status of CBD laced edibles by passing laws allowing the addition of CBD to food  The FDA has said it may make an exception for CBD  allowing it as a food additive or dietary supplement even though it is now a listed drug  It will hold a public forum on the issue in Maryland on May 31 With the conflicting rules and at best haphazard enforcement  Holm and other CBD vendors say they are pressing ahead  devising their own strategies that they feel are at least a gesture toward compliance Igor Yakovlev  who stirs CBD into honey on New York s Staten Island  prints a disclaimer on each Beezy Beez Honey jar stating that the FDA has not  evaluated or approved  his product Holm  in consultation with a lawyer  noted that the FDA bans CBD being added to food for  interstate commerce   and reasons she is fine to sell CBD coffee so long as the extract is produced and processed in New York  It is so confusing because you can ask three different attorneys and get three different answers   said Allan Gandelman  a farmer in Cortland who founded the New York Cannabis Growers and Processors Association earlier this year   So you decide you re going to blaze a path forward  and produce a product that customers really want  and go for it until the government gets its act together    Reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York  Editing by Frank McGurty and Dan Grebler

KABUL  Afghanistan   In a sign that a logjam in Afghanistan over entering peace talks with the Taliban could be easing  the Afghan government announced Sunday that it had named a council of senior political leaders who will appoint negotiators  create their mandate for talks and oversee their work The formation of the council   led by President Ashraf Ghani and composed of both current and former senior government officials and leaders of political parties and opposition groups   comes after months of bitter disagreements over the next steps for peace talks with the Taliban So far  negotiations have occurred only between the insurgents and American diplomats  without the Afghan government  an impasse that American officials have struggled to break The two sides are near an agreement on the withdrawal of American troops and on a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil not be used by terrorist groups to attack the United States and its allies  as Al Qaeda did in September 2001  But the United States has insisted that nothing can be finalized until the Taliban and the Afghans figure out the country s political future The Taliban have refused to meet directly with representatives of the Afghan government  calling it a puppet of the United States  The Afghan government has insisted on nothing less than direct negotiations  criticizing any move by political groups to engage with the Taliban as giving the insurgents unwarranted legitimacy Mr  Ghani  in opening the first meeting of the new council  expressed happiness on Sunday and thanked political leaders for creating a unified front under the government s umbrella  With complete unity for the sake of a better future for our country  we will make decisions about the aims of this process and the makeup of the negotiating team   Mr  Ghani said The progress was welcomed by Zalmay Khalilzad  the American Special envoy leading the peace efforts  Mr  Khalilzad spent much of the past week in Kabul trying to urge the Afghan government to introduce an inclusive negotiating team  Ambassador Khalilzad was pleased to see the Afghans with whom he met  inside and outside government  coming together to put peace first   the United States Embassy in Kabul  said in a statement announcing his departure   Ambassador Khalilzad underscored the imperative of reducing violence across Afghanistan in the coming weeks and explored ways to build broader regional support for the current effort to realize the Afghan people s yearning for peace  ImageQatari officials  center  with delegations from the United States and the Taliban in Doha in February CreditMinistry of Foreign Affairs of QatarAfter the new council met  officials expressed their willingness to be flexible to build trust and pave the way for direct negotiations Mohammed Umer Daudzai  a member of the council  said an informal meeting with the Taliban in Qatar  seen as an icebreaker  would go ahead  That meeting  set for mid April and expected to be attended by more than a hundred Afghans from various parts of society  is intended as a trust building measure  It was decided in today s meeting that we will participate in the meeting in Qatar as a joint delegation   Mr  Daudzai said   A big delegation will go to Qatar to exchange views with the other side  which are the Taliban  but they will not negotiate  Negotiation is the next step  Easing Mr  Ghani s concerns is the fact that since he leads the council overseeing the talks  his officials will be on the negotiating team when direct talks with the Taliban do begin  Government representatives are also likely to attend the large Qatar meeting The Taliban  in a statement soon after Mr  Daudzai s comments  made clear that they were still sensitive about talking to the Afghan government  They said that if any officials were part of the delegation in Qatar  they would be attending in a personal capacity  No one will be participating as representatives of the Kabul administration   Zabihullah Mujahid  the Taliban spokesman  said in the statement Although political parties and lawmakers welcomed the progress  many cautioned that it was still fragile  and said Mr  Ghani s office still had many differences with the parties on major issues  including the size and makeup of the negotiating team A leaked initial list of the team published by local news media also raised concerns about just how seriously the Afghan government and political elite were taking the participation of women  Only two women were on a proposed list of 22 negotiators  Today s meeting in the palace could be a good start for building of national consensus on peace   at least now there is a start for decisions on how to go ahead with peace talks   said Mohammad Natiqi  a leader of the Wahdat e Islami Party   But there are still big differences between political parties and the presidential palace  Mohammad Nazeer Ahmadzai  a member of Parliament  said the council created a platform to bridge rifts that benefit the Taliban  He pointed to a meeting in Moscow in February where the Afghan political elite went in large numbers to meet with the insurgents despite strong disagreement from the government  If the meeting in Qatar ends up similar to the meeting in Moscow  it will damage the people s trust in the peace process  and it will show the government weaker and more marginalized   he said  

JERUSALEM   Palestinians voiced alarm while Israelis weighed the gravity on Sunday of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s sudden election promise to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank Some Israeli commentators saw the right wing leader s pledge on Saturday  as Tuesday s national ballot approaches  as mainly a bid to siphon votes from ultranationalist rivals long advocating annexation But after years of resisting far right calls to formally put West Bank land captured in the 1967 Middle East war under permanent Israeli hold  Netanyahu could be counting on support for a dramatic shift from his close ally  U S  President Donald Trump  Who says that we won t do it  We are on the way and we are discussing it   Netanyahu  asked why he had not extended Israeli sovereignty to large West Bank settlements  told Israel s Channel 12 News In March  Trump broke with decades of international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  territory Israel captured from Syria  That followed his December 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel  and the U S  embassy s move to the holy city last May Asked in an interview on Friday on Israel s Channel 13 why he wasn t pressing Trump now to approve a West Bank settlement status change  Netanyahu replied   Wait until the next term  Taking Netanyahu at his word  Palestinians seeking statehood in the West Bank  Gaza and East Jerusalem called his settlement annexation remarks a violation of international law regarding occupied territory  His declaration is not just in the heat of     electioneering campaigns   said Hanan Ashrawi  a Palestine Liberation Organization official   This is the end of any chances of peace  A spokesman for Hamas  the Islamist militant group that runs the Gaza Strip  said  the response to  Israeli  crimes and foolishness will be met by popular resistance  armed resistance and by all our might  But Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett  head of the New Right party and author of a plan to annex parts of the West Bank  suggested Netanyahu was simply trawling for votes  For the past 10 years  Netanyahu has blocked applying Israeli law to even a centimeter of land   Bennett tweeted In the settlement of Karnei Shomron  spice shop owner Yehezkel Shaul said he believed Netanyahu s annexation pledge  calling him  the most reliable and honest person  At the local high school  Harel Levi  18  was not so sure  It s an election promise and he ll find some excuse later   Levi said HEATED ISSUESettlements  which Israel s B Tselem rights group said cover about 10 percent of the West Bank  are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart peace talks  frozen since 2014 After decades of settlement building  more than 400 000 Israelis now live in the territory  according to Israeli figures  The West Bank is home to some 2 9 million Palestinians  the Palestinian Statistics Bureau says A further 212 000 Israeli settlers live in East Jerusalem  according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs The Palestinians and many countries consider settlements to be illegal under the Geneva conventions  which ban settling on territory occupied in war  Israel disputes this  arguing that the status of the West Bank is still disputed  But unilateral annexation would be far harder to justify  even among allies Trump s predecessors as president publicly discouraged the expansion of settlements  arguing that they made it harder to negotiate a viable Palestinian state  viewed by administrations from both U S  parties as Israel s likeliest route to peace Palestinians argue that Washington did not do enough in practice to press for settlements to be curbed Most peace plan scenarios foresee Israel negotiating to keep some settlements in return for giving other land to the Palestinians  Annexation could take that off the table Netanyahu s annexation promise was met with scepticism by Shaqued Morag  director of Peace Now  an Israeli anti settlements group that closely monitors their expansion  So we must ask  why has Netanyahu said this now   Morag said  The answer  she told Reuters  was that Netanyahu feared for his political survival and  the times dictate he makes these extreme declarations that he has no intention to follow through on  Israel Katz  the acting foreign minister and a member of Netanyahu s Likud party  said its  great fear  was a split in the right wing vote that would result in a second place finish behind the centrist Blue and White faction Katz said Likud had to ensure it emerges as the biggest party  to put Netanyahu in the best position to get the nod from Israel s president to try to put together a governing coalition  No one party has ever won a ruling parliamentary majority on its own in an Israeli election   Additional reporting by Ron Bousso in Karnei Shomron  West Bank  Ali Sawafta in Ramallah  West Bank and Maayan Lubell and Stephen Farrell in

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William P  Barr has directed parts of the Justice Department to investigate accusations of discrimination  including claims that the F B I  academy weeded out potential agents for not being  masculine enough  and that it has become harder for transgender people to work at the Bureau of Prisons Mr  Barr s request came in response to a letter that he received last week from DOJ Pride  a Justice Department group founded in 1994 to advocate the interests of lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender employees  Less than half of the group s members said they believed that the Justice Department does not discriminate against them  the letter said  adding that the finding and others from a survey undertaken in October show that members have become more alienated from the department under the Trump administration  Given the crucial role the department fulfills in our society   enforcing the nation s laws and administering justice   we are concerned that so many employees who dedicate themselves to the department do not think the department values them   members of DOJ Pride wrote In response  Mr  Barr vowed that the Justice Department would not discriminate against workers based on sex  sexual orientation or gender identity  as well as a long list of other  non merit based  factors  Employment decisions at the department must be made solely on merit and free from discrimination   he wrote in a letter on Thursday addressed to the group and distributed to the more than 115 000 employees of the Justice Department   Every employee should know that I stand by the principle  The exchange shows how Mr  Barr is working to raise morale after many Justice Department employees described a drop over the past two years  particularly among gay  lesbian and transgender employees The F B I  said in a statement that it needs people  from all different backgrounds  experiences and perspectives  to effectively do its job protecting Americans and that it does not tolerate discriminatory behavior  The Bureau of Prisons did not respond to a request for comment Mr  Barr  who was sworn in as attorney general in February  is settling in to a Justice Department that underwent a drastic shift under his predecessor  Jeff Sessions  who moved away from the civil rights centered agenda of the Obama era to one that reflected his ultraconservative stance on immigration  civil rights and social issues As Mr  Sessions refocused the department s civil rights work onto protections for people of faith  police officers and local government officials  critics warned that those moves effectively curbed the rights of gay  lesbian and transgender people  as well as of minorities who faced discrimination from the police Mr  Sessions also pushed back on departmental efforts to extend civil rights protections to transgender people  He ordered prisons to house transgender women with men  a move that many human rights experts said put the transgender women at risk of assault  and defended President Trump s ban on transgender soldiers in the military  In October  the department sided with a funeral home that had fired a transgender woman  arguing that the definition of sex in the Civil Rights Act was biological and  does not apply to discrimination against an individual based on his or her gender identity  And while the heads of all federal agencies are required by law to issue an Equal Employment Opportunity statement saying that they are committed to providing equal employment under the law and a workplace free of discrimination  Mr  Sessions never did Mr  Sessions s policy positions reverberated inside the department as well  The survey of DOJ Pride members from October  a month before Mr  Trump forced out Mr  Sessions  found that less than a third of respondents believed that the department  values its L G B T Q  employees   and only 43 percent believed that it  does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression  The survey also found that gay  lesbian and transgender employees believed that the department had recently become less welcoming to employees who were not heterosexual  One respondent said that the treatment was grounds for quitting Some members of DOJ Pride were upset when Guy Benson  a Fox News contributor  was chosen to speak at last year s annual gay pride celebration  Some members attended a separate awards ceremony  where one person said that the group would not return to the shadows  according to video of the proceedings obtained by The New York Times In a letter to Mr  Barr last week  the leaders of the group noted that Mr  Sessions had never issued the Equal Employment Opportunity affirmation and said that they believed that it was especially important for Mr  Barr to do so in light of the department s recent decisions not to extend civil rights protections to transgender people Mr  Barr issued that statement on Thursday The attorney general has yet to lay out an agenda on gay rights  During his confirmation hearing  he said that he would support a law that would ban antigay discrimination  but he noted that he does not believe that current sex discrimination laws apply to gay  lesbian and transgender people But in his letter this week  Mr  Barr wrote that the department would act swiftly when employees are found to have discriminated  

Boeing said on Friday that it was slowing production of its 737 Max jet and establishing a new internal safety committee after two of the planes were involved in fatal crashes in five months The company will reduce the rate at which it produces the 737 family of airplanes to 42 a month from 52  Boeing s chief executive  Dennis A  Muilenburg  said in a statement  In addition to the Max  Boeing produces the 737 NG and a military version of the plane Boeing will also establish a committee on its board of directors to review how it develops and builds planes  Mr  Muilenburg said The company is making the moves as it confronts an escalating crisis after the crashes of two 737 Max planes  Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia in October and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 last month  The Max has been grounded  and Boeing paused deliveries of new planes  creating a backlog on its production lines in Renton  Wash  The company has been stockpiling finished planes in Renton and in nearby Seattle Airlines around the world have thousands of outstanding orders for the Max jet  which represent billions of dollars for Boeing s bottom line in the coming years  Safety is our responsibility  and we own it   Mr  Muilenburg said   When the Max returns to the skies  we ve promised our airline customers and their passengers and crews that it will be as safe as any airplane ever to fly   The Seattle area is feeling the pain of the Max crisis  The company s presence is seemingly everywhere in the region  Introduced in 2011 as Boeing scrambled to compete with its European rival  Airbus  the Max became Boeing s best selling jet  Each Max sells for about  100 million Preliminary investigations now indicate that both airplanes crashed after anti stall software unique to the Max activated because of faulty data and sent the planes into irrecoverable nose dives The software  known as MCAS  was added to the new jet to compensate for its larger  more fuel efficient engines  The engines changed the aerodynamics of the plane  raising the possibility that it could stall in some circumstances In his statement  Mr  Muilenburg acknowledged that the new anti stall software played a role in the accidents   We have the responsibility to eliminate this risk  and we know how to do it   he said The Dangerous Flaws in Boeing s Automated SystemHere s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months Boeing engineers began working on a software update after the Lion Air crash  but the company and aviation regulators in several countries deemed that the Max remained safe to fly  Though many pilots had not been informed of the powerful new software before the accident in Indonesia  Boeing said it was possible to handle a malfunction if pilots followed a set of instructions it issued after that crash That claim  which was backed by the Federal Aviation Administration  is now under scrutiny  On Thursday  the Ethiopian authorities released a preliminary report of their investigation and found that the pilots in that crash had initially followed the instructions in Boeing s emergency checklist Only after the crash in Ethiopia did regulators ground the Max  Boeing continues to work on the software update and revised training procedures for the Max  and this week said the fixes were taking longer than anticipated Boeing has given no timetable for the return of the Max  The updates will have to be certified by the F A A  and other regulators before the planes can fly again  It may be weeks  if not months  before that can happen  Teams are working tirelessly  advancing and testing the software  conducting non advocate reviews and engaging regulators and customers worldwide as we proceed to final certification   Mr  Muilenburg said   We re also finalizing new pilot training courses and supplementary educational material for our global Max customers  Boeing is now under pressure from some airlines to compensate them for the cost of the grounded jets  Norwegian Air s chief executive said previously that he expected Boeing to  take this bill  The airline Garuda Indonesia asked to cancel an order for 49 Max planes last month  And on Friday  Bloomberg reported that Ethiopian Airlines was reconsidering its order for 25 additional Max planes because of the  stigma  surrounding the aircraft  We may reach the decision  Look  we just had a very tragic accident a few weeks ago  and customers still have the accident in their mind   Tewolde GebreMariam  chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines  told Bloomberg   So it will be a hard sell for us to convince our customers  Though the airlines have mostly been able to manage the grounding of the Max so far  the credit agency Fitch Ratings said in a note on Friday that the impacts may begin to ripple across Asia in the coming weeks as seasonal air travel picked up  If there is a delay in the delivery schedule of the 737 Max jets by Boeing  affected airlines may choose to either scale back their expansion plans to strengthen their balance sheets or continue to grow by leasing aircraft at increased rates   Fitch said Boeing is also facing growing pressure from Washington  The Justice Department and the Transportation Department s inspector general are investigating the design  manufacturing and certification of the Max  Lawmakers have raised questions about Boeing s close relationship with the F A A   which in recent years has given aircraft makers more authority to certify their own products  

WASHINGTON   The House on Thursday gave final passage to a bipartisan resolution forcing an end to United States military involvement in Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen  sending President Trump a pointed rebuke over his continued defense of the kingdom after the killing of a dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi The 247 to 176 vote  with 16 Republicans joining all House Democrats  invoked the rarely used War Powers Act to curb the president s executive power to wage war without congressional approval  It most likely sets up the second veto of Mr  Trump s presidency  this time to publicly defend a four year conflict that the United Nations has deemed the world s worst humanitarian crisis  with thousands of civilians killed and millions suffering from  famine The Senate passed the resolution in March  54 to 46  The vote in the Senate and in the House makes it clear that the United States will not continue to follow the despotic  anti democratic leadership coming out of Saudi Arabia   said Senator Bernie Sanders  independent of Vermont and one of the lead sponsors of the resolution   The United States should not be led into a war by a despotic  undemocratic  murderous regime  Supporters of the Yemen resolution have faced a grueling road in recent months to get the legislation onto the president s desk  The Senate   led by the resolution s authors  Senators Mike Lee  Republican of Utah  Christopher S  Murphy  Democrat of Connecticut  and Mr  Sanders   first passed the measure 56 to 41 in December  but Paul D  Ryan  the House speaker at the time  refused to take it up His successor  Speaker Nancy Pelosi  did  and the House easily passed it in February  But House Democrats inadvertently derailed the process by supporting a surprise procedural motion offered by Republicans to declare the chamber s opposition to anti Semitism  By attaching an unrelated amendment to the Yemen resolution  the House ended its  privileged  status  which would have forced the Senate to quickly take it up and send it to Mr  Trump The Senate then had to start from scratch The vote on Thursday amounted to a do over  Republicans again tried to derail the resolution with a last minute procedural maneuver to attach an amendment to condemn the movement to boycott  divest from and sanction Israel  a provision that put Democrats in a difficult position But this time  intent on ensuring the legislation would not be knocked off course again  Democratic leaders rallied their rank and file to oppose Republicans  efforts  Representative Ted Deutch  a Florida Democrat and one of the strongest pro Israel voices in the House  stood to condemn the Republican maneuver  This is about politics   he said   This is about trying to drive a wedge into this caucus where it does not belong  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the No  2 Democrat  accused Republicans of  using Israel as a partisan cudgel  and urged his colleagues to oppose the measure  Its intention is not to unite but to divide  Its intention is not to support our ally but to kill this bill through a cynical and dishonest tactic   Mr  Hoyer said as Democrats stood and applauded   Let s stop playing games with this very important and serious issue  To persuade the president to support the legislation  a bipartisan group of lawmakers   including Representatives Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and one of the lead sponsors of the resolution  and Matt Gaetz  Republican of Florida and one of the president s staunchest allies   requested to meet with the president  appealing to his desire  to achieve our shared interest in responsibly drawing down needless conflicts throughout the world  The House resolution employs the 1973 War Powers Act  which gave Congress the ability to compel the removal of military forces absent a formal declaration of war  Those powers  created in the wake of the Vietnam War  have almost never been used  as lawmakers have demurred from intervening in politically sensitive matters of war  peace and support for the troops  When we started talking with folks about doing this  they basically laughed it off   said Stephen Miles  the director of Win Without War  an advocacy coalition that lobbied for the resolution   They said it wouldn t happen  Congress doesn t ever invoke the War Powers Act  It was a really long arduous process of education  In its justification for opposing the resolution  the White House argued that the use of the act  is flawed  because the Pentagon has provided  limited support to member countries of the Saudi led coalition  in Yemen  That argument may have been more resonant years ago   repeated bipartisan attempts in 2016 to rebuke the American role in the Saudi led intervention stalled in both the House and the Senate  beginning with efforts to block the sale of munitions to the Saudis But after the killing of Mr  Khashoggi  a Virginia based columnist for The Washington Post  lawmakers on both sides of the aisle  livid at the administration s equivocal response  signaled a new willingness to reconsider the relationship with Riyadh  Lawmakers have grown increasingly vocal about reasserting their oversight on foreign policy  We are clawing back our constitutional responsibilities   said Representative Jim McGovern  Democrat of Massachusetts And the public has become more aware of the crisis in Yemen  where an estimated 80 percent of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance or protection and millions are without access to clean drinking water  according to the United Nations  

It was March 2015  and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend  Ind   recognized that the country was having what he called a  painful dialogue  about how people of color and law enforcement were coexisting in their communities  The Black Lives Matter movement was growing in influence after several high profile killings of black men by police officers Mr  Buttigieg was also facing a crisis at home  He had demoted the city s black police chief after the chief was accused of having recorded officers  conversations without their consent  The chief had sued  contending that he had been demoted because he was black  And rumors were swirling that the recordings had captured racist remarks by some of the officers In his State of the City address that March  Mr  Buttigieg said it was  time for South Bend to begin talking about racial reconciliation   There is no contradiction between respecting the risks that police officers take every day in order to protect this community  and recognizing the need to overcome the biases implicit in a justice system that treats people from different backgrounds differently   Mr  Buttigieg said  according to a transcript of the speech published by The South Bend Voice  We need to take both those things seriously  for the simple and profound reason that all lives matter   he added Four years later  as Mr  Buttigieg pursues the Democratic nomination for president  his use of the phrase  all lives matter    which has often carried the connotation of ignoring the specific grievances of black Americans   has come under scrutiny A story published this week by CNBC drew attention to Mr  Buttigieg s 2015 remarks and also raised questions about his decision to demote the police chief On Thursday  Mr  Buttigieg  37  sought to explain his past use of the phrase while speaking to reporters at a convention for the National Action Network  the nonprofit civil rights organization founded by the Rev  Al Sharpton  At that time  I was talking about a lot of issues around racial reconciliation in our community   Mr  Buttigieg told reporters   What I did not understand at that time  was that phrase  just early into mid 2015  was coming to be viewed as a sort of counter slogan to Black Lives Matter  And so  this statement  that seems very anodyne and something that nobody could be against  actually wound up being used to devalue what the Black Lives Matter movement was telling us   That is the contribution of Black Lives Matter   he added   and it s a reason  since learning about how that phrase was being used to push back on that activism  I ve stopped using it in that context  The close examination of Mr  Buttigieg s language and his handling of the police department is one of the first speed bumps for a campaign that has otherwise enjoyed a relatively smooth ride  Mr  Buttigieg announced this week that his presidential campaign had raised more than  7 million in the first quarter of 2019  a significant sum for a mayor who was little known outside of South Bend only a few months ago Nate Levin Aspenson  a local organizer in South Bend  told CNBC that Mr  Buttigieg s use of the phrase in 2015  was not that long ago   It was not a time when  all lives matter  was a smart thing to say  or reflective of someone who is concerned about black people being killed by the police   he said The Black Lives Matter movement began in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman  a neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon Martin  an unarmed black teenager  The movement gained even greater recognition the following year after the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner Soon  the phrase  all lives matter  also emerged  Some people who faced blowback for using the phrase said they had used it with good intentions as a way to bring people together  But others seemed to use it to rebut the idea that black people faced unique prejudice in the United States The fresh scrutiny of Mr  Buttigieg s 2015 remarks has also resurfaced the allegations made by the police chief  Darryl Boykins  who sued the mayor in 2013  In federal court documents  Mr  Boykins   who could not immediately be reached on Thursday   said he had been illegally demoted from his job as chief in 2012 because he was black  Mr  Buttigieg has maintained the demotion was necessary because Mr  Boykins was the subject of a federal wiretapping investigation The case was settled in late 2013  court documents show  But a separate legal dispute continues between the City Council of South Bend and the group of police officers who were recorded over whether the tapes can be released  Mr  Buttigieg s office has refused to release the tapes without a court order  and has said that doing so would put the administration in legal jeopardy  

ISTANBUL ANKARA   Election officials expanded a vote recount in Istanbul late on Thursday  CNN Turk said  as the ruling party of President Tayyip Erdogan pushed its appeal against its shock defeat there in local elections Erdogan s AK Party said it would also demand a wider check on votes across the capital Ankara   which initial results suggested it also narrowly lost in Sunday s vote in a major blow to the establishment Those losses  if confirmed  would be particularly painful for Erdogan  whose party and its predecessor have dominated the two cities for 25 years  He launched his political career in Istanbul and served as the city s mayor in the 1990s On Wednesday  Turkey s High Election Board had ordered a full recount in three of Istanbul s 39 districts and a recount of just invalid ballots in 15 districts after an appeal from Erdogan s AKP Late on Thursday the board decided there would be a full recount in those 15 districts as well  CNN Turk said  Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul  Ekrem Imamoglu  told Reuters it looked like his lead had narrowed to around 19 500 votes from an earlier 25 000 as the recount progressed  but he was sure he would still become mayor  The results will not change  Time is passing and Istanbul is waiting for service  so we just want to get to our job as soon as possible   said Imamoglu of the Republican People s Party  CHP   The mathematics and numbers are clear   Imamoglu told Reuters   There is no need to think of a Plan B right now  Imamoglu later said on Twitter that recounts in Istanbul s 14 districts  where there were a total of 89 255 invalid votes  had been completed  and added that he was 18 871 votes ahead of his rival The AKP s representative on the election board  Recep Ozel  told broadcaster A Haber earlier on Thursday that the difference in Istanbul would keep falling and his candidate  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  would emerge the winner in Turkey s commercial hub Speaking at a news conference in Ankara  AKP spokesman Omer Celik said the steps taken for recounts were not extraordinary  All citizens should remain calm  Our democracy is showing its strength as it always has   Celik said   Let the law work and let s respect the outcome  RECESSION CHALLENGEAhead of the elections  the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival the alliance between the AKP and their nationalist MHP partners  They named joint candidates in certain cities  including Ankara and Istanbul In Ankara  opposition candidate Mansur Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes on Sunday to earn a nearly 4 percentage point victory over his AKP rival  former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki  The AKP also appealed against those results  prompting the election board to order a recount in 11 of the city s districts But AKP Secretary General Fatih Sahin said on Thursday that the results of the recount so far were  far from meeting our expectations  and the party would appeal for another recount across the city If the initial results are confirmed  the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32 6 billion liras   5 79 billion  for 2019 in Istanbul and Ankara Erdogan would likely also lose some oversight for municipal contracts in the two cities  possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession In another sign of public backlash  the AKP MHP alliance also lost control of the southern coastal cities of Antalya  Mersin and Adana  the central provinces of Bolu and Kirsehir  and the eastern cities of Artvin  Igdir and Ardahan The CHP has said that Kurdish votes coming from the pro Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party  HDP  had helped them win narrow victories in key provinces  after the HDP chose not to name candidates in some cities and back the opposition instead  Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics since coming to power 16 years ago and ruled his country with an ever tighter grip  campaigned relentlessly for two months ahead of Sunday s vote  which he described as a  matter of survival  for Turkey In some 100 rallies during his election campaign  Erdogan described the opposition as terrorist supporters and said his central government could not provide services if it wasn t in harmony with local administrations But the president s efforts came up against widespread anger about Turkey s recession  which has brought surging inflation and unemployment  and caused the lira to plunge Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to volatility in the currency  which sold off sharply nearly two weeks ago  reflecting waning confidence among both Turks and international investors  It closed at 5 63 to the dollar on Thursday   Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay in Ankara and Yesim Dikmen in Istanbul  Editing by Jonathan Spicer  Andrew Heavens and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   An American lobbyist was sentenced Friday to three years of probation and a  5 000 fine for failing to register as a foreign agent for a Russia friendly political party in Ukraine and for helping a Ukrainian billionaire illegally purchase tickets to President Trump s inauguration The case against the lobbyist  Samuel Patten  highlighted how the Ukrainian political party sought to gain influence in the United States by hiring American consultants who could lobby on their behalf and make connections to the new Trump administration Mr  Patten  a longtime Republican operative whose family was once part of Washington s social elite  pleaded guilty to violating the federal Foreign Agents Registration Act  which requires lobbyists for foreign interests to disclose their work to the Justice Department  Federal prosecutors stepped up enforcement of the often ignored law in lock step with the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  The crimes that I committed are a source of great shame and regret for me   Mr  Patten  47  wrote in a letter to Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the Federal District Court in Washington  In court on Friday  he said   I behaved as if the law did not apply to me and that was wrong  Judge Jackson said she was most disturbed by Mr  Patten s misstatements to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence about his work in Ukraine and his purchase of the inaugural tickets  She also said his failure to register as a foreign lobbyist for Ukraine was not  a mere technicality  or an oversight  but a serious omission that deprived the American public  members of Congress and policymakers of information necessary to judge the motivations of those who seek to influence them  People need the facts for democracy to work   she said Mr  Mueller s prosecutors uncovered evidence of Mr  Patten s offenses while investigating Paul Manafort  the former Trump campaign chairman who was recently sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for financial fraud and conspiracy  Mr  Mueller s team turned the case over to the United States attorney s office in Washington  D C Although they did not recommend any specific sentence  the prosecutors argued for leniency  saying that Mr  Patten had quickly pleaded guilty and had cooperated with the government in several enforcement matters  including the prosecution of Mr  Manafort  Mr  Patten s lawyer asked for probation  The charges carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a  250 000 fine Judge Jackson said she had decided to spare Mr  Patten prison time because he moved quickly to admit his guilt  worked hard to help the special counsel s investigation and seemed truly remorseful   You have done everything in your power to make amends   she said Both Mr  Manafort s and Mr  Patten s offenses were rooted in their work for pro Russia billionaires in Ukraine  who paid tens of millions of dollars to western lobbyists and law firms to help shape their political party s message to the West  Mr  Patten essentially picked up where Mr  Manafort left off in 2014  when Viktor F  Yanukovych  a pro Russian politician whom Mr  Manafort helped elevate to Ukraine s presidency  was forced from power and fled to Moscow Like Mr  Manafort  Mr  Patten formed a partnership with Konstantin V  Kilimnik  a Russian operative in Ukraine who prosecutors have linked to Russian intelligence  From 2015 to 2017  a political party called the Opposition Bloc paid Mr  Patten s company more than  1 million  depositing the funds in a bank account in Cyprus As part of his work  Mr  Patten arranged meetings in Washington between Ukrainian oligarchs and members of Congress and the executive branch  without disclosing his activities to the Justice Department  as required  He also drafted op ed articles for the oligarchs that were published by American media outlets  The description of one op ed appeared to match one that bore the name of one oligarch and was published in U S  News   World Report in February 2017  It argued that Mr  Trump would be good for Ukraine and criticized Ukraine s current leadership The judge said the law that required Mr  Patten to disclose such activities is specifically designed  to put people on notice that a foreign government is trying to affect their opinion   By hiding that information  she said  Mr  Patten worked to undermine the integrity of the public discourse that shapes American opinion and policy The fact that he also misled Senate committee investigators  she said   underscores the fact that you knew what you were doing and the word  mistake  does not apply  Mr  Patten also arranged for a straw donor to purchase four tickets for  50 000 so that a Ukrainian billionaire could attend a Trump inaugural event  It is illegal for foreigners to contribute to presidential inaugural funds  campaigns or political action committees In a sentencing memorandum  Mr  Patten s lawyer said his client thought he was merely giving the Ukrainian access to a postelection party  not creating an avenue for influence peddling  Mr  Patten wrote the judge   I could have told my client  no   when he asked me to buy him tickets to the Inauguration party  but I was too eager to please and I broke a rule in doing so  Federal prosecutors in New York are now investigating whether there were other illegal foreign donations to the inaugural events in addition to the one that Mr  Patten arranged  

ADDIS ABABA   Ethiopia Airlines  doomed 737 MAX jet hit excessive speed and was forced downwards by a wrongly triggered automation system as pilots wrestled to regain control  a preliminary report into the crash that has shaken the aviation world showed on Thursday Three times the captain Yared Getachew cried  pull up   before the Boeing plane plunged into a field six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa last month  killing all 157 passengers and crew  said the report by Ethiopian investigators  The disaster   and parallels with another 737 MAX crash in Indonesia where 189 people died last October   has led to the grounding of Boeing s flagship model  It has also brought uncomfortable scrutiny over new software  pilot training and regulatory rigor  While the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority s Accident Prevention and Investigation Bureau had a remit to investigate rather than blame  it implicitly pointed the finger at Boeing by defending the pilots  recommending the U S  company fix its control systems  and saying regulators must be certain before allowing the MAX back in the air  The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft   Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told a news conference  Since repetitive uncommanded aircraft nose down conditions are noticed     it is recommended that the aircraft control system shall be reviewed by the manufacturer  Boeing  the world s biggest planemaker and one of the United States  most important exporters with a  500 billion order book for the MAX  says a new software fix for its anti stall system will enable pilots to always override if necessary  According to the report by the Ethiopian investigators  an alarm indicating excess speed was heard on the cockpit voice reporter as the jet reached 500 knots  575 miles per hour    well above operational limits FRAGMENTS IN A CRATERThe plane had faulty  angle of attack  sensor readings  its nose was pushed down automatically  and the crew lost control despite following recommended instructions  it said   Most of the wreckage was found buried in the ground   the report said  indicating the strength of the impact on an arid field in an agricultural zone  No bodies were recovered  only charred fragments among the debris in a crater Boeing has seen billions wiped off its market value since the crash  but its shares actually rose 2 4 percent on Thursday  Morgan Stanley said the report of flight control problems  which Boeing was already trying to fix  meant a  worst case scenario  of a new cause was probably off the table  Families of the victims  regulators and travelers around the world have been waiting to find out to what extent Boeing technology or the pilots  actions played a role A final report is due within a year The preliminary report into the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia suggested pilots also lost control after grappling with so called MCAS software  a new automated anti stall feature that repeatedly lowered the nose based on faulty sensor data  It had to take a second disaster to wake up the major players to pay attention to something that could ve been resolved after the first disaster   said one woman  who lost her father in the Ethiopian crash  asking not to be named  Whatever the issues were  they better be 110 percent sure about their resolution  otherwise the 157 lives lost would have been for nothing if something like this happens again  This is a lesson to not take shortcuts in order to try and save bucks   PROFITS OVER SAFETY  U S

TEL AVIV   It was a referendum on him and he nailed it  Nobody can take that away from Benjamin Netanyahu  This summer  in his fifth term  he will surpass David Ben Gurion as the longest serving Israeli prime minister  Enough said His victory contains a warning for any Democrat still imagining that the 2020 election will bring an easy victory over Donald Trump  The Netanyahu playbook will be President Trump s next year  Gather nationalist and religious voters in your camp  add in a strong economy  dose with fear  sprinkle with strongman appeal  inject a dash of racism and victory is yours   whatever indictments are looming It s not that this could happen  It will happen  absent some decisive factor to upend the logic of it  Netanyahu is savvier than Trump  but they share a shrewd assessment of how to control and manipulate the politics of spectacle  as well as a fierce determination to stay out of jail  They campaign ugly Exactly a century ago  Ben Gurion said   Everyone sees the difficulty of relations between Jews and Arabs  but not everyone sees there is no solution to that question   Netanyahu s solution is by now clear  He is a true believer in Greater Israel and will not give up one inch of the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River  There will be no Palestinian state on his watch  Period Many Israelis  weary of the chimera of a two state peace  thank him for that   as they thank him for a strong economy  Trump s support and a sense of stability  Netanyahu is a formidable politician adept in using hate and fear  the strongest currency in contemporary politics His victory was personal but it was also structural  Israel now has a structural majority of the right  This will almost certainly enable Netanyahu to form a right wing government  even though his Likud party appeared tied with the Blue and White party of his upstart challenger  Benny Gantz  each winning 35 seats The Gantz performance was remarkable  It demonstrated the deep disquiet of liberal Israel over Netanyahu the King  But in the end Gantz took more votes from the left   the Labor Party and Meretz   than from the right  As Avi Scharf  editor of the English edition of the liberal daily Haaretz  put it to me   Israel s founding left is totally obliterated  The structural majority of the right is composed of the ultra Orthodox  the settler movement  Mizrahi Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent  nationalists of various stripes and Russian immigrants like the one who recently told my friend Shlomo Avineri  a political scientist   I don t want to live under Putin  but I want my leader to be like Putin  Netanyahu never passes up a photo op with Vladimir Putin  any more than he does with Trump   A different league   one of his campaign ads said  Netanyahu was able to project presence among the superpowers  His base loved it  Trump s base loves him  unswervingly  The president is not structurally assured of victory in 2020  but he is structurally within sight of it That Netanyahu is facing indictment on bribery and other charges proved no obstacle to Likud increasing its seats to 35 from 30 in 2015  In the near term  Israeli politics   and its democracy   will hinge on Netanyahu s attempts to secure immunity from prosecution while in office  He may make acquiescence to such legislation a condition for coalition partners joining the government  It will not be pretty  We could see a coup d état against democracy  something very dangerous   Tom Segev  a prominent historian  told me For now  Israelis seem prepared to shrug  The not with a bang but a whimper conclusion to the Mueller report reinforced a feeling that the cloud of corruption that has hung around Netanyahu for years should not be taken as proof of it In the longer term  Israeli politics will turn to the question of annexation  At the last minute  to shore up the right  Netanyahu promised to start annexing the West Bank if he won another term  The United Right and other extreme parties will not let him forget it Still  there is no reason to take Netanyahu at his word  He made himself kosher with the Obama administration through his Bar Ilan speech of a decade ago supporting a Palestinian state  only to do nothing to favor one and everything to block one Annexation could see the same fate because it s problematic  Netanyahu is happiest in the gray zone where Israel controls millions of Palestinians without having to confront the question of whether they vote or are granted Israeli citizenship  He does not want to jeopardize good relations with Egypt and the Saudis  He s quite happy with a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that once saw itself in the role of leading the way to a Palestinian state but has become the feeble enabler of Israel s gray zone domination Netanyahu s annexation decision may hinge in the end on the long incubated Trump plan for Israel Palestine  It s said to exist  Maybe it really does  God knows  The fact that strong pushback from the United States on partial annexation is no longer assured says it all  The rightist nationalist wave has yet to crest The Times is committed to publishing a

NEW YORK   Donald Trump isn t on the ballot for Israel s national election  yet he s a dominant factor for many American Jews as they assess the high stakes of Tuesday s balloting At its core  the election is a judgment on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  who has won the post four times but now faces corruption charges  In his battle for political survival  Netanyahu has aligned closely with Trump   a troubling tactic for the roughly 75  of American Jewish voters who lean Democratic  The world has come to understand that Netanyahu is essentially the political twin of Donald Trump   said Jeremy Ben Ami  president of the liberal pro Israel group J Street   Unlike his previous elections  there is a much deeper antagonism toward Netanyahu because of that close affiliation between him and Trump and the Republican Party  Netanyahu featured Trump in a recent campaign video  while Trump has made a series of policy moves viewed as strengthening Netanyahu in the eyes of Israeli voters  including relocating the U S  Embassy to Jerusalem  withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and officially recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory  It s troubling   said Halie Soifer  executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America   The U S  Israel relationship should not be about any two leaders or any two parties  The American Jewish community wants the relationship to remain on a bipartisan basis  Though it leans Democratic overall  the American Jewish community   numbering 5 5 million to 6 million   is not monolithic  Most older Jews remain supportive of Israel s current Middle East policies  as does the roughly 10  of the Jewish population that is Orthodox  Jewish billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has been a staunch financial supporter of Trump and the GOP Divisions among U S  Jews have been exacerbated by recent allegations of anti Semitism directed at the Democrats  two Muslim American congresswomen   Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib  Seizing on the controversy  Trump tweeted his support for a purported  Jexodus  movement that would encourage Jews to leave the Democratic Party  Republicans are waiting with open arms   Trump tweeted on March 15 Morton Klein  president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America  predicts such an exodus will take place because of the Democrats  decision to avoid explicit condemnation of the congresswomen Ben Ami scoffed at the notion  suggesting that Jexodus was a fantasy of pro Trump operatives  I ve yet to meet an actual Obama Clinton voter who s said publicly they re switching to vote for Donald Trump   he said   This is not real  It s completely made up  New York based journalist Jane Eisner  former editor of The Forward  a Jewish newspaper  said many American Jews have  Netanyahu fatigue    even some who supported him in past Among liberal Jews  Eisner said  there are strong worries that Netanyahu will push Israel s government even further to the right if he wins  perhaps moving to annex some land in the occupied West Bank with confidence that the Trump administration will not object Morton Klein conceded that some Jews have grown weary of Netanyahu  but predicted he would prevail  People would be nervous if he s not there   Klein said Jack Rosen  president of the American Jewish Congress  said any surge in Netanyahu fatigue should not be interpreted as a weakening of American Jews  support for Israeli  There is a sense of fatigue having one leader for 10 years   Rosen said   Just as we ve had Clinton fatigue and Bush fatigue  Among liberal and centrist American Jews  dismay with Netanyahu extends beyond his alliance with Trump  Some say he s been too harsh in his treatment of migrants  and they bemoan his backtracking on a promise to allow mixed gender prayer at the Western Wall  Perhaps most disturbing has been Netanyahu s alliance with an ultranationalist political party linked to a movement previously banned for anti Arab racism and incitement That political alliance was assailed as  repugnant  by Eric Yoffie  a rabbi from Westfield  New Jersey  in a March 27 op ed in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz  Yoffie also decried Netanyahu s  excessive enthusiasm  for Trump  Cordial relations are essential   wrote Yoffie  president emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism   But the sycophantic buddy movie that Bibi has produced with America s unbalanced and unpredictable president is something else altogether     Bibi s egregious and unnecessary embrace of everything Trump will cost Israel dearly  In Israel  a prevalent view  at least in pro Netanyahu ranks  is that the prime minister s friendship with Trump is paying unprecedented dividends  There is widespread sentiment that liberal American Jews  as a constituency  are dissipating due to intermarriage  and that the evangelical Christian community in the U S  is a more dependable ally for Israel At last year s ceremony in Jerusalem celebrating the relocation of the U S  Embassy from Tel Aviv  evangelical Christian pastors allied with Trump delivered the opening and closing blessings Netanyahu s main challenger in the election is Benny Gantz  a former military chief popular in Israel but with a relatively low profile in the United States  American Jews who dislike Netanyahu view Gantz as preferable  due in part to a less combative personality  but liberals note with frustration that the platform of Gantz s Blue and White party makes no mention of Palestinian statehood  and says that Israel will maintain control of parts of the West Bank Emily Mayer of IfNotNow  a group of youthful American Jewish activists opposed to Israel s treatment of Palestinians  is dismayed at how that issue has been marginalized in the Israeli election campaign  Regardless of the winner  the utter erasure of Palestinian humanity from this election cycle and the normalization of an undemocratic and immoral military occupation should alarm any Jew who cares about freedom and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians   Mayer said in an email    Associated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report  

As far as I know  the Federal Reserve   the world s most important economic policy institution   doesn t have an anthem  But if it were to adopt one now  the choice would be obvious   Send In the Clowns  You see  the Fed s governing board currently has two vacancies  and Donald Trump has proposed filling those vacancies with ludicrous hacks  If he succeeds  one of our few remaining havens of serious  nonpartisan policymaking will be on its way toward becoming as corrupt and dysfunctional as the rest of the Trump administration Stephen Moore and Herman Cain are  of course  completely unqualified   I say  of course  because their lack of qualifications is  paradoxically  a key qualification not just for Trump but for the G O P  in general  There are plenty of genuine monetary experts with conservative political leanings  some of them quite partisan  But modern Republicans have shown consistent disdain for such experts  perhaps because of a sense that anyone with real expertise or an independent reputation might occasionally be tempted to take a stand on principle  For an even deeper look at what s on Paul Krugman s mind  sign up for his weekly newsletter  There s no risk that either Moore or Cain will ever take such a stand  In fact  what seems to have recommended both men to Trump was their evident willingness to completely reverse their policy views when politically expedient  Both were hard money men during the Obama years  demanding higher interest rates despite very high unemployment  Both have now taken to berating the Fed for failing to print more money in the face of low unemployment   because that s what Trump wants That said  there s a difference between the two men I wrote about Moore a couple of weeks ago  noting that he has long been a prominent fixture in the conservative movement  he is  basically  a classic right wing hack who tries  incompetently  to impersonate an economic expert  Cain  on the other hand  is a spam king whose business model involves making his email list available to direct marketers Put it this way  In recent years Moore has been out there predicting magical results from tax cuts  putting out fake economic numbers  and giving speeches to FreedomFest  At the same time  Cain has been offering a platform for peddlers of get rich schemes and cures for erectile dysfunction  So it says something about what Trump wants that he apparently sees the two men as equally valuable allies What does Trump want  His attempted beclowning of the Fed follows  I d argue  from the fact that his one major legislative success  the 2017 tax cut   which he predicted would be  rocket fuel  for the economy   has turned out to be a big fizzle  economically and  especially  politically It s true that U S  economic growth got a bump for two quarters last year  and Trumpists are still pretending to believe that we ll have great growth for a decade  But at this point last year s growth is looking like a brief and rapidly fading sugar high  Meanwhile  the tax cut remains unpopular  partly because few people perceived personal benefits  partly because voters appear to be less concerned about paying too much than with the sense that the rich   the prime beneficiaries of the Trump cut   are paying too little Some leaders might see such disappointments as reasons to make a course correction  But this is Trump  When the going gets tough  he blames someone else  Everything would have been great  he insists  if the Fed hadn t thwarted his plans There s a good argument to be made that the Fed misjudged the economy s strength  that it raised interest rates too fast and that the economy would be doing somewhat better if it hadn t  In fact  it s an argument I agree with But that s not what Trump is saying  He wants the Fed to act as if we were still in a deep depression  he wants it both to cut rates and to resume the emergency policies it pursued   and he denounced   when we had more than twice as much unemployment as we do today  This would  he insists  turn the economy into the  rocket ship  he originally promised You don t have to be a gold bug or even an inflation hawk to see these demands as deeply irresponsible  Indeed  they sound a lot like the  macroeconomic populism  that has repeatedly led to economic disaster in Latin America  with Venezuela the latest example  Running the printing presses to fight a depression  as the Fed did after the financial crisis  is prudent and sensible  running them because you refuse to accept the reality that your policies aren t delivering an economic miracle is different  and always ends badly Now  even putting both Moore and Cain on the Fed board probably wouldn t be enough to push America over the monetary edge  And so far  markets don t seem worried about the potential for runaway inflation But maybe investors should be worried  at least a bit  by the spectacle of a president who would rather appoint hacks and debase the Fed s integrity than admit that his policies aren t working as promised  U S  policymaking is looking ever more like that of a corrupt third world regime  And that is bound  sooner or later  to have consequences The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our

LAS VEGAS   President Trump on Saturday again declared that the United States was  full  and called its asylum system  a scam   tying his push to close the country s borders to undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers to an entreaty for Jewish voters to support his re election campaign  Our system s full  our country s full   Mr  Trump said  speaking to an audience that included descendants of Holocaust survivors  Jews in red skullcaps emblazoned with  Trump  in white thread and people carrying Israeli flags   You can t come in  Our country is full  What can we do  We can t handle any more  Our country s full  You can t come in  I m sorry  He was met with raucous applause and cheers at the Republican Jewish Coalition s annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas  underscoring how many conservative Jewish voters  alarmed by rising threats of anti Semitism and energized by his pro Israel policies  have embraced a president with a history of trafficking in anti Semitic tropes   including remarks that he has made before the coalition Fresh from a visit on Friday to a California border town  the president doubled down on his attacks on migrants seeking asylum at the border  The administration has recently toughened its policy for accepting asylum seekers  with stories of fleeing violence and corruption no longer meeting the standard for entry  The asylum program is a scam   he said  describing people  who look like they should be fighting for the U F C    with large muscles and face tattoos   Some of the roughest people you ve ever seen  Mr  Trump has sought to paint himself as a chief supporter of Israel  trumpeting the fulfillment of his promise to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem and his decision to recognize Israel s authority over the long contested Golan Heights  Vice President Mike Pence  in a speech later Saturday  called the president  the greatest friend of the Jewish people ever to sit in the Oval Office  Like the lawmakers who spoke before him   Representative Lee Zeldin of New York  one of two Republican Jewish representatives  and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader   the president framed Democrats as unwilling to combat anti Semitism  Republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti Semitism   Mr  Trump said  He brought the crowd to its feet by introducing Timothy Matson  a police officer wounded during the shooting in October at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh In condemning anti Semitism  all three men singled out Representative Ilhan Omar  the freshman Democrat from Minnesota and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress  who for weeks has fended off accusations of anti Semitism over comments critical of Israel ImageAttendees at the coalition s annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas included Sheldon G  Adelson  the billionaire casino magnate and prominent Republican donor  and his wife  Miriam Adelson CreditAl Drago for The New York Times Special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota   Mr  Trump said  expressing gratitude to other attendees  including Sheldon G  Adelson  the billionaire casino magnate and prominent Republican donor  and his wife  Miriam   Oh  I forgot  she doesn t like Israel  I m so sorry   Ms  Omar herself was recently the target of death threats  This week  federal agents arrested a New York resident  Patrick W  Carlineo Jr   after he reportedly called her office  described her as  a terrorist  and promised  in an expletive laden threat  to  put a bullet in her skull   Ms  Omar later responded on Twitter by quoting a prayer of forgiveness   My Lord  forgive my people for they do not know  Mr  Trump also appeared to blur the lines between the American Jews in the audience and Israelis  referring at one point to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as  your prime minister  and warning that congressional Democrats  could leave Israel out there all by yourselves  At one point  he asked the crowd   How the hell did you support President Obama  How the hell did you support the Democrats   Reminded by the audience that members of the Republican Jewish Coalition did not  in fact  support Mr  Obama  he laughed before conceding   You guys didn t  That s right  A few protesters were escorted from the arena early on in the speech  chanting  Jews are here to say  Occupation is a plague   according to IfNotNow  a Jewish organization that issued a statement afterward  Logan Bayroff  a spokesman for J Street  the liberal Jewish organization  said the president s remarks about immigrants and minorities were  extremely discordant and extremely disgusting to the majority of Jewish people  But the crowd of supporters in the ballroom at the Venetian hotel and casino were enthusiastic as the president delivered a cornucopia of boasts  complaints and exaggerations typical of his campaign rallies  efforts to overhaul trade deals with Mexico and China  and his pledge to build a border wall  Cheers of  four more years  rang out after Mr  Trump left The president s claims about the country s capacity to support more immigrants echoed an argument he made on Friday during his visit to a border town in California  backing down from a threat to close the legal ports of entry between the United States and Mexico Allies of the president have argued that he is right to push to overhaul the process  with the surge of families turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents at the ports of entry or in between them  What you see happening here is an abuse of asylum laws   Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of the president s  said in a brief interview after Mr  Trump s speech   If asylum is going to be that everybody who is economically impoverished can come to America  there will be no way we can handle the flow   Bottom line is   he added   we accept refugees

administration has proposed imposing tariffs on  11 billion worth of imports from the European Union  to punish the bloc for providing what it says are unfair subsidies to Airbus  the WSJ reports The W T O  says European subsidies to Airbus have harmed the U S   according to the office of the U S  trade representative  an argument that it has made since 2004  The new tariffs   which would affect

The crown prince plans to use the proceeds to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil  How investigators could pursue legal action against BoeingAircraft manufacturers like Boeing rarely face a criminal investigation over plane crashes  But Peter Henning of DealBook asks  What federal criminal laws are investigators looking at as they pore over Boeing s records    One statute they may consider is the federal false statements law  The broad statute is used when a company provides information to a federal agency like the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the safety of a plane and makes it a crime to provide an agency with  any materially false  fictitious  or fraudulent statement or representation      The criminal investigation may also examine a statute that  makes it a crime to  knowingly and with intent to defraud  falsify or conceal a material fact about an aircraft part  or to make  any materially fraudulent representation  about a part  It can be applied to conduct outside the United States so long as the company is organized under the laws of this country    And  if there is evidence of fraud and not just false statements  the Justice Department could also pursue a wire fraud case   There is danger in any criminal investigation because even the hint of possible misconduct could have significant consequences as it tries to deal with the fallout from crashes of its best selling aircraft  More  It isn t just anti stall software in the 737 Max jet that may need updating  And investigators still have questions about how the pilots of the doomed

entitles them to the documents Mr  Trump has denounced Democrats  request as political harassment  The acting White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  has pledged that they will  never  see the returns Mr  Mnuchin has been more cautious  In October  he said that if Democrats won the House and requested the returns  he would work with government lawyers to see if the demand was legal  More

while helping minority students meet them  died on Sunday in Chicago  He was 80 The cause was a heart attack  his son Carter said In 1976  Dr  Stewart  the first in his family to complete college  became the president of Spelman  the historically black women s college in Atlanta that was rich in tradition but short of funds  His appointment was opposed by students who had wanted the school s trustees to choose a black woman as president  and who briefly locked several trustees in a room in protest His tenure was successful despite the rocky start  When he retired from Spelman 10 years later   he was succeeded by the school s first black female president  Johnnetta B  Cole   the endowment had grown to more than  41 million from  9 million and enrollment had grown to 1 600 from 1 200  About half the college s professors had doctorates when Dr  Stewart took over  the share was 74 percent when he left  And the average SAT scores of entering freshmen had surged by 100 points During Dr  Stewart s tenure  the college created a chemistry department  a comprehensive writing program and a Women s Research and Resource Center After leaving Spelman  Dr  Stewart took over the College Board  the nonprofit private organization that administers the SATs and a scholarship service  He was thrust into a contentious national debate over the college admissions process ImageDr  Stewart at an appearance at Spelman by Shirley Chisholm  the first black woman elected to Congress  in the 1980s CreditSpelman ArchivesSome critics complained that relying largely on standardized tests reduced the number of minority students who were accepted  because minority students tended not to do as well as a result of perceived bias in the tests Others cautioned that making the tests easier  or giving too much weight to amorphous factors   like attracting a more racially and ethnically diverse freshman class and students whose talents cannot be measured only by test taking   could lower academic standards The board revised the exam to eliminate more facile multiple choice questions and permitted students to use calculators  although it stopped short of requiring essays  as some had recommended  It also began programs to better prepare minority students for college  Having spent a lot of time defining and raising standards   Dr  Stewart told The New York Times in 1993   we have decided to help students meet those standards  But while Dr  Stewart insisted that a standardized test of acquired knowledge should not be the sole criterion for college admission  he staunchly defended the SAT s record as an indicator of students  performance during their freshman year  True  average Scholastic Assessment Test scores for some ethnic minority students are lower than the overall averages   he wrote in a letter to The Times in 1995   But those scores reflect inequity of education  not bias in the test  Image I believe in human dignity and individual potential   Dr  Stewart said   As administrators  I think we are at our best when we help release the best in other people  CreditSpelman CollegeDr  Stewart warned that the elimination of affirmative action programs in college admissions  designed to mitigate generations of discrimination in educational opportunity  could cause a  wipeout that could take away an entire generation   Such a move  he said  would lead to an increased reliance on test scores  which could risk  the resegregation of higher education  Dr  Stewart  who said that at one point he considered becoming a minister  characterized himself in the 1980s as having become more conservative over the years   a  19th century liberal in the Adam Smith sense   I became far more convinced that government couldn t do it all  that there had to be a market mechanism at work to make efficient decisions and also to protect individuality and individual creativity   he said an interview with The College Board Review in 1986  I believe in human dignity and individual potential   he added   I don t like heavy handed government or other forms of centralization  As administrators  I think we are at our best when we help release the best in other people  Dr  Stewart was a director of The New York Times Company from 1986 to 2005  After retiring from the College Board in 1999  he was a special adviser to the president and senior program officer in the education division of the Carnegie Corporation of New York  From 2000 to 2005  he was chief executive of the Chicago Community Trust  where he supported a charter school initiative called Urban Prep Academies Dr  Stewart was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago s Harris School of Public Policy from 2005 to 2011  In 2010  he was appointed to the Commission on Presidential Scholars by President Barack Obama Notable Deaths 2019A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2019Donald Mitchell Stewart was born on July 8  1938  in Chicago to Elmer Ashton Stewart  a Post Office employee  and Anna Lucy  Mitchell  Stewart  a homemaker who sold encyclopedias to help put her son and daughter through college He graduated from Grinnell College in Iowa in 1959 with a bachelor s degree in political science  He went on to earn a master s in political science from Yale University and a master s and doctorate in public administration from Harvard University s Kennedy School of Government  where his doctoral dissertation was titled  The Politics of Higher Education and Public Policy  A Study of the American Council on Education  Before joining Spelman  Dr  Stewart held leadership positions at the University of Pennyslvania  including associate dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences  director of the College of General Studies and counselor to the provost  He also worked in the overseas development division of the Ford Foundation In 1965 he married Isabel Carter Johnston  who survives him along with their sons  Jay Ashton Stewart  Carter Mitchell Stewart and Gojeb Frehywot and eight grandchildren Dr  Stewart turned down an offer to become assistant secretary of education to join the College Board  As we look to the future   he said when he was appointed   the issues will be performance  quality and access  I believe very strongly in high standards  but also in helping people to meet those standards  not to see standards lowered   

DALLAS   Southwest Airlines customers relaxing on Thursday evening got an email that may mean their summer vacation could be more stressful and expensive than they planned Southwest  the biggest operator of Boeing jets  is removing the grounded 737 Max from its schedule until at least Aug  5  well past the peak of the summer high season Company President Tom Nealon wrote in his email that the airline is taking the Max out of its schedule two months longer than previously planned to reduce the need for last minute changes during the summer travel season  The decision  he wrote  would make the schedule more reliable Other airlines are likely to follow Southwest s example  putting pressure on Boeing to finish fixing software on an anti stall system implicated in two deadly crashes Last month  Boeing and federal officials said privately that the company would finish its work before the end of March  Instead  it was delayed by an unexpected problem that Boeing hasn t fully described  and the company is now aiming to complete its work by late April Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company s pilots have flown 96 test flights totaling 160 hours with the new software and will operate more in the coming weeks to prove that the fix works The changes must be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration for approval  Foreign regulators including those in Europe and China will then do their own reviews   significant because foreign airlines account for about 85  of Max orders  according to analysts for financial services firm Cowen It remains uncertain how willing passengers will be to board the Max after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed all 346 people on board  The general flying public seems to be asking more questions about the airplane than they have with prior fleet groundings   said Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak  referring to the 2013 grounding of Boeing 787s because of overheating lithium ion battery packs  The 787 survived and became a hit with airlines and passengers FAA officials including acting chief Daniel Elwell met in Washington with representatives from Southwest  American and United and their pilot unions  An FAA spokesman said they went over the early findings from the two crash investigations  upcoming changes in the Max software  and pilot training for those changes  Elwell promised that the agency would be transparent about decisions to clear the plane to fly American Airlines 737 pilot Dennis Tajer  who was in the meeting  said unions pushed for a stronger pilot training program including troubleshooting items only indirectly related to the anti stall software  He said FAA seemed receptive  This will not be a minimum training event to just get by   he said The longer the Max planes sit on the ground  the more money airlines lose  Southwest already figures that just the first three weeks the Max had been grounded  along with other setbacks  cut the airline s first quarter revenue by  150 million Southwest has been canceling about 90 flights a day because its 34 Max jets have been grounded since mid March  Spokesman Chris Mainz said the new schedule eliminates about 160 daily flights to assure customers that it will operate the flights they booked That is 4  of Southwest s 4 000 daily flights during summer  Still  unless the airline finds replacement planes quickly   and that can be a complicated process   Southwest will scrap about 10 000 flights that could have carried nearly 1 8 million people between now and early August American Airlines doesn t expect its 24 Max jets to be flying before June 5  and it too is canceling about 90 flights a day United Airlines  with 14 Max planes  says it is shuffling its fleet and mostly covering flights that were scheduled with the Max in mind Without those planes  travelers will have fewer flights to choose from  and fewer planes to carry passengers whose flights are canceled for other reasons such as bad weather  There could also be fewer fare sales  Travelers who have not already booked their summer reservations may end up paying a slightly higher airfare   said Henry Harteveldt  a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group   but it s not going to be the summer from hell  Harteveldt said he expects airlines that don t have Max jets   a list that includes Delta  JetBlue  Alaska and Spirit   will court travelers with price cutting The cost of the Max crisis to Boeing also rises the longer the plane is grounded and jets coming off the assembly line pile up around Seattle With aircraft orders booming  Boeing shares have soared for more than two years  although they dropped about 14  from March 1 through Friday s close  Most of Wall Street has expressed confidence that Boeing can fix the Max quickly and regain momentum Poponak  the Goldman Sachs analyst  said however there is a risk that Boeing orders could suffer for the next few years  He said some airlines seemed to view the Airbus competitor  the A320neo series  as superior  and some aircraft leasing companies faced a challenge to place the Max with airline customers Since its launch in 2017  the Max had emerged as Boeing s best selling jet  Fewer than 400 have been delivered  but about 4 600 are on order However  the company took no new orders for the Max in March   not even before the March 10 crash in Ethiopia   and only 10 in the first three months of the year  down from 112 in the same period last year  It could be that airlines interested in the plane had already placed orders Boeing stopped deliveries and announced last week that it was cutting production of 737s from 52 to 42 a month Airlines in China and Norway have said they want compensation for their grounded planes  While other airlines have kept silent  analysts expect Boeing will make concessions that could total hundreds of millions of dollars The Chicago based company also faces a growing number of lawsuits by families of the crash victims Boeing hasn t provided numbers on the financial impact from the Max crisis     

WASHINGTON   In June 2016  five months before the American presidential election  Julian Assange made a bold prediction during a little noticed interview with a British television show  WikiLeaks has a very big year ahead   he said  just seconds after announcing that the website he founded would soon be publishing a cache of emails related to Hillary Clinton He was right  But an indictment unsealed on Thursday charging Mr  Assange with conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer in 2010 makes no mention of the central role that WikiLeaks played in the Russian campaign to undermine Mrs  Clinton s presidential chances and help elect President Trump  It remains unclear whether the arrest of Mr  Assange will be a key to unlocking any of the lingering mysteries surrounding the Russians  the Trump campaign and the plot to hack an election The Justice Department spent years examining whether Mr  Assange was working directly with the Russian government  but legal experts point out that what is known about his activities in 2016   including publishing stolen emails   is not criminal  and therefore it would be difficult to bring charges against him related to the Russian interference campaign Numerous significant questions are left unanswered  including what  if anything  Mr  Assange knew about the identity of Guccifer 2 0  a mysterious hacker who American intelligence and law enforcement officials have identified as a front for Russian military intelligence operatives Court documents have revealed that it was Russian intelligence   using the Guccifer persona   that provided Mr  Assange thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D  Podesta  the chairman of the Clinton campaign Another question is whether Mr  Assange was a conduit between the Russian hackers and the Trump campaign  Mr  Assange exchanged emails with Donald Trump Jr   Mr  Trump s eldest son  during the campaign  and a Trump campaign official sent Roger J  Stone Jr   a longtime adviser to the president  to get information about the hacked Democratic emails  according to a January indictment by Robert S  Mueller III  the special counsel Mr  Mueller concluded his investigation without an indictment that directly connected WikiLeaks  the Russians and the Trump campaign  suggesting that prosecutors did not find sufficient evidence that Mr  Assange knowingly engaged in a conspiracy with Russia to help the Trump campaign But the report drafted by Mr  Mueller s team  and expected to be released next week  could have additional details about the ties between the Trump campaign and Mr  Assange  Those details could be redacted by the Justice Department  however  if officials believe the material includes classified intelligence  said Carrie Cordero  a former official with the Justice Department s National Security Division and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  What was the actual interaction between Russian intelligence surrogates  WikiLeaks and Trump campaign surrogates   she said   That is a question that has not yet been answered  On Thursday  congressional Democrats sent a letter to Attorney General William P  Barr again demanding that they be provided the full  unredacted report  along with underlying evidence ImageRobert S  Mueller III  the special counsel  concluded his investigation without an indictment that directly connected WikiLeaks  the Russians and the Trump campaign CreditCliff Owen Associated PressThe special counsel also handed off his work to other prosecutors  including those who have long been examining Mr  Assange s dealings with Guccifer  the Russian intelligence front Many Democrats and Republicans remain convinced that Mr  Assange knowingly worked with Russian intelligence  On Thursday  Senator Richard M  Burr  the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee  said Mr  Assange and WikiLeaks  have effectively acted as an arm of the Russian intelligence services for years   The committee s Democratic vice chairman  Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  said Mr  Assange had become  a direct participant in Russian efforts to undermine the West  Mr  Assange has long been a polarizing figure   hailed at the beginning of his career as champion for government transparency but also viewed by American national security officials as a disruptive force who conspired with Chelsea Manning  the former Army intelligence analyst  to publish hundreds of thousands of classified documents But it was WikiLeaks  publication of material stolen by Russian intelligence in 2016 that hardened the view of national security officials In April 2017  in one of his first major speeches  Mike Pompeo   who was C I A  director at the time but months earlier  as a Republican congressman  had praised WikiLeaks for its releases that damaged the Clinton campaign   signaled that the government would take a hard line on WikiLeaks Mr  Pompeo compared WikiLeaks to  a hostile intelligence service   and said it sought support from anti democratic countries as it targeted the United States with its disclosures Mr  Pompeo s public remarks coincided with a private push against Mr  Assange by the Trump administration  The C I A  intensified espionage efforts against WikiLeaks  seeking to learn more about his interactions with the Russian intelligence operatives The timing of Mr  Assange s actions fueled suspicions  His June 2016 interview announcing the impending release of Democratic emails came three days after a meeting at Trump Tower in New York between Russians and senior Trump campaign officials   a meeting set up on the promise that the Russians would have damaging information about Mrs  Clinton Throughout the 2016 campaign  Mr  Assange played down accusations of Russian interference  and misled the public on his source for the damaging documents WikiLeaks released He offered a  20 000 reward for information about the killing in Washington of Seth Rich  a young Democratic National Committee staff member shot to death in an apparent bungled street robbery  Some supporters of Mr  Trump suggested that it was Mr  Rich who had leaked the committee s emails and that he had been killed in retaliation During an August 2016 discussion with Dutch television about the sources of WikiLeaks  information  Mr  Assange suddenly brought up Mr  Rich s killing  That was just a robbery  I believe  wasn t it   the interviewer said   What are you suggesting   I m suggesting that our sources take risks   Mr  Assange said  He then declined to say if Mr  Rich was a source  

Purdue Pharma s sales force swept through New York State  visiting doctors and pharmacies nearly half a million times between 2006 and 2017 to promote OxyContin and other opioid painkillers  That is roughly 160 sales stops in the state each weekday during the height of the nation s addiction crisis The company s flood the zone sales strategy was among the new disclosures contained in court papers filed on Thursday by Attorney General Letitia James of New York as part of the office s lawsuit against opioid manufacturers  distributors and eight members of the Sackler family  who control Purdue During that time the sales force had the most visits per capita  11 881 per 100 000 people  to rural Herkimer County  2017 population  62 240  in the Mohawk Valley  according to the papers  State data shows that the county s rate of emergency room visits involving opioids was nearly three times higher than New York City s in 2017 Sales reps made more than 250 visits that year to one  pain management facility with three locations in Central New York   the court papers said  That comes out to about one visit every weekday The disclosures were contained in a new version of the attorney general s amended complaint  which was originally filed two weeks ago with significant portions of the document redacted  Over the last two weeks  lawyers in the attorney general s office have negotiated with the lawyers for the defendants to lift most of the redactions In a statement  Purdue Pharma said the new court filing  contains factual errors and gross distortions and misrepresentations based on highly selective excerpting of language from tens of millions of documents  The complaint is designed to publicly vilify Purdue and its former directors  Heroin Addiction Explained  How Opioids Hijack the BrainA look at how opioids hijack the brain  from temptation and tolerance to relapse and recovery The new disclosures make clear that Purdue was not the only manufacturer with a marketing strategy that in some measure seemed to suggest a military campaign One supervisor at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals  a manufacturer of branded and generic opioids based in Ireland  urged his sales force to  ATTACK   according to the papers  telling them they could get  big bonus dollars  by waiting in front of the doors of health care providers and by using free trial offers to win business Another Mallinckrodt sales supervisor told the company s New York staff that the company s Xartemis opioid  is the BEST opportunity to make lots of money    Mallinckrodt s approach was so aggressive that the Drug Enforcement Administration referred to the company as the  kingpin of the drug cartel   according to the court papers Mallinckrodt did not respond to requests for comment The complaint described a visit an internal investigator for one of Mallinckrodt s distributors made to the Staten Island office of a physician assistant in 2010  The investigator reported   The parking lot was packed and the street was also full of cars  Many people were sitting around in the cars and half dozen milling around in the parking lot  Looks like a typical Florida pill mill  I am very uncomfortable with this  Despite these red flags  sales representatives from Mallinckrodt continued to visit the office  the complaint says  The physician assistant  Leonard Marchetta  was indicted in 2014 for conspiracy to distribute narcotics  pleaded guilty the next year and was sentenced to 11 years in prison The filing also removed the redaction on several emails sent by Richard Sackler  a former president of Purdue  In one  he suggested that people who took OxyContin were solely to blame for their addiction   They get themselves addicted over and over again   Dr  Sackler wrote   They engage in it with full  criminal intent  Why should they be entitled to our sympathies  A statement issued on behalf of Dr  Sackler said he was  sorry for using insensitive language in an email to a friend nearly 20 years ago during moments of frustration about reports of illicit activity  ImagePurdue Pharma s corporate headquarters in Stamford  Conn  It said the new court filing  contains factual errors and gross distortions and misrepresentations based on highly selective excerpting of language from tens of millions of documents  CreditDrew Angerer Getty ImagesThe Sacklers have filed a motion to dismiss a similar lawsuit against individual family members brought by Maura Healey  the attorney general for Massachusetts  It contends that many of the allegations were based on misleading representations of routine board meetings  using  snippets of emails   many of which are  stale and distorted  It further argues that the Sacklers were often acting in their legal obligations to the company and disputes the lawsuit s assertion that they directed the company s conduct  These are examples of an overriding theme in the complaint against the Sacklers   said a lawyer for the families   If you look at everything in the most dated and cynical way  then you can make anything sound terrible  There were other new disclosures in the latest filings in the New York case   Purdue employees knew as early as 1999 that people were abusing OxyContin and knew the ways they were doing so  In an internal email to a senior executive  an employee disputed the claim that some abusers of the drug  shoot   or inject  it  saying that they crushed the tablets and snorted the powder   Injection is not too popular because the waxy junk in the tablets can mess up the user s veins   the employee wrote   At least  that s what I ve read   the email said   I understand that OxyContin is the preferred drug   the email said   Purdue Pharma spent  68 million from 2006 to 2016 on opioid education  much of it directed to front groups  and  1 5 million in New York in roughly the same period to push its message  through seemingly legitimate sources   according to the complaint   Mallinckrodt paid  300 000 to a Kansas doctor  Sri Nalamachu  who was featured in a brochure in which  he criticized efforts to restrict access to pain prescription medication due to concerns  about opioid abuse  the complaint said  The payment was never disclosed  in the brochure or elsewhere   An executive at a regional drug distribution company asked a Mallinckrodt executive to keep supplying the opioid oxycodone  It s  like people are addicted to these things  Oh  wait  people are   the first executive wrote  The Mallinckrodt executive responded that it was  just like Doritos   Keep eating   he added   we ll make more   

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s apparent election victory has deepened the divisions in an already divided country Bolstered by his base of religious and working class voters  Netanyahu can be expected to press ahead with a hard line agenda that will likely eliminate the last hopes of a two state solution with the Palestinians  A looming indictment in a series of corruption scandals could even accelerate these trends For all the talk of unity from political leaders during the campaign  Israel is a deeply tribal country  People are divided between Jews and Arabs  religious Jews and secular Jews  Jews of European ancestry and those of Middle Eastern heritage  and residents of the secular  high tech metropolis of Tel Aviv and people from dusty  outlying towns  West Bank settlements and the conservative capital of Jerusalem Netanyahu  himself a secular  U S  educated millionaire with a propensity for cognac and cigars  has nonetheless aligned himself with downtrodden Jewish Israelis with whom he would seem to have little in common  Portraying himself as a victim of the country s  elites   Netanyahu is seen as their hero  Netanyahu is the best prime minister the state of Israel has ever had  and we will continue to support him   said Alon Davidi  mayor of the southern town of Sderot Just two weeks ago  Davidi s town was dealing with around the clock air raid sirens as Palestinian militants in the neighboring Gaza Strip were bombarding southern Israeli communities with rocket fire It s a scene the residents of southern Israel have gotten used to since the Hamas militant group seized power in Gaza 12 years ago  It s also a constant source of frustration  Residents complained about Netanyahu s inability to stop the rockets and were furious over his latest behind the scenes cease fire deal with Hamas But given a chance to change things in Tuesday s election  residents of Sderot voted overwhelmingly for Netanyahu s Likud party and its religious and nationalist allies  We are intelligent people   Davidi told the Army Radio station   We are people who know how to appreciate everything that s done for us  and I think that Netanyahu and all the right wing parties are doing what they can do and what they believe  In Sderot  whose population is largely working class  religious and of Mizrahi  or Middle Eastern  descent  Netanyahu s Likud received 44  of the vote  compared with 9  for the rival Blue and White party  according to official election data  More than 80  of Sderot voted for Likud and its religions and nationalist allies Similar thinking took place across Israel  A look at the electoral map showed Likud and its allies sweeping the vote in smaller  outlying cities and towns  West Bank settlements and in Jerusalem  whose population is largely poor and religious In contrast  Blue and White  led by former military chief Benny Gantz  coasted to victory in Tel Aviv  the country s prosperous commercial and cultural center  as well as the nearby suburbs that are home to a more professional and affluent population On the campaign trail  Gantz sought to project an image of decency and virtue  taking aim at the corruption investigations swirling around Netanyahu and promising a clean and honest government In contrast  the 69 year old Netanyahu  facing the strong likelihood of criminal charges in the coming months  sounded very much like his friend President Donald Trump  He frequently portrayed himself as the victim of a  witch hunt  and accused Gantz of conspiring with politicians from the country s Arab minority to topple him  Even after a decade in office  Netanyahu marketed himself as the outsider These different approaches were on display on election night  when preliminary results showed a close race and each candidate declared victory Gantz s rally looked like a celebration  Netanyahu s felt like a sporting event  with the whipped up crowd whooping and hollering as if it were at a soccer match  Where Gantz s supporters were excited  Netanyahu s supporters   many wearing Jewish skullcaps and dancing to Mizrahi pop music   were ecstatic  His speech included a Jewish prayer and a Trump like swipe at the  hostile  media Netanyahu s opponents finally conceded defeat Wednesday  acknowledging that he and his traditional allies control a solid majority in the 120 seat parliament But the process of building a coalition can require weeks of negotiations  and his smaller partners will be looking to extract control of powerful government ministries and generous budgets to promote their pet causes Thanks to Netanyahu s legal woes  these smaller partners have some added leverage  They will likely use Netanyahu s fear of indictment to their advantage as he seeks promises to protect him from prosecutors  perhaps by pushing legislation granting him immunity Netanyahu veered sharply to the right on the campaign trail to shore up support of his base  promising to begin annexing West Bank settlements if re elected  Netanyahu s allies will try to hold him at his word  The new Netanyahu government will have two main goals  to get rid of the indictments looming in his future and to annex the settlements to Israel  in coordination with the Trump administration  These two goals could be summed up as  immunity in exchange for sovereignty    wrote Aluf Benn  editor of the Haaretz daily The annexation of Israeli settlements could spell the end for any remaining hopes of establishing an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel Ben Dror Yemini  a columnist for the Yediot Ahronot daily  urged Netanyahu to consider a  unity  government with Gantz instead of caving in to the  extortion  of small hard line parties  Which is the better choice  to save the country or to sanctimoniously insist that  promises must be kept    he wrote Such a scenario seems unlikely  After decades of doing things his way  Netanyahu seems unlikely to reach across the aisle unless he has no choice As he put it at his late night victory rally   I ll start by assembling a right wing government with our natural allies tonight     EDITOR S NOTE  Josef Federman  the AP s bureau chief for Israel and the Palestinian territories  has covered the region since 2003  

WASHINGTON   The Treasury Department said on Wednesday evening that it would not immediately comply with a congressional request to hand over President Trump s tax returns  setting up a protracted legal battle between two branches of government Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  said in a letter to Representative Richard E  Neal  the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  that the Treasury Department s lawyers needed more time to assess the lawfulness of the request and expressed concern that it would be a violation of taxpayer privacy Mr  Mnuchin did not say how much time the review would take but conveyed concerns about whether Congress has authority to review the records  The committee s request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional investigative authority  the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose and the constitutional rights of American citizens   Mr  Mnuchin wrote   The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically motivated disclosures of tax information  regardless of which party is in power  Mr  Neal responded to Mr  Mnuchin s decision with a terse statement that indicated he believed the request was a matter for the Internal Revenue Service  not the Treasury secretary   I will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response to the commissioner in the coming days  Mr  Neal is expected to send a follow up letter demanding the tax returns and outlining potential next steps  which could include a subpoena or a lawsuit  The issue could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court Mr  Trump said on Wednesday that he would not turn over his tax returns because they remained under audit by the I R S   signaling a long fight ahead The president  who has used the excuse of an I R S  audit since the 2016 presidential campaign  made clear he would continue to cite that as a reason not to release his tax records  even though no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing returns while under audit  I would love to give them  but I m not going to do it while I m under audit   Mr  Trump told reporters before departing for a trip to Texas   I have no obligation to do that while under audit and no lawyer would tell you to release your tax returns while you re under audit  Mr  Trump s Treasury Department was facing a midnight deadline to respond to a letter sent last week by Mr  Neal  who issued a formal request for six years of Mr  Trump s personal and business tax records White House officials have called the request a political fishing expedition  and Mr  Mnuchin has said that furnishing the returns could open the floodgates to weaponizing the Internal Revenue Service Mr  Mnuchin signaled his intention on Tuesday  when he told members of Congress that the president had no legal obligation to make his tax returns public  While Mr  Mnuchin insisted that he would follow the law  he also defended Mr  Trump s right to keep his tax returns private Mr  Mnuchin reiterated his position that the privacy of taxpayers  including that of the president  was paramount during a moderated discussion on Wednesday at the International Monetary Fund  We are going to respond carefully  We need to make sure that the I R S  and individual taxpayer information does not just become subject to political winds   Mr  Mnuchin said  adding that he had been consulting with the Justice Department on the matter   Whether it is this party or a different party over time  I take the obligation very seriously to make sure that we follow the law correctly  But the provision in tax law that Democrats are using appears to give the Trump administration little leeway to resist their request  it says merely that the Treasury secretary  shall  furnish the requested information  It was used several times by House Republicans when they were investigating whether the I R S  had improperly delayed applications by conservative groups for nonprofit status Some Democrats quickly denounced the Treasury Department s decision on Wednesday  How many lawyers and how much time does it take for Secretary Mnuchin to understand that  shall  means  shall    said Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas  a member of the Ways and Means Committee   Again  believing that he is above the law  Trump is engaged in obstruction  Republicans praised Mr  Mnuchin s caution and lashed out at Democrats for what they said was an abuse of power  Americans didn t elect their members of Congress to go to Washington to try to dig up harmful information on their political opponents   said Senator Charles E  Grassley of Iowa  the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee   It should be alarming to every American that there are attempts by elected officials to weaponize the I R S  for partisan political purposes  Mr  Mnuchin acknowledged that White House lawyers had been in touch with the Treasury Department about the matter before Mr  Neal made his formal request last week  Mr  Mnuchin said he had not personally spoken to Mr  Trump about the request As a candidate  Mr  Trump promised on many occasions that he would release his returns when the I R S  finished an audit of his taxes  Declining to release the returns broke with decades of precedent Charles P  Rettig  the I R S  commissioner  said Tuesday at a congressional hearing that no rules prohibited taxpayers who are under audit from releasing their tax returns The tax returns of presidents are automatically audited  After Democrats took control of the House this year  Mr  Neal decided to use a provision in the tax code that allows the chairman of the tax writing committee to gain access to the returns of any taxpayer  Mr  Neal said Mr  Trump s returns were needed so the committee could assess how the I R S  was auditing presidential returns Republicans have argued that this rationale is suspect  pointing out that Democrats only asked for Mr  Trump s returns and that there are other methods that could be used to study the auditing practices at the I R S Although he has said he would rely on the advice of his department s lawyers when deciding  Mr  Mnuchin  one of Mr  Trump s most loyal aides  has been widely expected to fight to keep the tax returns secret In his letter  the Treasury secretary said he would be personally overseeing the matter

opportunity on Thursday evening The delay pushed back a repeat of the rocket s majestic lift from the launchpad last February  During that test launch  the Falcon Heavy lofted a spacesuit wearing mannequin  nicknamed Starman  into a long orbit around the sun  It sat in the driver s seat of a red Tesla Roadster that belonged to Elon Musk  the founder and chief executive of SpaceX  Video broadcast from orbit turned into the longest car commercial ever The spacecraft s payload this time is mundane and useful  Arabsat 6A  a Saudi Arabian communications satellite which will relay television  internet and mobile phone signals to the Middle East  Africa and Europe  Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar  Why is Falcon Heavy different from other SpaceX rockets The company s workhorse is the Falcon 9 rocket  which first launched in 2010  The first stage of the Heavy essentially consists of three Falcon 9 first stages bound together  The second stages of the two rockets are identical  The additional thrust allows the Heavy to propel 140 000 pounds to low Earth orbit  nearly three times what the Falcon 9 can lift How does this Falcon Heavy differ from the first one On the test flight  the two side boosters were older versions reused from earlier flights   SpaceX s best innovation to date is landing the booster stage of its rockets and launching it again  traditionally  rockets have been one use throwaways  with the booster stages dropped into the ocean  For this one  the side boosters have never before been used  They are the latest version of the rocket  called  Block Five     Block  is what rocket companies call a major upgrade   That boosts the thrust and how much the Falcon Heavy can carry Will SpaceX land the three boosters Yes  The two side boosters are to return to landing pads at Cape Canaveral  not far from the launchpad  just as in the maiden flight The center booster  which will go higher and farther  is to set down on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean  That did not quite work as designed on the first try  The booster missed the platform  hitting the water at more than 300 miles per hour  Mr  Musk said the booster did not have enough ignition fuel to light the engines for the final burn Why hasn t Falcon Heavy flown in more than a year Even though the first Falcon Heavy flight appeared to be nearly flawless  SpaceX probably made adjustments  That  after all  is the reason a rocket company performs a test flight for a new rocket design SpaceX also has had a backlog of Falcon 9 missions to fly  It launched 20 Falcon 9 missions in 2018  more than in any previous year  in addition to the one Falcon Heavy launch  The company was also busy at work developing its Crew Dragon capsule for taking NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station The market for the Falcon Heavy is also much smaller than once envisioned  When Mr  Musk first announced the rocket in 2011  he said he expected that there would be a 50 50 mix between the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy  In the years since  improvements have made the Falcon 9 more powerful  and miniaturization of electronics has shrunk the size of many satellites The Falcon Heavy is now needed for only the largest satellites like the 13 000 pound Arabsat 6A satellite  which is headed to geosynchronous orbit more than 22 000 miles above Earth Timeline of SpaceX MissionsSpaceX launched its Falcon Heavy rocket for the second time on Thursday Are there more Falcon Heavy flights planned One more Falcon Heavy flight is scheduled for this year   a mission for the United States Air Force carrying 25 small satellites In addition  SpaceX has announced contracts for two Falcon Heavy launches of commercial satellites  and the company has won two competitions to use the rocket for national security missions Will Falcon Heavy go to the moon At present  no  but that answer could change In 2017  SpaceX announced that two space tourists would go on an around the moon trip in one of the company s Crew Dragon capsules launched by a Falcon Heavy  But when the first Heavy reached the launchpad last year  SpaceX said it had decided not to go to the expense and effort of making the rocket safe enough for launching people The possibility of using the Falcon Heavy for lunar missions was revived last month by Jim Bridenstine  the NASA administrator  when he told a Senate committee that the big rocket that his agency is developing  the Space Launch System  would not be ready for its first test flight in 2020  NASA was looking into using commercial rockets as an alternative  he said One of the alternatives was putting the second stage of the Space Launch System on top of a Falcon Heavy first stage  Mr  Bridenstine later said that option was feasible but could not be done by next year  because major changes would be needed to the boosters and SpaceX s launchpad to accommodate the Frankenstein rocket combination  Mr  Bridenstine  however  left the door open  saying that NASA would explore all options to meet the Trump administrations goal of sending astronauts back to the moon by the end of 2024 What other rockets is SpaceX planning to build SpaceX s next generation rocket was once known as B F R  where  B  stood for  big  and  R  stood for  rocket   It now has the less colorful name Starship  SpaceX has begun small hop tests of a preliminary design  nicknamed Starhopper  The full fledged design is to reach orbit and eventually make distant journeys to the moon and Mars  but that is still years away One of Starship s first passengers is to be Yusaku Maezawa  founder of the online Japanese clothing company Zozo  Mr  Maezawa had been one of the lunar tourists who had signed up for the Falcon Heavy trip around the moon but now will wait longer for the even larger rocket Earlier reporting on private spaceflightSpaceX and NASA Launch Is First Step to Renewed Human SpaceflightMarch 1

Welcome to the Climate Fwd  newsletter  The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change  Sign up here to get it in your inbox By Ronda KaysenImageCreditTyler VarsellSpring is here  and that means millions of Americans will soon be seeding  fertilizing and mowing their grass America has a lot of lawns  Add them all together  and they d cover an area roughly the size of Florida  making grass the most common irrigated plant in the country  And all that grass comes with an environmental cost To keep weeds at bay  homeowners dumped around 59 million pounds of pesticides onto their residential landscapes in 2012  according to the Environmental Protection Agency  Some of those leach into the waterways  potentially exposing children and pets to harmful chemicals  Grass is thirsty  too  Americans use about 7 billion gallons of water a day  a third of all residential water consumption  to irrigate  Roughly half of that water is wasted because of runoff  evaporation or overwatering  And then there s the mowing  edging and leaf blowing  According to a study by Quiet Communities  a nonprofit group  that equipment  mostly powered by gas  emitted 26 7 million tons of pollutants into the atmosphere in 2011  Those emissions contribute to climate change  Despite the time and resources needed to maintain a tidy lawn  they provide no habitat for bees  butterflies or the birds that feed on the insects  Lawns are a significant environmental problem   said David Mizejewski  a naturalist with the National Wildlife Federation   We put in these lawns  and we basically turned these important habitats into dead zones   The good news is  You don t necessarily have to let your yard go wild  or dig the whole thing up to plant rocks  in order to lower your environmental impact  A Secret Superpower  Right in Your BackyardMarch 6  2018You can reduce your lawn by chipping away one weekend and one season a time  dedicating a few of the hours you might normally spend caring for your lawn to planting native grasses  shrubs  trees  flowers and food  Consider replacing some of that needy grass with a low maintenance ground cover like clover  creeping thyme  mint or strawberry  You can also plant a tree and surround it with a bed of mulch  If you already have trees on your property  you could put in shade loving plants   like hostas  ferns  impatiens and primrose   below the canopy  Before you head to the nursery to buy any new grass  plant  shrub or tree  try to choose something that s native to your area and not an invasive species  If you re not sure  punch your ZIP code into the Native Plant Finder  which is managed by the National Wildlife Federation  Another option for reducing lawn area is to start a flower bed or a kitchen garden  The beauty of these plots is that they can start small and expand a bit each season  Plus  they look great  you can get fresh food and herbs  and they ll support butterflies  bees and birds  Whatever you plant  avoid pesticides and aerate the soil instead  Fertilize grass with leaf clippings and accept that you may need to coexist with dandelions  That Alaskan Well Was Dry  Here s How We Figured It Out ImageSteel pipe marks the location of the  40 million KIC 1 exploratory well from 1986 CreditFran Durner Anchorage Daily NewsBy Henry FountainIt began with an intriguing lead  It ended with the answer to an Arctic mystery My Times colleague Steve Eder and I had written an article in December about the Trump administration s efforts to allow oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska  We d mentioned an exploratory well that had been drilled in the refuge three decades ago The well was the only one ever drilled there and had obtained mythic status in the state  Designated KIC 1  it held the best clues as to whether there was oil in the refuge  but the results had been kept secret all these years  When we were in Anchorage reporting the story  it seemed that everyone there was talking about it We decided to do some digging   This comes naturally to Steve  an investigative reporter who can think of few better ways to spend a day than poring over old documents for a story  I m more comfortable reading scientific papers  The trail led fairly quickly to a 1987 court case   in Cleveland  of all places  A friendly court clerk there scanned hundreds of pages of microfilmed documents for us to read We also reached out to dozens of people involved in the case  One of the key characters in the story   Sidney Silverman  a lawyer  had confirmed to us that he had deposed an oil company executive who told him about the well  But Mr  Silverman  now 86  couldn t remember the name of the executive Steve found the name buried deep inside one of the court documents  a mundane list of Mr  Silverman s expenses   Proof that  as the historian Robert Caro has noted  it s important to  turn every page  when doing research  That was one of many  ah ha   moments  Another was when we found a general reference to the well results in another court document There were plenty of dead ends and plenty of dead people  given that we were investigating events from 32 years ago  When we did reach people who had been involved in the case  often their first reaction was something like   You want me to remember something from 1987  But as our reporting proceeded  we got more confirmation of our initial findings  The story got stronger and stronger  In the end  Steve and I thought we d really nailed it  And judging by what we ve heard from Alaska  everybody there is still talking about the well   but also about our story The week s top stories from Team ClimateMarch Temperatures in Alaska  20

JERUSALEM   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re election on Wednesday  with religious rightist parties set to hand him a parliamentary majority and his main challenger conceding defeat With more than 99 percent of votes counted   ballots cast by soldiers at military bases will be tallied over the next two days   Netanyahu s conservative Likud party looked likely to muster enough support to control 65 of the Knesset s 120 seats and be named to head the next coalition government It would be Netanyahu s record fifth term as premier In a televised statement  Yair Lapid  number two in the centrist Blue and White party led by former general Benny Gantz  said   We didn t win in this round  We will make Likud s life hell in the opposition  U S  President Donald Trump  who Netanyahu featured on campaign billboards to highlight their close relationship  phoned to congratulate him on his re election  the Israeli leader said  adding that he thanked his American ally for  tremendous support for Israel  Netanyahu tweeted that Trump had called him from Air Force One  The president was on a flight to Texas Trump told reporters at the White House that Netanyahu s re election improved the chances of peace between Israel and the Palestinians   He s been a great ally and he s a friend  I d like to congratulate him on a well thought out race  A team led by Trump s adviser and son in law Jared Kushner has been working on an Israeli Palestinian peace plan  but it has not disclosed details  Palestinians  angered by what they see as Trump s pro Israel bias  have called it a non starter Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said on Twitter he would begin meeting next week with political parties that won parliamentary seats to hear who they support for prime minister At the sessions  which Rivlin said would be broadcast live  to ensure transparency   he will then pick a party leader to try to form a coalition  giving the candidate 28 days to do so  with a two week extension if needed The close and often vitriolic contest was widely seen in Israel as a referendum on Netanyahu s character and record in the face of corruption allegations  He faces possible indictment in three graft cases  and has denied wrongdoing in all of them Despite that  Netanyahu gained four seats compared to his outgoing coalition government  according to a spreadsheet published by the Central Elections Committee of parties that garnered enough votes to enter the next parliament   It is a night of colossal victory   the 69 year old Netanyahu told cheering supporters in a late night speech at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv after Tuesday s vote   He s a magician   the crowd chanted as fireworks flared and Netanyahu kissed his wife Sara  Earlier that night  Gantz had claimed victory Tel Aviv Stock Exchange main indexes were up nearly 1 percent in late trading on Wednesday  displaying confidence in a veteran prime minister who has overseen a humming economy and blunted various security threats  including from Syria  Netanyahu was now poised to become  in July  the longest serving Israeli prime minister  overtaking the country s founding father  David Ben Gurion  That could be scuppered if criminal charges are filed and force his removal Israel election graphic   https   tmsnrt rs 2D916UvIMMUNITY An indictment decision would follow a review hearing where Netanyahu can be expected to argue he should be spared in the national interest  Some analysts predict he may try to pass a law granting himself immunity  as a sitting leader  from trial During the campaign  the rival parties accused each other of corruption  fostering bigotry and being soft on security Israel s 21 percent Arab minority saw its parties lose seats  Voters blamed divisions between Arab factions which had united in the previous election  disillusionment  and a voting boycott campaign rooted in dismay at the 2018  nation state  law declaring that only Jews have the right of self determination in Israel In Taybeh  an Arab town  Hadash party official Hosam Azem  52  said   Arabs who don t vote  most of them don t do it for ideological reasons   just because they don t think their vote will have an impact   he said During the campaign  Netanyahu sought to tap into Trump s popularity among Israelis  who delighted in his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital in 2017 and transfer of the U S  Embassy to the holy city last May from Tel Aviv  Two weeks before the election  Trump signed a proclamation  with Netanyahu at his side at the White House  recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war In a rare turn during the race toward the Israeli Palestinian conflict  Netanyahu further alarmed Palestinians by pledging to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re elected  Palestinians seek a state there and in the Gaza Strip  with East Jerusalem as its capital This pre election promise from Netanyahu was widely seen as an attempt to draw right wing votes rather than a change of policy  But with Trump s moves on Jerusalem and the Golan  the prime minister may feel emboldened to advocate annexation  Commenting on the election  Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said   Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo  They have said no to peace and yes to the occupation  The last round of U S  brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014  Trump is expected to release his administration s Middle East peace plan after the election  If it includes Israeli concessions to the Palestinians  Netanyahu s probable far right coalition allies will probably object    Additional reporting by Dan Williams  Ron Bousso and Maayan

A day before he was to appear at a congressional hearing focused on the biggest banks in the United States  Bank of America s chief executive  Brian Moynihan  said on Tuesday that the bank planned to raise its minimum wage to  20 an hour from  15 over the next two years It was another example of how big banks are trying to deal with shifting political winds in Washington  where they face new scrutiny under the Democrats  who now control the House of Representatives Income inequality has become a key focus of some liberal lawmakers  some of them part of the tide of Democrats swept into office in last year s midterm elections  And now the banks  leaders must explain to progressive representatives like Maxine Waters of California and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York why they are paid more than 700 times what low wage workers  including some tellers in their branches  earn each year Appearing on the MSNBC show  Morning Joe   Mr  Moynihan said that starting next month  Bank of America s lowest paid employees would earn  17 an hour  The hourly rate would increase incrementally over the next two years until it reached  20  the highest minimum wage paid by any of the country s largest banks JPMorgan Chase said last year that it was using some of the savings it had realized as a result of the Trump administration s corporate tax cuts to raise its minimum wage to  15 an hour Mr  Moynihan is set to appear before the House Financial Services Committee  where he and leaders of Bank of New York Mellon  Citigroup  Goldman Sachs  JPMorgan Chase  Morgan Stanley and State Street Corporation are expected to be questioned on issues like executive pay  diversity  fair lending and the financial services industry s ties to gun makers For years under Republican control of the committee  members focused on the effects of Dodd Frank financial regulations  Now  instead of lamenting the constraints of stricter regulations  banks are being forced to respond to lawmakers  inquiries about compensation and fair competition  Ms  Waters  who is chairwoman of the committee  recently harangued Wells Fargo s chief executive  Timothy J  Sloan  for receiving a  2 million bonus even as regulators continued to criticize the bank s performance   Mr  Sloan resigned on March 28  The change is reflected in the topics that banks and trade groups choose to address at industry events  Discussions of income inequality are popping up in places like the Bank Policy Institute s annual New York conference and the World Economic Forum s retreat in Davos  Switzerland  Meet the new hyper attuned bank C E O s    said Mike Mayo  an analyst for Wells Fargo who covers Bank of America and other big banks   If the top levels of the financial industry were tone deaf around the financial crisis  this is the opposite  Big banks face growing pressure to show they are treating their less powerful customers and employees well  On Tuesday at Bank of New York Mellon s annual shareholder meeting  the Rev  Jesse L  Jackson  the civil rights leader  was in the audience  During a question and answer session  he first praised the bank s chief executive  Charles W  Scharf   on your efforts to achieve diversity across the United States in a fundamental way  But  he added  the bank still has work to do   There s too much disparity  too little transparency   he said   Are you preparing to raise the wages of workers  for example  Across the country  workers in low wage jobs often find they need government assistance even though they have full time employment  or even several jobs  A 2015 report from the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California  Berkeley  found that bank tellers were among those who struggled to earn enough A spokeswoman for Bank of America said the new wage would affect tellers as well as workers in consumer banking  technology and operations and staff support  among other areas  The bank has over 200 000 employees At Wells Fargo  which has been working to repair its culture and its standing with regulators after a series of scandals  some employees have had their pay stagnate or shrink as the bank reshaped its incentive plans so that they no longer encouraged cheating  Some rank and file employees have reported difficulties making ends meet  In 2017  Wells Fargo set its minimum wage at  15 an hour  up from  13 50 Mr  Scharf said at Tuesday s meeting that Bank of New York Mellon had recently raised its minimum wage to  15 an hour Another source of pressure is an effort by the wealth management company Arjuna Capital to get several big banks  including Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon  to disclose comparisons of the pay for men and women  and for white employees and minorities  The most striking feature of these banks is that they re run by white men  and that there isn t a balance of gender and racial equity in the top jobs   Arjuna s managing partner  Natasha Lamb  said in an interview on Tuesday   Really  the goal of our proposal is to create a more diverse  balanced leadership  Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon both advised shareholders to vote against Arjuna s proposal this year  as did Wells Fargo and JPMorgan  Citigroup revealed last year that the median pay gap between its male and female employees was 29 percent   women earned that much less   while the gap between white and minority workers was 7 percent Mr  Mayo said the wage increase announced by Bank of America also reflected a trend among large banks toward employing fewer low wage employees like tellers in favor of more highly skilled workers like financial advisers and technologists who help operate digital banking services  Mr  Moynihan was paid more than  26 million in 2018 The Committee for Better Banks  an activist group that promotes employee unions  reported on Tuesday that in 2018  the six largest banks   JPMorgan  Citibank  Wells Fargo  Bank of America  Goldman and Morgan Stanley   laid off more than 3 000 employees in total  an increase from 349 the previous year  Last year also had record annual profits for the banks  

Good Friday   Want this by email  Sign up here    It doesn t take a genius  to know capitalism needs fixingCapitalism helped Ray Dalio build his investment empire  But in a lengthy LinkedIn post  the Bridgewater Associates founder says that it isn t working anymore   Mr  Dalio writes that he has seen capitalism  evolve in a way that it is not working well for the majority of Americans because it s producing self reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have nots     Disparity in wealth  especially when accompanied by disparity in values  leads to increasing conflict and  in the government  that manifests itself in the form of populism of the left and populism of the right and often in revolutions of one sort or another     The problem is that capitalists typically don t know how to divide the pie well and socialists typically don t know how to grow it well     We are now seeing conflicts between populists of the left and populists of the right increasing around the world in much the same way as they did in the 1930s when the income and wealth gaps were comparably large     It doesn t take a genius to know that when a system is producing outcomes that are so inconsistent with its goals  it needs to be reformed  Stay tuned  Mr  Dalio says that he ll offer his solutions in another essay Elon Musk and the S E C  need their  reasonableness pants A federal judge gave Elon Musk and the S E C  two weeks to resolve a dispute about whether Mr  Musk violated a settlement he reached with the commission  Matthew Goldstein of the NYT reports Mr  Musk s tweeting is at the heart of the skirmish  The S E C  says that a tweet about Tesla production numbers violated the settlement  in which he promised to get approval from a Tesla lawyer before publishing any Twitter posts that include potentially market sensitive information His lawyers insist that the tweet didn t contain material information  One of them said yesterday that the S E C  s policy on what needs to be vetted was  murky   Judge Alison Nathan of Federal District Court in Manhattan wondered if there was a  lack of clarity  and whether the settlement should be modified or struck down  Take a deep breath   Judge Nathan told both sides  She added that they should put on  their reasonableness pants  to find common ground This is  something of a victory for Mr  Musk  who could have been fined if he was found to be in contempt   Mr  Goldstein writes  But Judge Nathan told Mr  Musk that  regardless of how powerful a person he is  a  court order is not optional  More  Tesla shares fell

investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash last month suggest that Boeing didn t give pilots enough guidance on new anti stall software in the 737 Max 8 The Ethiopian Airlines pilots followed Boeing s instructions when the anti stall system kicked in  the report suggests  They then shut down the software and tried to retake control   but failed to do so  Four minutes later  the plane crashed The system appeared to have forced the plane s nose down several times in less than three minutes  It  left the pilot with no ability to gain control of the aircraft if it went to the full

that  Anna Swanson of the NYT reports  instead saying that it may take at least four more weeks to secure an  epic  trade deal    The United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues  including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed  and when     In remarks at the White House  Mr  Trump said that the deal was  very complete  and that the two sides had  agreed to far more than we have left to agree to       I think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to   Mr  Trump added Yet no matter what  Mr  Trump can already claim a trade

board  Mr  Cain doesn t have what critics say are the requisite qualifications Critics worry that Mr  Trump is politicizing the Fed  which is meant to be apolitical  The possible nominations of Mr

As federal prosecutors on Tuesday brought new money laundering charges against 16 parents enmeshed in the college admissions scandal  a question hung over the sprawling case  Would anybody implicated in the scam actually serve time behind bars The Hollywood actress Lori Loughlin and her husband  the designer Mossimo Giannulli  were among those indicted on a count of conspiracy to commit fraud and another of money laundering conspiracy  raising the legal stakes for parents who have not said whether they would plead guilty in the case But it was a wide open question  legal experts and former prosecutors said  as to what price celebrities  business executives and other boldface names may end up paying if they are convicted in the largest ever admissions prosecution  This is somewhat uncharted waters because this is a really unique case   we haven t seen a case where dozens of parents are being hauled off into court before   said Bradley Simon  a former federal prosecutor who now leads the white collar defense practice at Phillips Nizer  a law firm based in New York Prosecutors have charged a total of 50 people  including the college consultant at the center of the scandal  William Singer  who has already pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges  Thirty three parents are accused of paying Mr  Singer to arrange for cheating on entrance exams or conspiring with him to bribe coaches or athletic officials to get their children admitted to colleges as recruits to sports teams  on the basis of fake credentials On Monday  prosecutors said that 13 of the parents  including the actress Felicity Huffman  would plead guilty  In all but one case  those parents will plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest service mail fraud  Then on Tuesday came indictments  including new counts  against many of the parents who had not announced plans to enter guilty pleas Vassili Thomadakis  a former assistant United States attorney in the district of Massachusetts  said Mr  Singer would almost certainly be sent to prison for some period of time  even though he has cooperated with the investigation  including making recorded phone calls to parents at investigators  request  Mr  Thomadakis said it was also likely that any coaches or administrators who were convicted would face prison time  perhaps for a matter of months or a few years Less clear  it seemed  was what might happen to any parents convicted in the case Former prosecutors said that might depend on an array of matters  How much did the parents spend on the scheme to get their child into college  Did they opt to plead guilty  Did they fight the charges through a trial  but get convicted anyway  Did they cooperate with the authorities  For folks who have these kind of the bigger payments that you see in the indictment  I think that they certainly face some prison time  especially if they take the case to trial and lose   Mr  Thomadakis said  Mr  Thomadakis said that prosecutors are likely to argue that a sentence of some prison time is necessary to dissuade other parents eager to do anything to help their children get into college from engaging in similar behavior If convicted  those accused of paying some of the largest sums   some families are accused of paying as much as  500 000 in bribes to get their children into schools   might be penalized most harshly Courtney Oliva  executive director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University and a former federal prosecutor  said that Ms  Huffman  who apologized this week for her role in the case and said she would plead guilty  most likely faces a short prison sentence or might avoid prison time altogether  serving most or all of a penalty through a home confinement or probation  Ms  Huffman acknowledged having paid Mr  Singer  15 000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter s SAT exam  I personally think it would be crazy to send her to prison   Ms  Oliva said Mr  Simon  the former federal prosecutor  noted that Ms  Huffman and Gordon Caplan  another parent who has said he would plead guilty  each issued long statements expressing remorse  Those were long and seemingly sincere statements of contrition   Mr  Simon said   If I were a judge  that would go a long way to ensure they don t get jail  On the other hand  Mr  Simon said  intense publicity around the case could create pressure to impose some prison time  Judges and prosecutors are always very sensitive to the court of public opinion in determining what sentences they get   Mr  Simon said   They will feel some pressure to send a message  A lot of people are really horrified by this  It undermines the system  It smacks of breathtaking self entitlement  Lawyers for defendants pleading guilty may argue that the harm their clients have suffered to their reputations  and the professional and other consequences of pleading guilty to a felony  provide enough of a deterrent Representatives for some parents have said that they intend to fight the charges  and are eagerly awaiting their chance to give their side of the story in court Among the parents indicted on Tuesday was William McGlashan  a major Silicon Valley investor  who is accused of paying Mr  Singer  50 000 for cheating on his son s ACT and of agreeing to pay  250 000 to get his son admitted to the University of Southern California as a football recruit  although prosecutors say Mr  McGlashan did not ultimately go through with that scheme  The prosecutor s case against Mr  McGlashan is deeply flawed and ignores important exculpatory facts   one of Mr  McGlashan s lawyers  John Hueston  said   We look forward to presenting his side of the story  David Schumacher  who represents Gregory and Amy Colburn  parents who are accused of arranging for cheating on the SAT  said that his clients were innocent of the charges   They re looking forward to asserting their rights under the Constitution and under the federal rules to a speedy trial so they can clear their good names   Mr  Schumacher said  

MANILA   Bracing for life after Brexit  British hospitals badly need more nurses like Filipino Jobie Escalona  but she twice flunked a mandatory English language test that asked her to write up the merits of immigration and computer education in school The 23 year old Escalona  with three years experience in a private hospital in Manila  lost almost 3 months salary paying nearly  600 to sit the tests Fed up  she was ready to give up on Britain and try Canada  one of several other countries short of nurses  until her father persuaded her to take the test a third time  I was already losing hope   she told Reuters  Finally  in January last year  she passed  having at last got a subject she felt comfortable writing about in the tough written section of the test Asked to compare team and individual sports  Escalona had little trouble   I was able to relate to it because I am a swimmer  But  her tortuous experience doesn t bode well for Britain s chances of adequately filling alarming staffing gaps in its healthcare services With Brexit looming  the supply of nurses from European Union countries has almost dried up  with lots going home  And of the many foreign nationalities employed in Britain  Filipinos made up the largest number  with 10 719  according to a parliamentary paper      As of June last year  16 percent of nursing jobs in hospitals and community health services were held by foreigners   nearly a quarter of whom were Filipinos Britain is already facing a shortage of 40 000 nurses  and once it leaves the EU  if it ever happens  the gap could widen to 50 000  enough to staff more than 40 small to medium sized hospitals  according to a report commissioned by the Cavendish Coalition  a group of health and social care organizations OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE      The staffing crisis is increasing Britain s dependency on hiring from low cost countries like India and the Philippines  where English is widely spoken  yet the language test has proved to be a major obstacle Philippine recruitment firm Louis International Manpower Services has received 1 000 job orders for nurses since 2015  It has only filled a quarter of them    It is not because of the lack of applications  but the English test   said Lilibeth Villas  documentation officer at the firm   We have applicants who were interviewed in 2015  but they have not passed the test yet  Run by the British Council  IDP Education and Cambridge Assessment  the International English Language Test System  IELTS  gauges applicants  ability to speak  listen  read and write  and is used by employers around the world Questions in the academic written section asks candidates to write short essays on diverse subjects  Examples given on the IELTS website included interpreting graphs on changes in radio and television audiences  and gender variations between full and part time students  and discussing the pros and cons of nuclear technology and of regulating car ownership Many candidates clearly find the weighty topics too daunting Febin Cyriac  a business development manager at Envertiz Consultancy  a British healthcare recruitment firm that specializes in bringing in nurses from overseas  started a petition in change org in 2014 that asked UK regulators to relax their IELTS scores  Working as a nurse himself  Cyriac said there are a good number of Indian or Filipino nurses with many years of experience working in Britain  but who are only working as assistant nurses in the National Health Service  NHS  and nursing homes  IELTS is the only barrier for them to practice as a nurse in the UK   said Cyriac  himself a nurse working in Britain Still  the number of Filipinos in the NHS has risen by almost a third in the last two years  according to British government figures Late last year  the pass mark for the writing section was lowered  but there are no immediate plans to make further changes to the test standards  said Andrea Sutcliffe  Nursing and Midwifery Council  NMC  Chief Executive and Registrar  We will continue to carefully monitor the impact of the recent changes  This change is part of a wider review of our overseas registration processes aimed at making it more straightforward and user friendly for people with the right skills and knowledge to join our register in a timely way   Sutcliffe said  There is an Occupational English Test  OET   more suited to medical professionals  that foreign nurses can take  If they pass that test they would still have to sit the IELTS  but they would be eligible for a lower pass mark  The OET is more expensive  however  making it unattractive for low paid nurses A London based recruitment agency visited Manila recently to find nurses for Cambridge University  East Surrey and Royal Cornwall Hospitals  while there have also been recent hiring drives for hospital trusts in Oxford  Hull and Dudley     Germany  Japan  the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are the other countries hiring Filipino nurses  said Bernard Olalia  head of the government s Philippine Overseas Employment Administration          In January alone  Olalia s office received 1 000 job orders for nurses from Saudi Arabia  There are a lot of markets for our Filipino nurses   Olalia said  adding that it was understandable if they took jobs in places where the requirements were easier to fulfill Filipino nurses who were recruited in the 1990s did not have to take the language tests  yet they are still in the NHS and providing good service  said Reydeluz Conferido  who was until recently the labor attache to the Philippines embassy in London While there  Conferido called on British officials to review the requirements placed on overseas nurses to see whether they were serving the correct purpose or creating an artificial barrier  If you really want these nurses  you would do something about your standards   he said   Additional reporting by Andrew MacAskill in LONDON

WEST HOLLYWOOD  Calif    Fred Rosen  the retired Ticketmaster tycoon  was eating a melted ham and brie sandwich at the exclusive San Vicente Bungalows and spouting forth about belts Yes  what people use to hold up their pants  You can buy one at Walmart for  4  he noted  Or you can get one at Gucci for  1 500   Every product I can think of has a luxury version  which got me thinking   Mr  Rosen said   Why not movies  It s an idea that has captivated one entrepreneur after another over the years  For a high price  allow tech billionaires  Wall Street titans  professional athletes  Russian oligarchs and other ultra wealthy people to rent movies   as soon as they come out in theaters   for viewing at home  Think of it like Netflix for one percenters  But such upstarts have always sputtered  including one backed by Best Buy in 2013 that charged  500 per movie on top of  35 000 in setup costs  Film studios  fearful of angering theater chains  have been reluctant to participate  Piracy has also been a concern Mr  Rosen  75  and a septuagenarian golfing buddy  Dan Fellman  who is Hollywood s foremost film distribution expert  may have finally figured out how to make it work  They have quietly founded Red Carpet Home Cinema  which rents first run films for  1 500 to  3 000 each  Red Carpet has contracts with Warner Bros   Paramount  Lionsgate  Annapurna and Disney s 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight divisions   resulting in some 40 movies annually  including blockbusters like  Aquaman  and  A Star Is Born  Those partnerships reflect entertainment industry relationships that Mr  Rosen and Mr  Fellman have cultivated over decades  Most studios do not see them as disrupters from Silicon Valley  something that has stalled start ups like Screening Room  which has tried without success since 2016 to speed first run movies to homes for a premium price   Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame is behind that one  Red Carpet also arrives at a time when the movie industry is undergoing sweeping change   not the least of which involves the manner in which Netflix is challenging the traditional way that films are released  For the most part  theater owners insist on a three month period of exclusivity to play new films  Netflix has started to chip away at that practice  offering theaters an exclusive window of three weeks or less for films like  Roma  and  Bird Box  Most studios see broader distribution change as inevitable  noted Harold L  Vogel  author of the textbook  Entertainment Industry Economics   Consumers want to have more control   Mr  Vogel said Even so  studios are treading carefully  None of the film companies that have signed on as Red Carpet partners would discuss the venture publicly  Several major movie operations  including Universal  Sony Pictures and Disney s other labels  are Red Carpet holdouts  They also declined to comment ImageDan Fellman  left  and Fred Rosen say their Red Carpet home movie service will be a niche offering   I m too old for disruption   Mr  Rosen said  CreditAlex Welsh for The New York Times I feel pretty comfortable that we can gain more studio partners   Mr  Rosen said   We are a niche offering   I m too old for disruption   but even if a studio makes  25 million to  50 million annually from us  that s found money  Theater owners  in the meantime  seem to be taking a wait and see approach to Red Carpet  I have no take on that   said Adam Aron  chief executive of AMC Entertainment  the dominant theater chain in the United States  In contrast  Mr  Aron has readily criticized start ups like MoviePass  the subscription ticketing service The folksy Mr  Rosen  who took over Ticketmaster in 1982 and helped turn it into a goliath  and Mr  Fellman  who started his studio career in 1964  worked out details for Red Carpet over rounds of golf at the well to do Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles  The luxury service operates a bit like a private club  There is a rigorous application process  and participants must have a credit card with a limit of at least  50 000  Those who become customers must buy a  15 000 box that connects to a home theater system  installed by a technician  and comes loaded with piracy protections Prices for rentals are set by the participating studios  with higher fees for blockbuster style movies like  Shazam   and lower costs for dramas like  The Shape of Water   Each rental allows for two viewings in a 36 hour period How big could Red Carpet get  There are more people who can afford it than you might think  Nearly 46 000 Americans have annual income of more than  2 million  according to Social Security Administration data from 2017  Mr  Rosen and Mr  Fellman  however  insisted over lunch in mid March that they were not interested in size  We re not even looking for 10 000 people   Mr  Rosen said  With fewer than 4 000 customers  Red Carpet could have  300 million in annual revenue  according to Mr  Fellman s projections Red Carpet  which counts Sherry Lansing  the former chief executive of Paramount  as an investor  has been operating in about 25 homes as part of a beta test since December   I m recommending the service to my friends   the Red Carpet website quotes Ms  Lansing as saying Mr  Fellman added   I m not interested in starting a business that is disruptive to the theatrical experience  Maybe we get 400 homes in New York and L A  Maybe 100 in each of the 30 biggest cities in the United States    Celebrities and Hollywood big shots have long been able to see first run films in their homes   free   as part of something known as the Bel Air Circuit  Studios allow a limited number of preapproved V I P s to  borrow  copies of new movies   We told studios   You set the terms    Mr  Fellman said   They appreciated that  What doesn t work in Hollywood is going in and wagging a finger and saying   This is how it s going to be    

LONDON DUBAI   Saudi Arabia is threatening to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if Washington passes a bill exposing OPEC members to U S  antitrust lawsuits  three sources familiar with Saudi energy policy said They said the option had been discussed internally by senior Saudi energy officials in recent months  Two of the sources said the plan had been discussed with OPEC members and one source briefed on Saudi oil policy said Riyadh had also communicated the threat to senior U S  energy officials The chances of the U S  bill known as NOPEC coming into force are slim and Saudi Arabia would be unlikely to follow through  but the fact Riyadh is considering such a drastic step is a sign of the kingdom s annoyance about potential U S  legal challenges to OPEC In the unlikely event Riyadh were to ditch the dollar  it would undermine the its status as the world s main reserve currency  reduce Washington s clout in global trade and weaken its ability to enforce sanctions on nation states  The Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option   one of the sources familiar with the matter said  The Saudis say  let the Americans pass NOPEC and it would be the U S  economy that would fall apart   another source said Saudi Arabia s energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment A U S  state department official said   as a general matter  we don t comment on pending legislation   The U S  Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment  Energy Secretary Rick Perry has said that NOPEC could lead to unintended consequences DOLLAR HEGEMONYNOPEC  or the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act  was first introduced in 2000 and aims to remove sovereign immunity from U S  antitrust law  paving the way for OPEC states to be sued for curbing output in a bid to raise oil prices While the bill has never made it into law despite numerous attempts  the legislation has gained momentum since U S  President Donald Trump came to office  Trump said he backed NOPEC in a book published in 2011 before he was elected  though he not has not voiced support for NOPEC as president Trump has instead stressed the importance of U S Saudi relations  including sales of U S  military equipment  even after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year A move by Saudi Arabia to ditch the dollar would resonate well with big non OPEC oil producers such as Russia as well as major consumers China and the European Union  which have been calling for moves to diversify global trade away from the dollar to dilute U S  influence over the world economy Russia  which is subject to U S  sanctions  has tried to sell oil in euros and China s yuan but the proportion of its sales in those currencies is not significant Venezuela and Iran  which are also under U S  sanctions  sell most of their oil in other currencies but they have done little to challenge the dollar s hegemony in the oil market However  if a long standing U S  ally such as Saudi Arabia joined the club of non dollar oil sellers it would be a far more significant move likely to gain traction within the industry WHAT IF Saudi Arabia controls a 10th of global oil production  roughly on par with its main rivals   the United States and Russia  Its oil firm Saudi Aramco holds the crown of the world s biggest oil exporter with sales of  356 billion last year  Depending on prices  oil is estimated to represent 2 percent to 3 percent of global gross domestic product  At the current price of  70 per barrel  the annual value of global oil output is  2 5 trillion  Not all of those oil volumes are traded in the U S  currency but at least 60 percent is traded via tankers and international pipelines with the majority of those deals done in dollars Trading in derivatives such as oil futures and options is mainly dollar denominated  The top two global energy exchanges  ICE and CME  traded a billion lots of oil derivatives in 2018 with a nominal value of about  5 trillion Just the prospect of NOPEC has already had implications for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  Qatar  one of the core Gulf OPEC members  quit the group in December because of the risk NOPEC could harm its U S  expansion plans Two sources said that despite raising the dollar threat  Saudi Arabia did not believe it would need to follow through  I don t think the NOPEC bill will pass but the Saudis have  what if  scenarios   one of the sources said ASSET SALESIn the event of such a drastic Saudi move  the impact would take some time to play out given the industry s decades old practices built around the U S  dollar   from lending to exchange clearing Other potential threats raised in Saudi discussions about retaliation against NOPEC included liquidating the kingdom s holdings in the United States  the sources said The kingdom has nearly  1 trillion invested in the United States and holds some  160 billion in U S  Treasuries If it did carry out its threat  Riyadh would also have to ditch the Saudi riyal s peg to the dollar  which has been exchanged at a fixed rate since 1986  the sources said The United States  the world s largest oil consumer  relied heavily on Saudi and OPEC supplies for decades   while supporting Riyadh militarily against its arch foe Iran But soaring shale oil production at home has made Washington less dependant on OPEC  allowing it to be more forceful in the way it deals with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations Over the past year  Trump has regularly called on OPEC to pump more oil to lower global oil prices  and linked his demands to political support for Riyadh   something previous U S  administrations have refrained from doing  at least publicly   Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump may feel he is  stuck  with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell  whom he has blasted for engineering four interest rate hikes since Trump appointed him  but none of Trump s other Fed appointees has stood in the way of the tightening campaign and at least one has said even higher rates may be necessary The voting records and public statements of Trump s Fed appointees  who now form a solid majority of the Fed s Washington based board of governors  show not only consensus around the recent increases  but no support so far for the rate cuts Trump has demanded  A possible upcoming nominee to the Fed  economic commentator Stephen Moore  has said he agrees with Trump that rates should be cut and had earlier called for Powell s ouster  Trump has mulled whether he could fire Powell  but in a March 8 phone call  reported by the Wall Street Journal  acknowledged he was  stuck  with the Fed chair for Powell s full four year term that runs to February 2022  If Moore does take a seat alongside Trump s appointees at the Fed  at this point he would be the outlier  I am comfortable with the current stance of our policy   Trump s newest appointee  Fed Governor Michelle Bowman  said in February in her only comments about monetary policy to date  Bowman joined the Fed in November  when the administration was growing agitated about rising volatility in financial markets  She voted for the December rate increase that has become a particular target of Trump s ire and point of blame for  in his view  holding back the economy  The White House on Tuesday announced Bowman would be renominated for a full 14 year term to follow the end next January of the short  partial term she was appointed to fill Trump s hand picked vice chair  Richard Clarida  voted for the December increase and the one before it in September  which was approved shortly after he joined the Fed board Randal Quarles  who was the first appointment Trump made to the Fed as his presidency took shape in 2017  voted for five rates hikes from December of that year to December 2018  and his most recent comments show the wide and sometimes paradoxical gap between the president s view of what the Fed should be doing  and those of the people he has chosen to oversee the central bank In what amounted to a bullish defense of where the economy is heading  Quarles last week said in fact that rates may need to move higher precisely because Trump s tax cuts and policies may produce a  persistent  boost to productivity and growth   Further increases in the policy rate may be necessary at some point  a stance I believe is consistent with my optimistic view of the economy s growth potential and momentum   Quarles said in remarks at the Manhattan Institute last week For now the Fed intends to hold rates steady  a position it reached both as Trump publicly called for a halt to rate increases  but also   and what Fed officials say mattered to them   as economic and financial data globally indicated a broad slowdown from the faster than expected growth of 2018 Trump blames the weaker data on what he called in a tweet on Thursday the Fed s  destructive  rate hikes  Others see a number of causes  including Trump s trade policies  and feel growth is likely to continue though at a tepid pace  We had this synchronized acceleration of growth a couple of years ago  Now it is synchronized deceleration and a slowing momentum across the spectrum   International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in Washington on Tuesday   Nobody wins a trade war   RULE BY CONSENSUSUnanimity among Fed board members is largely the norm  The Fed strives to be a consensus driven organization  led  but not dictated to  by a chair whose job is to canvas and shape opinion among as many as 18 other policymakers split between the seven member board based in Washington and 12 regional bank heads The regional bankers  five of whom each year have a formal vote on interest rates even as all 12 participate in Fed debates  are part of a now century old system meant precisely to guard against too much power residing with the board and the chair in Washington There are currently two open board seats Even as Fed officials have begun to speak more frequently and openly in public  formal dissents against any given policy action have in general declined since the 1970s  The last one by a board member was in 2005 by then Governor Mark Olson against a rate increase But that doesn t necessarily mean conformity inside the room when the Federal Open Market Committee meets every six weeks  Opposition to some of the extraordinary policies put in place to fight the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis  for example  led former Governor Kevin Warsh to resign even though he never dissented  maintaining a unified face for the Fed during a treacherous time Yet with the current group of appointees there is little sense of the sort of behind the scenes warfare that occurred  for example  when a group of governors tried to revolt against the recession inducing steps pushed by 1980s era Fed Chairman Paul Volcker to curb runaway inflation Transcripts of recent Fed meetings won t be released for five years  but the summary minutes of sessions last fall show the central bank sifting through data  coming to grips with developing risks  and shifting their stance as a result By January   all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to maintain  the existing interest rate  the minutes stated  Several  said continued growth might warrant higher rates eventually There was no mention of support for a rate cut   Reporting by Howard Schneider  Editing by Dan Burns and Andrea Ricci  

Pacific Gas and Electric announced the appointment of a chief executive and 10 new board members on Wednesday to improve the  safety culture and operational effectiveness  at the embattled California utility Bill Johnson  a former head of Progress Energy and the Tennessee Valley Authority  will fill the chief executive position held by Geisha Williams  who left in January  just before PG E filed for its second bankruptcy in the last two decades PG E faces tens of billions of dollars in liabilities related to catastrophic wildfires over the last two years  In addition  climate change is making natural disasters more destructive  and shifts to green energy are upending the industry  We have heard the calls for change and have taken action today to ensure that PG E has the right leadership to bring about real and dynamic change that reinforces our commitment to safety  continuous improvement and operational excellence   the board said in a news release   We believe our new C E O  and the newly constituted board will help PG E address California s evolving energy challenges and deliver what our customers expect from their energy company   How Pacific Electric and Gas ignored fire risks in favor of profits  The board appointments  supported by shareholders  are the latest development in the battle to gain influence over PG E  While the utility is undergoing bankruptcy reorganization  much of the power lies with the bankruptcy court s judge  At the same time  investment firms with large stakes are hoping to set up a new leadership that will help take PG E out of bankruptcy and run it efficiently  But the shareholders will have to contend with California s politicians  the state s utilities regulator and the representatives of wildfire victims The 13 person board has several members with some energy experience  as well as several investors  It includes Nora Mead Brownell  who has served as a commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  Cheryl Campbell  who until last year worked at Xcel Energy  an electric and gas utility  and Jeffrey Bleich  a partner at Dentons  a global law firm PG E said its management had discussed the selection of a new chief executive and board members with three investment firms  Abrams Capital Management  Knighthead Capital Management and Redwood Capital Management  The firms  according to PG E  support Mr  Johnson and the new board Nathan Click  a spokesman for Gov  Gavin Newsom of California  said in a statement that the new board fell short of what the administration had wanted to see from the utility  Time and again  PG E has broken the public trust and its responsibilities to ratepayers  wildfire victims and employees   Mr  Click said   While changes were made in the last few days to augment the safety and government expertise on the board  this proposed board still raises concerns   particularly the large representation of Wall Street interests and most board nominees  lack of relevant California experience  The incoming chief executive  Mr  Johnson  65  gained national attention in July 2012 when he became chief of Duke Energy for less than a day before he was fired and given a severance worth an estimated  44 million  He was picked for the job as part of the merger of two North Carolina utilities   Duke Energy and Progress Energy   to form the nation s largest electric utility retailer From 2007 to 2012  Mr  Johnson served as chief executive and chairman of Progress Energy  The former Duke chief executive Jim Rogers  who died in December  said at the time that Mr  Johnson had been fired because of his leadership style and a lack of transparency Mr  Johnson led Progress Energy during the renovation of its sole nuclear power plant in Florida  in Crystal River  In an unusual move  the utility decided to self manage the project rather than leave it to an engineering company  Workers cracked the concrete building that housed the reactor  forcing the permanent shutdown of a nuclear plant that had otherwise been fully operational After Duke Energy ousted Mr  Johnson  the Tennessee Valley Authority  a federally owned and operated utility  hired him as its chief executive In November  he announced his plan to retire from the authority after reducing its debt by  3 5 billion and increasing the use of carbon free energy sources  But during his time there  the utility s management practices were criticized At a hearing on Tuesday in Federal District Court in San Francisco  PG E escaped a threatened court ordered overhaul of its power line maintenance efforts  which the utility previously estimated could cost up to  150 billion  Instead  Judge William Alsup ordered it to focus on cutting back trees near electrical lines  submit to random inspections and fully comply with state laws and its own new fire mitigation plan submitted to state regulators PG E was also directed not to pay out any shareholder dividends  which have been suspended since late 2017  until adequate staff is hired and new tree maintenance standards are met  It s a problem of your own making   Judge Alsup told the utility s officials   A lot of money went out in dividends that should have gone to your tree budget  The judge  who is overseeing the company s probation stemming from six felony convictions after a 2010 Bay Area gas line explosion  said he had issued the pared down order in the interest of public safety  despite evidence of  really rampant wrongdoing  At the end of the hearing  the judge directly addressed PG E s interim chief executive  John Simon  who sat alone in the front row of the otherwise crowded courtroom gallery  We ve got a fire season coming up quick  and by December we ll be back here  and we will know how many fires your company started   Judge Alsup said   And I m hoping the answer is zero  That s what I want   Me  too  Judge   Mr  Simon said

ANCHORAGE  Alaska   The Yupik Eskimo village of Kotlik on Alaska s northwest coast relies on a cold  hard blanket of sea ice to protect homes from vicious winter Bering Sea storms Frigid north winds blow down from the Arctic Ocean  freeze saltwater and push sea ice south  The ice normally prevents waves from forming and locks onto beaches  walling off villages  But not this year In February  southwest winds brought warm air and turned thin sea ice into  snow cone ice  that melted or blew off  When a storm pounded Norton Sound  water on Feb  12 surged up the Yukon River and into Kotlik  flooding low lying homes  Lifelong resident Philomena Keyes  37  awoke to knee deep water outside her house  This is the first I experienced in my life  a flood that happened in the winter  in February   Keyes said in a phone interview Winter storm surge flooding is the latest indication that something s off kilter around the Bering Strait  the gateway from the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean  Rapid  profound changes tied to high atmospheric temperatures  a direct result of climate change  may be reordering the region s physical makeup  Ocean researchers are asking themselves if they re witnessing the transformation of an ecosystem The Bering Sea last winter saw record low sea ice  Climate models predicted less ice  but not this soon  said Seth Danielson  a physical oceanographer at the University of Alaska Fairbanks  The projections were saying we would ve hit situations similar to what we saw last year  but not for another 40 or 50 years   Danielson said Walruses and seals use sea ice to rest and give birth  Villagers use sea ice to hunt them  Sea ice is the primary habitat of polar bears  Algae that clings to the bottom of sea ice blooms in spring  dies and sinks  sending an infusion of food to clams  snails and sea worms on the ocean floor   the prey of gray whales  walruses and bearded seals Sea ice also affects commercially valuable fish  Sea ice historically has created a Bering Sea  cold pool   an east west barrier of extremely cold  salty water at the bottom of the wide  shallow continental shelf  The wall of cold water historically has concentrated Pacific cod and walleye pollock in the southeastern Bering Sea  It tends to extend from the Russian side to the northwest   said Lyle Britt  a fisheries biologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   It kind of comes down almost like a little hockey stick shape     through the center of the southeast Bering Sea  However  when Britt and other NOAA researchers last year conducted annual fish and ocean condition surveys  they got a big surprise  For the first time in 37 years  they found no cold pool Researchers found high concentrations of Pacific cod and walleye pollock in the northern Bering Sea  But the species that was supposed to be there  Arctic cod  was hardly found More than half the fish landed in U S  waters come from the North Pacific  and most are caught in the Bering Sea  Chad See  executive director of the Freezer Longline Coalition  a trade association of vessels that target Pacific cod using baited lines  said members caught their quota last year but had to travel farther north  Does that mean that the stock is declining  is suffering because of the warming temperatures  Or is it that they ve moved north and it s still a vibrant fishery   See said It s too soon to conclude that atmosphere and ocean changes are due simply to climate change  said NOAA physical oceanographer Phyllis Stabeno  who has studied the Bering Sea for more than 30 years  The southern Bering Sea since 2000 has undergone multi year stanzas of low and extensive ice  she said When sea ice in November began forming as usual  she expected a bounce back this winter  Instead  warm winds in February mostly cleared the northern Bering Sea of sea ice through the Bering Strait into the Chukchi Sea  We re in winter   she said   This is all supposed to be frozen  Formation of the cold pool is again in doubt  It could return in the future  but temperatures are trending upward with the rate of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere Scientists say figuring out the ocean physics is far less of a challenge than projecting the biological ramifications  We sort of opened up this whole Pandora s box of not really knowing how the ecosystem as a whole is going to adjust to that   Danielson said The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service early last summer detected trouble  Resident called with reports of emaciated and dead seabirds Common murres  which can use up fat reserves and starve after three days without eating  fly hundreds miles to find fish schools or krill but were washing up dead on shore  Forktail storm petrels  fulmars  shearwaters  kittiwakes  auklets and puffins also died No one can say why  Seabird experts wonder whether the presence of more pollock and Pacific cod  which have voracious appetites and are far more efficient hunters of forage fish than seabirds  was a factor Dean Stockwell  a research associate professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks with a specialty in phytoplankton  said the ocean changes have the potential to affect plant life at the bottom of the food web but it s too soon to know Of immediate concern is whether warmer water will allow harmful algae containing toxins to stay viable long enough for shellfish to eat them and pass toxins to marine mammals and people  Toxins are being carried to the Arctic  Stockwell said  The question with global warming types of things is   Can it get a foothold  Can they do damage    he said Seabird experts wonder if toxins played a role in recent seabird deaths by affecting their ability to forage No one has connected the dots  said Britt  the NOAA fisheries biologist  At the moment  nobody s sitting with in hand a comprehensive research study that covers the birds and the mammals and the fish and the zooplankton all in one synthesized report   he said  adding that it will take researchers more time to figure out what s going on Meantime  Kotlik resident Keyes is researching climate change effects in her coastal village of 650 as project coordinator for a team working under a Bureau of Indian Affairs program The absence of sea ice since mid February meant taking land routes to visit nearby villages  she said  And seal hunters this spring found bearded seals to harvest but not near the village Like the cod fishermen   They had to go farther north   Keyes said  

BEIRUT   It s Arab Spring  season II  and he s one of the few holdovers  The last man standing among a crop of Arab autocrats  after a new wave of protests forced the removal of the Algerian and Sudanese leaders from the posts they held for decades Syria s President Bashar Assad has survived an uprising  a years long ruinous war and an Islamic  caliphate  established over parts of his broken country  As the Syrian conflict enters its ninth year  the 53 year old leader appears more secure and confident than at any time since the revolt against his rule began in 2011 But the war for Syria is not over yet  and the path ahead is strewn with difficulties The back to back ouster of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after two decades of rule and Sudanese leader Omar al Bashir after three  has been dubbed a  second Arab Spring   after the 2011 wave of protests that shook the Middle East and deposed longtime dictators in Tunisia  Egypt  Libya and Yemen Social media has been filled with pictures of leaders at past Arab summits  noting almost all of them were now deposed except for Assad  Some pointed out ironically that al Bashir s last trip outside of Sudan in December was to Damascus  where he met with the Syrian leader In most countries of the Arab Spring  the faces of the old order were removed  but either the ruling elite that had been behind them stayed in place or chaos ensued In Syria  Assad and his inner circle have kept their lock on power and managed to survive eight bloody years of chaos  That resilience may keep him in power for years to come even with a multitude of challenges  including a rapidly degenerating economy and a persisting insurgency in the northwest    WHAT IS ASSAD S STAYING POWER Assad has survived through a mix of factors unique to him  His is a minority rule  and he has benefited from a strong support base and the unwavering loyalty of his Alawite sect  which fears for its future should he be deposed That support stretched beyond his base to other minority sects in Syria and some middle  and upper class Sunnis who regard his family rule as a bulwark of stability in the face of Islamic radicals  Despite significant defections early in the conflict  the security services and military have not shown significant cracks  Loyal militias grew and became a power of their own Even as vast parts of his country fell from his control or turned into killing fields  Assad kept his core regime in place Perhaps Assad s largest asset is Syria s position as a geographic linchpin on the Mediterranean and in the heart of the Arab world  That attracted foreign intervention  particularly from Russia and Iran  whose crucial political and military assistance propped up Assad and turned the tide of the war in his favor The unwavering backing from powerful friends is in sharp contrast to the muddled response by the U S  administration  and something none of the other Arab leaders benefited from in their own struggle against their opponents Is he completely out of the woods For now  Assad appears to be secure  With the help of Russia and Iran  he has restored control over key parts of the country  and the world appears to have accepted his continued rule  at least until presidential elections scheduled for 2021 Gulf countries reopened embassies after years of boycott  Delegations from Iraq  Lebanon and Jordan have visited in recent months  discussing restarting trade  resuming commercial agreements and releasing prisoners  Although the Arab League said it was not yet time to restore Syria s membership to the 22 member organization  the issue was discussed at their annual summit for the first time since the country was deprived of its seat eight years ago Much of what happens next depends on Assad s ability to keep a lid on rising discontent as living standards deteriorate  and whether he is able to preserve Russia and Iran s support    AN ECONOMY IN SHAMBLESAfter years of war and ever tightening U S  sanctions  Syria s economic pinch is becoming more painful  The government s coffers are reeling from lack of resources  and the U N  estimates that eight out 10 people live below poverty line Gas and fuel shortages were rampant in Damascus  Latakia and Aleppo this winter  Social media groups held competitions over which city had the longest lines at gas stations  forcing the issue to be debated in parliament This week  the government imposed gas rationing  limiting motorists to 20 liters every 48 hours  The crisis was worsened when reports spread about an impending price hike  prompting lines of hundreds of cars to stretch for miles outside gas stations  Oil Minister Ali Ghanem denied plans for a hike  warning of a  war of rumors that is more severe than the political war  The government s inability to cope with rising needs has fueled criticism and anger even among its support base  Still  it s unlikely the discontent will set off another wave of protests  Most Syrians by now will put up with anything to avoid another slide back to violence Still  the United Nations describes the level of need in the country as  staggering   with 11 7 million Syrians requiring assistance  nearly 65 percent of the estimated 18 million people who remain in the country  millions of whom are displaced from their homes  Another more than 5 million fled abroad during the war    GOING FULL CIRCLE Demonstrations reminiscent of the early years of the conflict have resurfaced In Daraa  where the revolt started  hundreds took to the streets recently  offended by the government s plan to erect a statue of the president s father  the late Hafez Assad  Further protests took place in some former opposition areas recaptured by the government after authorities moved to enforce military conscription there despite promises to hold off Arrests and detentions continue to be reported in recaptured areas  fueling fear that so called reconciliation deals between authorities and residents of former opposition areas are only facades for continued repression and exclusion In eastern Ghouta  which the government recaptured last year after a siege  the government has been arresting former protest leaders and anti government groups despite reconciliation deals  according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Militarily  the defeat of the Islamic State group s  caliphate  last month closed one brutal chapter of the war but opens the door to an array of potential other conflicts  The militant group s defeat sets the stage for President Donald Trump to begin withdrawing U S  troops from northern Syria  a drawdown that s expected to set off a race to fill the vacuum The focus also pivots to Idlib  the last remaining rebel bastion in Syria where an estimated 3 million people live  under control of al Qaida linked militants  

LONDON   With the arrest in London of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  and the news of a criminal case against him in the United States  anyone expecting him to appear in an American courtroom should be warned  Extraditing him will not be quick  and it will not be easy The American authorities made a preliminary extradition request on Thursday  soon after Mr  Assange was jailed for jumping bail  but that was just the first in a long series of legal filings  hearings  appeals and administrative decisions  And in the end  experts say  the result is far from certain The process is mostly up to the courts  but politicians will have a hand in it  too  and were already drawing battle lines over Mr  Assange  Complicating matters  prosecutors in Sweden could reopen a rape investigation involving Mr  Assange and request extradition to that country  forcing the British government to decide which case would take precedence  It s not simple  and the defense will argue everything they can   said Rebecca Niblock  a partner at the British law firm Kingsley Napley who specializes in extradition law   I think it is going to be a long one  I d say minimum a year and a half  but if things get complicated  it could be much longer  Jeremy Corbyn  the leader of Britain s opposition Labour Party  wrote on Thursday on Twitter   The extradition of Julian Assange to the U S  for exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan should be opposed by the British government  The Conservative Party government has avoided taking a position  while signaling that it takes a much less favorable view of Mr  Assange   and sees in him a potent political issue Sajid Javid  who as home secretary has a role in the process  said in Parliament on Thursday that he  won t be drawn into the request for extradition  or discuss  the details of the accusations against Mr  Assange  either in the U K  s criminal justice system  or in the U S  ImageSupporters of Mr  Assange demonstrating outside the Westminster Magistrates Court in London CreditPeter Summers Getty ImagesDiane Abbott  Mr  Javid s Labour counterpart  said   Julian Assange is not being pursued to protect U S  national security  he s being pursued because he has exposed wrongdoing by U S  administrations and their military forces  The partisan divide raises the prospect that a change of government could change Mr  Assange s fortunes  because his case could take years to end  Britain s next scheduled general election would be in 2022  and there is widespread speculation that Prime Minister Theresa May might call early elections For years  Mr  Assange has been simultaneously hailed as a hero for transparency  and cursed as a reckless anarchist and publicity seeker  In 2016  WikiLeaks published stolen Democratic Party emails  damaging the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton Robert S  Mueller III  the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in that election  reported in court documents that Russian intelligence was the source of those emails  which Mr  Assange has denied But Mr  Assange has been in the sights of American officials since 2010  when WikiLeaks published an immense trove of classified material  primarily about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  taken from military computer systems by Chelsea Manning  an analyst in Army intelligence  Ms  Manning was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 35 years in prison  and spent nearly seven years in prison before her punishment was commuted by President Barack Obama WikiLeaks and its defenders argue that it was following a standard practice of news organizations  publishing information of public interest  even if the person who supplied the information obtained it illegally The case is about the  publishing of documents  of videos of killing of innocent civilians  exposure of war crimes   Kristinn Hrafnsson  a WikiLeaks editor  told a news conference on Thursday   This is journalism  ImageThe barrister Jennifer Robinson  left  and the WikiLeaks editor Kristinn Hrafnsson  right  addressing reporters outside the court in London on Thursday CreditJack Taylor Getty ImagesBut the indictment unsealed on Thursday alleges that Mr  Assange  a native of Australia  went further  conspiring with Ms  Manning  then known as Bradley Manning  to help her hack into the military network Mr  Assange s defenders  including a number of human rights activists  contend that the case against him is not about hacking  but about releasing information that embarrassed the United States For extradition to proceed under British law  the United States must submit a full extradition request  and Britain s home secretary must certify that it is legally valid and send it to the courts   all by mid June  Mr  Javid said  Then the matter goes to an extradition hearing before a judge  whose rulings can be appealed all the way up to Britain s Supreme Court Two recent  high profile cases could point the way for Mr  Assange s defense  The American authorities sought the extradition of Lauri Love  a British man charged with hacking into dozens of United States government computer systems  and Stuart Scott  a banker charged with currency manipulation In each case  a judge ruled against the defendant but the decision was overturned on appeal  partly on the grounds that the alleged illegal acts occurred in Britain  which meant any prosecution should take place in Britain If the courts uphold extradition  it is up to the home secretary to actually order it  The law gives the home secretary some leeway to defy the ruling and refuse extradition  though not much In another hacking case  the United States sought to prosecute Gary McKinnon  who was accused of gaining unauthorized access to dozens of government computers  in search  he said  of information about U F O s ImageMr  Assange on the steps of the High Court in London in December 2010  That year WikiLeaks published a trove of classified material taken from American military computer systems CreditStefan Wermuth ReutersAfter a decade of legal battles  the British courts ultimately decided against him  But in 2012  the home secretary at the time  Mrs  May  refused to order extradition based on Mr  McKinnon s mental health and the risk that he might commit suicide Since then  court decisions have narrowed the range of discretion available  but the courts could take Mr  Assange s condition into account  said Ms  Niblock  the extradition lawyer  His physical and mental health have undoubtedly deteriorated over the past seven years   she added In 2010  Swedish prosecutors ordered the arrest of Mr  Assange  who was living in Britain  to be questioned about allegations of sexual misconduct and rape in Sweden  While free on bail  he fought extradition to Sweden   which he said would turn him over to the United States   until he exhausted his appeals in 2012  Mr  Assange has denied the allegations against him Rather than submit to extradition  he took refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London  and the country granted him asylum  British prosecutors charged him with violating the terms of his bail In 2017  Swedish prosecutors set aside the rape case and the extradition request  saying that the effort was moot with Mr  Assange in the embassy On Thursday  Ecuador s government withdrew his asylum status after almost seven years  and allowed British police to enter the embassy and arrest him  He was swiftly convicted on the bail charge  for which he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison The next day  the Swedish Prosecution Authority said it was looking into the possibility of reopening its case against him  

Last November  federal prosecutors accidentally revealed  in an unrelated court document  that a sealed indictment had been filed against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  Many people concerned with civil liberties  including some who despise Assange  were alarmed by the idea that he could be punished for his role in exposing American government secrets   If Assange can be prosecuted merely for publishing leaked classified documents  every single media outlet is at risk of prosecution for doing the exact same thing   the lawyer Bradley P  Moss wrote in The Atlantic At the time  the public didn t know what the actual charges were  Now that Assange has been dragged from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London  where he s lived for almost seven years  and is facing extradition to the United States  we do  He s been indicted for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion  a result of his alleged attempts nearly a decade ago to help former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning crack a password to a government computer These charges do not pose quite the threat to a free press that some feared  because hacking is not standard journalistic practice   The indictment does not charge Assange for the act of publishing  which would have been a serious Rubicon crossed   Ben Wizner  director of the American Civil Liberties Union s project on speech  privacy and technology  told me  But  as Wizner emphasizes  that doesn t mean we shouldn t be worried about what Donald Trump s Justice Department is up to  Elements of the Assange indictment could still set a dangerous precedent  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  I don t say that out of any sympathy for Assange  an odious person who initially sought refuge in the embassy to dodge charges stemming from an alleged sexual assault in Sweden  In the 2016 election  Assange acted as a conduit for Russian intelligence services that had hacked emails from top Democrats  He helped spread the conspiracy theory that the leaked Democratic emails were actually released by Seth Rich  who worked for the Democratic National Committee and who was murdered in 2016  Surely Assange knew this wasn t true  There is ample evidence of his misogyny and anti Semitism  He might be known as an information anarchist  but by helping Trump become president  he became a handmaiden to authoritarianism So Assange may well deserve to go to prison  What s troubling  however  is that his indictment treats ordinary news gathering processes as elements of a criminal conspiracy The Obama administration made a decision that it couldn t prosecute Assange for disseminating classified information without threatening the First Amendment   The problem the department has always had in investigating Julian Assange is there is no way to prosecute him for publishing information without the same theory being applied to journalists   Matthew Miller  a former Justice Department spokesman  told The Washington Post in 2013 When Miller said that  the facts underlying the current hacking charge were already known  During Manning s trial in 2011  military prosecutors revealed chat logs in which Manning asked Assange for help cracking the password  There was no indication  then or now  that Assange succeeded  the Assange indictment says only that the password  would have allowed  Manning to access government computers without entering her own user name On Thursday  Miller told me there could be several reasons the Obama Justice Department didn t pursue a hacking indictment  At the time  Ecuador was less willing to turn Assange over   There s no reason to bring a case against him when you can t actually put your hands on him   said Miller  And while he believes that the hacking charge is justified  he said   This is not the world s strongest case  But the Justice Department s desire to nail Assange for publishing information leaked by Manning never went away  Miller said that both former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wanted to take a new look at the case  It s a relief that they found a way to make the case without a frontal assault on journalistic prerogatives  Still  if you read the indictment  a lot of things that journalists do routinely are part of Assange s alleged crime  It was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning took measures to conceal Manning as the source of the disclosure of classified records to WikiLeaks   says the indictment  Most if not all investigative journalists take such measures to protect their sources  The indictment says   It was part of the conspiracy that Assange encouraged Manning to provide information and records from departments and agencies of the United States   Journalists often do this when they urge whistle blowers to come forward   It was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning used a special folder on a cloud drop box of WikiLeaks  to transmit classified information  the indictment continues  Like many news organizations  The New York Times does something similar  soliciting tips through an encrypted submission system called SecureDrop For any of these actions to become part of a criminal conspiracy  there has to be a crime  But as Georgetown law professor David Super points out   We have right now a criminal code that is bursting at the seams with offenses   making it easy to break laws without realizing it A prosecutor  then  might be able to find a pretext for a similar conspiracy case if  for example  someone decides to leak the Mueller report  or Trump s tax returns   This pattern of behavior has already been turned against journalists in many parts of the world   Super said  Journalists  get prosecuted for pretty mundane stuff  some of which they probably did  but they wouldn t have been charged for if they didn t make the regime unhappy  Assange seems to have thought that  by helping elect Trump  he would improve his own situation  As Julia Ioffe reported in The Atlantic  in 2016 WikiLeaks suggested to Donald Trump Jr  that Trump should lean on Australia to have Assange  an Australian citizen  appointed ambassador to the United States  Roger Stone  a Trump adviser who was indicted in part for lying about his communications with WikiLeaks  reportedly told an associate that he was trying to get Assange a pre emptive presidential pardon  Now Assange has discovered  as so many others have before him  that betting on Trump can ruin your life  There s a certain dark satisfaction in that  But any legal theory that Trump s Justice Department uses against Assange can also be used against the rest of us RELATEDMore coverage of Julian Assange s arrest

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William Barr has pledged to release next week Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election and contacts between Moscow and President Donald Trump s campaign  albeit with color coded redactions  While congressional Democrats have demanded the release of the full report with nothing blacked out  as well as the underlying evidence Mueller collected  Barr has said he will redact four categories of sensitive information Barr told a congressional committee on Tuesday these redactions will be color coded and accompanied by notes explaining the grounds for withholding information  It is unclear how much will be blacked out According to a March 24 letter Barr sent to lawmakers  Mueller s nearly 400 page report presents evidence on both sides of the question of whether Trump engaged in obstruction of justice  and while it  does not conclude that the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  Barr said in his letter that Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia  Barr also said that he as attorney general concluded that Mueller s evidence was  not sufficient  to establish that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice Here is an explanation of the four categories of information that Barr has said will be redacted GRAND JURY MATERIALIn the U S  criminal justice system  prosecutors generally must get authorization from a group of citizens known as a grand jury before bringing criminal charges or issuing subpoenas  Grand juries meet in secret to ensure that people being investigated are not tipped off  while also protecting the privacy of potential criminal defendants who ultimately are not charged Over the course of Mueller s investigation  which led to charges against 34 people and three Russian companies  his team used grand jury proceedings to issue more than 2 800 subpoenas and executed nearly 500 search warrants  A provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure called Rule 6 e  requires government lawyers to maintain the confidentiality of  matters  before grand juries  with some exceptions This rule is unlikely to lead to many redactions in the part of the Mueller report dealing with whether Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice with actions aimed at impeding the inquiry  For that investigation  Mueller s team gathered evidence through voluntary FBI interviews with witnesses  which do not implicate grand jury secrecy rules Mueller did use a grand jury to question associates of Roger Stone  a longtime adviser to Trump who came under scrutiny due to his interactions with the Wikileaks website that published emails the special counsel has said were hacked by Russia to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton  In January  Mueller indicted Stone on charges including obstruction of an official proceeding  witness tampering and making false statements  Stone has pleaded not guilty Another key figure who testified before Mueller s grand jury was George Nader  a Lebanese American businessman involved in an effort to set up a back channel between the incoming Trump administration and the Kremlin while Barack Obama was still president  according to a Washington Post report INFORMATION THAT COULD AFFECT ONGOING CASES Barr has said he will redact information that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions   You ll recall that the special counsel did spin off a number of cases that are still being pursued   Barr told lawmakers   And we want to make sure that none of the information in the report would impinge upon either the ability of the prosecutors to prosecute the cases  or the fairness to the defendants  Mueller s team has enlisted attorneys from other parts of the Justice Department  court records show  to jointly prosecute certain ongoing cases  These include  charges against Stone  witness tampering charges against Konstantin Kilimnik  a Russian associate of Trump s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort  charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking Democratic emails  and a Russian  troll farm  accused of flooding social media sites with propaganda to promote Trump and disparage Clinton Separately  referrals by Mueller gave rise to inquiries by federal prosecutors in Washington  Virginia and New York  The New York referral related to Trump s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen  who pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and is due to report to prison for a three year sentence in May  U S  prosecutors in Virginia are investigating secret Turkish lobbying involving Michael Flynn  Trump s fired former national security adviser  In Washington  lobbyist Samuel Patten pleaded guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent for pro Russian Ukrainian politicians and helping a pro Russian Ukrainian businessman illegally purchase tickets to Trump s inauguration Stone s trial is set to begin in November and Manafort has been hit with state charges in New York  so information about those two men could be redacted  PERIPHERAL THIRD PARTIES Barr has said he will redact  information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties   This is another way of articulating a long standing Justice Department policy of not releasing disparaging information about a person unless the individual is indicted  The policy is grounded in the belief that people who are indicted can defend themselves in court  but people who are investigated without being charged do not have this opportunity This policy has been dispensed with before  including in June 2016 when then FBI Director James Comey publicly pronounced that Clinton had been  extremely careless  in handling classified information even though she was never charged Some legal experts have said this policy should not apply to Mueller s report because it was primarily a counterintelligence operation  rather than a traditional criminal investigation  By focusing on the privacy rights of  peripheral  third parties  Barr may be signaling he will make an exception to the policy in order to allow information to remain unredacted concerning people who  while not charged with crimes  are central to the probe  potentially including Trump INTELLIGENCE GATHERING SOURCES AND METHODSIn investigating Russian election interference  Mueller s team may have relied on information from top secret intelligence sources  Justice Department officials last year turned down a request by Republican lawmakers for certain information about Mueller s investigation  saying doing so could put lives at risk and expose the identity of a U S  citizen who provided intelligence to the FBI  While redacting such material  Barr might opt to divulge it to certain lawmakers behind closed doors   Reporting by Jan Wolfe  Editing by Will Dunham  

 Reuters    British drugmaker Indivior Plc lost nearly three quarters of its share value on Wednesday and former parent Reckitt Benckiser also fell following U S  criminal charges accusing Indivior of illegally increasing prescriptions for its opioid addiction treatment Suboxone In an indictment in federal court in Abingdon  Virginia  a grand jury said Indivior made billions of dollars by deceiving doctors and healthcare benefit programs into believing its Suboxone Film version was safer and less susceptible to abuse than similar drugs The indictment charged Indivior and its subsidiary Indivior Inc with conspiracy  health care fraud  mail fraud and wire fraud  If the company is convicted  the U S  government would seek forfeiture of at least  3 billion from Indivior  the indictment said The company has set aside a provision of  438 million related to the issue Indivior developed the film version of the treatment as a period of marketing exclusivity granted by the U S  Federal Drug

reason for the discontinuance was to delay FDA approval of generic Suboxone   This indictment is not against RB Group Plc or any other group company and we currently have no additional or new information in respect of this matter  apart from what has been publicly issued by the Department of Justice and Indivior Plc   Reckitt  owner of Durex condoms and Lysol cleaners  said in a statement on Wednesday It referred investors back to a previous statement that it was recognizing a provision of  400 million relating to the issue but that its final cost could be substantially higher  The

President Trump s declaration that Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a foreign terrorist organization is the first time the United States government has designated a part of another country s military as that type of threat  In doing so  Mr  Trump took broad aim at a pillar of the Iranian state  which exerts enormous influence in politics and the economy as well as in Iran s internal and external military policies Mr  Trump said the Revolutionary Guard Corps  actively participates in  finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft  The Iranian government has used the Guard Corps internationally to create  train  arm and sometimes plot strategy for paramilitary forces and nonstate actors in other countries  Iran s adversaries have accused elite Guard Corps units of having plotted and sometimes carried out assassinations in foreign countries Since many businesses are linked to the Guard Corps   it is thought to have ties to companies that do more than  20 billion worth of business annually  according to estimates by British and American research groups   the sanctions could touch many businesses outside Iran Iran s enemies  notably Israel and Saudi Arabia  which have long feared the power of the Guard Corps  welcomed Mr  Trump s announcement  But those who have relied on Iran s help  including Iraq  worried about how the new sanctions might make even more fraught its balancing act between the United States and Iran Who are the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Founded in the early days of the 1979 Iranian revolution that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power  the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps started as a military force assigned to safeguard the new government and Mr  Khomeini  who as supreme leader was Iran s most powerful theological and political figure  The Guard Corps reported directly to Mr  Khomeini and later to his successor  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  so its power cannot easily be checked by Iran s other institutions Since its founding  the Guard Corps has vastly expanded and now constitutes one of the three main branches of Iran s armed forces  along with the army and the police The Guard Corps has more than 125 000 active duty personnel and controls a paramilitary force known as the Basij  according to a survey by the International Institute for Strategic Studies  a British research group  The Basij often has been used to repress antigovernment protesters  according to Iranian dissidents and others The Guard also has specialists in ballistic missile technology and asymmetric warfare  along with its own air force  navy and intelligence service  Critics accuse the Guard s intelligence operatives of tracking down anyone deemed an enemy of the state ImageMembers of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps protecting Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Qom  Iran  in 1979 CreditMichel Lipchitz Associated PressHow is the Guard different from other parts of the military While the army defends Iranian territory  the Guard was set up to safeguard against internal uprisings and threats from ideological opponents  within or outside the country  Guard members view themselves as keepers of Iran s revolutionary flame The Guard is best known for the power it projects outside Iran in making foreign policy through training militias in foreign countries and undertaking operations such as fighting the Islamic State  the Sunni extremist militant group regarded as a terrorist organization by virtually all countries The Guard also differs from other branches of the armed forces in the strong influence it wields over who gains political power  The Guard controls directly and indirectly billions of dollars in contracts in construction  electricity and engineering  as well as in other strategic fields such as telecommunications and media  Many large companies are either tied to individuals in the Guard or run by former members What is the Guard s Al Quds Force The most elite members of the Guard are in the Al Quds Force  numbering a few thousand  whose work is focused mostly outside Iran  Its members are believed to carry out clandestine operations including assassinations  and are experts in asymmetric warfare  They have trained nonstate actors in foreign countries including Hamas in the Palestinian territories  Hezbollah in Lebanon  and Shiite militias in Syria and Iraq The Al Quds Force was designated as a supporter of foreign terrorist organizations  including the Taliban and others  more than 10 years ago by the Treasury Department What attacks have been linked to the Al Quds Force They include an attempted assassination of the Saudi ambassador to Washington  the attempted assassination of an Israeli diplomat in New Delhi  and the capture and killing of five American military personnel by an Iraqi militia in a 2007 attack in Karbala  Iraq  The Al Quds Force also is thought to have initially supplied and then helped train Iraqis to manufacture roadside bombs that could destroy armored vehicles used by American soldiers in Iraq What else do Guard Corps members do Increasingly they exercise power domestically through their businesses and propaganda wings  which not only own media companies but are also are active in Iranian universities  While involved in business of all kinds  Guard Corps members focus on those that have strategic implications  according to analysts at the London based International Institute for Strategic Studies ImageMaj  Gen  Qassim Suleimani is the powerful leader of the Quds Force CreditOffice of the Iranian PresidencyWho leads the Revolutionary Guard Corps The top commander is Maj  Gen  Mohammad Ali Jafari  He has held the position since 2007  Equally powerful  but perhaps with a higher profile  is the Quds Force leader  Maj  Gen  Qassim Suleimani General Suleimani is regarded as a hero in Iran  and perhaps a future leader of the country  He has been credited with having made some of the earliest liaisons between Iraqi organizations that opposed Saddam Hussein and Iran During the 1980 88 Iran Iraq war  he forged alliances with the Shiite Badr Organization of Iraq and with Kurdish leaders from different parties General Suleimani has been especially active in Iraq since 2014 when the Iraqi Army collapsed in the face of aggressive adherents of the Islamic State who seized Mosul and other cities  He helped to organize young Iraqi Shiite fighters who rallied to fight the Islamic State and ultimately  along with American air support and Special Operations forces  helped Iraq regain control over its territory Nonetheless  the United States has long considered General Suleimani a dangerous threat  And General Suleimani has not been shy about publicly rebuking the Trump administration Last July  when President Trump warned Iran not to threaten the United States  General Suleimani dismissed his warning in a speech as  cabaret style rhetoric   

President Trump has adopted a blunt new message in recent days for migrants seeking refuge in the United States   Our country is full  To the degree the president is addressing something broader than the recent strains on the asylum seeking process  the line suggests the nation can t accommodate higher immigration levels because it is already bursting at the seams  But it runs counter to the consensus among demographers and economists They see ample evidence of a country that is not remotely  full    but one where an aging population and declining birthrates among the native born population are creating underpopulated cities and towns  vacant housing and troubled public finances Local officials in many of those places view a shrinking population and work force as an existential problem with few obvious solutions  I believe our biggest threat is our declining labor force   said Gov  Phil Scott of Vermont  a Republican  in his annual budget address this year   It s the root of every problem we face  This makes it incredibly difficult for businesses to recruit new employees and expand  harder for communities to grow and leaves fewer of us to cover the cost of state government   Or if you look at a city like Detroit   many of the city s problems would become less difficult if its population would start growing   said Edward Glaeser  a Harvard economist   All sorts of things like the hangover pension liability become much more solvable if you re actually looking at new people coming in  ImageA road less traveled in Rutland  Vt   last spring  Vermont s governor has described the state s shrinking labor force as  at the root of every problem we face   CreditCaleb Kenna for The New York TimesThis consensus is visible in official government projections  The Congressional Budget Office foresees the American labor force rising by only 0 5 percent a year over the coming decade  about one third as fast as from 1950 to 2007  That is a crucial reason that economic growth is forecast to remain well below its late 20th century levels And that  in turn  is reflected in the national fiscal outlook  There are now 2 8 workers for every recipient of Social Security benefits  a rate on track to fall to 2 2 by 2035  according to the program s trustees  Many state pension plans face even greater demography induced strains In smaller cities and rural areas  demographic decline is a fundamental fact of life  A recent study by the Economic Innovation Group found that 80 percent of American counties  with a combined population of 149 million  saw a decline in their number of prime working age adults from 2007 to 2017 Population growth in the United States has now hit its lowest level since 1937  partly because of a record low fertility rate   the number of children born per woman  The United States increasingly has population growth rates similar to slow growing Japan and Western Europe  with immigration partly offsetting that shift  The Trump administration has portrayed the surge of asylum seekers at the southern border as a crisis  and applied aggressive tactics to deport undocumented immigrants already in the United States  But it has also announced plans to issue up to 30 000 additional H 2B visas for temporary workers  That immigrants keep showing up here is a testament to our freedom and the economic opportunity here   said Matthew Kahn  an economist at the University of Southern California  If immigrants weren t trying to come   if they believed the United States to be full   that would be a problem  Mr  Kahn said A particular fear  said John Lettieri  president of the Economic Innovation Group  is that declining population  falling home prices and weak public finances will create a vicious cycle that the places losing population could find hard to escape He proposes a program of  heartland visas   in which skilled immigrants could obtain work visas to the United States on the condition they live in one of the counties facing demographic decline   with troubled counties themselves deciding whether to participate Although some of the areas with declining demographics are hostile to immigration  others  cities as varied as Baltimore  Indianapolis and Fargo  N D   have embraced the strategy of encouraging it  One of the key solutions is to welcome immigrants into these communities   said Brooks Rainwater  director of the National League of Cities  Center for City Solutions Many parts of the country that are growing in population and that are more economically dynamic have depended on the arrival of immigrants for that success Sun Belt metros like Dallas and Phoenix have been built on the logic of rapid expansion   of quickly built homes  of poached employers  of new highways paved to ever newer subdivisions  Their economic development strategy is growth  Their chief input is people   the more  the better  Growth cities need immigrants to continue their growth   said Joel Kotkin  executive director of the Houston based Center for Opportunity Urbanism  which promotes policies to help cities grow   The older historically declining cities need immigrants to reinvigorate their economies  And the expensive cities need them because  frankly  white people  African Americans and middle class people are leaving for more affordable areas  As many industrial cities have lost population since the mid 20th century  Americans have built whole new metropolises on land that was virtually empty then  The Las Vegas metropolitan area  with more than two million people today  had barely 50 000 in 1950  Still  only about 3 percent of the country s land is urbanized America s metropolitan areas remain among the least dense in the world  said Sonia Hirt  a professor of landscape architecture and planning at the University of Georgia  Nationwide  the United States has less than one third of the population density of the European Union  and a quarter of the density of China  Factually speaking  the country is not actually full   that s impossible   Ms  Hirt said   The real question is  if you continue on the current path of immigration  does this bring more benefits than it brings costs  Economists  too  argue that countries  or even cities  can t really fill up  Rather  communities choose not to make the political choices necessary to accommodate more people  At the local level  that means neighbors may be unwilling to allow taller buildings or to invest in more schools or improved infrastructure  At the national level  it means that politicians may be unwilling to take up immigration reform  or to address workers who fear unemployment  The president s comments echo such local fights   We re full  has often been a motto for people to keep out poorer renters  minority households or apartment buildings  among both conservatives and liberals  The claim can be a way of disguising exclusion as practicality  It s not that we re unwelcoming  it s just that we re

ADDIS ABABA   Ethiopian Airlines  doomed 737 MAX jet hit excessive speed and was forced downwards by a wrongly triggered automation system as pilots wrestled to regain control  a preliminary report into the crash that has shaken the aviation world showed on Thursday Three times the captain  Yared Getachew  cried  pull up   before the Boeing Co plane plunged into a field six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa  killing all 157 passengers and crew  said the report by Ethiopian investigators  The March 10 disaster  and parallels with another 737 MAX crash in Indonesia last October in which 189 people died  has led to the worldwide grounding of Boeing s flagship model  It has also brought uncomfortable scrutiny over new software  pilot training and regulatory rigor  The report leaves unanswered questions  aviation experts said  over whether crew followed guidance not to restore power to a troublesome anti stall system following sensor damage  possibly caused by a bird strike  The plane was also left at unusually high thrust throughout the flight  data suggested  While the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority s Accident Prevention and Investigation Bureau had a remit to investigate rather than blame  it implicitly pointed the finger at Boeing by defending the pilots  recommending the U S  company fix its control systems  and saying regulators must be certain before allowing the MAX back in the air  The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft   Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told a news conference  Since repetitive uncommanded aircraft nose down conditions are noticed     it is recommended that the aircraft control system shall be reviewed by the manufacturer  Boeing  the world s biggest planemaker and one of the United States  most important exporters with a  500 billion order book for the MAX  says a new software fix for its MCAS anti stall system will enable pilots to always override if necessary  Responding to the preliminary report  Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said   As pilots have told us  erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment   It s our responsibility to eliminate this risk  We own it and we know how to do it   Muilenburg said in a statement FRAGMENTS IN A CRATERAccording to the preliminary report  an alarm indicating excess speed was heard on the cockpit voice reporter as the jet reached 500 knots  575 miles per hour    well above operational limits The plane had faulty  angle of attack  sensor readings  its nose was pushed down automatically  and the crew lost control despite following recommended instructions  it said   Most of the wreckage was found buried in the ground   the report said  indicating the strength of the impact on an arid field in an agricultural zone  No bodies were recovered  only charred fragments among the debris in a crater A final report by Ethiopian authorities aided by air safety experts from the United States and Europe is due to be published within a year Boeing has seen billions wiped off its market value since the crash  but its shares rose 2 9 percent on Thursday  Morgan Stanley said the report of flight control problems  which Boeing was already trying to fix  meant a  worst case scenario  of a new cause was probably off the table  The software update  along with the associated training and additional educational materials that pilots want in the wake of these accidents  will eliminate the possibility of unintended MCAS activation and prevent an MCAS related accident from ever happening again   Muilenburg s statement said Families of the victims  regulators and travellers around the world have been waiting to find out to what extent Boeing technology or the pilots  actions played a role The preliminary report into the crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia suggested pilots also lost control after grappling with the MCAS software  a new automated anti stall feature that repeatedly lowered the nose based on faulty sensor data  Whatever the issues were  they better be 110 percent sure about their resolution  otherwise the 157 lives lost would have been for nothing if something like this happens again   said one woman  who lost her father in the Ethiopian crash  asking not to be identified   This is a lesson to not take shortcuts in order to try and save bucks   PROFITS OVER SAFETY  The U S  Federal Aviation Administration regulator  under fire for its certification of the MAX  cautioned the inquiry was not over   As we learn more about the accident and findings become available  we will take appropriate action   it said Boeing may press to know more about how crew members responded to problems triggered by the faulty data  The New York Times quoted the Ethiopian government s Dagmawit as saying pilots turned MCAS off and on  which is not the step recommended in procedures telling crew to leave it off once disabled  With bereaved families angry and confused  relatives of an American woman killed in the Ethiopian crash  Samya Stumo  filed the first lawsuit on behalf of a U S  victim in Chicago  The complaint named Boeing and Rosemount Aerospace Inc  the manufacturer of the angle of attack sensor  as defendants Stumo is the niece of consumer activist Ralph Nader  who called for a boycott of the 737 MAX on Thursday Pilots around the world were watching closely  If the preliminary report from the Ethiopian authorities is accurate  the pilots quickly identified the malfunction and applied the manufacturer s checklist   said Captain Jason Goldberg  spokesman for Allied Pilots Association  which represents American Airlines pilots   Following this checklist did not appear to allow the pilots to regain control of the aircraft  But a former U S  National Transportation Safety Board investigator questioned the aircraft s speed  which according to data in the report was left on a higher than usual setting  Aviation experts say the sensor fault should have required the crew to take manual control of the power since it would disrupt accurate speed readings in the cockpit  The report does not address information about unreliable airspeed procedures which should be considered   said Greg Feith  a former NTSB air safety investigator GRAPHIC  Ethiopian

SÃO PAULO  Brazil   Cleuzenir Barbosa  a retired teacher  was fed up with Brazil s corrupt politics  She was also an avid supporter of Jair Bolsonaro  the far right politician who won the presidency last year on the promise to clean up the capital So when a member of Mr  Bolsonaro s party asked her to run for a state legislature seat  she was ecstatic   so ecstatic  Ms  Barbosa said  that she did not stop to consider why the party would be interested in a candidate like her  a community organizer with no political experience  It was all perfect  I couldn t believe it   Ms  Barbosa said in a telephone interview   I was full of expectations of a new way of doing things  full of plans  Now  prosecutors are investigating whether the candidacy of Ms  Barbosa and at least four other women who ran as part of Mr  Bolsonaro s party represented a new take on illegal campaign financing  a form of corruption with deep roots in Brazilian politics Mr  Bolsonaro s conservative Social Liberal Party  or P S L   is one of at least five parties being investigated by prosecutors for enlisting obscure female candidates in order to tap money from a taxpayer financed electoral fund meant to increase the number of women in politics The party leaders are suspected of then asking the women to kick back the money  which would be used to promote men  No charges have been filed The scandal has led to the ouster of one of Mr  Bolsonaro s cabinet members and has left a second one teetering  calling into question the president s commitment to cleaning up Brazilian politics It comes at a vulnerable moment in his presidency  when his popularity ratings are plummeting and his government is struggling to get signature proposals   overhauls of the penal code and the social security system   through Congress It has also drawn attention to how unequal men s and women s participation in politics remains in Brazil  which lags behind nearly all of its Latin American neighbors in the number of women in office Worldwide  Brazil ranks 133 out of 193 countries in terms of female representation in legislative bodies  below Jordan and just above Bhutan  Chad and Egypt Taking advantage of resources aimed at promoting greater female representation has fueled anger even among the P S L  party faithful  All of the embezzlement needs to be investigated  but I am particularly indignant about information that women were used   said Janaína Paschoal  an outspoken conservative who ran on the P S L  ticket in São Paulo and was elected a state legislator   Those possibly involved need to be removed from office  Although several parties are under investigation by prosecutors  the P S L  has come under particular scrutiny because Mr  Bolsonaro is the president and ran as an alternative to the corrupt parties that had been in power  The fact that the P S L  is falling back on old political tricks is not that surprising   said Monica de Bolle  a Brazilian economist who heads the Latin American studies program at Johns Hopkins University   But the female aspect is really important  For Ms  Barbosa  it all started with an unexpected call from a politician from the president s party  who asked if she wanted to run for office She drove 14 hours from her home in Governador Valadares to the capital  Brasília  There she was greeted by the crème da la crème of the P S L   and formally invited to be a candidate by Marcelo Henrique Teixeira Dias  then the regional president of the party Mr  Bolsonaro himself recorded a short video for her campaign  This year  without a doubt  is her year   Mr  Bolsonaro said in the message  flashing a thumbs up as a slightly bewildered looking Ms  Barbosa stood next to him She was enthusiastic  she said   At first  it all went according to script  But as the October election approached  she began to realize local party leaders were showing more interest in the campaign funds allocated to her as a female candidate than to her proposals Come October  Mr  Bolsonaro won the presidency  But Ms  Barbosa  disillusioned  filed a formal complaint with public prosecutors in December  accusing party leaders of trying to use her candidacy to siphon money to male candidates That helped instigate a broader investigation into the matter and presented a significant challenge to Mr  Bolsonaro s recently formed administration Deeply entrenched attitudes help keep women out of politics in Brazil  despite progressive laws intended to change that For the last decade  the country has required that 30 percent of each party s candidates be women  but that has done little to boost the participation of women in state and national legislatures Parties often ran female candidates   as required   but gave them little or no resources  In some cases  the women were surprised to learn they were on the ballot In local elections in 2016  more than 18 000 names on ballots did not receive any votes   suggesting they were likely  ghost  candidates  Of those  86 percent were women A law passed before the most recent elections demanded that parties allocate at least 30 percent of taxpayer financed electoral funds to women  Yet many female candidates still performed poorly  with the proportion of women lawmakers inching up to 15 percent from 11 percent Mr  Bolsonaro  who is notorious for misogynist comments he made as a congressman  has shrugged off the imbalance On International Women s Day  he joked that his government had achieved gender parity for the first time in Brazil s history  because each of the two female ministers in the 22 member cabinet was  equivalent to 10 men  On the same day in neighboring Argentina  which ranks 18 out of 193 countries in terms of female participation in Congress  President Mauricio Macri signed a law that requires that half of each party s candidates be women When the newspaper Folha de S  Paulo first broke the story that some P S L  leaders appeared to have used women as ghost candidates  Mr  Bolsonaro fired one of his top aides  Secretary General Gustavo Bebianno  As the president of the party  Mr  Bebianno was responsible for the distribution of campaign funds Mr  Bebianno denies any wrongdoing and says all of the funding allocations were approved by electoral authorities Ms  Barbosa said that immediately after receiving  16 000 from the electoral fund  P S L  operators ordered her to transfer most of the money to specific accounts She said she refused  and sent numerous complaints to the regional party president  Mr  Teixeira Dias  as well as handing over relevant bank statements and WhatsApp messages to the authorities In a written statement  Mr  Teixeira Dias  who is now the tourism minister  denied any knowledge of the misuse of campaign funds  It is necessary to wait to see what is real and what is not real   said Justice Minister Sergio Moro  a former federal judge who built a reputation for zealously prosecuting corrupt politicians Ms  Barbosa said she doesn t hold Mr  Bolsonaro responsible  But just three days after going to the police  she packed her bags and moved to Portugal  where she is seeking political asylum  In Brazil  women who denounce their husbands for abuse are killed and politicians who denounce corruption end up dead   she said   Anybody who is a whistle blower is vulnerable   

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  Most employers in New York City would no longer be able to force job applicants to take drug tests for marijuana use  under a bill overwhelmingly approved this week by the City Council If the drug screening law is enacted  it would put New York in relatively uncharted territory  Several drug policy and employment experts said that they did not know of similar laws on the books  even in states that have legalized marijuana In Maine  where voters approved legal recreational marijuana use  the law prevents employers from discriminating against people who have used cannabis  but it does not specifically regulate drug testing  The Council s bill would affect public and private employers in New York City  including companies with headquarters elsewhere  according to Jumaane D  Williams  the city s public advocate and the bill s sponsor  He said it was unclear exactly how many employers in the city screen employees for drugs and might be affected  I m proud that the city has taken action where the federal and the state government have stalled   Mr  Williams said on Thursday The legislation  which passed on Tuesday by a 40 to 4 vote  was the latest in a series of progressive steps that city officials have taken to ease cannabis restrictions as state lawmakers  efforts to legalize marijuana have stalled  In addition to Mr  Williams s bill  the city also passed a bill that would stop the city from requiring marijuana testing for people on probation  Both bills are currently awaiting Mayor Bill de Blasio s signature The mayor s administration fully supports the employment bill  a spokeswoman for the mayor  Olivia Lapeyrolerie  said on Thursday  The employment screening bill would take effect one year after it is signed into law Not every employee would be exempt from drug testing if the bill becomes law  If workers appeared to be under the influence of marijuana at work  employers would still be permitted to drug test The bill also carves out exemptions for certain safety sensitive industries  including law enforcement and construction  as well as jobs that require supervising children or medical patients  The bill also would not stop federal and state employees or contractors  who are not under the city s jurisdiction  from being tested  Nor would it end the drug test requirements imposed by the federal government on transportation workers like truck drivers and pilots Dionna King  a policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance  acknowledged that the range of exceptions could weaken the impact of the bill  Still  she said the bill was an important step toward ending the stigma attached to marijuana use  Through this legislation  there will still be a good number of folks who will no longer have to submit to testing just to get employment   Ms  King said Pre employment drug testing started to become increasingly common in the 1980s  Former President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order in 1986 that called for  drug free workplaces  in the federal government  and mandated drug testing at federal agencies In 1988  the Drug Free Workplace Act extended the policy to federal contractors and recipients of federal grants  From there  it ultimately spread to the private sector  pushed by advocates of strong antidrug policy  according to Mark A R  Kleiman  a professor at public policy at New York University By 2011  more than half of United States employers conducted drug screenings on all of their job candidates  according to a survey from the Society for Human Resource Management  a trade organization  Only 29 percent of employers did not conduct drug tests at all  It has become so normalized now   Ms  King said   People expect it as part of the hiring process  Employers defended the testing as a way to root out prospective workers whose drug use could have led to impaired judgment  lower productivity and higher absentee rates  according to Melissa J  Osipoff  a lawyer at the employment law firm Fisher Phillips But opponents to pre employment drug screening believe that the practice is overly invasive and creates an unnecessary barrier to employment  Mr  Kleiman and Ms  King said there was little evidence that passing a drug test would be a predictor of an employee s job performance In recent years  as attitudes toward marijuana have shifted  some employers began to reconsider their views on marijuana testing  Ms  Osipoff said  Even in states that have legalized some form of marijuana  employers have felt pressed to reconsider drug testing policies in order to hire competitively  Ms  Osipoff said   In states where it s legal  they ll tell you   We can t get good candidates if we test for marijuana    she said But Kathryn S  Wylde  64  president of the Partnership for New York City  which represents business leaders  called the bill an overreach by the City Council  This is another instance where City Council is interfering in the relationship between employees and employers   she said Ms  Wylde  64  said the bill would increase costs for global employers in particular  forcing them to modify existing policies to comply with the city s law In New York  Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo said that he would push to legalize recreational marijuana this year  Though he had initially hoped to include the measure as part of the state budget  lawmakers were unable to reach a deal  Mr  Williams said that while the state continued to negotiate legalization  it was important for the city to continue to enact what he viewed as sensible marijuana policy   If we want to be a progressive city  we have to really put these things into action   he said Quest Diagnostics  one of the nation s largest medical testing companies  released data on Thursday that said that marijuana use had risen among United States workers in 2018  An analysis of more than 10 million drug test results showed that 2 3 percent of the American work force tested positive for marijuana use in 2018  up from 2 percent a year earlier Quest also said that the percentage of American workers who tested positive for illicit drugs was at its highest point since 2004 The country s growing acceptance of marijuana usage was likely to force employers to take a harder look at their drug testing policies  Ms  Osipoff said  She expected that New York City s bill would push employers across the country to consider broad changes  When New York City passes a law  that just gets employers talking   she said One of the Council members who opposed the bill  Steven Matteo  a Republican of Staten Island  said he felt the city should not interfere with the private sector s hiring discretion  I believe private businesses should have the power to determine their own hiring practices   said Mr  Matteo  the City Council s minority leader Mayor de Blasio Backs Legal Marijuana  With CaveatsDec  19  2018Black Lawmakers to Block Legalized

WASHINGTON   Charges against Julian Assange  the founder and leader of WikiLeaks  that were unsealed on Thursday brought to a head a long running debate about whether his actions could be construed as a crime and what prosecuting him would mean for American press freedoms Mr  Assange vaulted to global fame in 2010  when his anti secrecy website began posting archives of secret American military and diplomatic documents leaked by Chelsea Manning  an Army intelligence analyst who had downloaded them from a classified computer network she worked on at her outpost in Iraq  His image became more complicated in 2016  when WikiLeaks published stolen Democratic emails that the Russian government had hacked as part of its covert operation to damage Hillary Clinton and help Donald J  Trump win the presidency Throughout that saga  national security and law enforcement officials in both the Obama and the Trump administrations have weighed whether they could charge Mr  Assange with a crime  That debate has raised concerns by press freedom advocates about what any precedent established by his case would mean for First Amendment rights and the future of investigative journalism in the United States Why does the case against Mr  Assange raise concerns about press freedoms Mr  Assange is not a traditional journalist  but most of what he does at WikiLeaks is difficult to distinguish in a legally meaningful way from what traditional news organizations  like The New York Times  do every day  seek out and publish information that officials would prefer to be kept secret  including classified national security matters  and take steps to protect the confidentiality of sources In recent years  prosecutors have begun far more regularly charging officials with leaking information to reporters under the Espionage Act  a World War I era law  It criminalizes the disclosure of potentially damaging national security secrets to someone not authorized to receive them  On its face  the Espionage Act could also be used to prosecute reporters who publish government secrets While many legal scholars believe that prosecuting reporters for doing their jobs would violate the First Amendment  the prospect has never been tested in court because the government has never charged a journalist under that law  The rumblings about prosecuting Mr  Assange raised the possibility that prosecutors could violate that norm and try to establish that publishing government secrets can be a crime Was Mr  Assange charged with publishing secrets No  When the indictment was unsealed on Thursday  it showed that a grand jury had instead charged Mr  Assange with conspiring with Ms  Manning to illegally hack a government computer to obtain national security information Specifically  the indictment said  on March 8  2010  Mr  Assange agreed to help Ms  Manning try to crack part of an encoded password that would have let her log onto a classified computer network under a user name that did not belong to her  Prosecutors also cited a chat log from two days later that they said indicated that Mr  Assange had taken steps to act on that conspiracy  He said he had  no luck so far  in trying to crack the password So can people concerned about press freedoms rest easy Not quite  For now  the case significantly reduces such concerns because it is outside traditional investigative journalism to help sources try to break passcodes so they can illegally hack into government computers But some press freedom advocates say they remain concerned  For one thing  the Justice Department could file a superseding indictment  so there is no guarantee that Espionage Act charges will stay out of the case  Under extradition procedures  however  any additional charges would most likely have to come soon   before Britain decides whether to transfer custody of Mr  Assange For another  prosecutors cited details that expanded beyond a narrow focus on cracking the passcode and that sounded like typical activities of a journalist  For example  the indictment talks about efforts to conceal conversations by using a special chat service and deleting certain chat logs  It also says Mr  Assange took a step to help Ms  Manning send him the files  by making a special folder for her to upload files And it quotes a purported exchange midway through Ms  Manning s leaks in which she wrote   After this upload  that s all I really have got left   but Mr  Assange replied   Curious eyes never run dry in my experience   Several weeks later  according to the indictment  Ms  Manning copied and sent WikiLeaks the diplomatic cables The Justice Department s inclusion of those details as relevant to the case was cause for worry  said Jameel Jaffer  the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University  The indictment and the Justice Department s press release treat everyday journalistic practices as part of a criminal conspiracy   he said   Whether the government will be able to establish a violation of the hacking statute remains to be seen  but it s very troubling that the indictment sweeps in activities that are not just lawful but essential to press freedom   activities like cultivating sources  protecting sources  identities and communicating with sources securely  Could Mr  Assange be charged later in connection with Russia s election interference It would not be easy The Espionage Act does not cover the disclosure of unclassified emails like the Democratic messages  so prosecutors would have to come up with a theory in which publishing them violated some other law  Even if they could find one  a 2001 Supreme Court ruling held that the First Amendment did not permit prosecutors to charge people with crimes for publishing or broadcasting information so long as they broke no law in acquiring it   even if their sources had done something illegal to obtain it No one has suggested that the Russians needed or had any help from Mr  Assange in hacking Democrats  emails  And Mr  Assange has denied knowing who his source was  at the time  Russian military intelligence officers created the fictitious online persona of a hacker calling himself Guccifer 2 0 to disseminate and call attention to the files  although evidence that it was most likely a front for Russian intelligence was broadly discussed What about the statute of limitations Normally  the statute of limitations prevents prosecutors from charging people with a crime for actions that took place more than five years ago  However  a hacking provision cited in the indictment   intruding into a government computer to obtain national security secrets   has an eight year limit  A grand jury returned the indictment of Mr  Assange on March 6  2018  just before the eighth anniversary of the day that Mr  Assange is accused of entering into a conspiracy with Ms  Manning to violate that law There is an oddity  As part of the USA Patriot Act after the Sept  11 attacks  Congress added that provision to a list of crimes that get an eight year limit under a separate law titled  extension of statute of limitation for certain terrorism offenses   While Mr  Assange s case involves national security  it is not about terrorism  The  terrorism  heading most likely makes no legal difference  however   just as prosecutors can use the words of the Espionage Act to charge leakers  not just spies Is a trial imminent No  Mr  Assange is widely expected to fight extradition to the United States by arguing in British court that his prosecution is politically motivated  That fight and inevitable appeals could take years to play out  

CANBERRA  Australia   Australia s prime minister on Thursday called a May 18 election that will be fought on issues including climate change  asylum seekers and economic management  We live in the best country in the world   Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters after advising the governor general to authorize the election  But to secure your future  the road ahead depends on a strong economy  And that s why there is so much at stake at this election   he added Morrison s conservative coalition is seeking a third three year term  But Morrison is the third prime minister to lead a divided government in that time and only took the helm in late August Opinion polls suggest his reign will become one of the shortest in the 118 year history of Australian prime ministers on election day  The polls suggest center left opposition leader Bill Shorten will become the eighth prime minister since the country plunged into an extraordinary period of political instability in 2007 The election pits Shorten  a former labor union leader who has presented himself as the alternative prime minister for the past six years  and Morrison  a leader who the Australian public is still getting to know Shorten said in his first news conference since the election was called that his government will take  real action on climate change  and reduce inequality in Australian society if his Labor Party wins power  Australians face a real and vital choice at this election  Do you want Labor s energy  versus the government s tiredness  Labor s focus on the future  versus being stuck in the past   Shorten said Morrison is seen as the architect of Australia s tough refugee policy that has all but stopped the people smuggling traffic of boats from Southeast Asian ports since 2014  The policy has been condemned by human rights groups as an abrogation of Australia s responsibilities as a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention Morrison s first job in Prime Minister Tony Abbott s newly elected coalition government in 2013 was as minister for immigration and border protection  He oversaw the secretive military run Operation Sovereign Borders Asylum seekers from the Middle East  Africa and Asia would typically disable or sink their boats when intercepted by patrol ships in waters north of Australia so that the Australian crews would have to rescue them rather than turn the boats away  Under the new regime  the asylum seekers were placed in motorized life boats that were towed back to Indonesia  The life boats had just enough fuel to reach the Indonesian coast  The Indonesian government complained the policy was an affront to Indonesian sovereignty The government has also maintained a policy adopted in the final months of a Labor government in 2013 of sending boat arrivals to camps on the Pacific island nations of Papua New Guinea and Nauru  Those who attempt to reach Australia by boat are told they will never be allowed to settle there Morrison remains proud of virtually stopping people smuggler boat traffic  He has a trophy shaped like a people smuggler s boat in his office inscribed with  I Stopped These  Labor has promised to maintain the policy of banishing boat arrivals to the islands  But Labor says it would give priority to finding permanent homes for the asylum seekers who have languished in island camps for years The conservative coalition argues that the boats would start coming again because a Labor government would soften the regime  The government introduced temporary protection visas for boat arrivals so that refugees face potential deportation every three years if the circumstances that they fled in their homelands improve  Labor would give refugees permanent visas so that they have the certainty to plan their lives Climate change policy is a political battlefield in a country that is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas and has been one of the world s worst greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis because of its heavily reliance on coal fired power generation Disagreement over energy policy has been a factor in the last six changes of prime minister Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard introduced a carbon tax in 2012  Conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott scrapped it two years later The coalition is torn between lawmakers who want polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and those who reject any measures that would increase household power bills The government aims to reduce Australian greenhouse gas emissions by 26  to 28  below 2005 levels by 2030 Labor has promised a more ambitious target of a 45  reduction in the same time frame Action on climate change was a major priority for votes when conservative Prime Minister John Howard s reign ended after more than 11 years at an election in 2007 Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd immediately signed up to the U N  s 1997 Kyoto Protocol on reducing emissions  Australia and the United States had been the only industrialized countries to hold out Climate change dropped down the list of Australian priorities after the global financial crisis hit But after Australians sweltered through a record hot summer and grappled with devastating drought  global warming has become a high priority issue for voters again The government warns that Labor s emissions reduction plan would wreck the economy The coalition also argues that Labor would further damage the economy with its policy of reducing tax breaks for landlords as real estate prices fall in Australia s largest cities  Sydney and Melbourne Morrison boasts that the conservative administration Prime Minister Howard led delivered 10 annual surplus budgets and paid off all federal government debt before the government changed at the 2007 election Rudd had planned a budget surplus in his government s first fiscal year  but the global financial crisis struck Many economists congratulate Rudd for keeping the Australian economy out of recession through stimulus spending  The coalition has accused Labor of spending too much and sinking Australia too deep in debt But debt has continued to mount since the conservatives regained the reins in 2013  But opinion polls suggest voters consider the conservatives to be better economic managers The government brought forward its annual budget blueprint by a month to April 2 and revealed a plan to balance Australia s books in the next fiscal year for the first time in 12 years Labor also promised to deliver a surplus budget in the year starting July 1  but it has yet to detail how it will achieve this goal Labor has also promised to spend an additional AU 2 3 billion   1 6 billion  over four years on covering treatment costs of cancer patients  It s an attractive offer with half Australia s population expected to be diagnosed with some form of the disease in their lifetimes The conservatives have largely taken credit for Australia s remarkable run of 28 years of economic growth since its last recession under Labor s rule Morrison hopes that voters will look to him to deliver a sequel to the Howard years when a mining boom delivered ever increasing budget surpluses  

NEW DELHI   It is the biggest election in history Across India  from the Himalayan mountains to the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal  the first wave of millions of citizens started casting ballots Thursday in a five week long vote to choose a new Parliament  which will select a prime minister India is the world s largest democracy  the most populous nation after China  and a pivotal geopolitical power  And it has never before held an election of this magnitude  900 million eligible voters  at least 11 million poll workers  2 3 million electronic voting machines  2 000 political parties  and special trains  boats  helicopters and even elephants to transport voting equipment ImageChecking an electoral list in Alipurduar CreditRupak De Chowdhuri ReutersThe race is a referendum on Narendra Modi  the powerful prime minister who is up for re election  One of the most polarizing figures India has produced in decades  Mr  Modi has championed an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics that strives to elevate India s Hindu identity but has sharply divided this country Many Indians appreciate his intensity  which he constantly demonstrates in huge rallies where hundreds of thousands of people gather under the hot sun to hear him thunder about being India s watchman   his new campaign slogan   and how he is the best candidate to preside over this dizzyingly diverse nation of 1 3 billion On Thursday evening  the Election Commission of India said that the first phase of voting   which involved more than 140 million voters in 20 states and federal territories   had been free  fair and peaceful  and that in some places  turnout topped 80 percent But there were a number of complaints about malfunctioning voting machines  and opposition parties in a few areas said that security forces or poll workers had coerced people to vote for Mr  Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party Chaos erupted at one polling station in the state of Andhra Pradesh when supporters of rival parties attacked each other  At least one man was killed At the Merry Angels Public School just outside the capital  New Delhi  the vast majority of more than a dozen voters interviewed on Thursday morning said they had voted for Mr  Modi s party  I m not even that happy with Modi   said Vikas Kumar Sau  a rickshaw driver who complained about slum housing and police harassment   But everyone else was voting for him  so I thought I might as well too  The voters moved through long lines to have their identification cards checked and then stepped into cardboard voting booths  where they pushed a button on a long tablet that showed the candidates  names  photographs and party symbols  which varied from a flower and soccer ball to a pair of scissors  All this unfolded quietly  The loudest sound was the electronic ding after each vote was cast A large number of Indians believe that the Modi administration has been more effective  less corrupt and better at positioning India on the world stage than past governments But his party has also alienated minorities and created fear  Intellectuals blame the Hindu nationalist atmosphere stoked by Mr  Modi and the party for a rash of lynchings and other violence against Muslims and lower caste Indians The latest surveys predict that Mr  Modi  68  will return to power  But voter discontent over India s economic challenges  especially rising joblessness  is likely to reduce the number of parliamentary seats his party controls  That could hamper his ability to push the Hindu nationalist agenda further ImageMr  Modi during a campaign rally in Junagadh CreditAmit Dave ReutersIndia Election 2019  A Simple Guide to the World s Largest VoteHow does the election work  Will Modi win  What are the main issues facing India and its 900 million voters In the last election  in 2014  Mr  Modi s party stunned the country by winning an outright majority in the lower house of Parliament  which has 543 elected seats  By picking up even more seats through alliances with smaller parties  he then built a political juggernaut that went on to dominate Indian politics But this time around  few expect such a tidal wave  Though Mr  Modi remains popular among many in the middle class and across northern India s Hindu heartland  more poor Indians are turning against him Farmers in many states have organized protests  furious that Mr  Modi has not delivered on promises to strengthen crop prices  In urban areas  anti Modi feelings are building as well  Rising inflation and unemployment have become liabilities for him India s economy is still growing at a fast rate  around 7 percent a year  Technology companies are popping up across the landscape  passenger jets are almost always packed  and more Indian students are attending the world s best universities  India now is the sixth largest economy  powered by its sheer scale But many gains have been captured by a tiny elite  Poverty lurks in every corner of this country  from New Delhi s busiest intersections to the sharecropper cotton farms across central India This leaves the leading opposition party  the center left Indian National Congress  an opportunity to capture more seats than in the last election  which it lost badly  But most polling data suggests Congress will be a distant second to Mr  Modi s  with slim prospects of forming the next government Several voters at the polling station outside New Delhi grumbled that Congress hadn t done much for India in all its years in power  A few said they voted for neither Congress nor the B J P  but for  the elephant   the symbol of the Bahujan Samaj Party  a party formed by members of lower castes The biggest criticism of Congress  which won India freedom from Britain and ruled for most of India s independent history  is that it has failed to articulate a clear vision  The party historically has championed minority rights  Its socialist policies have helped improve education and empower lower castes But as Mr  Modi s party has pulled India rightward  the Congress party has struggled to respond Rasheed Kidwai  author of several books on the Congress party  said it lacked  that kind of hunger for power that the B J P  has  The party also cannot shake its reputation as a family dynasty  embodied by its leader  Rahul Gandhi ImageCarrying equipment to a remote polling station in West Bengal CreditRupak De Chowdhuri ReutersMr  Gandhi s father was prime minister  So were his grandmother and great grandfather But Mr  Gandhi  48  has never displayed his ancestors  zest for politics  He is known as affable  mild mannered  even a little shy  and if this race were purely a choice between him and Mr  Modi  opinion polls show he would be trounced But Indian politics are not personality pageants  The race for prime minister is actually 543 different parliamentary races  often driven by complex local issues and contested by a galaxy of parties that fight along geographic  religious and caste lines  Bribes are rampant  the election commission has already seized billions of rupees and millions of liters of liquor The election results will not be clear for a while  since the voting is conducted through mid May  Different places vote on different dates  and the electronic machines   and the poll workers   will move from site to site Only after the last votes have been cast will the election commission reveal the results  expected on May 23 ImageAn elections official at work in Majuli CreditAdnan Abidi Reuters 

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump had had it The flow of migrants at the southern border was surging  Another caravan appeared to be forming  And his government had run out of holding space  forcing the release of tens of thousands of families apprehended at the border During a meeting with senior aides on the last Thursday in March  Trump demanded drastic action to make good on the threat he d tweeted that morning  Shut the southern border  Curbing illegal immigration was his signature issue  he railed  Why couldn t he deliver Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen urged the president to reconsider  Her agency had already diverted hundreds of border agents away from certain crossings to process migrant families elsewhere  creating what would soon become considerable bottlenecks  Closing ports completely  she reasoned  would only encourage migrants to cross elsewhere   illegally Trump wasn t having it  Shut the ports at El Paso  Texas  at noon tomorrow  he ordered  End of meeting The directive set off a frantic behind the scenes push to get Trump to change his mind  and he ultimately relented  But the episode launched a turbulent 12 day stretch that would lead to the eventual resignation of Nielsen  the potential dismissal of much of her agency s top leadership and the beginning of a new phase in which immigration hard liners at the White House are determined to wield considerably more influence over Homeland Security This account is based on interviews with 20 administration officials  congressional aides and people familiar with the events  many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations    ON BORROWED TIMETrump and Nielsen s relationship was never especially close  Nielsen had been picked for the top Homeland Security job at the urging of her predecessor  John Kelly  who left to become Trump s White House chief of staff  Trump had always been suspicious of her  in part because she d worked for former President George W  Bush  She had been widely expected to leave the department last fall after Kelly s departure from the White House  but she appeared to get back on Trump s good side during the government shutdown  when she served as one of the top defenders of his push to build a southern border wall But Nielsen took the brunt of Trump s fury over rising border crossing numbers  and the situation was only getting worse  Aides spent months desperately trying to come up with new solutions  and some tried to steer Trump away from more drastic measures  including his talk of reinstating the family separation policy that prompted international outrage While Nielsen had doubts at times  she had dutifully carried out Trump s orders  taking ownership of his most divisive policies  including the family separations  and spending months trying to broker arrangements with Central American countries  including Mexico  But it also fell to Nielsen to explain to Trump the legal limits of things he wanted to do  And he didn t like it It didn t help that Kelly had been critical of Trump in appearances since he left the White House   something Trump held against Nielsen  Or that John Bolton  Trump s national security adviser  had been pushing for Nielsen s ouster since last fall  telling Trump he didn t think her leadership or policies were effective    A TRIP CUT SHORTNielsen had just landed in Europe last week for her first time as secretary when she decided to rush back to Washington  landing early Tuesday morning Though aides had succeeded in talking Trump down from his border closure threat the week before  he had continued to crank up his rhetoric  warning by tweet that if Mexico didn t  immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border   he would be  CLOSING  the border  or large sections of it within a week By Wednesday  Nielsen was at the border  overseeing efforts to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and preparing for the president s Friday visit to Calexico  California But the night before Trump s visit  a puzzling notice arrived on Capitol Hill  Trump was withdrawing his nomination of Ron Vitiello to permanently lead the U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency  It had to be a mistake  staffers reasoned  Why would Trump be spiking his own nominee  a well respected and longtime border official who appeared to be cruising to confirmation Vitiello got a call that night from senior Trump aide Stephen Miller informing him that he wouldn t be joining the president on his trip to the border the next morning  There was no explanation Nielsen had received no heads up But word began to spread that his nomination was being yanked  We want to go in a tougher direction  was all Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday morning It was Step One of the plot to purge DHS leadership Nielsen joined Trump at the border  echoing his words at a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement and standing by Trump s side as they toured a section of newly rebuilt border fencing  introducing him to local officials But inside she was fuming    DUSTING OFF A LETTERNielsen returned to Washington on a Coast Guard Gulfstream as Trump continued onto California and Nevada to do some fundraising  By that night  murmurs were swirling that Vitiello s removal wasn t a one off and that Miller was orchestrating a wholesale leadership overhaul of her department Already frustrated by what she saw as insufficient help from departments like Justice and Health and Human Services  with clear signs that White House hard liners were on the ascent  Nielsen pulled up the resignation letter she d written months before   just in case She went into a Sunday White House meeting with Trump that she d requested not sure if she d be fired  resign or stay to fight another day It was  by all accounts  a cordial conversation in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House residence  with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney in attendance  Nielsen had come prepared with a list of ideas to share with the president  But the two quickly agreed the arrangement was no longer working  Trump wanted to go in a different direction Nielsen resigned on the spot  Trump tweeted the news before she could get her letter out    THE PURGEStanding outside her home in Alexandria  Virginia  on Monday  Nielsen sounded just as loyal to Trump as she had at the border  I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis   she said  thanking the president  for the tremendous opportunity to serve this country  By the end of the day  the department she had led appeared to be on the cusp of being dismantled  with the head of U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services and the department s general counsel among those expected to be pushed out  It s time to do things a little differently   White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said on Fox News Channel   And so the president s looking around to reshape his team so he can have the people in place to carry out his agenda     Associated Press writer Zeke Miller

WASHINGTON   President Trump welcomed Egypt s president  Abdel Fattah el Sisi  to the White House on Tuesday  and bestowed on his ally what he most eagerly sought  a ringing endorsement of his strongman rule Mr  el Sisi  64  a former general who took power in a military coup in 2013  is seeking to amend the Egyptian Constitution to allow him to run for two more six year terms  which would keep him in power until 2034 When Mr  Trump was asked about the amendments  he professed not to know anything about them  but declared   I can just tell you he s doing a great job  Great president  Mr  el Sisi s visit came on the same day that another key ally of Mr  Trump s in the Middle East  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  was facing voters in a tight election  In the weeks leading up to that vote  the president tried to shore up Mr  Netanyahu s fortunes with a series of gestures  chief among them American recognition of Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights It also came as Mr  Trump called a third ally  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia  who has been under a cloud since reports that he ordered the killing in October of a Saudi dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi Mr  Trump and Prince Mohammed discussed Saudi Arabia s  critical role  in stabilizing the region  the campaign to isolate Iran and  the importance of human rights issues   according to a White House statement For Egypt s leader  Mr  Trump offered only the trappings of an Oval Office welcome  though one with flashing cameras and looming boom mics  Back home  where Mr  el Sisi has methodically stifled dissent and tightened his grip on power  that could prove more than enough validation  The single and only reason for President Sisi to visit the White House right now is to obtain a strong endorsement from President Trump to stay in power   said Amy Hawthorne  the deputy director of research at the Project on Middle East Democracy   He has calculated that he can intimidate his opponents and potential opponents with a show of support from Trump  Before their session  Mr  Trump said the two men would discuss trade and counterterrorism  He said nothing publicly about Egypt s human rights record  which was always checkered but has deteriorated under Mr  el Sisi  who has brutally suppressed the Muslim Brotherhood and turned Egypt into a society in which a person can be arrested over an objectionable Facebook post  Mr  Trump s daughter Ivanka also met with Mr  el Sisi to discuss the empowerment of women Mr  Trump said nothing about several Americans currently detained in Egypt  Earlier in the day  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the issue with Mr  el Sisi  according to the State Department For his part  Mr  el Sisi said relations between Egypt and the United States had never been stronger   All the credit goes to you  Mr  President   he said through a translator   Thank you very much for your support on all fronts  In fact  some analysts said  the United States alliance with Egypt is at an awkward moment  Mr  Trump has focused most of his energy in the region on assembling an Israeli and Persian Gulf alliance against Iran ImageProtests near the White House on Tuesday over Mr  el Sisi s visit  In Egypt  Mr  el Sisi has methodically stifled dissent and tightened his grip on power CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times When you think of Trump s agenda in the Middle East  Egypt doesn t offer that much   said Brian Katulis  an expert on Egypt and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress   What s interesting to me is that Trump   who is always asking  what s in it for us     is even doing this meeting  Moreover  Egypt  which still receives roughly  1 3 billion a year in American military aid  recently agreed to buy 20 fighter jets from Russia  potentially exposing individual Egyptians to American sanctions Mr  Trump s decision on the Golan Heights rankled Egyptian officials  as did his earlier order to move the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  Both moves run counter to the spirit of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel  brokered 40 years ago by President Jimmy Carter They could also make it harder for Mr  el Sisi to voice wholehearted public support for the Israeli Palestinian peace plan being drafted by Mr  Trump s son in law and senior adviser  Jared Kushner The administration has said it would present the plan sometime after the Israeli elections  but the White House  like the Israeli public  will have to await the results of Tuesday s vote to determine whether Mr  Netanyahu or his opponent Benny Gantz  are able to form a governing coalition There is less suspense in Egyptian politics these days  Analysts said Mr  el Sisi s constitutional amendments  which also include a provision that would expand the military s role  have drawn no public enthusiasm  But the electoral system is set up so that they can prevail with a simple majority even if voter turnout is low To coincide with Mr  Sisi s visit  his critics began an online petition on Tuesday to oppose the amendments  The website was quickly blocked inside Egypt  the government has previously blocked several other independent or critical websites or online publications But the petition remained accessible outside Egypt and the website counter indicated that more than 67 000 people had endorsed it   a number that could not be confirmed  Egypt has permitted almost no public criticism of the proposals or organizing against them  but street signs urging a  yes  vote are common in Cairo  These amendments were cooked up inside the regime   Ms  Hawthorne said   They ve had only Potemkin debates about them  President Barack Obama kept Mr  el Sisi at a distance  But it was his second White House invitation from Mr  Trump  who has obviously established a rapport with him  At a meeting in Saudi Arabia in May 2017  the two lavished praise on each other  with Mr  Trump even declaring   Love your shoes  Boy  those shoes  Some of Mr  Trump s affection may be explained by his general affinity for strongmen  At a recent speech to Republican supporters  the president recalled an exchange he claimed to have had with President Xi Jinping of China  who  like Mr  el Sisi  pushed for an extension of his term Mr  Trump said he referred to Mr  Xi as a king  which prompted the Chinese leader to demur that he was only a president  I said  No  you re president for life  and therefore you re king    Mr  Trump said he replied If Mr  el Sisi succeeds in his drive to extend his term  he would serve as Egypt s president until the age of 80   unless he changes the Constitution again

COLUMBIA  S C    Ernest F   Fritz  Hollings  the silver haired Democrat who helped shepherd South Carolina through desegregation as governor and went on to serve six terms in the U S  Senate  has died  He was 97 Family spokesman Andy Brack  who also served at times for Hollings as spokesman during his Senate career  said Hollings died early Saturday at his home on the Isle of Palms Hollings  whose long and colorful political career included an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination  retired from the Senate in 2005  one of the last of the larger than life Democrats who once dominated politics in the South He had served 38 years and two months  making him the eighth longest serving senator in U S  history Nevertheless  Hollings remained the junior senator from South Carolina for most of his term  The senior senator was Strom Thurmond  first elected in 1954  He retired in January 2003 at age 100 as the longest serving senator in history In his final Senate speech in 2004  Hollings lamented that lawmakers came to spend much of their time raising money for the next election  calling money  the main culprit  the cancer on the body politic   We don t have time for each other  we don t have time for constituents except for the givers      We re in real  real trouble  Hollings was a sharp tongued orator whose rhetorical flourishes in the deep accent of his home state enlivened many a Washington debate  but his influence in Washington never reached the levels he hoped He sometimes blamed that failure on his background  rising to power as he did in the South in the 1950s as the region bubbled with anger over segregation However  South Carolina largely avoided the racial violence that afflicted some other Deep South states during the turbulent 1960s Hollings campaigned against desegregation when running for governor in 1958  He built a national reputation as a moderate when  in his farewell address as governor  he pleaded with the legislature to peacefully accept integration of public schools and the admission of the first black student to Clemson University  This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina s choice  a government of laws rather than a government of men   he told lawmakers  Shortly afterward  Clemson was peacefully integrated In his 2008 autobiography   Making Government Work   Hollings wrote that in the 1950s  no issue dominated South Carolina more than race  and that he worked for a balanced approach  I was  Mister In Between  The governor had to appear to be in charge  yet the realities were not on his side   he wrote   I returned to my basic precept     the safety of the people is the supreme law  I was determined to keep the peace and avoid bloodshed  In the Senate  Hollings gained a reputation as a skilled insider with keen intellectual powers  He chaired the Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee and held seats on the Appropriations and Budget committees But his sharp tongue and sharper wit sometimes got him in trouble  He once called Sen  Howard Metzenbaum  D Ohio  the  senator from the B nai B rith  and in 1983 referred to the presidential campaign supporters of former Sen  Alan Cranston  D California  as  wetbacks  Hollings began his quest for the presidency in April 1983 but dropped out the following March after dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire Early in his Senate career  he built a record as a hawk and lobbied hard for military dollars for South Carolina  one of the poorest states in the union Hollings originally supported American involvement in Vietnam  but his views changed over the years as it became clear there would be no American victory Hollings  who made three trips to the war zone  said he learned a lesson there  It s a mistake to try to build and destroy a nation at the same time   he wrote in his autobiography  warning that America is now  repeating the same wrongheaded strategy in Iraq  Despite his changed views  Hollings remained a strong supporter of national defense which he saw as the main business of government In 1969 he drew national attention when he exposed hunger in his own state by touring several cities  helping lay the groundwork for the Women  Infants and Children  or WIC  feeding program A year later  his views drew wider currency with the publication of his first book  The Case Against Hunger  In 1982  Hollings proposed an across the board federal spending freeze to cut the deficit  a proposal that was a cornerstone of his failed presidential bid He helped create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and write the National Coastal Zone Management Act  Hollings also attached his name to the Gramm Rudman bill aimed at balancing the federal budget Hollings angered many of his constituents in 1991 when he opposed the congressional resolution authorizing President George Bush to use force against Iraq In his later years  port security was one of his main concerns As he prepared to leave office  he told The Associated Press   People ask you your legacy or your most embarrassing moment  I never  ever lived that way      I m not trying to get remembered  He kept busy after the Senate helping the Medical University of South Carolina raise money for the cancer center which bears his name and lecturing at the new Charleston School of Law Hollings  one political defeat came in 1962 when he lost in a primary to Sen  Olin Johnston  After Johnston died  Hollings won a special election in 1966 and went to the Senate at age 44  winning the first of his six full terms two years later Ernest Frederick Hollings was born in Charleston  South Carolina  on Jan  1  1922  His father was a paper products dealer but the family business went broke during the Depression Hollings graduated from The Citadel  the state s military college in Charleston  in 1942  He immediately entered the Army and was decorated for his service during World War II  Back home  he earned a law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1947 The next year  he was elected to the state House at age 26  He was elected lieutenant governor six years later and governor in 1958 at age 36 As governor  he actively lured business  helped balance the budget for the first time since Reconstruction and improved public education Funeral arrangements were not immediately available  He had four children with his first wife  the late Patricia Salley Hollings  He is survived by three of his four children  His second wife   Peatsy   died in 2012    Former Associated Press Writer Bruce Smith contributed to this story    This story corrects the final paragraph  Hollings is survived by three children  His fourth child is deceased  Links additional photos
