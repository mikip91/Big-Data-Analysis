HARRISBURG  Pa    Pittsburgh s suburbs  perhaps the most politically poked and prodded territory in Pennsylvania recently  are under the microscope again in a state legislative election that some see as an early test of President Donald Trump s strength in a critical battleground ahead of 2020 The open state Senate seat is in a territory historically influenced by Republican enclaves outside the Steel City but also viewed as increasingly friendly to Democrats  even as the area s more rural coal regions have swung to Republicans Tuesday s special election pits Republican D  Raja against Democrat Pam Iovino for a seat largely controlled by Republicans the past 50 years Raja is the chairman and chief executive of an information technology consulting firm he helped start after he immigrated from India  Iovino is a Navy veteran who served as an assistant secretary of the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs The district is politically divided  Democrats have a registration edge  even though Trump won it in 2016 when he became the first Republican since 1988 to capture Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes To a great extent  the campaign has focused on the usual grist of Pennsylvania s elections  the state s booming natural gas industry  abortion rights  gun rights  jobs and the minimum wage Then there s the TV attack ad by Raja that tries to link Iovino to the Green New Deal  a wide ranging plan to combat climate change supported by several Democratic members of Congress The ad says Iovino has  teamed up with extremists who want to stop our growth with billions in new energy taxes  and fans out photos of prominent Democrats  including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California  Vermont Sen  Bernie Sanders and New York Rep  Alexandria Ocasio Cortez In the campaign s final hours Monday  the state Republican Party issued a robocall from Donald Trump Jr   urging listeners to vote for Raja and saying  the Make America Great Again agenda cannot afford to have Pam Iovino win this race and implement her liberal and extreme agenda in Pennsylvania  Republican strategists hope to see extra energy from their party s base amid a backlash to the Green New Deal and what a Raja campaign strategist called special counsel Robert Mueller s  overreach   The things that motivate Republicans tend to be national issues   said Ray Zaborney  the strategist Iovino s campaign said she has no position on the Green New Deal and has not spoken in support of it  and an Iovino campaign strategist said Republicans have run a  fact free  campaign  They re trying to nationalize Pam because there is no dirt on her   said the strategist  David Marshall In recent days  both state parties sent mailers linking Raja to Trump  The Democrats  mailer quotes Raja s praise of Trump s election victory and tax law  and says   Pennsylvania can t afford a state senator who thinks that Donald Trump is  a great first step   Alternately  the Republican mailer shows a photo of a smiling Trump and the message   a vote for Raja is a vote for President Trump s agenda  Even though it could be a bellwether  the race itself has attracted little media coverage or campaign spending from outside the state  An Iovino victory will still leave Republicans with what s expected to be a six seat state Senate majority in this session and strategists on both sides expect turnout to be around 20 percent  or about 42 000 voters Still  it is territory successfully cultivated last year by Democrat Conor Lamb in his two victories in two different Republican held congressional districts  one in a special election and one in the general election after the state s high court redrew U S  House district boundaries Until the recent fliers  Trump had figured little into the special election attacks and counterattacks  The president won the district by 6 percentage points in 2016 However  his margin of victory pales next to the double digit percentage point margins of victory there in 2018 by Democratic Gov  Tom Wolf and Democratic U S  Sen  Bob Casey  as well as by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012  

ISTANBUL   Turkey s opposition looked poised to win control of the country s two biggest cities Monday as it dealt President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s conservative party one of its most serious electoral setbacks in years  The opposition won Ankara  a ruling party stronghold for decades  and was leading a tight race for mayor in Istanbul  according to unofficial figures Monday The leader who has dominated Turkish politics for 16 years declared victory despite the opposition gains Sunday s local elections were widely seen as a gauge of support for Erdogan as the nation of 81 million faces a daunting economic recession  They were also a first test for Erdogan   who has been accused of increasingly authoritarian tendencies   since he got widely expanded presidential powers last year If confirmed  the swings in Ankara and Istanbul could be excruciating for the politician who campaigned hard to retain hold of them  The opposition also retained its hold over Izmir  Turkey s third largest city Although Erdogan was not running for office Sunday  he became the face of the campaign  rallying tirelessly for months across Turkey  using hostile rhetoric against opposition parties and portraying the vote as a matter of national survival The decline in urban support for his conservative  religious based party came despite the fact that Erdogan wields tight control over the media  which hardly covered the opposition candidates  campaigns Behlul Ozkan  an associate professor at Marmara University  said Erdogan s loss of ground in Ankara and Istanbul indicated that his socially conservative and construction driven policies no longer resonated in Turkey s cities  Political Islam s quarter century old hegemony in Turkey s two largest cities is over   he said   The basic problem is that Erdogan is not able to get votes from middle income earners  who believe that the economy  education and urban administration are not run well  More than 57 million voters were eligible to choose leaders for 30 major cities  51 provincial capitals and 922 districts in Turkey  as well as thousands of local positions  The election was marred by sporadic violence  with five dead and scores injured across Turkey Erdogan s party and its nationalist allies garnered some 52  of the vote overall but the opposition made momentous inroads A strategic decision by a pro Kurdish party to sit out critical races in major cities contributed to the opposition s gains  The opposition also increased its support along the Mediterranean  taking the city of Adana from the nationalists and the resort destination of Antalya from the ruling party Erdogan acknowledged setbacks in a speech to his supporters  saying his party would work to understand what had gone wrong and fix the problem Unofficial results reported by the state run Anadolu news agency after all votes were counted showed a razor thin win for the opposition in the race for mayor of Istanbul  Turkey s largest

winning the top post in Ankara with 50 9  support  The AKP still holds a majority of Ankara s 25 districts  The government had accused Yavas of forgery and tax evasion  which he called slanderous The AKP s candidate for Ankara mayor  Mehmet Ozhaseki  won 47 1  support and his party said it would challenge the results Sunday s election was a significant victory for the opposition  which displayed good strategies and promising candidates  said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli  the Ankara director of the German Marshall Fund  This will certainly lead to an emerging new political landscape in Turkey   he said He argued  however  that a pause in elections until 2023 would benefit Erdogan  This gives the governing party and President Erdogan a window of opportunity to undertake economic reforms  political reforms if they wish  fix Turkey s relations with foreign countries   he said Andrew Dawson  head of the Council of Europe s election observation mission  said Monday his monitors were  not fully convinced that Turkey currently has the free and fair electoral environment which is necessary for genuinely democratic elections  In predominantly Kurdish provinces  the Peoples  Democratic Party  or HDP  won back some seats from government appointed trustees  including the symbolic capital of Diyarbakir  but lost several former strongholds to the ruling party The government has replaced

LONDON   With Britain s parliament deadlocked over the way forward on Brexit  speculation is growing that Prime Minister Theresa May could call a snap election to try and break the impasse Last week  after her Brexit deal was rejected by parliament for a third time  May s comment that she feared  we are reaching the limits of this process in this House   was seen by many as a hint she could be moving towards an election The Sunday Times reported her media chief  Robbie Gibb  and her political aide Stephen Parkinson were pushing for an election But the deputy chair of her Conservatives  James Cleverly said on Sunday the party was not planning for an election  while justice minister David Gauke warned it would not solve the issue over the way forward on Brexit In 2017  May lost her party s majority in parliament in an election she did not need to call  It has since been reliant on the support of Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party  which has voted against her Brexit deal all three times  HOW CAN AN ELECTION BE CALLED Britain s next national election is not due to be held until 2022  but there are two ways an earlier vote can be called 1  Two thirds of parliament s 650 lawmakers would have to vote in favor of holding an election 2  If a motion of no confidence in the government is passed by a simple majority of lawmakers and no party can succeed in winning the confidence of the House of Commons over the next 14 days  an election is triggered Many of May s Conservatives oppose the idea of an election  If she cannot persuade enough of her party to support an election  May could be forced to back a no confidence vote in her own government in order to try to trigger one WHO WOULD LEAD THE CONSERVATIVES INTO AN ELECTION Last week  in a bid to win Conservative lawmakers over to her deal  May promised to step down before the next phase of Brexit negotiations if her deal was approved by parliament  She has previously said she would not contest the 2022 election May s deal was rejected for a third time on Friday  Even if she were to agree to go sooner  a Conservative leadership contest is likely to take weeks at a minimum  On Sunday  Conservative deputy chairman James Cleverly told Sky News it was  the inevitable possibility  that May could have to lead the party in a snap election if one were held WHAT WOULD THE CONSERVATIVES  POSITION BE ON BREXIT One of the biggest difficulties about an election would be the question of what the Conservative Party s election manifesto would say on Brexit  The party is deeply divided on the issue  Half of May s lawmakers voted in favor of a  no deal  Brexit when parliament voted on alternative Brexit options last week  while 34 supported seeking a customs union with the EU and eight backed a confirmatory public vote on any deal Many lawmakers are likely to be unhappy standing on a manifesto which pledged to implement May s deal  More than 100 Conservative lawmakers opposed the deal when it was first voted on in January  75 voted against it at the second try and 34 at the third attempt on Friday WHAT DO THE OPINION POLLS SAY A poll by Opinium published on Sunday put May s Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party level on 35 percentage points each  A separate poll by Deltapoll in the Mail on Sunday gave Labour 41 percent  a lead of five percentage points over the Conservatives  who were on 36 percent  HOW QUICKLY COULD AN ELECTION BE HELD Britain is due to leave the EU on April 12 unless it sets out an alternative way forward on Brexit  The government would need to seek a longer delay to the Article 50 negotiating period in order to hold a national election  It is likely the EU would agree to this  although it is not guaranteed  May has said any longer delay would mean Britain taking place in European Parliament elections According to a possible timetable set out by the Institute for Government  an election could be held as soon as mid late May  If is triggered by a no confidence vote  it would be slightly later due to the 14 day period   Reporting by Kylie MacLellan  editing by Guy Faulconbridge

TEL AVIV   When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to undermine his strongest election challenger  he pins a label on him that many Israelis see as an insult   Leftist  Israel was founded by the left  which dominated politics in the early years of the state  In 1992 it took 61 of the 120 seats in the Knesset  or parliament  Nearly 30 years on  the left is forecast to take only around 25 seats in an election on Tuesday The left has been reeling after a series of setbacks   the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995  the failure of his 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords to deliver peace with the Palestinians  many rounds of failed negotiations and years of bloodshed that have made both sides bitter and mistrustful  Now  only 12 percent of Jewish Israelis identify themselves as left wing  according to the Israel Democracy Institute  It was around double that a decade and a half ago  Fifty six percent now describe themselves as right wing  up from 40 percent over the same period  and the amount who say they are centrists is little changed at 26 5 percent With Netanyahu in power for the past decade and months away from becoming Israel s longest serving leader if he is re elected  the right is on the ascendant The only candidate with a chance of beating Netanyahu is not a leftist  Benny Gantz  a former general and political novice  belongs to a new party that is running on a centrist platform  Seeking to win over right leaning voters  Gantz  59  has highlighted his military credentials and is a pragmatist  Gantz was head of the Israeli military during the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and the militant Islamist group Hamas in which 2 100 Palestinians were killed  against an Israeli death toll of 67 soldiers and six civilians Gantz embraces that legacy  running a television ad which highlighted the number of Palestinian militants killed on his watch Careful not to alienate centrist voters  Gantz also chooses his words carefully on the issue that more than any other divides Israel s left and right   a  two state solution  for the Israeli Palestinian conflict Gantz nods to the left by saying Israel should pursue peace and end its dominion over the Palestinians but stops short of endorsing Palestinian statehood Most polls show Gantz s centrist Blue and White party leading Netanyahu s right wing Likud in a straight race  But they also show a Netanyahu led alliance of all the right wing parties is more likely to secure a majority  TRAITORS    Netanyahu has cast Gantz as a weak leftist who will endanger Israel s security by giving territorial concessions to the Palestinians  which is anathema to the right This is Netanyahu s standard play book  say his opponents  The word  left  is a tool to delegitimize everyone or anyone who s against Netanyahu   said Labour lawmaker Merav Michaeli    Left  has become like a curse  so it s not surprising that so many people are trying to avoid it        If there is really deep damage our prime minister has done to society  it s making the left wingers traitors   said Labour supporter Liat Arbel   We are as  much a  part of Israel as right wingers      In the build up to the election  Netanyahu struck an alliance with anti Arab and far right politicians  some of whom seek to annex the Israeli occupied West Bank Foremost among Netanyahu s critics for veering further right is the last left winger to beat him in an election  Ehud Barak Like Gantz  Barak is a former military man  Now retired from politics  Barak  77  says the far right has become the driving force in Israeli politics   like the tail wagging the dog   The left  he says  has lost steam  The left used to have a vision for Israel   a modern  Zionist  enlightened society on the cutting edge of the

it s a burning vision   so it motivates them  Historian Gadi Taub  of Hebrew University s School of Public Policy  describes himself as a former leftist He says the left has become elitist  over critical of their own society  and out of touch with mainstream Israelis  who are deeply skeptical about prospects for peace with Palestinians   The Israeli public is pragmatic  It drew its conclusions from the failure of the left s vision and it changed direction   said Taub NO PEACEFor many Israelis  Barak played a big role in the left s decline  In 2000  he and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat failed to agree a peace accord  From that day onwards the Israeli public believed that there was no partner  that  they  don t want peace   said Angela Godfrey Goldstein  a veteran Israeli peace activist   Israelis hunkered down  The outbreak of a Palestinian intifada  or uprising  a few months later drove the sides even further apart  Palestinians carried out shootings and

ISTANBUL ANKARA   President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party has submitted objections to local election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara  party officials said on Tuesday  after results showed the opposition earned narrow victories in both cities The AK Party is on track to lose control of what are Turkey s two biggest cities  its commercial hub of Istanbul and the capital Ankara  in a surprise election setback that may complicate Erdogan s plans to combat recession In Istanbul  the mayoral candidate of the main opposition Republican People s Party  CHP   Ekrem Imamoglu  and his AKP rival  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  both said on Monday Imamoglu was around 25 000 votes ahead  Istanbul has an estimated total population of 15 million The AKP had previously said it would use its right to object to the results where there were voting irregularities  adding that the errors at the ballots had affected the outcome On Tuesday  Bayram Senocak  the AKP s Istanbul head said that objections had been submitted by the 3 p m   1200 GMT  deadline for appeals  and added that legal action would be taken against electoral officials who made the errors  We have submitted all our appeals to the district electoral councils   Senocak said  as he waved ballot records in which he said vote count irregularities could be seen An AKP deputy chairman later said the difference between Imamoglu and Yildirim was down to 20 509 votes and would keep falling as a result of their appeals  He said the elections were  the biggest blemish in Turkish democratic history  The CHP s Istanbul head Canan Kaftancioglu said her party submitted objections in 22 districts  adding they expected to receive 4 960 more votes after the appeals were resolved  They are trying to steal the will of the people as it was reflected in the ballots   she told reporters in Istanbul The CHP s Imamoglu said on Tuesday he was saddened by the AKP failure to congratulate him after the election board count put him ahead  I m watching Mr Binali Yildirim with regret  You were a minister of this nation  the parliament speaker and a prime minister   Imamoglu said in Istanbul   What could be more noble than congratulating   The world is watching us with shame right now  We are ready to manage the big city of Istanbul  Let go and congratulate us with honor  so we can do our job   he said  MOMENT OF BEGINNING Ahead of the elections  the CHP had formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival that of the AKP and their nationalist MHP partners  The alliances nominated joint candidates in certain cities  including Ankara and Istanbul Imamoglu  who laid a wreath at the mausoleum of modern Turkey s founder  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk  in Ankara  later went to CHP headquarters to meet Mansur Yavas  the opposition s candidate in the capital  Speaking at the CHP building  Imamoglu said the elections marked a  moment of beginning  for Turkey In Ankara  Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes  ahead of his AKP rival and former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki in Sunday s local elections by nearly 4 percentage points  The AKP said it had also submitted objections to results across Ankara Defeats in Ankara and Istanbul would be a significant setback for Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics for more than 16 years  He had campaigned relentlessly ahead of the vote  describing it as a  matter of survival  for the country Erdogan s political success has rested on years of stellar economic growth in Turkey  but an economic recession that has brought surging inflation and unemployment and a plunging lira currency have taken their toll on his popularity Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to pressure on the lira  which weakened sharply last week as a lack of confidence in the currency among Turks led them to snap up record holdings of dollars and gold On Tuesday the lira weakened more than 2 percent against the dollar on concerns about tensions with the United States after it halted delivery to Turkey of equipment related to the F 35 fighter aircraft   Reporting by Ezgi Erkoyun and by Tuvan Gumrukcu  Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay  Writing by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Daren Butler  Editing by Dominic Evans  Gareth Jones  William Maclean

JERUSALEM   Frustrated over their choices in the Israeli election  and at Arab politicians whom they describe as ineffective  some Palestinian citizens of Israel have been gathering popular support for a boycott of Tuesday s ballot But a well known Palestinian hip hop artist released a powerful new video on Thursday pushing back on the boycott  urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes   and expressing hope that a strong turnout on Tuesday could help send Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu packing  or even  to prison  Tamer Must Vote    <U+062A><U+0627><U+0645><U+0631>

Arabic language video  which spread widely on social media and has sparked a robust online debate  the rapper  Tamer Nafar of Lod  Israel  argues with himself over whether to vote or stay home  then comes down strongly in favor of voting   dramatizing what Mr  Nafar said had been his own internal dialogue over the past few weeks  It s our land  but their state   the voice of the pro boycott Mr  Nafar says in the video  which is titled  Tamer Must Vote  in English  adding of the Israeli Parliament   The Knesset s not for me  ImageIsraeli border police officers standing guard next to posters depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditOded Balilty Associated PressBut the Mr  Nafar who favors voting retorts that even the shekel is Israeli  What then   throw away our money  and drop out of the economy  since the taxes paid by Arab citizens fund the army   Plant tea leaves at home so we won t fund missiles on Gaza   They re using us to look liberal   the pro boycotter says  echoing a frequent argument of Palestinian citizens who say that participating in Israeli democracy provides a veneer of equality in Western eyes  Yeah  baby  democracy is so  80s   the pro voter says sarcastically His vote wouldn t change anything  the pro boycotter responds  It s like stepping  into a missile war when all I got is a knife   or fighting a tank  when all I got is a stone  The pro voter hits back by acknowledging  it doesn t mean that we ll liberate Palestine   but says  dropping the mic  that  if our vote will erase Lieberman  imprison Bibi  then we re ready   referring to the former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman Indeed  one of the richest ironies that could emerge from Tuesday s election would be if strong Arab turnout raised the minimum vote threshold for political parties to gain entry into Parliament so high that Mr  Lieberman failed to clear it  His party  Yisrael Beiteinu  is struggling in the polls  Read about how Prime Minister Netanyahu s anti Arab provocations may backfire this time around  though they may have helped him in the past  It was Mr  Lieberman who pushed a change in the election law that raised the voting percentage threshold in 2015  as a way of banning Arab parties from the Knesset  The Arab parties responded at the time by joining forces  and their Joint List won a record 13 seats in the Knesset that year Some polls this year indicated turnout among Palestinian citizens would be even higher  given widespread anger at Mr  Netanyahu  who has been running an exceptionally anti Arab campaign  But the boycott movement is having the reverse effect  exasperating Arab leaders as well as many Jewish Israeli opponents of Mr  Netanyahu who hoped that Arab voters could play a decisive role in defeating him In an interview  Mr  Nafar said he was still hoping for such a result  which he said would be  poetic justice   Read our guide to the Israeli elections  He said that he was not enamored of Benny Gantz  the former army chief who is neck and neck with Mr  Netanyahu in the polls  but that Mr  Gantz would be preferable to Mr  Netanyahu  And although Mr  Netanyahu is facing indictment only on corruption charges  Mr  Nafar said   he would prefer it be for  war crimes     At least it s something   he added ImageBenny Gantz  leader of the Blue and White party  during an election campaign event in Ashkelon on Wednesday CreditAmir Cohen Reuters I guess I m watching too much  Game of Thrones    he said Mr  Nafar  39  began his hip hop career in the late 1990s  and his lyrics took a strong political turn with the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada  in 2000  The son of Palestinian refugees and a father of two  he was the star of a celebrated autobiographical film   Junction 48   in 2016  The Israeli culture minister  Miri Regev  walked out on his performance at the country s movie awards ceremony that year and has tried to have his performances canceled  I m not saying that being in the Knesset is the best medicine  but if I want to let go of it I should do that dose by dose   he said  explaining his decision to vote   not all at once  with nothing in its place In the video  Mr  Nafar s pro boycott persona has little use for Arab politicians   Did they deal with poverty  Did they bring us schools and jobs   he asks   We only see them out there during elections   He adds that he voted for the Joint List the last time  but infighting broke it apart   For me  this ship has sunk   he says Yet Mr  Nafar s pro vote voice says that rather than the Titanic  he sees Arab politicians as the Mavi Marmara   the protest ship that tried to defy the Israeli blockade of Gaza in 2010  gaining international attention for the Palestinian cause   It doesn t make sense for me to give up a tool  when I hardly have any tools  so I m going to vote   he says The alternative  Mr  Nafar said in the interview  would be to allow Israeli leaders to do whatever they wanted to Palestinian citizens   even if  as some extremist right wing politicians would like  that meant transferring Arab citizens out of Israel Voting  Mr  Nafar s alter ego says in the video  was at least one thing he has the power to do to ensure  that I can sing to the boycotters  rather than talk to them in the transfer trucks   

WASHINGTON   U S  Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to deter Russia from meddling in U S  elections by threatening stiff sanctions on its banking  energy and defense industries and sovereign debt The  Deter Act  is the latest effort by U S  lawmakers to increase pressure on Moscow over what they see as a range of bad behavior  from its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria s civil war to attempts to influence U S  elections The measure was introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen  a Democrat  and Marco Rubio  a Republican  They offered a similar measure last year  when it also had bipartisan support but was never brought up for a vote by the Senate s Republican leaders  who have close ties to President Donald Trump Trump has gone along with some previous congressional efforts to increase sanctions on Russia  although sometimes reluctantly  Backers of stronger action against Russia believe such measures will have better prospects in 2019  given control of the House of Representatives by Democrats  who are less reluctant than Trump s fellow Republicans to push back against the White House According to details of the legislation  first reported by Reuters  it would require the U S  Director of National Intelligence  DNI  to determine  within 30 days of any federal election  whether Russia or other foreign government or anyone acting as an agent of that government  had engaged in election interference If the DNI found such interference occurred  the act would require  among other things  that mandatory sanctions be imposed within 10 days on  among others  Russian banks and energy companies The act would mandate that sanctions be imposed on two or more of the following Russian banks  Sberbank  VTB Bank  Gazprombank  Vnesheconombank and Rosselkhozbank It also would order the prohibition of all transactions subject to U S  jurisdiction in Russian sovereign debt  Russian government bonds and the debt of any entity owned or controlled by Russia s government The sanctions would include blocking   freezing without seizing   any assets in the United States of those targeted for sanction  including senior Russian political figures and business leaders Russia denies trying to influence U S  elections  But U S  intelligence and law enforcement agencies have found that Moscow sought to intervene in the 2016 vote to boost Trump s chances of winning the White House An investigation by U S  Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not establish that members of Trump s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election  according to a summary released by U S  Attorney General William Barr last month The Deter Act is targeted at Russia but notes that U S  intelligence has identified China  Iran and North Korea as other major foreign government cyber threats  It also asks that Trump s administration present Congress with a strategy on preventing interference in U S  elections for each of those countries and other countries of significant concern The senators timed the bill s release to come after the end of Mueller s investigation  which has cast a shadow over the first two years of Trump s presidency  and just before an address to Congress by Jens Stoltenberg  secretary general of the NATO alliance  who has focused on the threat posed by Russia   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle  Editing by Peter Cooney and Bill Trott

OTTAWA   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s insistence that there is little wrong with how he is handling the worst crisis of his tenure is frustrating lawmakers and senior party figures who believe the approach could cost him re election this October Angry legislators are starting to push back against Trudeau and his team  opening up public divisions of the kind the ruling Liberals have not seen for almost 20 years Trudeau has been under pressure over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on then Justice Minister Jody Wilson Raybould last year to try to ensure SNC Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial by paying a fine instead  Wilson Raybould resigned on Feb  12 after being demoted within the Cabinet  and a second minister  Jane Philpott  subsequently quit over the way the matter had been handled The mood among senior advisers inside the prime minister s office has often been grim  according to two Liberals familiar with the matter  The frustration is certainly more palpable than it was a couple of weeks ago     it s not the happiest of places to spend much time   said one of the people  who like others cited in this story requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation  Despite a sea of unfavorable headlines as well as opinion polls showing the Liberals are on track to lose October s federal election  Trudeau s approach has been to wait it out  His support for keeping the two former Cabinet ministers in caucus   while indicating both could run again for the party in October   is also inexplicable to Liberal lawmakers who say it threatens party unity Both Wilson Raybould and Philpott say they are acting out of principle and that the scandal shows the Liberal Party needs to do better Many lawmakers are furious that Trudeau s team did not do more to shut down the affair soon after it erupted on Feb  7  In a sign of their anger  they look set to defy his wishes and expel at least Wilson Raybould from caucus at its next scheduled meeting on Wednesday   They have bungled this from the start  They should have issued an apology  promised to do better and moved on   said one of the party s most senior figures  Instead  Trudeau initially denied anyone in his office had inappropriately pressured Wilson Raybould  only to have her publicly testify to the contrary  She released more documents on Friday  ensuring the story was kept alive  Some legislators complain that Trudeau s tight knit team has kept them at a distance  that it can be hard to speak to the prime minister alone and that he has ignored people with experience  Trudeau  47  came to power in 2015 with a small cadre of longtime intimates serving as a brain trust  including Gerald Butts  his close friend and top political adviser  Butts resigned in February amid the scandal  Members of the Trudeau team are pushing back against the criticism  arguing they are doing the best they can   No one is claiming the outcome was handled well  but I m not sure it would have gone any better had we tried something else   said a third Liberal  conceding that  perhaps there can be some recalibration  on improving relations with legislators A government official  pressed on Trudeau s handling of the affair and criticism from Liberals  said the prime minister was  very proud of the team  and focusing on his agenda  PUT UP OR SHUT UP  Trudeau has made small shifts in strategy  such as reaching out more to his members of parliament and slightly broadening his circle of advisers  but otherwise insists on staying the course  He doesn t throw chairs against the wall or bang on tables  That s not his style   said the third Liberal   But he can be very stubborn  Once he s decided on something  that s it   Trudeau told reporters last week that his team was  stronger and more united than ever before   but the splits are clear for all to see  Liberal legislator Judy Sgro urged Wilson Raybould and Philpott to  either put up or shut up  and said they were being selfish  Ironically  Liberals say it was the Trudeau team s desire to prevent further outbreaks of intraparty hostility that helped exacerbate the current crisis  Unhappy Liberals complain Trudeau s closest advisers sidelined a raft of party veterans after the 2015 election who were associated with past infighting  They say that deprived Trudeau of the chance to consult people with previous experience of dealing with problems   It s almost like  we are not a continuation of the Liberal Party  we re new and different   And by doing that  there s no question they don t have the same group to circle the wagons and defend them that they once had   said a fourth Liberal  As well  Trudeau  a self avowed feminist who appointed a gender balanced Cabinet  recruited star candidates like Wilson Raybould and Philpott who veteran legislators complain had no experience of federal politics and therefore were unfamiliar with conventions on party loyalty and solidarity  While polls suggest an October election defeat  some insiders are less gloomy  That said  they concede the result could well be a minority government  which would leave the Liberals reliant on

CANBERRA   Australia s conservative government on Tuesday proposed tax cuts for low and middle income earners and record spending on health and education while promising the first budget surplus in more than a decade  shaping its pitch for votes in an imminent election Treasurer Josh Frydenberg offered A 158 billion  85 66 billion pounds  in tax cuts over the next decade primarily aimed at middle income earners  on top of tax cuts of A 144 billion last year  as the coalition government  which is trailing in opinion polls  tries to win over voters  An election must be held by mid May and could be called as soon as this week  The budget is back in the black  and Australia is back on track   Frydenberg told parliament in a budget speech on Tuesday evening  For the first time in 12 years  our nation is again paying its own way  Analysts long expected a spending plan designed to attract votes  It is the pre election budget to end all pre election budgets   it is extraordinarily generous   said Paul Williams  professor of political science at Griffith University There was muted reaction by the Australian dollar after the budget release  Earlier on Tuesday  it slid after the country s central bank held interest rates steady but still managed to sound dovish to some Standard   Poor s and Moody s left their top AAA ratings for Australia unchanged  S P said the country would achieve stronger fiscal outcomes than anticipated in the near term because of robust commodity prices and terms of trade  Moody s said strong employment growth supported the economy Frydenberg predicted a budget surplus of A 7 1 billion in the fiscal year ending June 2020  up from a December forecast of a A 4 1 billion surplus  as higher export receipts and tax revenues boost government coffers If achieved  it would be the first surplus since 2007 08  before the global financial crisis hit TAX REBATESThe projected surpluses increase to A 11 billion in 2020 21 and A 17 8 billion in 2021 22 before easing to A 9 2 billion in 2022 23  Offering potential swing voters an immediate dividend  the government said it will double the tax rebate for people earning between A 48 000 A 90 000 a year to A 1 080 in the current fiscal year Budget papers showed the cost of the tax cuts out to 2021 22 would be A 15 billion  Polls show the conservative Scott Morrison led government   consisting of the Liberal and rural focused National party   is headed for a resounding defeat against centre left Labour unless it can alter the current trajectory  Williams of Griffith University said the most the budget can do  is  stem the decline in support  The electorate has stopped listening   On Tuesday  Frydenberg also proposed changes in future years that would see income bands widened and tax rates reduced to deliver personal tax cuts The government would accelerate tax cuts for small businesses  it said  with the tax rate for businesses with turnover of less than A 50 million cut to 25 percent in 2021 22 The opposition Labour party said the budget would not address stagnant wage growth or tackle climate change Anaemic wages growth has been a hot political issue and is being used as an election platform for Labour and its supporters to campaign on The Australian Council of Trade Unions described wage growth forecasts in the budget  rising to 3 5 percent in 2021 22  as  fantasy  Strong inflows into government coffers meant Frydenberg could increase spending on healthcare  a strength of the opposition Labour party  to a record A 89 5 billion in 2022 23  That is up nearly 10 percent on expected spending in 2019 20 The government would spend A 100 billion on infrastructure over the next decade to reduce congestion and improve links between Australia s cities and regional towns  a lot of which has already been announced MORE RURAL ROADSSpending on rural infrastructure was forecast to rise by nearly 30 percent  with A 4 5 billion to go for building roads in rural areas  the major support base of the ruling coalition s junior partner The government also included an immediate one off rebate on energy costs to pensioners  another key voter demographic for the coalition  of A 75 for an individual or A 125 for couples And Frydenberg announced a A 3 5 billion package to reduce emissions to meet Australia s commitments under the Paris Accord  The government s environmental record is seen as one of its electoral weaknesses with urban voters  Frydenberg maintained a relatively optimistic outlook for the economy  though he conceded there were risks including from falling house prices and global ones such as Brexit  The government forecast full year economic growth of 2 25 percent in 2018 19  which would need activity to pick up in the January to June period as the economy grew 0 3 percent in the September quarter and 0 2 percent in the December quarter Growth in the A 1 9 trillion economy is seen picking up to 2 75 percent in 2019 20 and 2020 21 The tax cuts and increased spending  if enacted  could offer a boost to the economy  as consumer spending has been soft recently as falling home prices and high debt levels weigh on sentiment  Financial markets are fully pricing in a 25 basis points rate cut later this year  AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said there was some  fragility  around the budget assumptions  including downside risks to wage growth and consumer spending forecasts   It has provided stimulus but from what I can see it is not overwhelming   Oliver said  adding it was probably not enough to prevent Australia s central bank from cutting interest rates around mid 2019   Reporting by Colin Packham and Swati Pandey in CANBERRA  additional reporting by Tom Westbrook and Jonathan Barrett in SYDNEY  Editing by

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Monday he was willing to wait until after the 2020 presidential election to get Congress to vote on a new healthcare plan  giving Republicans time to develop a proposal to replace Obamacare Congressional Republicans have been unable thus far to draft a proposal to replace Democratic President Barack Obama s signature Affordable Care Act despite frequent vows to do so in recent years Trump s vow last week that the Republican Party will be  the party of healthcare  caught his fellow Republicans off guard after the Justice Department backed a lawsuit intended to wipe out Obamacare  which has helped millions of Americans get health insurance In a series of tweets on Monday night  Trump said Republicans are developing  a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums  cost    deductibles than Obamacare   In other words it will be far less expensive   much more usable than ObamaCare  Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House   he said Trump s move suggests he is willing to debate the future of the U S  healthcare system during the 2020 presidential election campaign rather than try to reach agreement on a plan sooner   Reporting By Steve Holland  editing by Darren Schuettler  

WASHINGTON   Democrats mocked President Donald Trump on Tuesday for pushing back his promise of sweeping healthcare reform until after the 2020 election  and said they were happy to make it a central campaign issue Trump had pledged in recent days to use court action to end Obamacare  the signature law of his Democratic predecessor  Barack Obama  and said his Republican Party would push over the next few months for a better healthcare plan at lower cost for most Americans But Republican leaders in Congress quickly shied away from the issue and pushed him to reconsider In a series of late night tweets on Monday  Trump did just that  saying there would be no vote on any healthcare legislation until after next year s election Democrats gleefully jumped on the delay  saying it showed Trump and his party had no idea what to do with healthcare beyond repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021  Translation  they have no healthcare plan   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said   They are for repeal  they have no replace  Mitch McConnell  the Republican Senate majority leader  said he told Trump on Monday the party was not about to restart work on comprehensive healthcare legislation  noting Republicans were unable to pass a plan when they controlled both chambers of Congress in the first two years of the Trump presidency  I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters  Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in November elections after campaigning heavily on strengthening Obamacare FIRST VOTETrump said on Tuesday he and Republicans would draw up a new healthcare plan ahead of the 2020 election and implement it soon afterward  I think we re going to have a great healthcare package     If we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency   which I hope are two good assumptions   we re going to have a phenomenal healthcare   Trump told reporters He said a Republican plan would mean most Americans pay lower premiums and deductibles for their healthcare than they currently pay under Obamacare  revisiting a promise he made during the 2016 campaign Trump told House Republicans in a speech on Tuesday night that they should campaign on a pledge to make healthcare the first vote in Congress after the 2020 election He said one of the major reasons Democrats won control of the House last year was because Republicans did not have a healthcare plan to put forward to voters  Republicans should not run away from healthcare  You can t do it  You re going to get clobbered   Trump said While Trump s delay gives Republicans more time to knit together an alternative to Obamacare  it all but guarantees a 2020 battle over the divisive issue  Don t let President Trump fool you  America  Republicans are not the party of healthcare  They are the party that wants to end your healthcare   Schumer said at a rally on Tuesday   We Democrats will not stop fighting tooth and nail to protect America s healthcare  today  tomorrow  and on in through 2021  Trump and his fellow Republicans vowed in the 2016 presidential election to  repeal and replace  Obamacare but failed to do so during their first two years in power  despite control of both the Senate and the House  Several of the leading candidates for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination  including a number of current U S  senators  have already made healthcare a major part of their campaign message Trump accuses Democrats of seeking  a socialist takeover of American healthcare   and is certain to take that argument onto the 2020 campaign trail   I see what the Democrats are doing  It s a disaster what they re planning and everyone knows it   he told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday   Reporting by Susan Heavey and Susan Cornwell  dditional reporting by Roberta Rampton  Editing by Susan Thomas  Bill Berkrot and Peter Cooney

WASHINGTON   Amid blowback from Capitol Hill  President Donald Trump switched gears again Wednesday  suggesting he never wanted Congress to vote to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election Trump s new tweets shifted his rationale for the  Obamacare  fight  First he said it was his choice to push off the health care votes  Then he said he never expected there to be any votes at all until after 2020 Trump claimed Wednesday he had never intended to reopen old wounds  But in keeping the issue at the forefront  the president put fresh attention on the GOP s long running and thus far unsuccessful effort to end ACA  I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me   the Republican Party   Trump tweeted  adding   I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election  That s not how congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader McConnell  understood Trump s sudden shift to the issue last week Nor did it stop Democrats from calling attention to the health care issue Wednesday The Democratic controlled House used a near party line 240 186 vote to condemn the Trump administration for joining a federal lawsuit aimed at annulling former President Barack Obama s health care law  Minutes later  the House Democrats  campaign organization launched digital ads in the districts of around 40 Democrats in competitive seats  saying they d  fought back  against GOP efforts to gut the statute s protections The GOP s bitter internal fight over health care in 2017 remains a sore subject for the president  He often retells the story of the late Arizona Sen  John McCain s  no  vote that killed the repeal and replace effort  Republicans  hit hard on health care issues during the 2018 midterm election  had no plans to take up the issue again before the next one Trump s fight was on display when he told Republican senators last week that his White House was developing a plan to replace the Obama health law  The sudden move stunned GOP leaders on Capitol Hill  While Trump wanted them to become  the party of health care   they feared it could be for all the wrong reasons if they were forced into a do over of the tough votes McConnell on Tuesday issued a rare public disclosure of his private counsel to the president  warning that another health care fight would be politically costly and doomed to fail now that Democrats control the House  The usually tight lipped leader said afterward that the president agreed to shelve his health care push until after the campaign  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters Tuesday Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week   backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  mindful that Republican unfulfilled promises to  repeal and replace  the Obama era law stand as a glaring failure of his administration  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   Trump said Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  After Trump said last week he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  McConnell faced a revolt from the ranks McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking    Associated Press writers Zeke Miller  Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram  Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar  Darlene Superville and Kevin Freking contributed to this report  

NEW DELHI   After a suicide bombing on Feb  14 in the disputed border region of Kashmir  India accused neighboring Pakistan of harboring the terrorists who it said had orchestrated the attack  The two countries quickly traded airstrikes Online  there was another battle One clip that circulated widely on Facebook and other services purported to show an aerial assault by India on an alleged terrorist camp in Pakistan  It was  in fact  taken from a video game  Photographs of dead bodies wrapped in white  supposedly of Pakistani militants killed in the attack  actually depicted victims of a 2015 heat wave  according to fact checkers  And local news outlets raced to post shreds of  exclusive  information about the hostilities  much of it downright false ImageFacebook executives said the flood of fake posts online after a February suicide bombing in Kashmir was extraordinary Facebook executives said the deluge was extraordinary   I ve never seen anything like this before   the scale of fake content circulating on one story   tweeted Trushar Barot  a former BBC journalist who leads the social network s anti disinformation efforts in India The flood of fake posts gave Facebook a taste of what is to come as India prepares for the world s biggest election  Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party are seeking another five years in power  and as many as 879 million people are expected to vote over five weeks starting on April 11 But as campaigning goes into high gear  Facebook is already struggling to cope with the disinformation and hate speech on its core social network and on WhatsApp  its popular messaging service On Monday  the company said it had removed hundreds of misleading pages and accounts associated with the B J P  and its main rival  the Indian National Congress  many of which were publishing false information  Facebook also removed more than 100 fake pages and accounts controlled by the Pakistani military India   where the company has 340 million users  more than in any other country   poses distinct challenges  Posts and videos in more than a dozen languages regularly flummox Facebook s automated screening software and its human moderators  both of which are built largely around English  Many problematic posts come directly from candidates  political parties and the media  And on WhatsApp  where messages are encrypted  the company has little visibility into what is being shared How WhatsApp Leads Mobs to Murder in IndiaFalse rumors of child kidnappers have gone viral on WhatsApp in India  prompting fearful mobs to kill two dozen innocent people since April India s elections present a unique set of issues  including a large number of languages and an extended time period for voting   said Katie Harbath  Facebook s public policy head for global elections  She said the company had been planning for the election for more than a year Other major social media platforms like Twitter and Google s YouTube are also grappling with false news and hate speech around India s elections  For the first time  the country s Election Commission has asked online services to police election related content from candidates and parties But the stakes are especially high for Facebook  which has been under scrutiny since the 2016 United States presidential election for distributing misinformation and for being misused by Russian agents to stir discord  While the company survived the 2018 American midterm elections relatively unscathed  it still found foreign influence networks attempting to use it to sway voters  And Facebook s services were plagued by misinformation in last year s Mexican and Brazilian elections India is one of Facebook s most important electoral tests this year  company officials said  along with major elections in places including the Philippines and Indonesia  Facebook s performance will be a prelude for how it navigates a likely onslaught of propaganda  false information and foreign meddling during the 2020 presidential election in the United States ImageFacebook participated in an educational event to raise awareness about false news and the spread of misinformation at a school in Lucknow  India  in 2018 CreditAbhishek Verma Agence France Presse   Getty Images The Indian elections in 2019 are an important test case for how they get 2020 right  and how they get elections right everywhere going forward   said Graham Brookie  director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council  a think tank working with Facebook to study disinformation campaigns India has been a laboratory for Facebook s election efforts since 2014  when the country last chose a Parliament  In that contest  Facebook worked closely with Mr  Modi s campaign to target ads and rally fans   part of a global effort to spread the use of the platform in politics  With Facebook s assistance  Mr  Modi became the world s No  2 most  liked  politician behind President Barack Obama  according to campaign officials After Mr  Modi s victory  Facebook advised him on how to use its service to govern  including getting government agencies and officials online  In 2015  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  hosted Mr  Modi for a televised chat at the company s Silicon Valley headquarters  Facebook held India up as a model for how governments could use the social network Facebook has since played down its connection to politicians around the world  including Mr  Modi  amid a rise in political misinformation  Ajit Mohan  a former Fox executive who became the social network s first India chief in January  said   We are absolutely not affiliated to any political party in India or anywhere else in the world  ImageAjit Mohan  a former Fox executive  was appointed Facebook s first chief of its India operations in January CreditVivek Singh for The New York TimesNow all the major Indian parties have sophisticated disinformation strategies  which include posting false and manipulated photos and videos and coordinating posts across a network of paid acolytes and volunteers  That has put Facebook  which has said it does not want to stifle free expression  in an awkward position For the past year  the company has relied on two independent organizations   first a local group called Boom and  more recently  the news agency Agence France Presse   to fact check a handful of posts in India every day  In February  Facebook added five more organizations to the stable and expanded the number of languages covered to seven  up from just English initially Facebook s algorithms flag potentially fake posts to the fact checkers  who decide which ones to investigate  After they publish their findings on Facebook  the company said  it reduces the visibility of false posts Yet some of Facebook s fact checkers may themselves be contributing to misinformation  Alt News  an Indian fact checking site unaffiliated with Facebook  recently found two of the social network s new partners   the large media houses India Today Group and Jagran Media Network   had repeatedly published false information related to the Kashmir attack Pratik Sinha  the founder of Alt News  said Facebook did not seem to view false news as a serious problem   The whole thing is a P R  effort   he said  Jency Jacob  the managing editor of Boom  said Facebook needed to do more  including making it easier for users to report misinformation ImageJency Jacob  managing editor of Boom  an Indian fact checking organization  said Facebook needed to do more to limit misinformation CreditAtul Loke for The New York TimesBalkrishna  who heads the fact checking effort at India Today  said that mistakes happened and that the company tried to correct them promptly  Pratyush Ranjan  a senior editor at Jagran New Media  the company s digital division  said its fact checking site  Vishvas News  operated separately and followed strict ethics guidelines  Facebook said it relied on the Poynter Institute  an American journalism organization  to certify its fact checkers and review their ethical standards A separate Facebook effort to assemble a broad coalition of Indian news organizations to combat false news during the election has been delayed amid funding problems and the departure of a key journalist who had worked on it The company has also tried to shed more light on political advertising on its site  posting weekly reports on top advertisers and how much they spent  Since Feb  21  when Facebook began tracking the data for India  spending has totaled about 103 million rupees  or about  1 5 million But the social network has not pushed for transparency on who is really paying for the ads  While the site s top three political advertisers in India were all associated with the B J P  s election efforts  none of them explicitly disclosed that affiliation to viewers India Election 2019  A Simple Guide to the World s Largest VoteHow does the election work  Will Modi win  What are the main issues facing India and its 900 million voters Facebook has also had difficulty dealing with hate speech  which is expected to intensify during the election For example  Raja Singh  a fiery right wing Hindu legislator in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad  refers to Muslims as  cow killers    an inflammatory phrase that has led to some deaths since the country s Hindu majority considers cows to be sacred  Although Facebook had removed some of Mr  Singh s posts for violating its hate speech rules  at least one threatening rant   in which he calls Muslims  dogs  and talks of cutting off their necks   remained on his official Facebook page for months Facebook removed the video  and then deleted Mr  Singh s Facebook page  after The New York Times inquired about it

BANGKOK   Thailand s military junta is targeting a popular new pro democracy party  accusing its leader of causing disorder that could lead to rebellion even as the seat allotments from last week s parliamentary elections are being calculated The billionaire leader of the Future Forward Party  Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  was ordered on Wednesday to submit to the police for questioning in the case  which initially opened four years ago  He is accused of helping protesters flee arrest at a demonstration and faces up to seven years in prison Mr  Thanathorn  who has built a large following partly through social media  posted the summons on Facebook and Twitter and wrote   When the dark power won t leave Future Forward alone   It s clear now that the old school political game won t end after the election  but is only getting more intense  because they re afraid of Future Forward   he added  The party came in third in the balloting last week The summons came Wednesday  a day after Thailand s Army chief  Gen  Apirat Kongsompong  warned that the military would not tolerate threats against the country s constitutional monarchy  in which the king is deemed head of state  Some considered his comments to be directed at Future Forward  The army does the army s duty  which is to protect  maintain  and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy   the general told reporters The interventions are the latest indications that the Thai junta is clinging to every advantage it can to gain an edge through the election  And the junta gave itself many of those advantages  as it put in place a new Constitution and electoral system after seizing power in a 2014 coup Those changes gave the generals sweeping influence over Parliament itself  and over an Election Commission with great power to bar candidates and target lawmakers for ejection ImageRepresentatives of the Pheu Thai and the Future Forward parties during a meeting after the election last month  The opposition coalition  including Pheu Thai and Future Forward  claimed on Wednesday that it would have a razor thin majority in the House CreditGemunu Amarasinghe Associated PressThe first electoral test for that new system came last week when Thailand finally held its long delayed parliamentary election  And though the results are not yet official  it is already clear that the regime s system is doing what it was designed to do  splintering the pro democracy opposition  and entrenching the junta s authority  Thailand is headed to a military guided  authoritarian system   said Purawich Watanasukh  a research fellow at the independent King Prajadhipok s Institute in Bangkok According to the Election Commission s preliminary results  the leading vote getter was the military backed party  Palang Pracharat  with about 24 percent  But that is less than half the popular vote received by the next three parties  which all campaigned for a return to democracy  In total  they received 51 percent of the vote  according to the early count  Palang Pracharat ran on the idea of maintaining stability and continuity and the others ran on the basis of restoring democracy   said Verapat Pariyawong  a visiting scholar at SOAS School of Law at the University of London   The majority of Thai voters went for the idea that we need to restore democracy  In parliament s lower house  the House of Representatives  the likely result will be a sharply divided body and a weak coalition government  The commission has until May 9 to announce the official results Calling itself the National Council for Peace and Order after it seized power  the junta drafted a new Constitution  the country s 20th  which was ratified in a 2016 referendum  For that vote  the junta blocked opponents from campaigning and barred election monitors Voters approved a separate measure allowing the military to appoint all 250 members of the Senate  who will join the 500 member lower house in selecting the next prime minister Critics contend that the entire system is rigged in the military s favor  That is partly through its influence over the powerful Election Commission  which came under fire for numerous irregularities during the balloting  delays in announcing the vote count  and an unexpected surge in the number of votes reported At one news conference  the commission s president  Ittiporn Boonpracong  told reporters that he could not work out the party list percentages because he did not have a calculator with him ImageDozens of protesters gathered in Bangkok on Sunday to protest the Election Commission s handling of the vote and what they termed cheating CreditLauren Decicca Getty ImagesAt another  the commission released 208 pages of election data and told reporters to figure out the seat allocations themselves Initial delays prompted the United States State Department to call for transparency  We stand with the Thai people in calling for the expeditious announcement of voting results and a fair and transparent investigation of any reported irregularities   a State Department spokesman  Robert Palladino  said last week More than 5 6 percent of the votes cast were invalidated  including some for not being marked properly  If they had gone to a single party  that party would have finished sixth over all Another 24 percent of the votes were spread among more than 70 other parties  fulfilling the military s goal of fragmenting the vote In the 2011 parliamentary election  more than three quarters of the vote went to two parties  Pheu Thai and the Democrat Party  which finished second and fourth in last week s election   An election held in 2014 was ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court  The military has another edge  as well  the timing of the coronation of a new monarch  King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun  expected May 4 to 6 That is only a few days before the election results become official  And the effect  in a country with strict laws against criticizing the monarchy  has been to make pro democracy leaders reluctant to stage any major protests before the coronation Dozens of protesters did gather on Sunday afternoon to protest the Election Commission s handling of the vote and what they termed cheating Still  the military may have to use even more tactics to fully secure a win Under complex rules that do not necessarily reward winning the most votes  Palang Pracharat will hold about 118 seats in the House while the opposition Pheu Thai Party is likely to get about 137  according to unofficial projections ImageCasting votes in Bangkok on election day  The Election Commission has until May 9 to announce the official results CreditWason Wanichakorn Associated PressThe opposition coalition  including Pheu Thai and Future Forward  claimed on Wednesday that it would have a razor thin majority in the House But under the country s new Constitution  and an accompanying body of law that followed it  the deck is stacked against them Since the next prime minister will be chosen by a combined vote of the House and the military appointed Senate  it is likely that the junta leader and current prime minister  Prayuth Chan ocha  will be named to head the new government And whatever the outcome of the vote  the Constitution gives the military the authority to shape Parliament s membership in the months and years ahead The Election Commission can seek to remove members for election misconduct and call new elections in those seats  in some circumstances barring the previous winner from running again  More than 180 such complaints have been filed  They have the whole year to disqualify people   said Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee  a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok   So the number can be changed the whole time  In addition  Mr  Verapat  the University of London visiting scholar  pointed out that the Constitution gives military appointed officials the power to remove members of Parliament any time for violating broad  ethical standards  The standards include adhering to democracy with the king as the head of state  pursuing the public interest over private interests and conducting oneself in an honest manner Government officials and courts will have wide discretion under the law to decide what violates the ethics standards  he said  Even if the so called democratic coalition was able to form a government   Mr  Verapat added   they would face a tough road ahead   

ISTANBUL   Even before the important election of Istanbul s mayor has been settled  the opposition candidate  who claims to have won  is challenging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by pressing ahead with his promise to have an independent audit of the city s books Mr  Erdogan and his party have been in control of the city since 2002  and analysts and opponents say they have warped the economy through kickbacks and crony schemes  There has not  however  been real proof of this Now  Mr  Erdogan s party is demanding a recount of the vote  The opposition candidate  Ekrem Imamoglu  says this is a delaying tactic  And  at a news briefing on Wednesday  he said the party was trying to erase town hall records from computers before he takes over and brings in independent auditors to examine the city s books His promise of an audit dramatically raises the stakes for Mr  Erdogan  who was confronted with a stunning electoral defeat Sunday night  when his Justice and Development Party  or AKP  was shown to be losing the contests for mayor in both Ankara and Istanbul At the Wednesday news briefing  Mr  Imamoglu said he had evidence that the Istanbul municipality had applied to a technical company for help in deleting data from its computers  In comments on Tuesday he had appealed to city workers to do the correct thing and not destroy government property  There are many issues   he said   When the day comes  once authorized  we will go there and we will start sharing them with the public  Mr  Imamoglu said he wanted the audit to examine not only the municipality s budget  but also private companies that serve as subsidiaries and partners to the municipality  This is the soft belly of AKP   Bahadir Ozgur  a business columnist  wrote Tuesday in the online newspaper Gazete Duvar The  AKP style municipal work  would end  he added  when independent auditors entered the town hall and  name by name expose how much money was transferred to whom  whose relative  brother  uncle won which bid  Mr  Erdogan s party has yet to cede to the opposition  and the High Election Council has yet to certify the results of Sunday s election  Opposition officials have said the legal process could take a week or more Mr  Imamoglu demanded a swift declaration of the results   We want justice   he said on Wednesday   We want our election certificate  ImageBillboards reading  Thank You Istanbul  had been put up on behalf of President Erdogan and his party  so confident were they of success in Sunday s mayoral vote  Current tallies show they lost CreditBulent Kilic Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesHe accused the AKP of playing for time and suggested the delaying tactics were partly to clean traces of their misdeeds  He promised new rules of transparency and international standards of accounting when he took over  This process here absolutely requires transparency   he told a news briefing on Monday   If you are going to govern Istanbul  which is a city of 16 million  you have to develop an exemplary model  and this is what I am aiming for  Mr  Imamoglu s opponent  former Prime Minister Binali Yidlirim  accused him Wednesday evening of trying to gain support abroad by stirring controversy   You do not have the right to tamper with the nerves of the nation   he said Mr  Erdogan had surprised many with the ferocity of his campaign in the local elections in Istanbul and Ankara  and some analysts have pointed to the importance of the big cities as a source of wealth for his network of family and friends Huge billboards of Mr  Erdogan and his candidate for Istanbul mayor  Binali Yildirim  thanking the public for their votes  have gone up around the city since Sunday night  a sign the party had been confident that their candidate would win  What makes the loss heavy is actually a secret known by everyone   Cigdem Toker  an investigative reporter with the fiercely opposition newspaper  Sozcu  wrote in a column on Wednesday She added that Istanbul and Ankara were important to Mr  Erdogan s party because  they are the centers of distributing financial resources   We are talking about tens of thousands of bids  public resources that can be identified with hundreds of billions  and the authority to spend them   wrote Ms  Toker  who is facing several court cases brought by Mr  Erdogan s government for her investigative reporting A new administration in Istanbul could end the flow of major city contracts for construction projects and city services that have been granted to favored businessmen A new administration could also end payments worth millions of dollars to endowments of charities and foundations run by the Erdogan family In January  Ms  Toker published details of payments made in 2018 by the Istanbul metropolitan municipality to foundations and charities run by Mr  Erdogan s children and their spouses Ms  Toker wrote that TUGVA  the Turkish Youth Foundation  received 74 million lira  or approximately  13 million by current exchange rates  that year from the municipality  Bilal Erdogan  Mr  Erdogan s younger son  sits on TUGVA s board ImagePresident Erdogan at a news conference in Istanbul on Sunday CreditMurad Sezer ReutersThe Archers Foundation  an archery sports club  received 16 million lira  or about  2 million  she reported  Bilal Erdogan sat on the board  she reported at the time  He has been widely known for his association with the foundation  although his name no longer appears on its website TURGEV  the Turkey Youth and Education Service Foundation  received 51 million lira  or about  9 million  she said  Esra Albayrak  Mr  Erdogan s daughter  is on its board The Turkey Technology Team Foundation  known as T3  where Mr  Erdogan s son in law Selcuk Bayraktar is head of the board  received 41 million lira or about  7 million  she also reported Her source for all of the payments was the 2018 Istanbul Municipality Report  which was not made public  underscoring Mr  Erdogan s sensitivity to the wider disclosure of such documents by the opposition Mr  Erdogan s signature success has been construction projects  from public residential building to infrastructure projects and expensive megaprojects like bridges and mosques  Opponents say that government contracts go to favored business partners  and that the AKP receives payments in a system of kickbacks from every deal Both the Ankara and Istanbul municipalities are heavily in debt  Mr  Ozgur warned in his column  and they may suffer if Mr  Erdogan  who controls the national budget  refuses them central government funds as punishment for the way they voted on Sunday Mr  Imamoglu  who announced his plans for Istanbul to international reporters Monday night  said he was prepared for that retribution and was confident Istanbul could generate enough of its own money to run itself He added that he had received indications of support from high within Turkey s state apparatus  if not in the lower ranks of the government  where support for Mr  Erdogan remains strong As president  Mr  Erdogan retains sweeping powers and could make life difficult for the incoming mayors  said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli  the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States  The AKP will control the municipal councils  and they have a say in particular in how the budget is allocated   he said  This control over the purse strings has long been a source of support for Mr  Erdogan and his party Ms  Toker reported Wednesday that there were signs already that the government was seeking ways to maintain control of resources  The Interior Ministry was taking steps to shift the approval of bids above a certain amount from municipal authorities to Mr  Erdogan s personal control  she wrote  In this way when it comes to investments in opposition controlled municipalities  the decision will be made in Bestepe   she wrote  a reference to the presidential palace  

GUATEMALA CITY   Guatemala s top electoral court has accepted three challenges to the presidential candidacy of former chief prosecutor Thelma Aldana  at least temporarily leaving her outside the race Jorge Mario Valenzuela  one of the Supreme Electoral Court judges who voted against Aldana  says one of the challenges alleged that Aldana did not have a certification from the comptroller s office indicating that her public accounts were all settled  The certificate is a requirement of candidates When Aldana registered her candidacy she had the certificate  but when the court later asked the comptroller it was told the document was expired Aldana could still appeal the decision  The challenges were brought by political rivals  

ISTANBUL   Step by step over the years  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey sought to ensure nobody could challenge him  He marginalized adversaries  He purged the army  the police and the courts  He cowed the press  He strengthened his powers in the Constitution  And he promised Turks a bright economic future So it was a huge surprise when the outcome of weekend municipal voting showed on Monday that Mr  Erdogan s party had not only lost control of Ankara  the political center  but maybe Istanbul  the country s commercial center  his home city and longstanding core of support Even if the results were not final  they amounted to the most momentous political earthquake to shake Mr  Erdogan in nearly two decades of basically uncontested control at the helm of Turkey  a NATO ally and critical linchpin of stability in the region  Erdogan s party plans to challenge election losses in Istanbul and Ankara  What was different this time was the rapidly tanking economy and a highly disciplined opposition It deployed monitors to not only scrutinize the vote tallies but also sleep on sacks of sealed counted ballots to guard against possible tampering by members of Mr  Erdogan s ruling Justice and Development Party  the AKP  We think they were not able to rig the election   said Ilayda Kocoglu  28  vice president of the Istanbul branch of the opposition Republican People s Party  or CHP  who slept on some sacks herself   They were not expecting us to be that organized  or that resolved  The results do not mean that Mr  Erdogan  whose term as president lasts for four more years  will change his behavior  which includes promoting Islamic religious values over secularism  closer ties to Russia and chillier relations with NATO  But the election showed Mr  Erdogan has weaknesses  It s a catastrophe for him   said Asli Aydintasbas  a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations   We now know he is not invincible  ImagePresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey arriving for a news conference in Istanbul  his home base of support CreditBulent Kilic Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesTurkey s weakened economy  which had rapidly expanded for years under Mr  Erdogan  was at the top of voters  concerns  despite Mr  Erdogan s exhortations that the problems are not of his making  The country tumbled into a recession in March  Unemployment exceeds 10 percent  and up to 30 percent among young people  The Turkish lira lost 28 percent of its value in 2018 and continues to weaken  Inflation has reached 20 percent Ms  Kocoglu said she and her colleagues understood within an hour of the closing of polls Sunday night that they were watching Turkey s most momentous change since Mr  Erdogan took power  Even the most remote areas of the Istanbul metropolitan area showed a defeat for Mr  Erdogan s mayoral candidate As of Monday night  results from the High Election Council had still not been fully released and Mr  Erdogan s party had not conceded defeat in Istanbul  But the tally showed the opposition candidate  Ekrem Imamoglu  ahead with 99 percent of the votes counted At a late night news briefing in Istanbul  Mr  Imamoglu said he was trusting in Turkey s institutions more than the AKP to confirm his victory   I don t expect this from the party   he said   For years to come AKP will not accept my win  Opposition mayors in Turkey s two most important cities give the Republican People s Party high profile opportunities to show how it can govern effectively  with control of municipal services from garbage collection to mass transit  And Mr  Imamoglu has promised that as mayor of Istanbul  he would audit the books  a prospect that could create new problems for the AKP should he uncover evidence of corruption under the ruling party s watch The Republican People s Party  long criticized for a lack of organization  for once was well prepared for the election  Mr  Imamoglu  49  a former district mayor  mobilized thousands of volunteers to observe every ballot box in the greater metropolitan area and record the count on a specially designed application  giving the party its own independent tabulation  We were able to compare our numbers with theirs   Ms  Kocoglu said A decisive moment came at 9 p m  Sunday when Mr  Erdogan gave his first speech of the evening  claiming victory for the AKP overall in the municipal district elections  The election commission suddenly stopped releasing election results for Istanbul  as did the semiofficial Anadolu news agency  which is widely followed on election nights as the source favored by the government for results The president s camp had already seen which way the vote was going and had stopped the count  said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli  the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States  a research institute   They stopped it to think what they could do   he said  There was even discussion of some kind of intervention  he said ImageEkrem Imamoglu  mayoral candidate for Istanbul of Republican People s Party  CHP   speaking after votes were cast  He was leading the race   a significant blow for the party in power CreditLefteris Pitarakis Associated Press We were very afraid   Ms  Kocoglu said  She recalled several elections when the election commission had stopped releasing details in the count  only to resume later and show an unlikely jump in favor of the ruling party Opposition supporters say this happened in a previous election for mayor of Ankara  and during the count for the 2017 constitutional referendum that gave Mr  Erdogan more executive powers and even in the presidential election in June The CHP s efforts to tabulate its own count in 2018 failed when the party s computer system broke down midcount  Its candidate later conceded defeat But this time was different  When Mr  Erdogan s candidate  Binali Yildirim  a former prime minister  declared himself the winner in Istanbul  Mr  Imamoglu immediately went public  announcing that he was leading in the race and had the records to prove it  He made 10 public statements of his lead through the night Mr  Erdogan is responsible for what many critics call an imperial presidency in Turkey  He oversaw a severe repression and government purging after a failed 2016 military coup attempt that he blamed on a longtime rival in exile  Fethullah Gulen  a cleric who lives in the United States  Under Mr  Erdogan  Turkey also has been a leading jailer of journalists But Mr  Erdogan s domination as Turkey s leader is also attributed to his unquestioned political talents and the failure of the main opposition party to put forward good candidates and broaden its appeal  CHP supporters have often questioned why their leaders have seemed to hand election after election to Mr  Erdogan The determination of the opposition was one thing  but support across society and even inside Mr  Erdogan s own party appeared to waver in the latest vote  The opposition stood firm  and there were signs of a public unleashing   Mr  Unluhisarcikli said  describing strong public support on Twitter and other social media ImageThe Istanbul mayoral candidate

Ankara and conceded the loss of at least one city to the opposition   a huge setback by itself Then people inside Mr  Erdogan s party headquarters posted screenshots taken from AKP computer monitors showing the opposition candidate in Istanbul leading the race  Mr  Erdogan s own supporters were apparently leaking the information  said Ms  Aydintasbas at the European Council for Foreign Relations Mr  Erdogan has become increasingly aloof over the years  surrounded in his vast presidential palace by a smaller and smaller circle of aides and ministers Yet political analysts were in little doubt that he made the decision to allow the true results for the Istanbul vote to be released Monday morning in order to protect his own electoral legacy  Erdogan is not a crazy person  he is intelligent   Ms  Kocoglu said Ms  Aydintasbas said Mr  Erdogan  who has always drawn legitimacy from the ballot box  would have seen it was impossible to alter the result   There was no real way   she said   They did not find a way of doing it without losing legitimacy  Others said Mr  Erdogan knew the risks to the economy if there were a wrangle over the election or a protracted dispute  The lira could fall sharply  as it did last summer  with drastic repercussions for businesses and livelihoods By accepting the election result  Mr  Erdogan has saved the reputation of the Turkish electoral system  which has given him legitimacy over the last 17 years  Mr  Unluhisarcikli said   With this one election Erdogan has dispensed the clouds of doubt of all the past elections  The swing away from Mr  Erdogan and his party in his home city  a place that he often describes with love and emotion  showed an unexpected success from the opposition alliance  which persuaded voters to vote tactically  despite their differences  Votes from the minority Kurds  and from unhappy conservatives who abandoned Mr  Erdogan  were critical  said Ms  Aydintasbas  who has followed Mr  Erdogan s career closely Ms  Kocoglu said that the election was a critical victory for the opposition since no further elections are scheduled for four years  I still cannot believe it   she said   When AKP came to power I was in middle school  I have never seen a victory   

Just when it seemed that democracy was all but dead in Turkey  voters delivered a sharp electoral rebuke to their authoritarian president  Recep Tayyip Erdogan Unofficial results in municipal elections over the weekend show that Mr  Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party lost control of Ankara  the capital  and Istanbul  the financial center and launching pad for Mr  Erdogan s political career Mr  Erdogan was not on the ballot  and his party still controls Parliament  but the vote was the worst election defeat of his nearly two decades in office  And while he won re election last year  a 2017 referendum that only narrowly gave him new authority over the legislature and judiciary presaged his weakening support Opposition candidates in the municipal races capitalized on growing discontent with his repression and economic mismanagement  The results signaled that  if the opposition stays united and forward looking  it could mount a true challenge to Mr  Erdogan in the next presidential election  in 2023 The president s main rival  the Republican People s Party  and its allies promised political change  job creation  better education and improved social services  Opposition members carefully monitored vote tallies and have even slept on sacks of counted ballots to ensure they are not tampered with by Erdogan loyalists Meanwhile  the pro Kurdish People s Democratic Party s disciplined effort in the bigger cities to support Republican People s Party candidates most likely provided the winning margin in Istanbul and Ankara For more than a decade  Mr  Erdogan has dominated Turkey  promoting Islamic religious values and ruthlessly crushing those he sees as adversaries  Over the years  he has manipulated the system to accrue sweeping executive powers  control the army and crack down on civil liberties  His cronies largely control the media  but Turkey still jails more journalists than any other nation The president inserted himself directly into the local election process  handpicking a longtime ally  Binali Yildirim  to run for mayor of Istanbul and choosing a former minister to run for mayor of Ankara  Their losses could deprive the president of a vast patronage apparatus that has bolstered his rule  Appearing at as many as eight political rallies a day  Mr  Erdogan waged an aggressively negative campaign  accusing the opposition of criminality or terrorism  threatening lawsuits and fueling nationalist anger It s not surprising that voters saw the election as a referendum on Mr  Erdogan s rule  Turkey s economy fell into recession in March after years of enviable growth  The unemployment rate is now over 10 percent  and is as much as 30 percent among young people  In 2018  the value of the Turkish lira fell 28 percent  Inflation is at 20 percent  Voters  particularly the young  are also concerned about corruption among members of the Erdogan family and its allies  Mr  Erdogan s party is challenging the vote counts but said it would respect the results  despite his autocratic bent  Mr  Erdogan values the legitimacy that elections confer The United States and other Western democracies had been losing hope that Turkey can be a reliable ally given Mr  Erdogan s drift away from democratic values and NATO and toward Russia  The latest election results offer a chance to assure him that any tampering would widen that breach   and further endanger economic and military partnerships  One concern is that Mr  Erdogan could try to increase his flagging support by undertaking long threatened military operations against America s Kurdish allies in Syria  Such a move may backfire  particularly if the operations go poorly Especially now that Turkey s political opposition has shown it is alive and capable of pushing back  Opinion   Selim KoruHas Erdogan s Populism Reached Its Limits April 2  2019Erdogan  Turkey s Leader  Staring at Major Electoral DefeatMarch 31  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

CHICAGO   Adrianne Burton  38  believes that the next mayor of Chicago will have a sharper  more empathetic eye on the public schools  Carolyn Davenport  62  is confident that the new mayor will be a superior manager  accustomed to running a career and a household without any fuss On her lunch break in the Loop  Denise Thompson  54  had a different view   We re making history  sure   she said   But a black woman running the city will be just like anybody else  On Tuesday  Chicagoans were headed to the polls to vote for a successor to Mayor Rahm Emanuel  Residents were choosing between two African American women  guaranteeing that Chicago will become the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  Read more about the Chicago election for mayor that resulted in a win for Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to run the city  Competing in the runoff election are Lori Lightfoot  a lawyer and former federal prosecutor  and Toni Preckwinkle  the president of the Cook County Board and the chairwoman of the county s Democratic Party  Both women beat out 12 other candidates in an election in February  a who s who of well known names that made up the most crowded ballot in municipal history As the voting began  the historic nature of the election was greeted in Chicago with both pride and nonchalance  a sense that electing an African American woman as mayor would be significant  but not seismic  Here s more on Chicago s election  Maybe it is because Chicago has already seen such milestones  sending the first African American president  Barack Obama  to the White House  helping elect the first African American woman to the United States Senate  Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois  in 1992  and making Harold Washington the city s first black mayor in 1983  It is tremendous   said Josie Brown Childs  a civic leader who worked for Mr  Washington in the 1980s   But Chicago has been on the forefront of certain black politics  whether it was with Harold or Obama  We ve been in the lead on those things  In interviews around the city during the run up to the election  Chicagoans said they were carefully weighing the platforms and promises of Ms  Preckwinkle and Ms  Lightfoot  watching their performances in televised debates and considering what kind of leader the current moment in Chicago demands ImageJosie Brown Childs  a civic leader who worked for Harold Washington in the 1980s  at her South Shore home CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York Times For me  personally  I m asking   Who is going to be the break from politics as usual in Chicago    said Jordie Davies  a Ph D  candidate at the University of Chicago whose dissertation focuses on political activism   I m excited about two black women  But I m looking at records  I m looking at who is going to offer the most holistic platform for addressing problems in Chicago  Deidre Baumann  50  a lawyer who cast her vote Tuesday at a library in the Budlong Woods neighborhood on the North Side  said she would be happy with whichever candidate prevailed  Either way  this is a historic election   she said She watched the debates and studied the candidates  records carefully  she said  deciding in the end to vote for Ms  Lightfoot  who she believed would bring her experience as a federal prosecutor to push for criminal justice reform  Here s what you need to know about Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago and the first openly gay mayor for the city   We have to make this city safe for all the citizens and the police   Ms  Baumann said   On the other hand  we cannot continue to incarcerate black and brown people in disparate numbers  In her eyes  Ms  Preckwinkle represented an older political model   I m disturbed a bit by her ties to the machine   she said   She always touted herself as the progressive candidate  She s had to move away from that as she navigated the political system in Chicago  The new mayor must contend with a host of complicated issues in the nation s third largest city  including a deep pension crisis  persistent violent crime  reform of the police department and the question of how to spur investment and growth in long neglected and segregated neighborhoods on Chicago s West and South Sides  Under Mr  Emanuel  the downtown has boomed  flourishing with tech companies  high rise hotels  a sparkling riverfront and luxury apartments  But many African American residents have moved out of the city in recent years  Mr  Emanuel  who was elected to two terms  did not seek a third term in office Polls have suggested that Ms  Lightfoot has a commanding lead over Ms  Preckwinkle  who entered the race last September after Mr  Emanuel announced that he would not run again  Ms  Preckwinkle garnered endorsements from powerful labor groups   the Chicago Teachers Union and the Service Employees International Union   and from prominent black leaders including Jesse White  the secretary of state In the part of Chicago s South Side that Ms  Preckwinkle once represented in the City Council  voters remembered her tenure fondly  Bob Kurth  76  a longtime resident of the Kenwood neighborhood  said Ms  Preckwinkle came through years ago when he complained about a hole in the street near his condo building  She was approachable  If you had a problem that was part of the ward  you called her and you had a meeting with her   Mr  Kurth said on Tuesday after voting for Ms  Preckwinkle   You saw her on the street  she always had time to talk to you  ImageLori Lightfoot and Toni Preckwinkle before the start of their final on air debate CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York TimesMs  Preckwinkle s long stint in government was not a deterrent  With Toni  she didn t start as a politician  and that means a lot to me   said Mr  Kurth  a retired salesman   She s learned how to play the game  but I don t consider her a part of it  Others saw Ms  Preckwinkle s years in political office as a concern  The fact Ms  Lighftoot had not served in elective office helped her earn the vote of Michelle Saulnier  29  a Ph D  student  It s a good thing  especially in Chicago where there s known to be a lot of corruption   Ms  Saulnier said after casting her ballot in the Logan Square neighborhood  where Ms  Lightfoot lives and her campaign signs abound   I think that s really important to try to break some of these cycles that we re in    Ms  Lightfoot had a head start on the campaign trail  declaring her candidacy for mayor in May 2018  when it was widely believed that she would face off against Mr  Emanuel A relatively unknown figure who has never held elective office  Ms  Lightfoot has spent time introducing herself to voters as a candidate who would focus on overhauling the police department  curbing street violence and rebuilding neighborhoods beyond the affluent downtown and North Side  Ra Joy  an entrepreneur in Chicago who was a candidate for lieutenant governor in 2018  endorsed Ms  Lightfoot early in the race  he said on Saturday at a candidate forum at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition on the South Side A mayoral contest between two African American women has scrambled the usual political calculus in Chicago  or what Mr  Joy called  tribal voting   in which politicians could count on support from voters of their own race  It s turned that notion on its head   he said  adding that the successful candidate would have to build coalitions of Latinos  whites and African Americans in a city where the population is almost evenly divided among the three groups Celestine A  Strain  46  a hospital technician  brought her granddaughter Kalicia  9  to the forum at Rainbow PUSH  hoping Kalicia would someday remember seeing two black women running for mayor of Chicago  It s amazing for her to see   Ms  Strain said  adding that she was hoping Ms  Preckwinkle  who has been a familiar face in county government for years  would emerge victorious on Tuesday   I really believe that she has the right experience  The Rev  Jesse Jackson offered no endorsement in the race  saying that he hoped to be more of a peacemaker after what played out in recent weeks as a bitter campaign  On stage on Saturday  he urged both candidates to sign a statement agreeing to appear together the morning after the election   I wanted to play a reconciling role   Mr  Jackson said in an interview in his office at Rainbow PUSH   The campaign ends  Let the healing begin   

KIEV  Ukraine   A young television comic and novice candidate trounced Ukraine s political elite in the first round of the presidential election  official results showed Monday   a stinging rebuke by an electorate tired of the lack of change in a country dominated by rich businessmen With the initial vote tally nearly complete  results released by the Central Electoral Committee showed that Volodymyr Zelensky  41  who is famous for playing a schoolteacher accidentally vaulted into the presidency  leading the field with more than 30 percent  He received 5 2 million votes  almost double the number of his nearest competitor  President Petro O  Poroshenko  who had just under 16 percent Yulia V  Tymoshenko  a former prime minister who has run for president twice before  came in third with more than 13 percent  The turnout was more than 63 percent in an electorate of 30 million  the electoral commission said Since no candidate garnered more than 50 percent of the vote  Mr  Zelensky and the apparent second place finisher  Mr  Poroshenko  will face each other in a runoff in three weeks  on April 21 As soon as the polls closed on Sunday and exit polls indicated that there would be a runoff  the two leading candidates began bashing each other Mr  Zelensky presented himself as an insurgent facing a tired old guard that had refused to take him seriously  He walloped a field of 38 other candidates representing different political blocs in Ukraine  most of whom attracted only small fractions of the vote ImageYulia Tymoshenko after a news conference in her election headquarters in Kiev on Monday CreditOleg Petrasyuk EPA  via ShutterstockA Zelensky adviser described the outcome as the culmination of a series of uprisings in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014 that succeeded in overthrowing governments but failed to break the grip of the oligarchs who control economic and political life  as well as the media  This is a struggle so that the political system finally starts working not for its own benefit  but for the benefit of the people   said Dmitri Razumkov  a political consultant for Mr  Zelensky   Despite two revolutions  nothing has changed in our country  Mr  Zelensky has been vague about what he would do as president  and at one point tried to crowdsource his program by suggesting that supporters contribute thoughts via social media  Voters might demand more in the second round There have also been suspicions that he is a front for Ihor V  Kolomoisky  a Ukrainian tycoon who fled to Israel amid a banking scandal  Both men have denied any secret pact Mr  Poroshenko  53  conceded on Sunday night that he had lost the confidence of young voters weary over the slow pace of change and the continuing economic woes  But he said that the time for joking was over and that Ukraine needed a leader who could confront both its socioeconomic problems and  more important  the conflict with Russia The election will help determine the course of the country that has become the European fault line in renewed global tensions between Russia and the West  The war for control of the Donbass  the regions in eastern Ukraine where government forces are fighting Russian backed separatists  has claimed 13 000 lives and displaced millions since 2014 In a sign of the deep rift with Russia  the main rivalry in the presidential race was not  unlike a decade ago  between pro Russian and pro Western factions  The leading ally of Russia this time  Yuriy Boyko  was in fourth place  with over 11 percent of the vote ImagePresident Petro O  Poroshenko came in second in the first round of voting CreditReutersMr  Poroshenko faces an uphill battle in a runoff  political analysts said  not least because he remains one of the wealthiest men in Ukraine  His wealth comes from his chocolate empire  and he did not fulfill a 2014 campaign promise to sell his business  Various businessmen close to him have been caught up in scandals involving corruption The president continued to grow richer as ordinary Ukrainians suffered from low wages and unemployment  noted Volodymr Fesenko  a political analyst The election outcome echoes a global trend of tossing out established political leaders in favor of candidates who promise a complete national overhaul  Mr  Fesenko and other analysts said  The victory of Zelensky is a protest against the old elites and the request for radical political change  a radical update   said Mr  Fesenko  chairman of a think tank called the  Center for Applied Political Studies  It is not so much love for the comedian as  the expectation that he can become a catalyst for change   he said Ukrainians seem less enamored of their leaders all the time  A mere 9 percent voiced confidence in the government  and 91 percent see it as corrupt  according to a Gallup poll conducted in March In Russia  Dmitri S  Peskov  the spokesman for President Vladimir V  Putin  declined to comment on the first round voting results  Russia s main interest is seeing a candidate prevail who will work toward a gradual settlement of the conflict in Donbass  he said Other Russian political leaders and the state run media tried to present the Ukrainian election as a farce and a rebuke to the idea that a political uprising like that in Ukraine in 2014 could force change  Rossiyskaya Gazeta  the government newspaper  said there were signs of  massive violations and falsifications in these elections   the dirtiest and most dishonest in the history of Ukraine  The Russian reports and commentary ignored the widespread perception that the election in Ukraine was democratic  with a real choice and an outcome that was not preordained   unlike elections in Russia  Only minor election law violations have been reported thus far  

CHICAGO   After Rahm Emanuel announced he would not seek another term as Chicago s mayor  the field of would be replacements seemed to grow by the day  Lori Lightfoot  a former federal prosecutor who had never held elective office  often seemed an afterthought in a mounting list of prominent names   a member of the Daley political dynasty  the head of the county s Democratic Party  a former leader of Chicago s public school system Yet on Tuesday  voters sided with Ms  Lightfoot in overwhelming margins  handing her a resounding victory as she prepares to become the first African American woman and first openly gay person to serve as Chicago s mayor  Ms  Lightfoot s outsider status and her pledge to combat political corruption resonated across the city s traditional dividing lines of race and class  With 97 percent of precincts reporting  she had received 73 percent of the vote and was leading in all 50 City Council wards  Today  you did more than make history   Ms  Lightfoot told a packed ballroom of her supporters that chanted her name on Tuesday night   You created a movement for change   Read how Chicago became the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  and how Chicagoans feel about it  Ms  Lightfoot  a Democrat  used her acceptance speech to underscore the historic nature of her victory  As her wife and daughter stood nearby  Ms  Lightfoot said her win proved that Chicago was  a city where it doesn t matter what color you are  and  where it doesn t matter who you love  just as long as you love with all your heart   She also reiterated her promise to invest in struggling neighborhoods  not just the booming downtown  a hallmark theme of her campaign pitch  We can and will make Chicago a place where your ZIP code doesn t determine your destiny   she said Ms  Lightfoot finished with the most support among 14 candidates in February s first round  nonpartisan election  In Tuesday s runoff  she broadened that appeal and soundly defeated Toni Preckwinkle  a longtime politician who leads the county board and local Democratic Party  The two women will soon have offices in the same building  and have vowed to work together despite a campaign that was often acrimonious In the Logan Square neighborhood on the city s Northwest Side  Deepti Pareenja  37  said she voted for Ms  Lightfoot on Tuesday in part because of the candidate s lack of political experience ImageMs  Lightfoot campaigned with supporters last week  She presented herself on the campaign trail as an antidote to Rahm Emanuel s eight years in office and as an answer to the city s far longer tradition of machine politics CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York Times It s because of Chicago   Ms  Pareenja said   We have a history of corruption with people who ve been ingrained in politics for multiple decades  Ms  Pareenja said she also voted for Ms  Lightfoot in February s first round election  but at the time did not think Ms  Lightfoot had much of a chance of winning  Ms  Pareenja said she was surprised and excited when the runoff field was set The fact Ms  Lightfoot had never served in elective office also helped her earn the vote of Michelle Saulnier  29  a Ph D  student  It s a good thing  especially in Chicago where there s known to be a lot of corruption   Ms  Saulnier said on Tuesday after casting her ballot in the Logan Square neighborhood  where Ms  Lightfoot lives and her campaign signs were all around   I think that s really important to try to break some of these cycles that we re in   Read more about the Chicago election for mayor that resulted in a win for Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to run the city  Don Rose  a political consultant who was a senior adviser to the Lightfoot campaign  said that Ms  Lightfoot benefited from recent corruption scandals that seemed to work against any mayoral candidate who was already part of the Chicago political establishment  It was the perfect situation for some kind of outsider who would capture that mantle and consolidate the reform minded vote   he said   People got fed up  Ms  Lightfoot  56  who held city government jobs under two mayors  presented herself on the campaign trail as an antidote to Mr  Emanuel s eight years in office and as an answer to the city s far longer tradition of machine politics  She criticized Mr  Emanuel s decision to close dozens of schools  mainly in Hispanic and black neighborhoods  and focused especially on promises to overhaul the Chicago Police Department and reduce gun violence  People feel like the violence is out of control and that there s no plan   Ms  Lightfoot said in an interview last year Just a few years ago  Mr  Emanuel turned to Ms  Lightfoot during the biggest crisis of his tenure  A Chicago police officer  Jason Van Dyke  had just been charged with murder in the death of a black teenager  Laquan McDonald  and protesters were calling for Mr  Emanuel s ouster ImageMs  Lightfoot with her daughter Vivian Lightfoot and wife Amy Eshleman before taking the stage to make her victory speech on Tuesday night CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York TimesIn the months that followed  Ms  Lightfoot was chairwoman of a panel that met with residents and produced a scathing report  The document accused the Police Department of systemic racism and found that officers had lost the trust of residents and failed to instill a sense of safety  What we heard from people all across the city is they felt like they didn t even have a claim to the geography in front of their house  on their street  or in their neighborhoods   Ms  Lightfoot said when the report was released in spring 2016 After the report was made public  Ms  Lightfoot drifted away from Mr  Emanuel  eventually resigning her role as president of the Chicago Police Board  which oversees officer discipline  and entering the mayoral race in May At the time  Ms  Lightfoot was one of only a handful of figures willing to run against Mr  Emanuel  who was widely expected to appear on the ballot until announcing in September that he would not  As the field of candidates grew more vast  including the entrance of Ms  Preckwinkle  Ms  Lightfoot forged ahead with her campaign There were reasons for skepticism  Ms  Lightfoot was relatively unknown in the city s political realm  and her ballot petition signatures were briefly challenged last year  But she surged in at least one poll in the final days before the February election  and was endorsed by The Chicago Sun Times  She has the vision  values  qualifications and policies to be an effective leader for the whole city  from the hedge fund managers to the fast food workers   the newspaper s editorial board wrote   She is calm  focused  principled and independent  In the weeks since  as the race took on a venomous tone  Ms  Lightfoot tallied up endorsements across the city  including from several of her former opponents Ms  Lightfoot repeatedly portrayed Ms  Preckwinkle  with whom she agrees on most major policy issues  as a part of the Democratic machine that long dominated Chicago government Ms  Preckwinkle was fond of noting Ms  Lightfoot s work as a  corporate lawyer  and her service in city government under the previous two mayors  And Bridget Gainer  a county commissioner who supported Ms  Preckwinkle  said her candidate s political experience was in fact an asset  We need results  not just rhetoric   Ms  Gainer said in February   Chicago is not a training wheels job   

TEL AVIV   An Israeli watchdog group has found a network of hundreds of social media accounts  many of them fake  used to smear opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in next week s election and to amplify the messages of his Likud party  according to a report to be released Monday The messages posted on the network s Twitter and Facebook accounts are frequently reposted by prominent Likud campaign officials and by the prime minister s son  Yair Netanyahu  the report says The watchdog group  the Big Bots Project  an independent organization that aims to expose the malicious use of social media  found no direct links between the network and Mr  Netanyahu  his party or his son  but said it appeared to operate in coordination with the party and Mr  Netanyahu s re election campaign  The network operates through manipulations  slander  lies and spreading rumors   the report said   On its busiest days  the network sends out thousands of tweets a day  The network s activity has intensified almost fivefold since the election was called in December  the report said  and  is mobilized at climactic moments for Netanyahu  such as the announcement of the indictment against him  The report says the network may violate Israeli laws pertaining to elections  campaign finance  privacy and taxation A spokesman for the Likud party said that it did not run a network of fake accounts   All of the Likud s digital activity is entirely authentic and is based on the great support of the citizens of Israel for Prime Minister Netanyahu and the great achievements of the Likud   the spokesman  Jonathan Urich  said on Sunday Mr  Netanyahu  who is facing an indictment on corruption charges  is in a tight race for what he hopes will be his fourth consecutive term  He is facing a strong challenge from Benny Gantz  a retired army chief  in the April 9 election According to the report  154 of the accounts in the network use fake names and another 400 accounts are suspected of being fake  The accounts appear to be operated by people  not bots  making them much harder to detect  the report says  Their posts  all in Hebrew  have had over 2 5 million hits  the report s authors estimate  in a country with 8 7 million citizens ImageBenny Gantz at a campaign rally in Tel Aviv CreditAbir Sultan EPA  via ShutterstockThe report was written by Noam Rotem and Yuval Adam  founders of the Big Bots Project  They were assisted by the Israeli Alliance  a liberal leaning organization  and their investigation was financed through an Israeli online crowdfunding site  Drove The New York Times and the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot received advance copies of the report One of the accounts is under the name  Moshe   whose handsome profile picture actually belongs to the Greek model Theo Theodoridis  Moshe  whose posts praise Mr  Netanyahu and excoriate his rivals  tweeted only 16 times during the first three months of 2018  By contrast  during the first three months of this year  with the election campaign underway  he tweeted 2 856 times The members of the network work in sync with each other  the report says  When one posted the false rumor that Mr  Gantz was a rapist  many of the others reposted it  On Thursday  many of the members almost simultaneously began tweeting that Mr  Gantz was mentally ill  echoing a video clip distributed by the Likud campaign As Mr  Gantz became Mr  Netanyahu s chief rival  the network focused more on him  The network s activity has often spiked at times of key political events The evening before the attorney general announced his decision to indict Mr  Netanyahu  the network circulated a Facebook post by an American woman saying that Mr  Gantz had sexually harassed her when they were in high school Mr  Gantz denied the accusation  and no support for it has been forthcoming  but the fabricated accounts pushed the story with tweets like   Gantz the rapist to jail  and  Lousy scum rapist  Items posted by the network have also described Mr  Gantz  somewhat incongruously  as being gay and having a mistress The network has also attacked the attorney general  Avichai Mandelblit  echoing Mr  Netanyahu s assertion that by seeking to indict the prime minister the attorney general had  surrendered to the media and the left  All accounts in the network are linked to that of a real person  Yitzhak Haddad  a resident of Ashdod The report cites a YouTube channel to which Mr  Haddad is an active subscriber  which has a message offering workers cash in exchange for  responding on Facebook and on the internet with political messages  ImageThe fake social media network s messages have been redistributed by prominent figures like Yair Netanyahu  shown here with his father CreditThomas Coex Agence France Presse   Getty Images You just get political messages and you post them   the message said It was not clear if the message was linked to the fake social network or whether Mr  Haddad ran the network When asked about the network on Sunday  Mr  Haddad said it was  all lies  He declined to confirm or deny that he was the person behind the Twitter account bearing his picture and email address  his connections with Likud  or his relationship to the YouTube channel recruiting workers for the election campaign In a later text message  Mr  Haddad wrote   There is absolutely nothing in this  Anyone publishing this nonsense can expect a very large lawsuit   You have no right to gag people on the right or on the left  period   he added   and the organization that is busy identifying accounts  who are they at all to decide for the open and free world  Mr  Urich  the Likud party spokesman  said that he did not know Mr  Haddad  and that Mr  Haddad was not employed by the Likud party and had no connection with Likud The network s messages have been redistributed by prominent figures in the Likud campaign team  Yair Netanyahu  an unofficial adviser to his father s campaign  has retweeted the network s members 154 times  the report said  Similarly  the network  liked  and replied to his messages 1 481 times  and shared his messages 429 times Yair Netanyahu did not reply to a request for comment  Mr  Urich  speaking on his behalf  said   Yair Netanyahu has no role in the Likud campaign  does not know the people of the network and is not involved in its activities  if any  Some of the tweets that include curse words and anti Arab slurs are written using numbers that look like letters in the Hebrew alphabet  apparently so that a Twitter audit would not identify them as inappropriate and shut down the account There have been efforts to update Israeli election law to cover relatively recent developments in social media  After the work of a special panel headed by a former Supreme Court chief justice  Dorit Beinisch  an amendment to the law was proposed to cover social media The Likud party opposed the amendment and it did not pass Karine Nahon  president of the Israel Internet Association  who was a member of the Beinish panel  said   We made a great effort to submit the recommendations as soon as possible so that legislation could already be enacted in the coming elections  But when a first reading bill was about to be voted on  the Likud decided in the middle of the night to remove it from the agenda   

Representative Ben Ray Lujn of New Mexico  a trusted ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was seen as a possible candidate to replace her when she retired  announced on Monday that he would run for the Senate in 2020 He will seek the seat held by Senator Tom Udall  also a Democrat  who said last week that he would retire at the end of his term Mr  Lujn s decision makes him the latest aspiring House speaker to move on because of Ms  Pelosi s longevity  Chris Van Hollen  now a senator from Maryland  and Xavier Becerra  now attorney general of California  are also among the former Democratic House stars who have since sought other offices An easygoing  well liked member of the House who currently serves as deputy speaker  Mr  Lujn has represented New Mexico s Third Congressional District since 2008  He also led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  the party s arm that supports House candidates  in the 2016 and 2018 elections  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 election  Mr  Lujn tipped his cap to Mr  Udall in a statement on Monday  calling him  a champion for New Mexico  and arguing that  New Mexico needs another champion  in the Senate He pointed to his legislative record on issues like health care and the environment  while promising to uphold what he called  New Mexico values   I was born and raised in New Mexico  on the small Namb farm I still call home   Mr  Lujn said in the statement and in a video on social media   My mother retired after 33 years with the local public school district and my late father   a union ironworker and state representative   instilled in me the importance of hard work  the idea that no job is too big or too small  and a love for New Mexico that guides me every day  In a telephone interview on Monday  Mr  Lujn said that leaving the House was one of several  tough decisions  he had to make in deciding to run for the Senate  But he said he was hopeful that Democrats could flip the Senate in 2020  and  we can t do that unless we keep New Mexico blue  He enters the race at a time when New Mexico has evolved into a safely Democratic state  After voting for George W  Bush in 2004  the state has turned progressively bluer and currently has no Republicans in its congressional delegation Mr  Udall won his Senate seat in 2008 after the retirement of Senator Pete V  Domenici  the last Republican to represent New Mexico in the chamber  In that same election  Mr  Lujn captured Mr  Udall s old House district  Mr  Udall is the scion of a political dynasty in the West  Democrats are likely to have an advantage in the race for Mr  Udall s Senate seat  and Mr  Lujn  46  is just one of several lawmakers who could seek it  New Mexico was among the states that saw a tide of young and diverse Democrats sweep to power during last year s midterm elections  and some of those newly elected officials may now consider running The state elected a Latina chief executive  Gov  Michelle Lujan Grisham  and sent two new women to the House  Representative Deb Haaland  58  who became one of the first Native American women elected to Congress  and Representative Xochitl Torres Small  34  a former aide to Mr  Udall who carried a conservative leaning district that hugs the border  We re a small family and we have to work closely with one another   Mr  Lujn said of the congressional delegation from New Mexico  But he added later   I would not have jumped into this race unless I felt I was the strongest candidate  There are also a handful of prominent Republicans in the state  including Susana Martinez  the former governor  and Richard J  Berry  the former mayor of Albuquerque  It is unclear if any would be interested in mounting a long shot campaign  and Ms  Martinez left office deeply unpopular Mr  Udall offered no hint as to a preferred heir when he announced he would retire  but he has indicated that he intends to remain involved in politics and government  

CHICAGO   Chicago became the largest American city ever to elect a black woman as its mayor as voters on Tuesday chose Lori Lightfoot  a former prosecutor  to replace Rahm Emanuel  When she takes office in May  Ms  Lightfoot also will be the city s first openly gay mayor Ms  Lightfoot  who has never held elective office  easily won the race  overwhelming a better known  longtime politician and turning her outsider status into an asset in a city with a history of corruption and insider dealings  Ms  Lightfoot  56  beat Toni Preckwinkle  a former alderman who is president of the Cook County Board and who had for years been viewed as a highly formidable candidate for mayor  Here s what you need to know about Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago and the first openly gay mayor for the city  For Chicago  Ms  Lightfoot s win signaled a notable shift in the mood of voters and a rejection of an entrenched political culture that has more often rewarded insiders and dismissed unknowns  For many voters  the notion that someone with no political ties might become mayor of Chicago seemed an eye opening counterpoint to a decades old  often repeated mantra about this city s political order   We don t want nobody nobody sent  As Ms  Lightfoot took the stage in a downtown ballroom on Tuesday night  she acknowledged the unlikeliness of her resounding victory  in which she appeared to win all 50 of Chicago s wards   We were up against powerful interests  a powerful machine and a powerful mayor   she said   Nobody gave us much of a chance  For some of Ms  Lightfoot s supporters  the significance of her victory was monumental  going beyond a single candidate or city   Look  nothing personal  but it s not the good old boys club anymore

leadership   said Stephanie Sandberg  executive director of LPAC  an organization that works to build the political power of L G B T Q  women Ms  Lightfoot s rise was unexpected only weeks ago  when 13 other candidates were vying to run the nation s third largest city  many of them far better known   with decades of experience in Chicago politics and with dynastic names like Daley  Ms  Lightfoot is a lawyer who has served in appointed positions  including as head of the Chicago Police Board and as a leader of a task force that issued a scathing report on relations between the Chicago police and black residents  but she was not widely known around the city until recent months Ms  Lightfoot   Chicago s 56th mayor   arrives at a pivotal moment for a Democratic city that has for the past eight years been led by Mr  Emanuel  who surprised many residents when he chose not to seek re election Chicago  a city of 2 7 million residents  is wrestling with dueling realities  Tech jobs and convention business have poured into its shimmering downtown while public schools have been shuttered on the South and West Sides  and thousands of black residents have moved away  Mr  Emanuel s administration made strides to shore up the city s fiscal woes but residents have complained about mounting taxes and fees  Chicago s new mayor still must come up with an additional  1 billion in the next four years to continue pulling the city out of a pension crisis And the city says its crime problems have been improving over the past two years  recording about half as many murders this year as it did during the same period in 2016  Still  gun and gang violence are pervasive and the city had more than 550 homicides in 2018  more than in the nation s two larger cities  New York and Los Angeles ImageAbraham Lacy and his son Isaac took a selfie with Chicago mayoral candidate Toni Preckwinkle on Tuesday CreditJoshua Lott ReutersRace has often played an outsize role in politics in Chicago  which is essentially evenly split between white  black and Latino residents  On Tuesday  though  the contest between two African American women scrambled the usual political calculus  or what one Chicagoan  Ra Joy  described as its habit of  tribal voting   in which politicians count on support from voters of their own race In February  during the most crowded mayoral primary in city history  Ms  Lightfoot and Ms  Preckwinkle topped a far larger array of candidates of various ethnicities  races and genders  removing all the others from Tuesday s runoff  That left political alignments few Chicagoans had seen before  Ms  Lightfoot pursuing white voters on the city s Northwest and Southwest Sides  both women seeking black voters from a base on the South Side that had leaned toward a different black candidate in February  parts of Chicago s North Side lakefront loaded with signs for Ms  Lightfoot Some residents said the history making nature of the election was energizing while others seemed nonchalant  perhaps partly because Chicago has seen similar milestones  In 1983  the city picked its first black mayor  Harold Washington  in a racially charged election  a term before that  in 1979  the city chose its first female mayor  Jane Byrne  It s not as shocking as it was back then  so that s wonderful progress   Kathy Byrne  the daughter of Jane Byrne  who died in 2014  said of the historic nature of this year s election   Why it s taken so long  I don t know  In many ways  the election transformed into a referendum on Chicago s political culture  known for its miserable ranking on most measures of corruption  its political machine and its habit of keeping family dynasties in power Ms  Lightfoot  who was partner at a prominent law firm  Mayer Brown  portrayed her newcomer status as a sign of strength  pledging to dismantle City Hall s old political ways and to  bring in the light   Still  her claim of being an outsider was questioned by some younger activists in the city  who pointed to her jobs in the Richard M  Daley administration and as a police oversight official during Mr  Emanuel s tenure  not to mention her role as a prosecutor ImageFor many of her supporters  Ms  Lightfoot s victory signaled a rejection of an entrenched political culture that has more often rewarded insiders and dismissed unknowns CreditJoshua Lott ReutersMs  Preckwinkle  the longtime Cook County board president  had tried to cast her experience as essential for managing a city the size of Chicago  while simultaneously reminding voters that she had   when she was first elected as an alderman years ago   regularly bucked the political establishment But as the election season played out  impatience over political corruption seemed to intensify among voters  in part because a major corruption scandal was unfolding at City Hall  Federal authorities have accused the City Council s longest serving alderman  Ed Burke  of running an old school shakedown  even as the local news media reported that a second alderman had cooperated with the authorities  secretly recording his conversations at City Hall for months Of the city s 50 aldermen  15 seats were up for runoff elections on Tuesday  Mr  Burke  who has denied any wrongdoing  won re election to another term in February  winning a margin large enough to avoid a runoff Rarely does this city get new  unexpected mayors  So Chicagoans watched with curiosity and uncertainty about what a Lightfoot administration would truly look like  Ms  Lightfoot has portrayed herself as a progressive  who promised to usher in a new era of accountability and transparency at City Hall  At times  she seemed to be running against Chicago politics in the public imagination  A television ad used an image of a smoke filled room and spoke darkly of the  Chicago machine  Ms  Lightfoot has spoken frequently of equity and inclusion  of redistributing city funds to spread the prosperity of downtown and the North Side to neighborhoods that have been neglected  It s unacceptable  the condition of our communities on the South and West Sides   she said during the campaign   The only way we are going to carve a new path for the city  to take us in a direction that our communities don t continue to be resource starved  is to vote for change  ImageMs  Lightfoot greeted residents on the South Side on

board  She has vowed to significantly change the Chicago Police Department  increasing training and reducing officer misconduct But her answers to the urgent question of how the city will pay its staggering bills have not been comprehensive Ms  Lightfoot has said that she will help the city meet its financial commitments by legalizing recreational marijuana and building a casino in Chicago  But she has not explained fully how she would solve the city s imminent pension crisis  Whoever is elected as mayor is going to face a very difficult financial situation   said Laurence Msall  the president of the Civic Federation  a watchdog group For Abraham Lacy  33  a Chicagoan who voted for Ms  Lightfoot s opponent on the South Side on Tuesday  the city s urgent challenges of finances  schools and crime called for someone with deep experience  It s tough to have someone new come in when you have this many things going on   Mr  Lacy said In the end  though  many voters said they were driven more by their perceptions about politics than about policy  Ms  Lightfoot  her supporters said  offered the promise of a new order and a rejection of the politics of a generation ago  It s because of Chicago   Deepti Pareenja  37  said  after casting her ballot on the city s Northwest Side for Ms  Lightfoot   We have a history of corruption with people who ve been ingrained in politics for multiple decades   

The future success of the Democratic Party depends on the crucial   but unsettled   allegiance of the nation s growing Hispanic electorate Fernand Amandi  a Democratic pollster and podcast host based in Miami  addressed the party s Latino quandary in a December interview with The Associated Press The question is not are Democrats winning the Hispanic vote   it s why aren t Democrats winning the Hispanic vote 80 20 or 90 10 the way they are winning black voters In an interview earlier this week  Amandi told me that Democrats  want and hope for this magical osmosis to happen but that s not how politics works  In the 2018 midterms  Democrats showed gains among Hispanic voters in most states  compared with 2014  Party operatives are concerned  however  about the slow rate of growth of these improved Democratic margins  They are equally worried about turnout   at a time when many thought that President Trump s rhetoric and policies would produce impressive gains among Latino voters for the Democratic Party Take turnout  Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic constituencies in the United States  but their level of political participation is not keeping pace with their overall population numbers As the accompanying Pew chart demonstrates  the number of Hispanic voters in midterm elections has grown steadily  from 2 9 million in 1986 to 6 8 million in 2014  At the same time  however  turnout   measured as a percentage of total eligible adult citizens 18 and over   has experienced a relative decline The Growth of the Latino Bloc       g edsall1 box  g artboard

  02           06           10           14         By The New York Times   Source  Pew Research CenterIn 1986  the Latino turnout rate was 38 7 percent  in 2014  that rate fell to 27 1 percent  If the 2014 turnout rate had been as high as it was in 1986  Hispanics would have cast 9 7 million ballots instead of 6 8 million   Complete numbers for 2018 are still being compiled  In a preliminary analysis of Hispanic voter turnout last year  Catalist  a Democratic firm that builds voter lists  found significant increases in turnout of three to five percent  comparing 2018 with the 2014 midterms  Texas  Nevada and California saw five percent increases  Florida four percent  New Mexico and New York three percent Turnout rates and levels of support are two key  but quite different  political measures  While Latinos had a turnout rate of 27 1 percent in 2014  their support for Democratic House candidates that year was 62 percent  Their support for Republican House candidates was 36 percent  according to exit polls While Democratic support among Hispanics has improved over the past decade  from the low 60s to the high 60s  there is evidence suggesting that those gains cannot be relied upon in future elections In the midterm elections  Florida became the prime example of such unreliability  as Republicans demonstrated they could buck state and national trends to make substantial gains among Hispanics Republicans won two close statewide races in Florida in 2018  one for senate and one for governor   despite the gradual erosion of Republican support among Cuban Americans in the state and despite the continuing influx of pro Democratic Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017 Simon Rosenberg  president of NDN  formerly the New Democrat Network  a pro Democratic think tank  wrote   In All Important Florida  Democrats Lose Ground With Hispanic Voters  a month after the 2018 election In an election where Democrats had one of their best years ever with Hispanic voters across the country  Florida Democrats saw their Hispanic numbers decline  Nationally  Democrats went from 62 36  26 pts  in 2014 to 69 29  40 pts  this election  In Florida  Democrats went from 58 38  20 pts  in 2014 to 54 44  10 pts  this year As Rosenberg pointed out  this shift occurred despite the fact that Trump did everything possible to alienate Latinos  along with undercutting Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis  the winning Republican candidates for Senate and governor Rosenberg noted that Trump hadrelentlessly attacked immigrants and Hispanics in particular  He grossly mismanaged the aftermath of Hurricane Maria  sending hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans fleeing to Central Florida  He revoked the temporary status of many immigrants in Florida  Given all this  one would have imagined the environment for Democrats to make gains among Hispanics was present in Florida this year  gains which were made elsewhere  Yet we fell back By all accounts  Scott and DeSantis campaigned almost daily in Hispanic precincts  while their Democratic opponents  Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum  took the Hispanic vote for granted  We had no infrastructure   Christian Ulvert  Gillum s director for Spanish language media  told Politico And honestly  Democrats have been playing catch up on Hispanic outreach for two decades  because Republicans have invested in it  You can t close that gap overnight Politico described Nelson s bid for a fourth term as  a uniquely lazy campaign that made laughably ineffectual attempts to engage with Hispanics  Melissa Michelson  a political scientist at Menlo College in California and president of the Latino caucus of the American Political Science Association  described in an email the changing political orientation of Florida s Cuban Americans In a 1989 90 survey  Michelson wrote  68 8 percent of Cuban Americans identified with Republicans  Since then there have been significant changes  Over the years  she continued  Pew has documented a steady decline in Cuban Americans  Republican identification  from 64 percent in 2002 to 56 percent in 2006 to 47 percent in 2013 Despite the decline in Republican support among Cuban Americans  Michelson emphasized thatThere has always been a contingent of Latinos who identify as Republican and are more interested in Republican conservative  or anti Communist  policies than in immigration issues or racism  Recall that 40 percent of Latinos voted for Bush in 2004  Reagan also enjoyed considerable Latino support  I think many Democrats are continually perplexed by this   that there could be Latino voters who are willing to support a president  or candidate  like Trump whose rhetoric and policies are so clearly anti Latino and racist While Scott and DeSantis revived Cuban American willingness to support Republicans  two of the three Florida House seats that had been represented by Cuban American Republicans switched parties in 2018 Revealing a contrast to Florida  Matt A  Barreto  a political scientist at U C L A  and a co founder of Latino Decisions  analyzed turnout and voting patterns in Texas  In a March report  Barreto described a huge pro Democratic turnout increase there  ranging from 105 to 125 percent in eight counties where Hispanics make up more than 90 percent of the population  There were significant gains in counties with white majorities of 83 to 91 percent too  but these upturns were smaller  in the 35 to 55 percent range The ability of two conservative Florida Republicans to make such inroads simply by campaigning diligently suggests that the Democratic hold on Latinos is less firm than many believed So where do Latinos stand politically The NBC News Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 918 Hispanics during 2018 and found that Trump s job approval rating was a relatively dismal 30 percent  21 points below his 51 percent favorability rating among whites  but 18 points higher than his 12 percent approval rate among African Americans The data  provided to The Times by Public Opinion Strategies  one of the two firms that conducted the survey  found that Trump s approval among Hispanics was highest among men and among the affluent   40 percent for both   and among men without college degrees  at 39 percent A 2018 Pew report   Key takeaways about Latino voters in the 2018 midterm elections   found that Hispanics cast a decisive majority of votes for Democratic congressional candidates  69 29   a smaller percentage of votes  however  than African Americans  90 9  and Asian Americans  77 23   Whites backed Republicans  54 to 44 In a state by state breakdown  Pew found that in the Texas Senate race  Latinos backed Democrat Beto O Rourke over Ted Cruz by nearly two to one  64 35  while Greg Abbott  the incumbent Republican governor  lost the Hispanic vote to Democratic challenger Lupe Valdez  53 42 In Florida  Democrats Gillum and Nelson won the Hispanic vote by nearly equal percentages  54 44 and 54 45    but in both cases by margins that were inadequate to produce overall victory The Democratic winner in the Nevada Senate race  Jacky Rosen  did far better among Hispanics  who backed her over Dean Heller  the Republican incumbent  67 30 While many Democrats expected Trump s anti immigrant rhetoric and policies  especially the family separation debacle  to produce a decisive shift to the left among Hispanics  that has not proved to be the case An October 2018 Pew report found that almosthalf of Latinos  48 percent  believe there is about the right amount of immigrants living in the U S   while a quarter say there are too many immigrants and 14 percent say there are too few  Three quarters of Hispanics opposed Trump s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border  while one in five favors construction In an email  Barreto  of Latino Decisions  argued that Democratic support among Hispanics remains solid I do not see anything since November 2018 to suggest Dems are losing any support at all  Trump continues on the same path of bashing immigrants and bashing Latinos without evidence and this only further decreases his favorability among Latinos Asked about the declining share of eligible Hispanics turning out on Election Day  Barreto countered that the growing numbers of eligible Latinos arealmost entirely driven by U S  born young Latinos turning 18 and entering the eligible voter pool In a common pattern  Barreto pointed out   young people have very low rates of voter registration and voter turnout   especially in midterm elections  Because of that  Barreto said that in order to get a better picture  the data should be age adjusted so that turnout levels of older voters of different races and ethnicities could be compared Barreto is also sharply critical of most polling of Hispanics and of exit polls in particular  arguing that the lack of Spanish speaking interviewers results in an undercount of Hispanic turnout as well as inaccurate estimates of Republican and Democratic votes In addition  candidates and political parties have to make a much stronger case to young Hispanics that their vote matters  according to Barreto Otherwise  you will only get incremental growth each year   which still puts Latinos as a larger and larger share of the electorate  but perhaps not as large as we could be Rosenberg  of NDN  argues that the Democratic Party did not start targeting the Hispanic electorate  with modern campaign tactics and communications  until the 2006 8 period  Those efforts immediately bore fruit  Rosenberg contended in an email Remember that in 2004 Bush won Arizona  Colorado  New Mexico and Nevada  Now Colorado and New Mexico are no longer really competitive at the presidential level  Nevada is slipping away from the Republicans  and Democrats elected a Senator in 2018 in Arizona Texas  according to Rosenberg   is about to hit a tipping point   in large part because of the Hispanic vote What conclusions and what questions remain in the wake of these complex and sometimes conflicting trends in the Hispanic electorate First and foremost  Latinos remain a decisively Democratic constituency  with important caveats Brian Schaffner  a political scientist at Tufts and co principal researcher at the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  wrote in an email that nationally  Hispanic support for Democrats has been relatively consistent Schaffner provided the accompanying graph  which shows the level of voting for Democrats in House contests in the six elections from 2008 to 2018 for whites  blacks  Asian Americans and Hispanics  The Hispanic Democratic vote shows a significant 8 6 point increase from 2014 to 2016 and a 13 6 point increase from 2014 to 2018   call it the Trump jump   although the increase in the percentage of Asian Americans voting for Democrats was even larger at 20 2 points Who Votes for DemocratsOf votes for the two major party candidates in House races  the share that went

Source  analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election Study by Brian Schaffner  Tufts UniversityLatinos  partisan loyalties are much less hard and fast than  say  those of either African Americans or white evangelicals  The results in Florida demonstrate that Democrats risk defeat if they fail to campaign heavily in Hispanic communities  and Republicans stand to gain at the margins if they are prepared to invest time  money and energy The major question mark going into 2020  assuming Trump is the Republican nominee  is whether Hispanic opposition to his presidency will prevent a recurrence of the Florida 2018 phenomenon  Will Trump s presence so nationalize the election that down ballot Republicans will face a brick wall when they try to make modest inroads among Hispanics To date  Trump has shown every intention of turning the election into a referendum on himself  and all the baggage he carries  with no regard for the political survival of fellow Republicans  If anything  he appears determined to drive up hostility to him among Latinos  For the past two days  for example  the president has ranted on Twitter  attacking Puerto Rico and its political leaders On Monday  he told his Twitter followers Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works On Tuesday  he was still at it All their local politicians do is complain   ask for more money  The pols are grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA Behaving this way  Trump may succeed in driving up support among  his people   as he likes to call his voters  But if he keeps it up  he will be doing both his Democratic opponent and the Democratic Party as a whole a huge favor as far as the Latino vote goes The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s

RALEIGH  N C    When Republicans took control of virtually every lever of North Carolina s state government for the first time since Reconstruction  they set out to transform the historically moderate Southern state into a more conservative stronghold That was less than seven years ago These days  the question is how much Republicans may have set their project back with a recent string of remarkable self inflicted wounds  It s never a dull moment with the Republicans here   said Morgan Jackson  a Democratic strategist and an ally of Gov  Roy Cooper  the Democrat whose November 2016 election was helped along by the protracted fight over a Republican backed bill limiting the bathroom choices of transgender people   Every time we think it can t get worse  they figure out a way to dig deeper  This week  federal prosecutors announced that the chairman of the state s Republican Party  Robin Hayes  had been indicted on charges of bribery and other crimes related to a scheme they said was designed to aid a major donor  who was also charged  The revelation came almost six weeks after Republicans faced the rare embarrassment of watching their seeming victory in a congressional race unravel after it became clear that their nominee had financed an illicit voter turnout effort  Read  Inside a Fly by Night Operation to Harvest Ballots in North Carolina For the state s Republicans  who rose to power by railing against cases of Democratic corruption and promising to be a positive disrupting force  the fresh scandals amount to a staggering record of self disruption For the state s liberals  it has been a moment to bask in schadenfreude  Over the last several years  they watched and warred with North Carolina Republicans amid aggressive conservative efforts to deregulate industry  play down climate change  curtail access to the ballot box  strip a Democratic governor of some executive powers  launch their so called  bathroom bill  and gerrymander districts in ways that made the courts recoil Republicans won some of those fights and lost others  but the hard right turn plunged the state into years of intense partisan warfare rife with high profile boycotts and large scale public demonstrations It is this record  and the recent bouts with scandal  that could also affect state and national elections next year Mr  Cooper will be up for re election  as will Senator Thom Tillis  a Republican whose delicate political situation was recently underscored by his opposition to   then eventual support of   President Trump s controversial executive action to fund a border wall And once again  this battleground state will be up for grabs in a presidential race   one that will unfold as Charlotte  the state s largest city  hosts the Republican National Convention  where Mr  Trump is likely to make his case for re election But there is also a chance that Democrats might end up ensnared in the most recent federal probe The donor who was charged  Greg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham  gave money to both parties  In the indictment unsealed Tuesday  federal prosecutors said Mr  Lindberg worked with Mr  Hayes to bribe the state insurance commissioner  Mike Causey  with campaign donations in the hopes that Mr  Causey would replace a state regulator who oversaw a company that Mr  Lindberg owned Mr  Hayes  who is a former congressman  Mr  Lindberg and two other men who were charged pleaded not guilty on Tuesday in appearances before a federal magistrate in Charlotte Mr  Causey  a Republican  tipped off federal investigators about possible corruption and later worked closely with them during their protracted inquiry  In an interview on Wednesday  Mr  Causey said he did not expect Republicans to be alone in facing the fallout  This is certainly not a party thing   Mr  Causey said  adding   I think when the facts come out  you re going to see both parties in the same boat  ImageGreg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham  has been accused of working with Mr  Hayes to bribe the state insurance commissioner CreditRobert Brown Public Relations  via Associated PressMr  Causey would not elaborate  and a spokeswoman for the F B I  declined to comment Although the indictment focused on Mr  Lindberg s dealings with Republicans  his ties to Democrats have also been under scrutiny in recent months Wayne Goodwin  a former insurance commissioner who is now chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party  accepted donations from Mr  Lindberg and later consulted for him  Mr  Goodwin told The Wall Street Journal this year that he was not a target of the federal inquiry  with which he said he cooperated The speculation around Mr  Goodwin  who has not been charged  did not keep his state party operation from taking a gleeful swing at its opponent  In a statement  Democrats mashed the scandals together and also nodded to the turmoil surrounding Representative Mark Walker  a North Carolina Republican whose ties to Mr  Lindberg were referenced in the indictment that became public this week   Mr  Walker was not charged with a crime and was not identified by name in the indictment   Bribery  Election fraud  Witness tampering  Lying to the F B I    Wednesday s Democratic Party statement declared  adding that 2019 would be the year when  North Carolina Republicans  corruption finally became public  and the party s leading figures  became fully engulfed in chaos  Carter Wrenn  a longtime Republican consultant in North Carolina  said the allegations of chicanery created  a smell in the air and around the Republican Party   The party  he said  would do well to try to quickly isolate the scandals Indeed  the Republican Party played down the idea of chaos  even as it moved to put a limited distance between itself and the accused  In a statement on Wednesday  it said Mr  Hayes had  relinquished most of his day to day duties  and that another Republican leader  Aubrey Woodard  had been named acting chairman  On Monday  the day before his indictment became public  Mr  Hayes said he planned to step down later this year as party chairman  citing his health The indictment is a dramatic turn of events for Mr  Hayes  73  a former State House majority whip whose family founded the Cannon Mills textiles company  and who has long been an advocate of integrating biblical principles into state government  He opposes abortion and was criticized  in an unsuccessful 1996 run for governor  for supporting a sex education curriculum that promoted abstinence and recommended cleaning genitals with Lysol disinfectant after sex To critics  the new instability is a consequence of the party s years of dominance  when they controlled the Executive Mansion and had a supermajority in the General Assembly  Until this year there s been literally no check on these folks  except for the courts   said Allison Riggs  a senior lawyer at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice who has been involved in fighting Republican redistricting efforts in North Carolina Pat McCrory  a business minded former Charlotte mayor  was elected governor in 2012 and helped cement Republican power in North Carolina  But the party s state legislative leaders often set the aggressive tone  In March 2016  Republicans led the charge on the law that became known as H B  2  which curbed legal protections for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people and set new restrictions on transgender bathroom use The resulting national backlash  with boycotts and threats of boycotts  allowed Mr  Cooper  who was then challenging Mr  McCrory  to argue that Republicans were harming the business climate  In November 2016  on a night when Mr  Trump won the state  Mr  Cooper did  too  by a slim margin  A few months later  he and the Legislature arrived at a compromise to repeal the law Last year  the Republicans  power was further weakened when they lost their veto proof majorities in the Legislature But they are majorities still  proof of the continued power of conservative ideas in North Carolina In an interview in his office on Wednesday  Senator Phil Berger  the president pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate and long one of the most influential Republicans in the state  cautioned against drawing immediate conclusions about how the scandals would influence voters Still  he acknowledged that it was  frustrating  that scandals were so often overshadowing Republican policy achievements  Stepping on a rake   Mr  Berger said with a light chuckle   I see it as some Republicans doing something that creates problems for the vast majority of Republicans who haven t done anything wrong   

RAMALLAH  West Bank   Israel is holding an election on Tuesday  and Palestinian communities in the occupied territories are not following it with much interest  This is not because whoever is elected will not have a strong impact on our lives  It s because none of the leading candidates has a program for peace  The main contenders are committed to maintaining the illegal Jewish settlements that have been established in the West Bank  They do not seek to end the occupation  Israel has not formally annexed the West Bank or the Gaza Strip  but it lords over these lands like a sovereign power  Or worse  It has seized tax revenues from the Palestinian Authority  which is supposed to administer the West Bank  it keeps Gaza under siege  It dictates that we  Palestinians  can only watch from our homes the results of an election whose outcome will govern our lives and the future on our land  Israeli Jews in the West Bank are citizens  but we are not  They will be able to go into Israel to vote  Not us During the last Israeli election  in 2015  I wrote that Palestinians here had become less interested in the results of that race than in the prospect of filing various international legal cases  I  for one  had pinned my hopes on the preparation of several claims to be brought before the International Criminal Court in The Hague  One of them would challenge the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank  There was no lack of evidence  I thought  and the transfer of civilians by a government into territories it occupies is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 Now I think  Never mind the merits of any such cases  With the United States government threatening to refuse granting visas to the court s staff   this  in relation to another case  to do with suspected crimes in Afghanistan   our chances are slim  Last month  the Trump administration also recognized Israel s authority over the Golan Heights  disputed territory that Israel forcibly seized from Syria in 1967  This can only embolden Israel to eventually proceed with the formal annexation of the West Bank Israel  thanks partly to this support from the United States  now appears to be winning on all fronts  with impunity  And we Palestinians seem too weak to stop it Israelis  for their part  seem to live under the illusion popularized by their prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  that their government can manage the conflict   that there is no need to actually resolve it  Yet over the span of Mr  Netanyahu s premiership  the situation has gone from gloom to more gloom  from dark times to darker ones  from some measure of hope to despair Then again  at this point  maybe even darker would be better for us   maybe that s the only way out  My one consolation watching Israel pursue its current path is to think that it is doing itself damage  too Consider three examples Violence by Jewish settlers and right wing activists against Palestinians in the West Bank more than tripled last year  compared with 2017 An Israeli family built a home on land taken away from Palestinians   and then tried to rent it out on Airbnb  When the company balked  citing a new policy announced late last year against listing properties in settlements  the family brought a case for discrimination in the United States   The Palestinian family is suing back  Last week  a family near the village of Hizma  north of Jerusalem  whose house is in an Israeli settlement  chose to destroy its home of more than three decades rather than paying Israeli authorities to do the job  and being fined  Won t Israeli society at some point also feel the nefarious effects of its government s inhumanity toward us In Arundhati Roy s novel  The Ministry of Utmost Happiness   one of her characters  Musa  says that if Kashmiris have failed to gain independence from India  at least in struggling for it they have exposed the corruption of India s system  Musa tells the book s narrator  an Indian   You re not destroying us  You are constructing us  It s yourselves that you are destroying   Palestinians today might say the same of our struggle with Israel Raja Shehadeh is a lawyer and the author of  Where the Line Is Drawn  A Tale of Crossings  Friendships and Fifty Years of Occupation in Israel Palestine  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

ANKARA  Turkey   I am a 30 year old Turkish man  and for my entire adult life there has been a ritual to elections  There s a bitterly fought campaign  the polling day arrives  people vote  ballots are counted and Recep Tayyip Erdogan wins  He stands on the balcony of his Justice and Development Party s headquarters in Ankara and gives a victory speech to a cheering crowd  If you are part of that crowd  you feel as if you have become a little more important in the world  If you aren t  you feel as if you have become a little less relevant  This sequence of events has repeated itself for 17 years  On Sunday Turkey voted to elect the mayors of its 81 provinces and their municipalities  President Erdogan s party  known as the A K P   allied itself with the ultranationalist National Movement Party  the secularist main opposition Republican People s Party  the C H P   contested in partnership with Good Party  an outfit that splintered from the nationalists in 2018  The People s Democratic Party  the H D P    which is home to Kurdish left nationalists  cooperated with the opposition alliance in several major cities while running against the A K P  in the Kurdish majority southeastern provinces  It was a brutal contest  Mr  Erdogan personally campaigned every day and repeatedly accused his opponents of being terrorist collaborators  Most opposition candidates merely presented themselves as the non Erdogan option On Sunday night  Mansur Yavas  the C H P  candidate for Ankara mayor  was comfortably ahead of his rival from the A K P   which has controlled Ankara for 25 years  Despite the momentous developments in Ankara  all eyes were fixed on Istanbul  Ekrem Imamoglu  a young  energetic C H P  candidate  was briskly tallying up votes and catching up fast with Mr  Erdogan s chosen man for Istanbul  Binali Yildirim  a former prime minister and former speaker of the Turkish Parliament Our phones were exploding with WhatsApp messages  There was a photo of Mr  Yildirim writing a short victory speech  There was Mr  Imamoglu going on air and insisting that he was leading by his campaign s calculations  People were angry because the authorities stopped publishing results as Mr  Imamoglu caught up with Mr  Yildirim in the public figures Then a news flash  Mr  Erdogan was on the balcony  But something was off  As he stepped up to the crowd  he began singing along to the song booming into the night   These roses are for you  this soul is ours  Don t be sad  don t cry  Always smile   Mr  Erdogan s speech was short and vague  He said that he was honored to carry the popular vote  and that his party had done well in many provinces  none of which he named   Those who made false claims are welcome to it   he said   let us see how they govern   This was the closest he got to admitting the calamity  His A K P  had lost Ankara and Istanbul  apart from other major cities To understand the significance of this  it helps to know the dominant narrative of Turkish politics today  It goes something like this  Throughout its republican history  Turkey has been governed by a secular elite characterized by its impish adherence to Western imperialists A group of plucky conservatives kept challenging this system until  in 1994  a young Erdogan and his friend  now dismissed  won the mayoralties of Istanbul and Ankara  respectively  Amid the economic crises  weak coalition governments and civil unrest of the 1990s  Mr  Erdogan and his associates were islands of good governance  They served these great cities with distinction and earned a reputation of incorruptibility  In 2002  their movement  now under the banner of the A K P   was elected into national office  Under Mr  Erdogan s firm leadership  they grew the economy  fixed the bureaucracy and won up to half of the popular vote  Turkey was booming  the world talked about the  Turkish model  of majority Muslim democracy  By the mid 2010s  Mr  Erdogan had defanged the coup prone military and disenfranchised the corrupt elites of old  The jealous opposition parties joined shadowy outside actors in plotting the downfall of Turkey s great revival  Some of Mr  Erdogan s friends and allies betrayed him  but  the people  did not  When the economy slowed down  or the court system got clogged up  he asked people to sacrifice for the cause of what he called  New Turkey   a nation unshackled from Western domination and free to soar to new heights But the myth of New Turkey is paradoxical  It was built on doing practical things in the 1990s  like filling potholes  But to maintain the myth  Mr  Erdogan sometimes asked voters to ignore those practical things and simply to have faith in  the cause   On Sunday  there was a major breach in this wall of faith  especially in Istanbul  where Mr  Erdogan s love of the people first transmuted into government service  This was probably due to a combination of growing economic problems and an increasingly competent opposition  It is a close count in Istanbul  and the Supreme Electoral Council has asked for three days to check everything  As things stand  it seems that Mr  Imamoglu  the young and stubbornly positive candidate of the C H P   will get the job that started Mr  Erdogan s  great love affair  with the people 25 years ago If that doesn t happen  and the A K P  holds the city  people will know that Mr  Imamoglu went up against vastly unequal odds   the government s near monopoly on TV  its abundant use of state resources  its threats of litigation   and probably still won This could signal the limits of Mr  Erdogan s political strategy  Already in this election  opposition politicians mocked the president for calling ordinary voters terrorists  He strongly denied the claim and sued one of them  In a recently viral video  an old woman asked   Why should the man governing Turkey make a distinction between the people  Are those  opposition  parties always evil and you  Erdogan  are good  When populist rhetoric comes from a fresh face and aims at a calcified elite  it sounds plausible  When it has supplanted that elite  and it has reached its demographic limits  it begins to look ridiculous  And therein lies the problem of Mr  Erdogan s politics  He isn t honest with himself  He wants to dominate the political space and transform the country  but he isn t quite willing to engage in the scale of repression that would require  He demonizes his opposition as terrorist collaborators  yet still allows them to participate in elections  Mr  Erdogan s style of politics demands that he either crank up the intensity  or collapse under the weight of its own contradictions Selim Koru is an analyst at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara and a

Nearly five years ago  Lesley McSpadden appeared distraught before the world after finding out that a grand jury had declined to indict a white police officer in Ferguson  Mo   in the fatal shooting of her teenage son  Michael Brown  who was black She stood on top of a car  surrounded by a sea of supporters   I ve been here my whole life  I ain t never had to go through nothing like this   she said before sinking her face into her hands Ms  McSpadden  39  came up short on Tuesday in an attempt to turn that sorrow and anger into an elected post  She lost the three way race for a seat on the Ferguson City Council to Fran Griffin  a black woman who has been deeply involved in reform efforts in Ferguson since the death of Mr  Brown  who was 18 Ms  McSpadden s election bid was her latest effort to effect change in the name of her son  She made appearances with other black mothers who lost their children to violence  including on stage at the Democratic National Convention in 2016  She also testified before the Missouri State Legislature  I wanted to go back and do something right in a place that did something so very wrong to my son  and I think that s what my son would want as well   Ms  McSpadden said about her candidacy in an interview with The Associated Press About a year ago  she moved from a nearby community to Ferguson s third ward  a predominantly black part of town that includes the apartment complex where her son was killed The police officer who shot him  Darren Wilson  was cleared of criminal wrongdoing on both the state and federal level but resigned from the police force ImageMs  McSpadden at her son s funeral in August 2015 CreditRichard Perry The New York TimesThe killing helped incite a national movement for police accountability  It also led to a Justice Department investigation that found that the police and municipal court system routinely violated the rights of black residents with disparities in traffic stops and the use of force  among other things That report  which came during President Barack Obama s time in office  led city leaders to reach an agreement with federal officials in which they agreed to take steps to reform the city s legal system Mr  Brown s killing also helped to change the makeup of the Ferguson City Council  which had just one black member at the time of the shooting  Now  three of the six council members are black  the mayor is white One black council member elected after Mr  Brown s killing  Wesley Bell  recently defeated the white incumbent county prosecutor who had overseen the grand jury that declined to indict Mr  Wilson Ms  Griffin  who was one of Ms  McSpadden s opponents in the election  moved to Ferguson in 2005 from her hometown  St  Louis  so that her children could have better educational opportunities  she said  She had long experienced some of the disparities that came with being black in the St  Louis suburb   she was constantly stopped by the police while driving  and many of her family members refused to visit her because of their concerns about the police  she said After Mr  Brown was killed  Ms  Griffin  38  regularly attended street protests in Ferguson  When the city reached the agreement with federal authorities  known as a consent decree  Ms  Griffin joined a committee created to help revise local policies and practices  The committee has contributed to the overhauling of policies pertaining to police searches  the use of force  and dash and body cameras  she said  I have compassion and empathy for what she went through as a mother because I don t wish that pain on anybody   Ms  Griffin said of Ms  McSpadden  But she added that the city needed a representative who  a  is aware of the issues that are going on  b  has been actively working toward creating the change  c  has a connection to the community  is accessible to the community  If Ms  McSpadden wins  she would become the second black mother who lost her son in a contentious shooting to be elected to office within the past year In Georgia  Lucy McBath won a congressional seat last year  A man fatally shot her son  Jordan Davis  in 2012 in a dispute over loud music  That man  Michael Dunn  was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison  

CHICAGO   Lori Lightfoot  a political novice  swept into Chicago s City Hall in staggering style  winning 73 percent of the vote and sending a deafening message to the political veteran she had defeated  She pronounced the results a  broad mandate for change   She promised to break the city s endless cycle of corruption  She pledged to remake Chicago  Thriving  prosperous  better  stronger  fairer   for everyone   Ms  Lightfoot said  beaming from a microphone in the hours after the votes were cast But this is Chicago  a city that is vast  complex  set in its ways and full of problems that are now Ms  Lightfoot s to solve Ms  Lightfoot  who will become this city s first black woman mayor and its first openly gay mayor when she takes office in May  made clean government a centerpiece of her agenda  But Chicago still carries the vestiges of its notorious political machine and  by some measures  more corruption than any other American city  Chicago s entrenched and decades long struggles with crime  segregation  policing and inequity loom  And its longstanding fiscal problems are urgent  Ms  Lightfoot must come up with another  1 billion to deal with a looming pension crisis  and fast  This is all hard   said David Axelrod  a longtime Chicagoan and political strategist   She s just pulled off an extraordinary political feat and that bespeaks a certain intellect and strength that is important  There are other skills that will be needed now   to cajole people  to get people to accept compromise  to recognize how much of the loaf you can have   he added   This is really a challenging job and she comes to it in not optimal times   Read more about Mayor elect Lori Lightfoot here  Uncertainty in the City CouncilWhen Harold Washington  Chicago s first black mayor  arrived at City Hall in 1983 promising change  he was greeted with a stone wall of opposition from a large group of white aldermen  What followed was a period of racially charged political fighting that came to be known as Council Wars ImageHarold Washington  right  and his fiance  Mary Smith  joined hands with State Senator Richard Newhouse as Mr  Washington declared victory in the 1983 mayoral race CreditKen Love Associated PressWhile Ms  Lightfoot is unlikely to encounter that level of organized resistance from the 50 member City Council  she will have to contend with it as a formidable governing body  theoretically powerful  thick with alliances and at least partly stocked with aldermen who supported Ms  Lightfoot s opponent in the mayoral race  Toni Preckwinkle  Historically  mayors like Ms  Lightfoot s predecessor  Rahm Emanuel  have held a firm hand over the council in setting the city s agenda  but Ms  Lightfoot s relationship with the aldermen is uncertain for now  None of them owe their elections to Lori  and so for the first time in perhaps 55 years  you may see the emergence of the kind of Chicago city government that during that time has only existed on paper   a weak mayor strong City Council government   said Marilyn Katz  a political consultant who worked on the Harold Washington campaign   What she uses to get them to vote for her proposals is unclear  David Orr  a former county clerk who served briefly as an interim Chicago mayor in the 1980s  said he thought Ms  Lightfoot s overwhelming margin of victory   she won all 50 of the city s wards   would ease her efforts to make inroads with the City Council  It s going to be a battle  O K    a battle in the sense that power never wants to give up what it s got   Mr  Orr said Ja Mal Green  an activist and former mayoral candidate who supported Ms  Lightfoot  said he believed that voters understood that Ms  Lightfoot could not instantly make all the changes she has pledged  She s not going to be able to make good on every promise   Mr  Green said   She ll be able to start the path for all the things that she promised  The City Council is not the only possible roadblock between Ms  Lightfoot and her ambitious agenda  Ms  Lightfoot  who promised in her campaign to kill what s left of the sputtering  Chicago machine   a system of patronage and corruption that once dominated city politics  will also face the challenge of working with Ms  Preckwinkle  who remains the president of the Cook County Board and will work in an office near Ms  Lightfoot Ms  Preckwinkle and Ms  Lightfoot sparred during debates this year  yet they exited the campaign on a gracious note  At the urging of the Rev  Jesse Jackson  they both appeared on Wednesday morning at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition on the city s South Side  holding hands in a gesture of unity ImageEddie Johnson  Chicago s police superintendent  Ms  Lightfoot  who made gun violence and police misconduct central to her campaign  will have to decide whether to pursue her promised changes with new leadership in the Police Department CreditRich Hein Chicago Sun Times  via Associated PressCrime  Policing and Promises of ReformAnother challenge ahead for Ms  Lightfoot  the scandal prone police department and persistently high homicide rate  both of which damaged the city s reputation and vexed Mr  Emanuel through eight years in office She will quickly be tested  After running on promises to reduce gun violence  Ms  Lightfoot will take office just before summer  the season when shootings traditionally spike  No child should have to worry about the consequences of going to the park and no parent should have to keep their kids inside on a warm day for fear of violence   Ms  Lightfoot s campaign website said Generations of Chicago mayors have struggled to tamp down violence and root out police misconduct  sometimes making progress but never ending the problems  Ms  Lightfoot  who made the issues central to her campaign  will have to decide whether to pursue her promised changes with new leadership in the Police Department or keep Superintendent Eddie Johnson in his post Ms  Lightfoot s role with law enforcement is complex  She emerged in recent years as one of the chief critics of the police  and she led a panel that found patterns of excessive force  systemic racism and strained community relations in the department  But she has a background in law enforcement  including a stint as a federal prosecutor  and has worked in police oversight roles in Chicago  including as the president of the Chicago Police Board Vague Plan for a Financial MessPerhaps most of all  Ms  Lightfoot will be tested by the city s urgent fiscal woes All four of the pension funds are miserably underfunded  Ms  Lightfoot also must dream up a plan to solve an expected budget shortfall in the coming year  That all comes as Chicagoans are increasingly frustrated over mounting taxes and increased fees   and loath to even talk about digging up any more cash for City Hall  And the possibility of worse economic times could make matters even more dire  The city and state of Illinois descended into their worst in the nation financial condition during one of the longest economic expansions in U S  history   Laurence Msall  president of the Civic Federation  a watchdog group  said   Neither government is currently prepared to weather the storm in the event of a recession  particularly if it is deep or long lasting  The fiscal challenges have developed over decades and multiple mayors  and they loom  During a combative campaign  neither Ms  Lightfoot nor her opponent laid out a comprehensive plan to solve the problem  The hard part starts now   said Eric Adelstein  a political consultant in Chicago who helped with Ms  Lightfoot s campaign   There are huge challenges facing this city  It s an exciting moment  but these jobs are rough   

MOSCOW   The email came out of the blue  from an aide to the mysterious Russian billionaire  Oleg V  Deripaska  who is said to be close to President Vladimir V  Putin and an on again  off again character in the two year investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election Would I be interested in interviewing Mr  Deripaska  the aide asked  It was a bit like being summoned to meet with Greta Garbo or J D  Salinger Of course  I said  aware that Mr  Deripaska normally communicated  if at all  through the phalanx of lawyers and publicity agents he surrounded himself with  I wondered to myself why he had suddenly decided to speak out Soon enough  I found myself sitting alone in a hotel conference room  at a table bearing a gigantic fruit platter  unsure what to expect  This was  after all  a man who had emerged on top in Russia s bloody aluminum wars in the 1990s  and was accused in United States Treasury Department documents of suspected ties to organized crime  money laundering and ordering a contract killing He is a man of about average stature  whose most striking feature is his large  round head  He was intense  and spoke in a robotic English  so as not to worry about mistranslations  he said It soon became clear that he saw the determination of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  that the Trump administration had not colluded with Russia  at least according to a Justice Department summary of his findings  as an opening to rehabilitate his image in the West This despite the fact that Mr  Deripaska had refused to cooperate with the investigation  revealing for the first time that he had received written questions from the Mueller team but had declined to answer them  Do I feel like your president  that I am exonerated   he said at one point   I never felt guilty  It was annoying for me  There was this huge crush on my business  on my companies  when sanctions were put on the companies I founded  ImageLike President Trump  Mr  Deripaska took a victory lap after the special counsel s report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesOver cups of special black tea from his home region  Krasnodar  he complained of the tendency of the American news media to rush to judgment and professed confidence in the United States justice system  which he said would ultimately prove his innocence of any wrongdoing A graduate of a prestigious physics faculty  Mr  Deripaska rose to wealth in the 1990s  strong arming his way to a virtual monopoly over the Russian aluminum industry  When it placed sanctions on him and his companies last year  the Treasury Department cited his links to the Russian government  saying he profits from the country s  malign activity around the globe  Even while keeping a low profile  he pursued a costly lobbying and legal effort to assert his innocence  Initially  this revolved around sanctions on his businesses  and with the help of a global influence buying operation he did persuade the Treasury Department to lift sanctions on his aluminum empire in January Mr  Deripaska now wants to escape the personal sanctions  which hinder his ability to do business in the United States  Last month  he filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of those sanctions  which he claims have cost him  7 5 billion The conclusion that members of the Trump campaign had not colluded with Russians  Mr  Deripaska said  suggested the tide was shifting in campaigns of innuendo and guilt through leaks to the news media  If so  he said  the American justice system might also eventually clear him of other accusations never proven in court  such as ordering a contract murder  I always believe in justice   said Mr  Deripaska  whose lawyers have frequently fought to keep suits from being brought in American courts  saying they have no jurisdiction   For us outside the United States  Mueller signals that the U S  legal system is still alive  it still exists  Mr  Deripaska had faced scrutiny for financial entanglements with a former Trump campaign chairman  Paul J  Manafort  who in July 2016 reportedly asked an associate to offer Mr  Deripaska a private briefing on the presidential race  in hopes of settling a  26 million lawsuit stemming from a failed investment venture  The two had been business associates a decade ago  Mr  Deripaska had denied receiving the offer  but had not addressed these matters in detail while the investigation continued  There was a new reality in the U S  In politics  in social life  you do not respect presumption of innocence   he said  speaking of the sanctions imposed on him last year and leaks to the news media about the Russia investigation   There is no due process  Without any court  the public can consider people guilty of something  Mr  Deripaska was an early focus of the F B I  investigation into Russian meddling  In September 2016  two months before the election  F B I  agents questioned him in an early morning visit to his New York residence He declined to elaborate on the specific  written questions the special counsel later sent to Moscow  but said they generally tracked news media reports about prosecutors  suspicions  He did not answer on the advice of his lawyers  he said  Besides  he said   Why should I  ImageOnce business associates  Paul J  Manafort and Mr  Deripaska had fallen out by the time Mr  Manafort joined the Trump campaign in 2016 CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesMr  Manafort agreed to work for the Trump campaign for free  but did seek compensation elsewhere  In an email reported by The Washington Post  Mr  Manafort suggested to a former employee  Konstantin V  Kilimnik  that his dispute with the Russian tycoon might be resolved by offering  private briefings  about the campaign  Mr  Manafort also transferred internal Trump campaign polling data to Mr  Kilimnik  who the special counsel said had ties to Russian intelligence These circumstances still have congressional investigators alarmed   You might think it s O K  that the campaign chairman of a presidential campaign would offer information about that campaign to a Russian oligarch in exchange for money or debt forgiveness   Representative Adam B  Schiff  the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  said at a hearing last week   I don t  In the interview  Mr  Deripaska denied  as he had when The Washington Post first reported the offer of private briefings in 2017  ever having received from Mr  Manafort either an offer or any information about the campaign  For me  it s just absurd   he said   I had no interest in the U S  election  Why on earth  if I have no interest  would somebody offer private briefings to me   He last met Mr  Manafort in 2011  he said  It s not even sociable   he said of the reported offer of briefings   It looks like this  You haven t seen this guy  you know you have this huge sum of a dispute  and then you are like   Let s go and drink a cup of coffee   Mr  Deripaska said that he indeed suspended his multimillion dollar lawsuit against Mr  Manafort  but not because Mr  Manafort had asked him to do so or because he had received anything from the campaign chairman in return  My lawyers felt that might put me at risk  which anyway happened later  when Manafort appeared in the campaign   he said  referring to the eventual sanctions that came in 2018   They didn t want to bring more attention   to the business dispute with a man who had become prominent in American politics  he said  He later refiled the lawsuit In fighting to lift the personal sanctions  Mr  Deripaska must overcome years old accusations of ties to organized crime related to his path from the ashes of the former Soviet Union s aluminum industry to a billionaire with global reach  and allegations he is a front for the Kremlin on foreign policy matters Mr  Deripaska called these accusations  balderdash  and his lawsuit challenged the sanction on constitutional grounds  He also denied he is close to Mr  Putin  insisting he only deals with the government on matters of business regulation The conclusion of the special counsel s investigation  he said  gave him hope for success   I reaffirm to myself that the U S  systems  that U S  institutions  still exist   

KIEV  Ukraine   The candidate who placed third in the first round of Ukraine s presidential election conceded defeat Tuesday  but alleged the incumbent who came in second rigged the results in his favor Opinion polls had shown Yulia Tymoshenko  a former prime minister who has been a fixture in Ukrainian politics for two decades  leading the race until a few months before Sunday s election With nearly 99  percent of ballots counted  comic actor Volodymyr Zelenskiy had garnered 30  of the vote  President Petro Poroshenko was next with just under 16   while Tymoshenko received 13  That means that Ukraine s new president will be elected in a runoff between Zelenskiy and Poroshenko on April 21 In her concession remarks  Tymoshenko alleged Poroshenko had manipulated the vote  He should not be in the runoff   she said   He got there by cheating  Tymoshenko did not specify what kind of election interference she thought occurred  although she had accused Poroshenko in the days before the election of buying votes Speaking to reporters on a trip out of town  Poroshenko wouldn t comment on Tymoshenko s allegations and said that she  should put up with  her defeat at the polls The president promised a democratic election last week  saying Ukraine had a lot at stake Tymoshenko said she would not contest the election results because she believes Poroshenko controls the courts  She refused to endorse either Zelenskiy or Poroshenko for the runoff She said she and her party would now focus on the parliamentary election in the fall  which could give her a post in a new government  The chance we ve lost in the first round of the presidential election is just one chance   Tymoshenko said   We still have one opportunity left to bring in a dramatic change  to implement a new course  and this is the next parliamentary elections    Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report

BANGKOK   An activist opposed to military rule in Thailand says his car was set on fire and gutted early Monday  just hours after he attended a rally protesting the Election Commission s alleged mismanagement of the March 24 general election Ekachai Hongkangwan has been the repeated target of physical and legal attacks  including a previous one on his car that did less damage  On March 5  he was attacked by two men on a motorcycle who tried to beat him with a wooden stick and a metal pipe Before his car was torched  Ekachai had joined fellow activists at a rally to gather signatures for the impeachment of Election Commission members  The rally was the first notable public protest since the election  whose results are to be officially confirmed on May 9  The Election Commission has been accused of releasing delayed and inconsistent vote totals  among other faults A statement issued Monday by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan ocha s office appeared to be a response to election protests  There are groups of people with bad intentions who create misinformation and use social media and agents to plant false ideas with the people  with the aim of creating chaos and damaging the country  religion  and monarchy   it said It said the government would enforce the rule of law and urged all citizens to be aware of the situation  If everyone cooperates and helps prevent the country from disturbance or slipping back into chaos  our country will be able to move toward sustainable and stable development   it said  The military has said it staged a 2014 coup against an elected government because of chaotic political conditions The junta took power after the coup and has changed the constitution and election laws to handicap parties opposed to it  Prayuth  who is junta chief as well as prime minister  is expected to return to office  largely due to the electoral measures implemented by the military government However  he could become prime minister but have a House of Representatives under opposition control  making it hard to pass laws and a budget  With weeks to go before final election results are certified  opponents of the junta are fearful that the Election Commission may disqualify enough of the winning anti junta lawmakers to make it impossible for them to form a majority in the lower house Ekachai has been a well known activist since at least 2013  when he was sentenced to three years in prison for allegedly defaming the monarchy by selling CDs which contained an ABC Australia documentary and copies of WikiLeaks documents He told The Associated Press on Monday that he believed his car was damaged because of his work on the election  but that  it is useless to be fearful  They want us to be afraid  So  if I am afraid  they will get what they want   He said another activist who had been campaigning for signatures had been assaulted Ekachai said it was lucky that 200 300 signed petitions that were in his car were only burned around the edges and were still in good condition  I will definitely use them  adding them to our petition effort   he said  

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O Rourke has said in recent weeks that his visiting all 254 counties in Texas during his failed Senate bid last year helped boost the state s voter turnout  That may be  but he s giving the wrong numbers on how much turnout among young people increased Since joining the presidential race last month  O Rourke has said in events from Iowa to Texas that youth voter turnout boomed during the race he narrowly lost to Republican Sen  Ted Cruz A look at his claim  most recently made during an event in El Paso  Texas  on Saturday O ROURKE   The state saw young voter turnout up 500  over the last midterm election  THE FACTS  Voter turnout by people under 30 did not jump nearly that much last year  Texas did see a large increase in those young voters  though More than 1 million young voters cast a ballot in the 2018 midterm election  a 234  increase from the 2014 midterm elections  according to voting data from the Texas secretary of state s office Initial reports suggested young voter turnout increased as much as 508  during early voting in Texas when compared with early voting in 2014  according to data released by a political consulting firm a week before the 2018 election O Rourke spokesman Chris Evans acknowledged his candidate used those figures without making the distinction that they represent an incomplete portion of early votes cast   not total turnout in the election Overall  voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election increased 77  in Texas over 2014 totals Dozens of other states saw gains in young voter turnout  according to Abby Kiesa  who researches youth turnout at Tufts University Kiesa said the 2018 midterm elections experienced a  strong trend  of voters under 30 casting ballots  A competitive Senate race and a number of groups that registered college students helped push those voters to the polls in Texas  where young voter turnout has been historically low  Something really significant happened in Texas   Kiesa said of the 2018 election   It s likely attributable to many factors     Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

MADISON  Wis    Conservative Brian Hagedorn s strong showing in Wisconsin s Supreme Court race cheered state Republicans Wednesday  with their first positive result in a statewide election since 2016 suggesting reasons for optimism next year in a critical presidential battleground Hagedorn led liberal backed Lisa Neubauer by 5 962 votes   less than half a percentage point   in a race that could still go to a recount  But it came after a string of losses by Republicans in special and statewide elections since Donald Trump carried the state While Republicans were excited  they were also cautious about what Hagedorn s showing means for President Donald Trump s re election  Nobody should assume because Republicans won this race that they will continue to win everything else   Republican strategist and former state GOP leader Brandon Scholz said   This is one election where all the pieces came together at the end  2020 is an entirely different  politically charged animal with the presidential race  Republican U S  Sen  Ron Johnson  who has been leading GOP efforts to rebound following the 2018 election  credited Hagedorn s showing with a ground up engagement with conservatives who were angry with attacks in the race and national Democratic priorities  This is the recipe for success   he said   That s what I ve been preaching since the day after the November 2018 election  We have to energize  rely on the grassroots  Hagedorn benefited from a late infusion of  1 2 million from the Republican State Leadership Committee  Conservative talk radio  including former Republican Gov  Scott Walker for three hours the day before the election  also worked to drive up turnout Republicans compared attacks on Hagedorn to those on U S  Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh  National political fights over the release of Robert Mueller s investigation into Trump and ongoing court battles over a lame duck legislative session in Wisconsin also fueled interest in the race  GOP strategists said Hagedorn said attacks against him over long ago blog writings  including calling Planned Parenthood a  wicked organization  and denouncing court rulings that favored gay rights  motivated his supporters Democrats took the result as a sign that despite a string of wins  including ousting Walker in November  nothing can be taken for granted  Not that Democrats needed it  but it s another wakeup call that every single election here is going to be highly competitive   said Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki   This is not a red state  This is not a blue state  This is the deepest shade of purple there is on the spectrum  Neubauer didn t immediately say whether she would request a recount  which would face a tough challenge in overturning such a large margin and which would come at her expense  She immediately appealed to supporters for money in case she pursues the recount  Counties have until April 12 to report final vote totals  and Neubauer has three days after that to request a recount The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been the deciding force in several partisan battles over policy in recent years  and is itself clearly partisan   conservatives hold a 4 3 edge  Democrats had hoped Neubauer would capture a seat currently held by a liberal justice  maintaining that spread but positioning them to win the majority in another election next year Unless Hagedorn s apparent victory is undone by recount  conservatives instead will enjoy a 5 2 majority and won t be at risk of losing it until at least 2023  The high court already looks likely to decide early disputes between new Democratic Gov  Tony Evers and majority Republicans in the Legislature Turnout was nearly 27   well above the 22  of last year s state Supreme Court race  Hagedorn overcame Neubauer s huge margins in the liberal strongholds of Madison and Milwaukee by running up the vote in Green Bay and more rural parts of northeastern and north central Wisconsin  Those are both parts of the state that helped fuel Trump s win in 2016 Wisconsin recounted its presidential vote in 2016 at Green Party candidate Jill Stein s expense  In that recount of nearly 3 million ballots  only 131 votes were changed   in favor of Trump  Neubauer  in a recount of just 1 2 million ballots  would have to pick up 45 times as many votes The 2016 presidential recount cost local election clerks  2 million   more than the  1 7 million Neubauer raised during the entire campaign through March 18  However  those costs included overtime for clerks who had to count nearly 2 9 million votes under a tight deadline due to the Electoral College Given the recent tight elections  Republicans are taking nothing for granted going into 2020  Johnson said  We have to run almost perfect elections going forward   he said  If  Democrats  are energized  we re going to have issues  Nobody will be overconfident  We know what s at stake        Associated Press writer Ivan Moreno contributed to this report from Pewaukee  Wisconsin  

NEW DELHI   Millions of Hindus will wake up at the crack of dawn this Saturday  five days before the start of India s general election  and march to nearby temples to chant a sacred hymn and renew a pledge to build a temple on the ruins of a 16th century mosque Hardline Hindu allies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  say they will mobilize more than 10 million people on April 6   the start of the Hindu New Year   to shore up support for the contentious plan to build a temple in the northern town of Ayodhya But while the event will keep the focus on a core demand of India s Hindu nationalists  it will not overtly be part of the BJP s election campaign  signaling a softer approach by the ruling party  multiple sources familiar with discussions said The commitment to construct a grand temple in Ayodhya to the Hindu god king Ram has been part of the BJP s election manifesto since the 1990s and has helped the party garner Hindu votes in state and federal elections since then However  the BJP and its allies are concerned that focusing on the temple issue could be too hot to handle  especially since it is now the party in power  It could worsen communal tensions and trigger religious riots in the country  said a senior BJP leader  We cannot underestimate the power of Hindu fringe groups  and it s best not to ignite these issues   said a BJP leader who is overseeing the party s election strategy The BJP leader and two other senior party members  two federal ministers and four members of hardline Hindu groups  who didn t wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue  said they reached a consensus to fold the temple issue into a broader religious and cultural discourse  without being too vocal about it Following a meeting between senior religious leaders and BJP politicians in January  the Vishwa Hindu Parishad  VHP  or the World Hindu Council  which is leading the movement for building the Ayodhya temple  put its agitation on hold in February Details of the meeting have not been published previously The VHP  which shares ideological ties with the BJP  would renew its demand only after the general election  its leaders said  While we remain committed to the cause that is so close to the hearts of Hindus  we re unanimous in our view that it s not the right time to amplify the temple issue   said Alok Kumar  international working president of the VHP   Politicization leads to controversies  HINDU MUSLIM RIOTSThe VHP has distributed pamphlets and issued appeals on social media to participate in a chanting ceremony aimed at renewing the pledge to build the temple on the spot where many Hindus believe Ram was born  where the mosque stood Sanjay Mayukh  a BJP spokesman in New Delhi  declined comment on the April 6 event being organized by the VHP  We wish them  VHP  a success and we will celebrate the Hindu New Year too   said Mayukh A militant Hindu mob tore down the mosque in 1992  sparking riots that killed about 2 000 people in one of the worst instances of sectarian violence in India since independence in 1947 The mosque  built by a Muslim ruler in 1528  has been one of the prime causes of conflict between India s majority Hindus and minority Muslims  who constitute 14 percent of the country s 1 3 billion people  India s Supreme Court is now in control of the site in Uttar Pradesh state and has been weighing petitions from both communities on what should be built there In March  the country s top court appointed an arbitration panel to mediate in the dispute  It s verdict is yet to come BJP election candidates confirmed they are avoiding the temple issue in their campaigns Former government minister and BJP lawmaker Sanjeev Baliyan  who is contesting the election from a constituency in Uttar Pradesh  said he has instructed supporters to  refrain from using the Ayodhya issue in any political rally   At least 65 people were killed in clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Baliyan s constituency in 2013  The danger of any religious tension spilling out of our control would change the election mood  Best to keep religious issues away from politics for now   he told Reuters Instead  Baliyan said  his campaign would focus on the BJP s achievements during its last five years in power and national security issues Most pollsters expect the BJP to emerge to win the highest number of seats in the election after recent military exchanges between India and arch enemy Pakistan led to a wave of nationalist fervor that has helped Modi But the pollsters say the BJP is unlikely to repeat its sweeping victory of 2014 because of the government s inability to provide jobs to the millions of youngsters coming into the job market each year and depressed rural incomes The BJP is also under fire from small business owners  traditional supporters of the party  who say they have suffered because of a rocky start to the Goods and Services Tax  India s biggest tax reform  and Modi s shock move to ban high value banknotes in 2016 The big question may be whether the BJP gets enough seats in the 544 member lower house of parliament to govern without having to form a coalition with other parties India begins voting on April 11 and the staggered election is scheduled to end on May 19  Results will be declared on May 23 Ambuj Nigam  the leader of the Vishwa Hindu Dal  a Hindu hardline Hindu group that came into existence in 2018  said the demand for a temple would again gain momentum after the general election  We have put all our controversial works on hold   said Nigam   But as soon as election results are out  we will bring Hindu nationalism back to the forefront    Additional reporting Zeba Siddiqui   Editing by Martin

BANGKOK   Thailand s influential army chief warned Tuesday that the military will fight any moves that threaten the country s system of constitutional monarchy with the king as head of state  in an apparent threat directed at supporters of a new anti junta party  The army does the army s duty  which is to protect  maintain  and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy   Gen  Apirat Kongsompong said at a news conference Apirat appeared to be targeting intellectuals backing the Future Forward Party  which according to preliminary figures ran a strong third in the March 24 general election Apirat s words  come as an intimidating knock out punch against any Thai political critics of Thailand s system of government   said Paul Chambers  a lecturer in political science at Naresuan University in northern Thailand   But more explicitly  the words seem to attack Future Forward Party  whose leaders have seemed particularly critical of the junta and military  and who in the past discussed the monarchy  Future Forward Party co founder Piyabutr Saenkanokkul used to be part of the Nitirat Group  legal scholars who sought reforms in Thailand s lese majeste law  which carries stiff prison terms for people found guilty of defaming the monarchy Apirat suggested that scholars who have studied abroad may have lost their understanding of the  Thai style democratic system  Pitabutr received his master s and doctoral degree in France  and other prominent members of the Nitirat Group studied law in Germany  Don t introduce the leftist views you learned that made you all pretentious   Apirat said The military backed Palang Pracharath Party won the most popular votes in the March polls  and its candidate  Prayuth Chan ocha  is likely to become prime minister  but could end up with the opposition holding a majority of seats in the House of Representatives  Prayuth led a 2014 coup that ousted an elected government and since then has served as junta chief and prime minister Supporters of the Future Forward Party believe the courts and the Election Commission may try to disqualify some of its winning candidates  or even the entire party  ahead of the release of official election results on May 9 Thai social media since the election has been buzzing with postings seeking to discredit the Future Forward Party One recently circulated video shows excerpts of a lecture Piyabutr gave in 2013  when he taught law at Bangkok s Thammasat University  He has said it was to explain the relationship of democracy to monarchies in political systems worldwide  But it has been cast by his party s opponents as criticism of Thailand s monarchy An obscure right wing group  Political Civic Group  said it has filed a complaint with the Election Commission about Piyabutr s statements  claiming they violated election law  He has denied the allegations against him and charged the video was taken out of context to undermine him Apirat also criticized activists who charge that the Election Commission mismanaged the polls and are seeking to impeach its members  Once the referee has made a ruling  you blame the referees  When boxers fight  this guy loses  and you blame the referees  If it s like this it will never end  It will be a never ending cycle of revenge and disapproval  How can it end  I ve said already   Apirat said  before taking a long pause   I don t want to say something too harsh  After becoming army commander  Apirat told reporters last October that he refused to rule out more coups if there is political unrest  If politics does not create riots  nothing will happen   he said His father  Gen  Sunthorn Kongsompong  helped carry out a 1991 coup and served as junta leader for more than a year  

ANKARA   Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul urged the High Election Board  YSK  on Wednesday to confirm him as the elected mayor after it ruled in favour of a partial recount of votes in 18 of the city s 39 districts Initial results from Sunday s mayoral elections showed the opposition Republican People s Party  CHP  had narrowly won control of Turkey s two biggest cities  Istanbul and Ankara  in a shock upset for President Tayyip Erdogan s ruling AK Party If those results are confirmed in the coming days  the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32 6 billion liras   5 79 billion  for 2019 in Istanbul  Turkey s commercial hub  and the capital Ankara Erdogan   who campaigned hard for the AKP ahead of the vote   would likely lose some oversight for local contracts in the two cities  possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession  However the AKP submitted objections to election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara  saying the results had been impacted by invalid votes and voting irregularities In Istanbul  CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu  and his AKP rival  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  both said on Monday that Imamoglu was about 25 000 votes ahead  a relatively slim margin in a city of some 15 million people The chairman of the Election Board  YSK   Sadi Guven  said on Wednesday it had ruled that the recount of what had been marked as invalid votes should go ahead in eight Istanbul districts  some of them AKP strongholds  but added that appeals were still underway The state run Anadolu news agency later said the YSK decided to recount invalid votes in 15 districts and all votes in three other districts as a result of the appeals  The AKP had said previously there were more than 300 000 invalid votes  Six of the 18 districts being recounted were initially won by the CHP  one by the nationalist MHP  and the rest by the AKP  according to Anadolu  Imamoglu called on the YSK to  do its job  and name him mayor  accusing the AKP of disrespecting the people of Istanbul  We want justice  We demand our mandate from the YSK  which has given the numbers  as the elected mayor of this city    The world is watching us   he told reporters After Imamoglu spoke  the hashtag  MazbatamiziVerin  Give our Mandate  was the top trending topic on Twitter in Turkey AKP Deputy Chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said his party was not doing anything illegal and added that the vote difference between Imamoglu and Yildirim had fallen to below 20 000 votes  We believe the reality will emerge tonight and we will all accept the results   Yavuz told reporters LOCAL PURSE STRINGSPro government newspapers on Wednesday said there had been a conspiracy against Turkey in the local elections  with the Star newspaper likening this to an attempted military coup in 2016 and nationwide protests in 2013  Yeni Safak newspaper editor Ibrahim Karagul called for a second vote after what he termed a  coup via elections   adding without providing evidence that supporters of the U S  based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen   blamed by Ankara for the 2016 coup attempt   were involved In Ankara  opposition candidate Mansur Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes on Sunday  nearly 4 percentage points ahead of his AKP rival  Recounts were planned in 11 Ankara districts due to AKP appeals  Anadolu said In some 100 rallies during his election campaign  Erdogan had described the opposition alliance as terrorist supporters linked to Gulen s network and Kurdish militants Erdogan s political success has rested on years of stellar economic growth in Turkey  but a recession that has brought surging inflation and unemployment and a plunging lira have taken their toll on the president s popularity While Erdogan s ruling alliance won a nationwide majority of just under 52 percent of all votes  losing Ankara and Istanbul   where he started his political life   would significantly dent his dominance  It is by controlling the municipality that you keep your support happy because it is at the municipal level that you give away lots of things to your core base   said Wolfango Piccoli  co president of Teneo political risk advisers While official results have not yet been announced  Erdogan has said his alliance had won the majority of municipal councils across Istanbul and Ankara  The AKP has said this was a sign of irregularity in the vote count Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to volatility in the Turkish lira  which sold off sharply nearly two weeks ago  reflecting waning confidence among both Turks and international investors  The lira was flat on Wednesday but slipped 2 percent on Tuesday after relations with Washington soured following a U S  decision to halt delivery to Turkey of equipment related to the F 35 fighter aircraft Adding to investor concerns over fraying diplomatic ties and possible U S  sanctions over the F 35 aircraft and missile defence  the U S  State Department urged Ankara to respect the  legitimate election results  Ankara responded by warning against foreign interference and  any steps that may be construed as meddling in Turkey s internal affairs     Additional reporting by Can Sezer  Daren Butler  Ali Kucukgocmen  and Dominic Evans in Istanbul  Editing by Jonathan Spicer and Gareth Jones  

ISTANBUL ANKARA   Election officials expanded a vote recount in Istanbul late on Thursday  CNN Turk said  as the ruling party of President Tayyip Erdogan pushed its appeal against its shock defeat there in local elections Erdogan s AK Party said it would also demand a wider check on votes across the capital Ankara   which initial results suggested it also narrowly lost in Sunday s vote in a major blow to the establishment Those losses  if confirmed  would be particularly painful for Erdogan  whose party and its predecessor have dominated the two cities for 25 years  He launched his political career in Istanbul and served as the city s mayor in the 1990s On Wednesday  Turkey s High Election Board had ordered a full recount in three of Istanbul s 39 districts and a recount of just invalid ballots in 15 districts after an appeal from Erdogan s AKP Late on Thursday the board decided there would be a full recount in those 15 districts as well  CNN Turk said  Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul  Ekrem Imamoglu  told Reuters it looked like his lead had narrowed to around 19 500 votes from an earlier 25 000 as the recount progressed  but he was sure he would still become mayor  The results will not change  Time is passing and Istanbul is waiting for service  so we just want to get to our job as soon as possible   said Imamoglu of the Republican People s Party  CHP   The mathematics and numbers are clear   Imamoglu told Reuters   There is no need to think of a Plan B right now  Imamoglu later said on Twitter that recounts in Istanbul s 14 districts  where there were a total of 89 255 invalid votes  had been completed  and added that he was 18 871 votes ahead of his rival The AKP s representative on the election board  Recep Ozel  told broadcaster A Haber earlier on Thursday that the difference in Istanbul would keep falling and his candidate  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  would emerge the winner in Turkey s commercial hub Speaking at a news conference in Ankara  AKP spokesman Omer Celik said the steps taken for recounts were not extraordinary  All citizens should remain calm  Our democracy is showing its strength as it always has   Celik said   Let the law work and let s respect the outcome  RECESSION CHALLENGEAhead of the elections  the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival the alliance between the AKP and their nationalist MHP partners  They named joint candidates in certain cities  including Ankara and Istanbul In Ankara  opposition candidate Mansur Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes on Sunday to earn a nearly 4 percentage point victory over his AKP rival  former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki  The AKP also appealed against those results  prompting the election board to order a recount in 11 of the city s districts But AKP Secretary General Fatih Sahin said on Thursday that the results of the recount so far were  far from meeting our expectations  and the party would appeal for another recount across the city If the initial results are confirmed  the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32 6 billion liras   5 79 billion  for 2019 in Istanbul and Ankara Erdogan would likely also lose some oversight for municipal contracts in the two cities  possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession In another sign of public backlash  the AKP MHP alliance also lost control of the southern coastal cities of Antalya  Mersin and Adana  the central provinces of Bolu and Kirsehir  and the eastern cities of Artvin  Igdir and Ardahan The CHP has said that Kurdish votes coming from the pro Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party  HDP  had helped them win narrow victories in key provinces  after the HDP chose not to name candidates in some cities and back the opposition instead  Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics since coming to power 16 years ago and ruled his country with an ever tighter grip  campaigned relentlessly for two months ahead of Sunday s vote  which he described as a  matter of survival  for Turkey In some 100 rallies during his election campaign  Erdogan described the opposition as terrorist supporters and said his central government could not provide services if it wasn t in harmony with local administrations But the president s efforts came up against widespread anger about Turkey s recession  which has brought surging inflation and unemployment  and caused the lira to plunge Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to volatility in the currency  which sold off sharply nearly two weeks ago  reflecting waning confidence among both Turks and international investors  It closed at 5 63 to the dollar on Thursday   Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay in Ankara and Yesim Dikmen in Istanbul  Editing by Jonathan Spicer  Andrew Heavens and James Dalgleish  

ISTANBUL   A European group observing local elections in Turkey criticized curbs on free expression on Monday  a day after voters appeared to have dealt President Tayyip Erdogan s ruling party defeats in major cities The head of the observer mission from the Council of Europe s Congress of Local and Regional Authorities said people should be able to express opinions without fear of government reprisal  I am afraid we    are not fully convinced that Turkey currently has the free and fair electoral environment which is necessary for genuinely democratic elections in line with European values and principles   Andrew Dawson told reporters in Ankara  But we do take the fact that many parties have been successful as a positive sign of Turkey s democratic resilience  The foreign ministry said the comments on civil liberties were  out of place  and beyond the group s remit  though Ankara would maintain a constructive approach towards election observers in the future Erdogan s AK Party  AKP  was on track on Monday to lose control of Istanbul and Ankara  according to official vote tallies and Turkish broadcasters  though the Islamist rooted party promised appeals that could delay the final results for days Dawson said  there could be cause for concern  over any further delays but it was too soon to tell  Despite daily rallies and overwhelmingly supportive media coverage  the president appears to have failed to assuage concerns among many voters over Turkey s tip toward economic recession after a currency crisis last year Last year  after Erdogan announced snap parliamentary and presidential elections for June  the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Monitoring Committee voiced concern over their freedom and fairness and recommended they be postponed Turkey s then prime minister told the European rights body  to mind its own business    Reporting by Sarah Dadouch  Additional reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu  editing by John Stonestreet  

BANGKOK   Thailand s junta leader looks set to return as prime minister after a general election stacked heavily in his favor  but the process reveals that more than a decade s polarization in Thai politics is as strong as ever Rather than ensuring stability  the sharply divided vote almost guarantees new struggles over power  which could involve parliament  street protests or even fresh military intervention A self declared  democratic front  of seven political parties says a preliminary vote count from the March 24 election shows it will be able to put together a majority in the House of Representatives But the junta appointed Senate also takes part in the vote for prime minister  meaning junta leader and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan ocha will likely need to win only one quarter of the elected representatives in the lower house to get his job back Prayuth as army commander led the 2014 coup that toppled an elected government  and many people would see his taking power again through a carefully manipulated process as just the latest instance of Thai voters having their choices overruled by legal or extralegal means It would still be far from smooth sailing even if Prayuth and his allies in the Palang Pracharath party form a government  while the anti junta coalition led by the Pheu Thai party holds a majority in the House of Representatives A Prayuth led government  won t be able to pass laws and pass budgets   said Pornson Liengboonlertchai  a professor of political science at Bangkok s Chulalongkorn University   There s a likelihood that they will become an ineffective government because there could be a no confidence vote which relies on majority votes  and there s a likelihood that Prayuth will face that  a vote of no confidence  With the final election results not being certified until May 9  there s a good chance the numbers   perhaps whittled down by disqualifications   will not give the anti junta coalition a majority But this runs the risk of appearing that the junta friendly Election Commission is helping to steal the election  creating a public backlash and the possibility of street protests  If they go the nuclear option and get rid of one of the parties  entirely dissolve them  then I think you may see people getting really  really  really upset   said Kevin Hewison  a professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and veteran Thai studies scholar In the worst case scenario  the failure to establish a working government could invite new intervention by the military  My big fear is that there s going to be another coup   Hewison said   They ll say   Look  this hasn t worked  we ll set them straight again   The army s excuse for staging its coup in 2014 was to end political strife that deadlocked the country s administration Aside from the maneuvering to form a new government  the vote showed that what Thailand s people want is not uniform and perhaps not even clear after nearly half a decade in which political activities were banned and freedoms of speech and assembly were severely restricted The preliminary results of the election  though marred by alleged irregularities  paint the picture of a nation deeply divided between those for and against military rule Of course divisions are nothing new in Thailand  The country s politics have been defined by them since the rise of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  a telecommunications tycoon who came to power in a populist political revolution nearly two decades ago Thaksin was beloved by many in the countryside for policies such as universal health care and farm subsidies  but was loathed by many in the country s conservative establishment who saw him as corrupt and a threat to the traditional role of the monarchy at the center of Thai society  He was ousted by a 2006 coup and is now in exile  The election seems above all to have made clear the depth of continuing divisions   said Michael Montesano  coordinator of the Thailand Studies Program at Singapore s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute   At the same time  the rhetoric used by some on the Thai right in support of the Palang Pracharath party may have inflamed the concerns of voters worried about former Prime Minister Thaksin s continued influence on Thai politics and broader threats to the old status quo  But the dominating factor of Thaksin as boogeyman may be fading  with the rise of what some analysts see as a third force  the Future Forward Party  which starting from scratch without the benefit of old school politicians in its leadership managed to pull off a third place finish in the polls  both in terms of popular vote and likely seat total The party has a youth oriented appeal but also a frank anti military stance  and as more or less amateurs  stands apart from the other major contenders Part of the party s appeal is that it has given those opposed to both military rule and Thaksin a path to express themselves Party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit has said he would join a coalition and support a Pheu Thai prime minister  Yet in a recent interview  when a reporter asked him to say the first word that popped in his head when he heard the name Thaksin  his answer was telling   History  The anti Thaksin forces may still see the battle as one against the former prime minister and his political machine  but others such as the Future Forward Party and Pheu Thai are trying to move it toward a pro democracy versus anti democracy dialogue  said Jacob Ricks  a political scientist at Singapore Management University  Thaksin is appearing less important in their discussion  while he remains front and center for the military and their allies   he said Montesano said one of the upsides of the election is that divides in Thailand are no longer so much about Thaksin  The downside may be that voter sympathy for or patience with a continuing authoritarian orientation toward politics has become evident   he said He said it was unlikely these divisions can be overcome in the foreseeable future  especially if  Palang Pracharath continues to push to install either Gen  Prayuth or an outsider into the premiership  if Future Forward stays true to its electoral platform  and if meaningful progress in addressing inequality in Thai society does not occur     Grant Peck has covered coups and elections in Thailand

LOUISVILLE  Ky    Sen  Tim Kaine endured being denied the vice presidency despite running on a ticket that won the national popular vote  But the Virginia Democrat on Monday downplayed the prospects for doing away with the Electoral College  which sealed Republican Donald Trump s election to the White House Kaine said abolishing the Electoral College would require a change to the U S  Constitution   with the  really onerous requirement  of being ratified by an overwhelming majority of states  It s not going to happen because smaller states really like the Electoral College   Kaine told an audience at the University of Louisville The idea has gained traction among Democrats since Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election  She netted nearly 3 million more votes than Trump  yet lost the Electoral College and therefore the White House to him  Kaine was Clinton s running mate Some candidates in the crowded race for next year s Democratic presidential nomination have already jumped aboard the push to scrap the Electoral College  tapping into Democratic anger over the election process  Trump became the second Republican in five elections to win the presidency through the Electoral College while losing the popular vote The Electoral College  a group that comes together every four years to technically elect the president  is enshrined in the Constitution  You might do it differently if you were starting from scratch   Kaine told the campus audience   But it s not going to get the support of this overwhelming majority of states  So I tend to focus on the things that I think I can really make a difference on  And I think that s not that productive a use of a whole lot of energy  Meanwhile  several Democrat controlled states are pushing for a national popular vote  But rather than pass a constitutional amendment  those legislatures are joining the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact  a group of states that pledge to give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote The compact would only go into effect when it includes states representing 270 electoral votes  the majority needed to win the White House Kaine  a former mayor and governor  delved briefly into the sting of losing the 2016 election  I had never lost a race  I can t say that anymore  I can say I ve never lost a popular vote on any ballot that I ve been on   he said  drawing applause from the audience   And I ve never lost the Virginia vote  Kaine recalled that his first visitor after he returned to the Senate following the 2016 loss was Republican John McCain  who lost to Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election  He said   Tim  I m the only person here who knows exactly how you feel    Kaine recalled    You and me are the only two that have been on a national ticket and lost      And I m just here to tell you  that the answer to what you re feeling is just go right back to work   And I said   You found me here  didn t you   On another issue  Kaine said he s confident that special counsel Robert Mueller s full report on the Russia investigation will eventually reach the public  because you can t keep a secret in Washington   Attorney General William Barr released a four page summary that detailed Mueller s  principal conclusions  and says a redacted version will be sent to Congress Asked about impeachment talk among some Democrats against Trump and how Congress should respond  Kaine replied   You should not jump to a conclusion about something so momentous and weighty before all the facts are out on the table  Kaine spoke as part of the McConnell Center Distinguished Speaker Series at UofL  He was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  a Kentucky Republican and a UofL graduate  

The chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and one of the state s leading political donors together sought to use campaign contributions to bribe the state s insurance commissioner  federal prosecutors said in an indictment that was unsealed on Tuesday The 23 page indictment   detailed with accounts of clandestine airport meetings and promises of millions of dollars in illicit donations   intensified the political tumult in a state already roiled by partisan warfare and a fraud tainted congressional election  And it also showed how  at least in the judgment of prosecutors  a leading political operative and one of his most important benefactors tried to shape government oversight in one of the nation s largest states  These men crossed the line from fund raising to felonies when they devised a plan to use their connections to a political party to attempt to influence the operations and policies of the North Carolina Department of Insurance   said John A  Strong  the special agent in charge of the F B I  office in Charlotte  N C The party chairman  Robin Hayes  faces the gravest set of charges of the four men who were indicted  Mr  Hayes was accused of bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud  along with several counts of making false statements  Three other people  including Greg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham and a prolific Republican contributor  were also charged Kearns Davis  a lawyer for Mr  Hayes  said the 73 year old Republican  steadfastly denies the allegations made against him in this case   In a separate statement  Anne Tompkins  a lawyer for Mr  Lindberg  said that Mr  Lindberg was  innocent of the charges in the indictment and we look forward to demonstrating this when we get our day in court  It was not clear whether the other men who were charged had lawyers A federal magistrate in Charlotte unsealed the case on Tuesday after the men were arrested   a public milestone in an investigation that began early last year with a tip from Mike Causey  the insurance commissioner According to the indictment  Mr  Lindberg  who has also given to Democrats  wanted Mr  Causey to oust a powerful regulator  in exchange for millions of dollars in campaign contributions   The targeted state official was in charge of overseeing North Carolina s regulation of a company that Mr  Lindberg owned  and Mr  Lindberg complained to Mr  Causey in February 2018 that the official was  deliberately and intentionally and maliciously hurting my reputation with other regulators  Mr  Lindberg said the official had been  lying  to Mr  Causey The next month  federal officials said  Mr  Lindberg and Mr  Causey met alone at the Statesville Regional Airport  What s in it for me   Mr  Causey asked Mr  Lindberg  according to the indictment Mr  Lindberg replied that he would support the commissioner s campaign for re election Mr  Hayes  one of the most influential political figures in the state  emerged as someone who could help carry out the plan  Federal officials said that Mr  Hayes knew at least some of the plot in May 2018 and  less than three months later  tried to disguise part of the bribe by arranging to transfer to the Causey campaign  250 000 that Mr  Lindberg had given to the state party Before the transfer  one of Mr  Lindberg s consultants  John D  Gray  called Mr  Hayes to say the men had  come to the conclusion that it would be better for all of us  if the money for the Causey campaign was funneled through the Republican Party  O K   well  if that s what you want to do  we can do it   Mr  Hayes replied  according to the indictment   It looks a little odd to have that much at one time  You know  we were talking about putting it over  you know  so much a month so it didn t jump out  but that s what you want to do  we can do it  Within weeks  prosecutors said  Mr  Hayes lied to F B I  agents about his efforts In a statement on Tuesday  Mr  Causey said his department  continues to cooperate with the federal authorities on this investigation   He otherwise declined to comment The indictment landed at a perilous moment for the Republican Party in North Carolina  Although Donald J  Trump carried the state in 2016  Democrats seized the governor s office that year  and last year s elections eroded the Republican supermajority in the General Assembly The party also suffered a stinging embarrassment in February  when the State Board of Elections ordered a new vote in the Ninth Congressional District after the Republican nominee s campaign financed an illicit voter turnout operation during the general election  Although no major Republican Party figures have been charged with wrongdoing  the man who coordinated the improper effort was indicted in connection with wrongdoing in earlier elections  and state and federal officials are conducting parallel inquiries into the general election  Read  A new election was ordered in North Carolina s Ninth Congressional District  On Monday  Mr  Hayes announced that he would not seek another term as state party chairman  In a statement announcing the decision  the party cited  recent  although temporary  issues with his mobility  After Mr  Hayes s indictment was announced on Tuesday  a lawyer for the state party  Josh Howard  said the party had become  aware of several indictments surrounding the conduct of a major donor to both major political parties and two of his associates  Mr  Howard  who spoke of the party s cooperation during the federal inquiry  did not mention that

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena that Democrats can use to try to force the Justice Department to hand over an unredacted copy of the special counsel s report and underlying evidence The move on Monday by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  the committee s chairman  made clear that Democrats are not satisfied with Attorney General William P  Barr s assurances on Friday that he will produce a full  albeit redacted  copy of the nearly 400 page report to Congress by mid April  As I have made clear  Congress requires the full and complete special counsel report  without redactions  as well as access to the underlying evidence   Mr  Nadler said in a statement   The attorney general should reconsider so that we can work together to ensure the maximum transparency of this important report to both Congress and the American people  The committee s announcement came a day ahead of a deadline set by Mr  Nadler and five other House committee leaders for Mr  Barr to voluntarily hand over the material collected by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III Mr  Barr appeared all but certain to miss it The urgency among Democrats came  in part  because they mistrust Mr  Barr s assessment of the report in a four page letter he sent to Congress late last month  The letter said that Mr  Mueller had not found that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to subvert the 2016 election  and that although Mr  Mueller did not offer a prosecutorial judgment on whether Mr  Trump obstructed justice  Mr  Barr had determined the president s actions were not illegal Democrats control the Judiciary Committee by a sizable margin and most likely will not need Republican support to approve the subpoena  If approved  it would be up to Mr  Nadler to determine when and if to issue it   effectively increasing pressure on Mr  Barr to meet Democrats  demands The committee s top Republican  Representative Doug Collins of Georgia  appeared to oppose a subpoena on Monday  saying Democrats had grown  desperate  despite Mr  Barr providing  transparency above and beyond what is required   Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not  in truth  require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department   Mr  Collins said in a statement Indeed  in his Friday letter to Mr  Nadler and other congressional leaders  Mr  Barr wrote that the Justice Department and special counsel s team were scrubbing the report to redact secret grand jury testimony  classified material and information about other continuing federal investigations  He also agreed to testify publicly in early May about his handling of the case In addition to authorizing a subpoena for the Mueller report  the Judiciary Committee will vote on Wednesday on subpoenas for five key witnesses in its investigation into possible obstruction of justice  abuse of power and corruption within the Trump administration The individuals are Donald F  McGahn II  a former White House counsel who spoke extensively with Mr  Mueller s investigators  Stephen K  Bannon  the president s former chief strategist  Hope Hicks  a former White House communications director  Reince Priebus  the president s first chief of staff  and Annie Donaldson  a deputy of Mr  McGahn who took detailed notes on the president s behavior during key episodes in his administration The five were among 81 individuals  companies and government entities from which the committee requested documents last month to kick start its investigation  Mr  Nadler said he would not have to use the subpoenas if the witnesses changed course and complied voluntarily  

I used to favor amending the Electoral College  in part because I believed the framers put it into the Constitution to protect slavery  I said as much in a book I published in September  But I ve decided I was wrong  That s why a merciful God invented second editions Like many historians  I thought the evidence clearly showed the Electoral College arose from a calculated power play by the slaveholders  By the time the delegates at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 debated how the president ought to be chosen  they had already approved the three fifths clause   the notorious provision that counted slaves as three fifths of a person to inflate the slave states  apportionment in the new House of Representatives The Electoral College  as approved by the convention in its final form  in effect enshrined the three fifths clause in the selection of the president  Instead of election by direct popular vote  each state would name electors  chosen however each state legislature approved   who would actually do the electing  The number of each state s electoral votes would be the same as its combined representation in the House and the Senate By including the number of senators  two from each state  the formula leaned to making the apportionment fairer to the smaller states  Including the number of House members leaned in favor of the larger states  But the framers gave the slaveholding states the greatest reward  The more slaves they owned  the more representatives they got  and the more votes each would enjoy in choosing the president The framers  own damning words seem to cinch the case that the Electoral College was a pro slavery ploy  Above all  the Virginia slaveholder James Madison   the most influential delegate at the convention   insisted that while direct popular election of the president was the  fittest  system  it would hurt the South  whose population included nonvoting slaves  The slaveholding states  he said   could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes   Instead  the framers  led by Madison  concocted the Electoral College to give extra power to the slaveholders If you stop at this point in the record  as I once did  there would be no two ways about it  On further and closer inspection  however  the case against the framers begins to unravel  First  the slaveholders did not need to invent the Electoral College to fend off direct popular election of the president  Direct election did have some influential supporters  including Gouverneur Morris of New York  author of the Constitution s preamble  But the convention  deeply suspicious of what one Virginian in another context called  the fury of democracy   crushed the proposal on two separate occasions How  then  would the president be elected  if not directly by the people at large  Some delegates had proposed that Congress have the privilege  a serious proposal that died out of concern the executive branch would be too subservient to the legislative  Other delegates floated making the state governors the electors  Still others favored the state legislatures The alternative  and winning  plan  which became known as the Electoral College only some years later  certainly gave the slaveholding states the advantage of the three fifths clause  But the connection was incidental  and no more of an advantage than if Congress had been named the electors Most important  once the possibility of direct popular election of the president was defeated  how much did the slaveholding states rush to support the concept of presidential electors  Not at all  In the initial vote over having electors select the president  the only states voting  nay  were North Carolina  South Carolina and Georgia   the three most ardently proslavery states in the convention Southerners didn t embrace the idea of electors because it might enlarge slavery s power  they feared  as the North Carolinian Hugh Williamson  who was not a slaveholder  remarked  that the men chosen as electors would be corruptible  persons not occupied in the high offices of government   Pro elite concerns were on their minds   just as  ironically  elite supporters of the Electoral College hoped the body would insulate presidential politics from popular passions When it first took shape at the convention  the Electoral College would not have significantly helped the slaveowning states  Under the initial apportionment of the House approved by the framers  the slaveholding states would have held 39 out of 92 electoral votes  or about 42 percent  Based on the 1790 census  about 41 percent of the nation s total white population lived in those same states  a minuscule difference  Moreover  the convention did not arrive at the formula of combining each state s House and Senate numbers until very late in its proceedings  and there is no evidence to suggest that slavery had anything to do with it But didn t the college  whatever the framers  intentions  eventually become a bulwark for what Northerners would later call the illegitimate slave power  Not really  Some historians have revived an old partisan canard that the slaveholding states  extra electoral votes unfairly handed Thomas Jefferson the presidency in 1800 01  They ignore anti Jefferson manipulation of the electoral vote in heavily pro Jefferson Pennsylvania that offset the Southerners  electoral advantage  Take away that manipulation  and Jefferson would have won with or without the extra Southern votes The early president most helped by the Constitution s rejection of direct popular election was John Quincy Adams  later an antislavery hero  who won the White House in 1824 25 despite losing both the popular and electoral votes to Andrew Jackson   The House decided that election   As president  the slaveholder Jackson became one of American history s most prominent critics of the Electoral College  which he blasted for disallowing the people  to express their own will   The Electoral College system made no difference in deciding the presidency during the 36 years before the Civil War There are ample grounds for criticizing the Constitution s provisions for electing the president  That the system enabled the election in 2016 of precisely the kind of demagogic figure the framers designed the system to block suggests the framework may need serious repair  But the myth that the Electoral College began as a slaveholders  instrument needs debunking   which I hope to help with in my book s revised paperback Read

BANGKOK   Thailand s ruling military junta has filed a complaint accusing the leader of a popular new political party of sedition and aiding criminals  a move he described as politically motivated The party  Future Forward  ran a strong third in elections last month that were also contested by a pro military party Future Forward s leader  Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  said he would report to police on Saturday to answer the summons against him  He could face up to nine years in prison The summons did not specify what actions prompted the complaint  It said Thanathorn was accused of sedition for using words or writing  to raise unrest and disaffection amongst the people in a manner likely to cause disturbance in the country  Several criminal complaints and protests to the Election Commission have already been lodged against Thanathorn and his party Speaking to reporters on Wednesday before a tour of a Bangkok neighborhood to thank voters  Thanathorn said the new legal action was expected and  nothing new   We are prepared mentally  There s nothing to worry about   he said   We believe in our innocence  We believe these cases are politically motivated  Thanathorn commented further about the summons on his Facebook page  saying it was clear  that old political games don t end after elections but in turn become even more intense because they are afraid of Future Forward  afraid of our victory that surpassed many people s expectations  He said he would answer the summons to show his innocence and  prove that Thailand s justice system will not submit to becoming a tool for dictators  Preliminary results of the March 24 general election failed to give any single party a majority  making it unclear whether pro  or anti junta parties will hold a majority in the House of Representatives  The Future Forward Party is a junior partner in an anti junta coalition that claims have a majority of seats  but the final official results won t be released until May 9 Between now and then  there could be shifts in party alliances  and there is concern that the state Election Commission  widely regarded as sympathetic to the junta  could disqualify the elected candidates of its opponents The army has several times publicly shown its disdain for Future Forward s policies  The country s influential army chief on Tuesday issued a thinly veiled attack on the party  not mentioning it by name but implying that it has foreign influenced ideas unsuitable for the  Thai style democratic system   which is a constitutional monarchy Gen  Apirat Kongsompong  the ruling junta s secretary general  said the army would do its duty   which is to protect  maintain and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy  Respect for the monarchy is a sensitive and emotional issue in Thailand  and accusations of disrespect are sometimes used by opportunists to smear their political opponents  Thailand has a lese majeste law that makes criticism of the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years  imprisonment per offense Thanathorn has said his party s primary agenda is to stop Thailand s military from intervening in politics  and also suggested its budget be slashed The new party s critics also have tried to tried to sow suspicion that it is allied with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  who was ousted by the military in a 2006 coup and is treated as the arch enemy of Thailand s royalist establishment  The party denies any such ties  and a large part of its appeal appears to be that it supports neither the military nor Thaksin The co founder of Future Forward  law scholar Piyabutr Saengkanokkul  has come under pressure as well  including a summons to be a witness in what appears to be Thanathorn s case Piyabutr has been in hot water with conservative Thais who see him as a threat to the monarchy after social media began circulating a video of a Feb  17  2013  lecture in which he described the role of the monarchy in democratic governments  He responded that the posting was misleading and was not about Thailand s system An obscure conservative organization filed a complaint about him with the Election Commission  and on Wednesday singer and actress Haruthai Muangboonsri formally submitted a legal complaint to police accusing him of being a threat to national security The military has governed Thailand since then army commander Prayuth Chan ocha staged a coup in 2014 against an elected government  Since then  Prayuth has served as junta leader and prime minister  and is the candidate of the pro military Palang Pracharath Party  which according to preliminary results grabbed the biggest share of the popular vote in last month s election According to a new constitution implemented under the junta  prime ministers are chosen by a joint vote of the elected House of Representatives and the appointed Senate  giving Prayuth a great advantage  However  his opponents could still control a majority in the lower house  making it difficult for him to pass laws or get a budget approved  and making any government he would head unstable because of the possibility it would face a vote of no confidence

MADISON  Wis    The Latest on the Wisconsin Supreme Court election  all times local  11 50 p m Wisconsin s Supreme Court race is too close to call and appears likely to go to a recount With the unofficial vote at 99 percent  conservative candidate Brian Hagedorn held a lead of about 1 600 votes over his liberal backed challenger Lisa Neubauer  The margin was about 0 14 percentage point out of nearly 1 2 million votes cast That is well within the 1 percentage point difference that allows the trailing candidate to request a recount The Associated Press did not declare a winner  noting that the race was within the margin for a recount Neubauer campaign manager Tyler Hendricks says the race is  almost assuredly headed to a recount  The court is currently controlled 4 3 by conservatives  and liberals were hoping for a Neubauer win to give them a shot at taking majority control next year    11 p m The campaign manager for the liberal backed candidate in Wisconsin s Supreme Court race says the contest is  too close to call  and  almost assuredly headed to a recount  As the unofficial vote count was nearly complete  conservative Brian Hagedorn and liberal backed candidate Lisa Hagedorn were separated by just over 3 000 votes out of more than 1 1 million cast That is well within the 1 percentage point difference that allows the trailing candidate to request a recount Neubauer campaign manager Tyler Hendricks says  We are going to make sure every vote is counted  Wisconsinites deserve to know we have had a fair election and that every vote is counted  The court is currently controlled 4 3 by conservatives  A Hagedorn win would increase it to 5 2 and insure that liberals don t have a chance at taking control in next year s election    10 20 p m Liberal backed Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Lisa Neubauer has a slight lead over her conservative opponent in a race that was within the margin for a recount as the vote count neared completion Neubauer led by less than 7 000 votes out of more than 1 million cast  or a little over a half percentage point If the loser is within 1 percentage point of the winner  they may request a recount  The last time that happened in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race was in 2011 A Neubauer win would put liberals in position to capture majority control of the court next year  A Hagedorn victory would increase the conservative majority to 5 2 and ensure it will be maintained for years Both Hagedorn and Neubauer are state appeals court judges  The race is officially nonpartisan but is seen as a potential barometer of the mood in Wisconsin a year before the 2020 presidential primary    8 35 p m Liberal backed Lisa Neubauer holds a narrow lead over her conservative opponent in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race after early returns Neubauer was ahead of Hagedorn by about 7 percentage points with more than a third of precincts reporting totals Tuesday A Neubauer win would put liberals in position to capture majority control of the court next year  A Hagedorn victory would increase the conservative majority to 5 2 and ensure it will be maintained for years Both Hagedorn and Neubauer are state appeals court judges  The race is officially nonpartisan but is seen as a potential barometer of the mood in Wisconsin a year before the 2020 presidential primary    9 35 a m Wisconsin voters picking a new state Supreme Court justice say the partisan backgrounds and support of the candidates in the officially nonpartisan race are a major factor Appeals court judges Brian Hagedorn and Lisa Neubauer are facing off in Tuesday s election  Hagedorn was former Republican Gov  Scott Walker s chief attorney and is backed by conservatives  Neubauer was appointed by a Democratic governor and has liberal support Lana Nenide  of Madison  says she voted for Neubauer because she wants a Democratic woman representing her rights  not  Scott Walker s puppet  Kathy Halverson  a Republican from Franklin  says she chose Hagedorn because  he has morals   Halverson says Hagedorn will  judge according to the law  Conservatives have a 4 3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court    7 a m Polls are open in Wisconsin for voters to choose a new state Supreme Court justice to serve a 10 year term The winner in Tuesday s election will replace 85 year old Justice Shirley Abrahamson  who is retiring Conservatives have been in the majority on the court since 2008  currently with a 4 3 split  If state appeals court Judge Brian Hagedorn wins the race  it would increase their majority A win by fellow appeals Judge Lisa Neubauer would give liberals a chance to take control of the court in the 2020 election Voter turnout in past Supreme Court races in non presidential years has generally been around 20   Voters need a photo ID to cast their ballots  Polls close at 8 p m    12 a m Wisconsin voters face a partisan choice in an election for the state Supreme Court The outcome of Tuesday s race won t immediately change the ideological control of the court  But a victory by liberal backed Lisa Neubauer would make it possible for liberals to win majority control in the 2020 election  She faces fellow state appeals court Judge Brian Hagedorn He was former Republican Gov  Scott Walker s attorney for more than five years before Walker appointed him to the bench in 2015  Neubauer was appointed by former Democratic Gov  Jim Doyle  Her family has deep ties to the Democratic Party Both Neubauer and Hagedorn insist their personal views do not affect how they would rule on the Supreme Court But liberal outside groups backed Neubauer  while Hagedorn won support from conservatives

ANKARA   After a decade and a half of dominance built on Turkey s buoyant growth Tayyip Erdogan has paid a heavy electoral price for an economic slump and will make changes to his government to halt the damage  senior officials in his party said on Monday Erdogan saw his Islamist rooted AK Party lose the capital Ankara in Sunday s local elections and appeared set for defeat in Turkey s largest city Istanbul   stunning reversals in two bastions of the party since he took power in 2003 The setbacks came despite a relentless two month campaign by the president who addressed up to eight rallies a day  condemned his opponents as terrorists and warned that the vote was a  matter of survival  for Turkey The secularist Republican People s Party  CHP  overcame overwhelming media support for the AKP and an environment which European observers said fell short of requirements for  genuine democratic elections   The AKP said it would appeal against the results in both cities Turkey has experienced years of rapid economic growth under Erdogan  underpinned by a construction boom and cheap loans  that have driven living standards ever higher and ensured the AKP won votes well beyond its core constituency of pious and conservative Turks  But the recent economic troubles took a toll on party support  two AK Party sources said  after the lira slumped against the dollar last year  inflation jumped to 20 percent  unemployment climbed and the economy tipped into recession  We saw the impact of the economy in the field  because there was serious unease   one of the sources said  adding that Istanbul accounted for 40 percent of Turkey s economy  meaning that any slowdown would hit the city hard  In total  three party sources told Reuters Erdogan was likely to implement cabinet changes in response to the setback  but gave no details   There will certainly be changes in some places   one source said After Erdogan won elections last June which ushered in a powerful new executive presidency  he also appointed his son in law Berat Albayrak as Finance and Treasury Minister  The sources declined to say whether Albayrak s position might be affected   If  Erdogan  cannot create a solution  it s inevitable that there will be greater losses in the period ahead   another party source said  NARROW OPTIONSErdogan appeared to recognise the scale of the challenge ahead  pledging on Sunday night to use the four years until Turkey s next national elections to carry out economic reform based on free market rules   We now have a four and a half year uninterrupted period to work   he said However  economists say the president has made similar reform pledges after all recent elections  before focusing instead on short term fixes  This time  his economic choices are narrowed by the conflicting priorities of supporting a fragile currency and restarting a stalled economy  Turkey s benchmark interest rate of 24 percent barely keeps the currency stable and at the same time puts a prohibitive cost on borrowing for Turkish firms Ulrich Leuchtmann of Commerzbank said authorities still have some room to increase government spending without driving the lira down further  but signals about Turkey s monetary policy were less encouraging Central Bank  backdoor tightening  over the last week to prevent a repeat of last year s lira crisis  when the currency fell 30 percent   did not really increase confidence in their policy making   Leuchtmann said  During his long tenure   first as prime minister  then as president   Erdogan has drawn strong support from ordinary Turks grateful for the stability and growth he brought  from liberals who backed his efforts to curb Turkey s military  and from Kurdish groups who entered into peace talks with Ankara But his main remaining ally now is the strongly nationalist MHP  Many former partners might think twice before resuming an alliance after Erdogan s campaign condemnation of opponents he said were linked to terrorists   In terms of political allies he has boxed himself into a Turkish ultra nationalist corner   said Turkey analyst Gareth Jenkins A crackdown following a 2016 failed military coup has seen more than 77 000 people jailed pending trial  and widespread arrests are still routine  Authorities have suspended or sacked 150 000 civil servants and military personnel Erdogan s critics accuse him of using the failed putsch as a pretext to quash dissent  Turkish authorities say the measures are necessary to combat threats to national security  threats which Erdogan repeatedly highlighted on the campaign trail After campaigning almost yearly for national elections  referendums and local votes  Erdogan s horizons have reduced to relatively short term goals  Jenkins said  casting doubt on his stated plan to avoid bringing forward elections slated for 2023 Defeat in both Ankara and Istanbul  if confirmed  would also mark a watershed in Erdogan s popular appeal   even though his AKP MHP alliance still succeeded in securing over 51 percent of the vote nationally  leading him to declare an overall victory  He can apply some brakes  he can slow the decline   Jenkins said   But I think we are seeing another milestone in that decline  I don t see him ever being able to increase his popularity again     Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker in London  Editing by Dominic Evans and

ANKARA ISTANBUL   Tayyip Erdogan s ruling AK Party was on track on Monday to lose control of Turkey s two biggest cities  Istanbul and Ankara  in a stunning local election setback that could complicate the president s plans to combat recession While official vote tallies and Turkish broadcasters put the main opposition Republican People s Party  CHP  candidates ahead in both cities  the Islamist rooted AKP promised appeals that could delay the final results for days  Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics since sweeping to power 16 years ago and has ruled with an ever tighter grip  campaigned relentlessly for two months ahead of Sunday s vote  which he described as a  matter of survival  for Turkey But his daily rallies and overwhelmingly supportive media coverage failed to win over many urban voters  as last year s punishing currency crisis weighed heavily on Turks  The people have voted in favour of democracy  they have chosen democracy   said opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu  whose secularist CHP also held its Aegean coastal stronghold of Izmir  Turkey s third largest city  The AKP and its Islamist predecessor have controlled Istanbul and the capital Ankara for 25 years  The results  which were still being tallied on Monday evening  would likely bring personnel changes at the highest ranks of government  according to sources inside and close to the AKP  In Istanbul  the country s largest city and economic hub  the CHP mayoral candidate was more than 22 000 votes ahead of his AKP opponent as the last votes were being counted  according to the country s electoral board  Yet the AKP also claimed victory  saying it had  plenty of  evidence of voting irregularities In Ankara  Turkish broadcasters said the CHP candidate had won a clear victory

ROME   Italy s ruling League party might not forge any more electoral pacts at a national level with its traditional ally Forza Italia  a senior League politician said on Tuesday  signaling the possible end of an era The League has struck repeated alliances with former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia over the past two decades  including at a parliamentary election in March 2018 However  the center right bloc  which also includes the nationalist Brothers of Italy  failed to win an outright majority in that vote  leading to three months of political stalemate  In the end  the League formed a coalition with the anti system 5 Star Movement  leaving Berlusconi in opposition  If we were to vote before the end of the year     I do not know if it would be possible to run again in a centre right alliance   said Riccardo Molinari  the League s parliamentary party leader in the lower house Molinari  who is close to League chief Matteo Salvini  stressed that he did not expect any national election this year  but said if his party performs strongly in EU parliamentary polls in May it might seek more power within the government The centre right bloc still stands together in local elections and has won seven successive regional votes over the past 12 months    most recently last month in Basilicata  At a national level  there is the question of the political vision you want to have  which is very different from local problems   Molinari told foreign reporters  noting the different views of Europe held by the eurosceptic League and more mainstream Forza Italia He did not mention Brothers of Italy  which is ideologically much closer to the League and a more natural partner Although the ruling coalition is constantly riven with tensions over a variety of issues  Molinari said League and 5 Star lawmakers got along well  while their two parties still commanded a clear majority in the polls  The longer we govern with 5 Star  the more it enters the public conscience and it would be hard to understand why the League  subsequently  would run with the centre right   he said The League s own support has roughly doubled from last year s election  with recent polls putting it on around 33 percent  By contrast  backing for 5 Star has dropped to around 22 percent from 33 percent a year ago Molinari said if the polls were borne out in next month s EU ballot then the balance of power would change within the government  If we get more votes than 5 Star  as seems likely  we will try to make our ideas weigh more on certain issues than is the case now   he added   We will clearly have greater weight  but we will want to use it to push the government forward not to break it apart    Reporting by Crispian Balmer  Editing by Catherine Evans

KIEV  Ukraine   Ukraine s president was holding off a long time rival in a bid to claim the other spot in a runoff set for later this month  while a comic actor with no political experience was leading strongly in the election  according to results released Monday With nearly 97  of the polling stations counted  Volodymyr Zelenskiy had 30  support in Sunday s vote  while President Petro Poroshenko was a distant second with just under 16  of the vote Ex Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko trailed behind in third with 13  support The strong showing for the 41 year old Zelenskiy reflects the public longing for a fresh leader who has no links to Ukraine s corruption ridden political elite and can offer a new approach to settling the grinding five year conflict with Russia backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that has left 13 000 dead since 2014  This is only the first step toward a great victory   Zelenskiy said The top two candidates advance to a runoff on April 21  Final results are expected on Tuesday Zelenskiy dismissed suggestions that he could pool forces with Tymoshenko to get her voters in the second round in exchange for forming a coalition later  We aren t making any deals with anyone   he said   We are young people  We don t want to see all the past in our future  Like the character he plays in a TV comedy show  a schoolteacher turned president angry over corruption  Zelenskiy made fighting corruption a focus of his candidacy  He proposed a lifetime ban on holding public office for anyone convicted of graft  He also called for direct negotiations with Russia on ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine The election was marred by allegations of widespread vote buying  Police said they had received more than 2 100 complaints of violations on voting day alone in addition to hundreds of earlier voting fraud claims  including bribery attempts and removing ballots from polling stations Zelenskiy s headquarters alleged multiple voting and other cheating on the part of Poroshenko s campaign  but election officials said the vote took place without significant violations Election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe hailed Sunday s election as competitive and free  even though it criticized procedural violations and said there were indications that state resources were misused in the vote Poroshenko looked visibly relieved about surpassing Tymoshenko  It s a tough lesson for me and my team   he said   It s a reason for serious work to correct mistakes made over the past years  But Volodymyr Fesenko  head of the Penta Center Kiev based independent think tank  predicted that Zelenskiy will easily win the runoff  He doesn t even need to do anything  the current government already has done it  setting most voters against itself   Fesenko said   Poroshenko needs to prepare for a defeat and try to seek security guarantees for himself and his team  Poroshenko  53  a confectionery tycoon before he was elected five years ago  saw his approval ratings sink amid Ukraine s economic woes and a sharp plunge in living standards  Poroshenko campaigned on promises to defeat the Russian funded separatists in the east and to wrest back control of Crimea  the Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 The OSCE said about 5 million people have been taking off Ukraine s voter registry as the government was unable to organize the presidential vote in Crimea or in the separatist held east In Moscow  Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  refrained from commenting on Zelenskiy s strong performance  but indicated that the Kremlin would like to see a change of government  We would like to see not a party of war at the helm in Ukraine  but a party that aims at a gradual settlement in eastern Ukraine   he told reporters A military embezzlement scheme that allegedly involved top Poroshenko associates as well as a factory controlled by the president dogged Poroshenko before this election After the vote  Poroshenko lashed out at Zelenskiy  describing him as a  puppet  of self exiled billionaire businessman Igor Kolomoyskyi  a charge that Zelenskiy denies Zelenskiy shot back  saying mockingly that it s impossible to say whether a corrupt official allegedly involved in the military embezzlement scheme was Poroshenko s puppet  or the other way round Voters on Monday were ready for the presidential runoff  Poroshenko is taking the country forward   said Serhiy Poltorachenko  a bank employee   He made mistakes  but promised to correct them  Petro Demidchenko  a 38 year old office worker  was supporting the actor  We don t know what to expect from Zelenskiy  but over the past five years we have found out what to expect from Poroshenko   corruption  soaring prices  continuing war and poverty   he said    Mstyslav Chernov in Kiev  Ukraine  Vladimir Isachenkov and Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report

MILWAUKEE   With their recent selection of Milwaukee for their party s 2020 convention  Democrats left little doubt that they believe their path to the White House runs through the Midwest in general and Wisconsin in particular Their optimism spiked in November  when Democrats defeated Scott Walker  the state s two term conservative governor  And they were energized and optimistic again this week for an intensely politicized State Supreme Court election they hoped would show Wisconsin trending steadily blue Then reality hit  A conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory on Tuesday  underscoring instead how competitive Wisconsin politics remain For Democrats  an intense effort to rebuild their Midwestern  blue wall  for 2020 is showing gains in Michigan and Pennsylvania  both of which President Trump captured in 2016  On Tuesday  Democrats flipped a key Pennsylvania State Senate seat that Republicans had long held outside Pittsburgh  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  But in Wisconsin  the apparent loss of the State Supreme Court race   Judge Hagedorn leads by nearly 6 000 votes and a recount is possible   underscored what strategists in both parties said in interviews this week  The state is a tossup in 2020 and its political identity is very much in flux  Republicans know they need this state and are going to fight like hell to keep it in President Trump s column   said Joe Zepecki  a Democratic strategist in Wisconsin  He said that Mr  Walker s loss in November may have fired up the conservative base just as Hillary Clinton s 2016 loss did for Democrats last November  They re coming with everything they ve got   he said of Republicans   That means we have work to do  Wisconsin s reputation as a battleground state is well earned  In the three closest presidential elections of recent times   2000  2004 and 2016   Wisconsin was decided by the narrowest average margin of any other state  less than one percentage point in each election Mr  Walker lost his re election bid for governor by less than one percentage point  after warning all year of a coming blue wave  Over the weekend  Mr  Walker offered a pep talk to Republican activists in Milwaukee about the stakes in electing Judge Hagedorn  a former lead counsel to his administration  who defended contentious election issues such as a voter ID law  Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field  Democrats wanted to defeat Judge Hagedorn and gain a liberal Supreme Court majority  Mr  Walker warned  so they could seize control of redistricting after 2020 and  get rid of one  maybe two seats that we currently have in the House of Representatives  Democrats  haven t forgotten about how close the election was  in 2016  Mr  Walker told party activists gathered for breakfast at the American Serb Hall in Milwaukee   They re not going to make that mistake again  ImageA conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory for the State Supreme Court on Tuesday  underscoring how competitive Wisconsin politics remain CreditRick Wood Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  via Associated PressMark Jefferson  executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party  said Judge Hagedorn s apparent victory showed the power of the party s engaged conservative base  The grass roots took offense to the attacks on Hagedorn s Christian faith   he said  referring to news accounts that the judge founded a Christian school that allows firing teachers in same sex relationships But others say Mr  Walker s midterm loss is probably a more relevant bellwether for 2020 than the Supreme Court race  because turnout was more than twice as high  and Mr  Walker is a polarizing  partisan figure in Wisconsin  much like the president Barry White  a lawyer who voted for Mr  Walker in 2010 but snubbed him in 2018 in favor of his Democratic opponent  Tony Evers  said he had wanted to make a bigger point  His ballot was  a repudiation of Trump and Republicans that insist on carrying his water   Mr  White said   It was the only message I could send  Mr  White lives in the Milwaukee suburbs  the state s most populous Republican region  Mr  Evers s gains there last year were a key to his narrow victory  In an interview  Mr  Walker said that should be a lesson to Mr  Trump   To win  he s going to have to improve his numbers in the suburbs   he said   With the passion the opposition is going to have  he s going to have to make some inroads  Last fall  Mr  Walker matched his vote totals from 2014 in the three suburban counties outside Milwaukee  But a surge of Democratic votes in the demographically changing suburbs meant his vote share dropped in 2018 by 12 percentage points in Waukesha County and by 16 points in Ozaukee County  It s the paradox of Trump s strategy of appealing to his base constantly   said Charles Franklin  director of the Marquette Law School Poll of the state   It also helps gin up the feelings of your opposition  I think that it s a gift to Democrats that keeps on giving  One of those voters is Tiffany Duncan  a 26 year old employee of a printing company  who skipped the 2016 election because she didn t like either major party candidate  But she definitely plans to vote in 2020   for whichever Democrat takes on Mr  Trump   I didn t think Trump was this crazy   she said as she walked to Caf Bavaria in Wauwatosa Village Still  Mr  Franklin said  the state is so evenly divided  its chances of determining an Electoral College majority for either party  puts us at ground zero  In a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than Mr  Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president  meaning his path to a second victory in the state is both uphill and narrow Many of today s uncertain voters   who are Republicans or Republican leaning independents   may come home to the party  especially once there is a Democratic nominee to contrast with the president John Carlson  a 59 year old engineer in Milwaukee  is one of those gettable voters for both parties  He went for Mr  Trump in 2016 but is uncertain if he will do so again  Democrats could win him over  he said    if the Democrats came up with somebody reasonable  which I m not expecting them to do  Republicans are framing the Milwaukee convention as an opportunity to motivate their own base  expecting Democrats to showcase a parade of far left figures and policies  National Republicans have already begun a coordinated effort to paint Democrats as wild eyed radicals steering the country toward socialism ImageIn a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than President Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times Democrats were energized in 2018  like any party is out of power during the first midterm  but then decided to go off the rails once they seized control of the House   said Rick Wiley  a former political director of the Republican National Committee  whose roots are in Wisconsin  The president energizes base Republicans and has had great success with working class voters   he said in an email   Those same working class voters won t check the box on a progressive socialist nominee  Mr  Jefferson of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he was upbeat about Mr  Trump despite public polling  I expect to see the same thing this cycle as 2016  where all polling suggests it s an uphill battle and on Election Day things look a lot different   he said   I think the Democrats are once again overplaying their hand and a little too confident  When Mr  Trump holds rallies aimed at Wisconsinites  he visits media markets across northern and western regions  largely agricultural and rural  where in 2016 he outperformed earlier Republican nominees In the Supreme Court race  Judge Hagedorn  the conservative  got a major boost in the Green Bay and Wausau markets  enough to overcome a deep deficit in Dane County  which includes Madison  the state s bluest stronghold In the 18 counties in the Green Bay media market  where TV ads linked Judge Hagedorn to Mr  Trump  voters swung by 18 points toward the conservative compared with a State Supreme Court election last year won by a liberal judge  according to an analysis by Craig Gilbert of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel The Saturday before Election Day  there was no shortage of avid Trump supporters at Roar Off the Shore  a tasting of craft beers and cheeses east of Green Bay in Kewaunee County  which is on the thumb of the Wisconsin mitten Though the county s populace is small  Mr  Trump s ability to run up the score in such places was repeated all across rural America in 2016  He won Kewaunee County  a dairy region  by 28 points compared with Mitt Romney s six point margin as the 2012 Republican nominee  I m tired of politicians  he s not a politician   said Randy Boor  57  who works in a factory that makes commercial cookware  He judged Mr  Trump s chances of carrying the state in 2020 as even better than in 2016  We ve got a guy there that s delivering   he said   He wants to do the frickin  job  You know how much could get done if he wasn t being opposed by all these idiots  Another beer taster  Dave Soborowicz  a 47 year old plumber  had driven across the state from Eau Claire to attend the event with his brother  who wore a Trump hat  But Mr  Soborowicz was less enamored of the president and unsure if he would vote for him the next time   He s so bloated in his head that he thinks he s still going to get his frickin  wall  when he s been defeated   he said Mr  Soborowicz said business was good for him as a plumber but he wasn t ready to give Republicans and the president credit   All I know is it was a bad winter   he said   so

MADRID   Spain s Podemos was the rising star of Europe s far left four years ago  but infighting and a failure to evolve has left it a shadow of the newcomer party it was then as it gears up for the country s most open election in living memory At best  it might emerge from the April 28 ballot as a junior partner in a Socialist led government  but that outcome would require support from other parties likely to be hard to win over Its decline underlines the challenge  in Spain and elsewhere across Europe  of forming viable governments once new parties emerge to break the political status quo Podemos was instrumental in setting that pattern as a European trend in a national election in 2015 Founded a year earlier out of the anti austerity movement against Europe s debt crisis  it won 20 percent in that vote  finishing a close third behind the conservatives  PP  and the Socialists  PSOE  and dismantling the monopoly on power those two parties had held since Spain s return to democracy in the late 1970s Now Podemos is down to around 12 percent  its appeal dented by scandals and divisions over how hard line the party  which supported a minority Socialist government over the past ten months and sits on some local councils  should be   We have caused shame due to our internal fights  our top officials and our visibility   leader Pablo Iglesias told a rally in March   We have acted like any other political party   With polls showing no single party anywhere close to securing an absolute majority on April 28  Podemos remains one of five parties  also including far right Vox  with a chance of being part of a governing coalition But its hopes of partnering the Socialists would likely rest on outgoing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also persuading skeptical Basque and Catalan nationalists to join that alliance In 2015  Podemos  meaning  We Can   surged on a groundswell of anti austerity support as protesters occupied the Puerta del Sol square in Madrid for weeks during the debt crisis  inspiring similar movements elsewhere in Europe and the United States It came within 350 000 votes of the Socialists  unprecedented for a non mainstream party  But that election was inconclusive and  by the time a fresh ballot was held six months later  Podemos had lost one million votes as the initial excitement waned Since then the party has also fragmented In January  Podemos  co founder Inigo Errejon left to launch another movement  a defection political analysts linked to his failure to maintain the party s wider appeal as a counterweight to Iglesias  more far left stance NO LONGER  BREAKING THE SYSTEM  Sanchez has said nothing about possible post election coalitions But while his Socialists lead in opinion polls  his options for securing a second term appear largely dependent on how Podemos fares  especially after the center right Ciudadanos ruled out an alliance  The right s options also appear limited  and a repeat election is a distinct possibility The dilemma of managing a fragmented or deadlocked political system is one that Spain shares with several neighbors  Politics have ruptured from Italy to France and Greece as the after effects of the 2009 14 debt crisis and austerity linger In Greece  things turned out differently for the anti austerity left  Its standard bearer  Syriza  has governed since 2015  supplanting the establishment Pasok socialists by accepting the strings attached to bailouts and changing from radical to reformer Podemos instead chose a harder line    In Greece s case  we drank from that particular chalice  we were disappointed and returned to pragmatism   said Theodore Couloumbis  a political analyst in Athens  But  without being in government  Podemos has also been forced to compromise through its representatives on local councils and as a PSOE ally  The party has become normal when it got into power   said Jose Fernandez Albertos  a political scientist at the Spanish National Research Council   Voters see that it will no longer break the system  If it manages to get into government  Podemos is likely to see its influence limited by its drop in votes  but could still have an impact  as it has done by pushing the Socialists on issues such as increasing the minimum wage  Its usefulness is to maintain the Socialists on the left   Fernandez Albertos said In neighboring Portugal  the Left Bloc also gained from its anti austerity stance during the debt crisis but lost support since it became an ally of the ruling Socialists in 2015 That minority government  also supported by the Communists  has achieved stability  potentially giving Sanchez and Iglesias a model to emulate But the Socialists and Podemos barely poll 40 percent together  leaving them far

PARIS   Algeria s ailing president  Abdelaziz Bouteflika  agreed Monday to step down by the end of the month  yielding to weeks of mass demonstrations demanding his ouster The initial reaction in Algeria was muted  and it was unclear whether the announcement would quell the protests  which have been calling for not only Mr  Bouteflika s resignation but the end of  the system  he led With no date set for a new election and no sign of the departure of Mr  Bouteflika s allies  some of his opponents were skeptical about the prospect of immediate  fundamental changes  Who is going to replace President Bouteflika   asked Smain Kouadria  a former member of Parliament and an activist in the opposition Workers  Party   All the senators are children of the system  So this announcement of his resignation is simply part of the rescue operation for a dying system  ImageProtesters demonstrating against Mr  Bouteflika in Algiers last month  The protests have only grown larger despite his previous concessions CreditRamzi Boudina ReutersMr  Bouteflika  82  who has ruled Algeria for 20 years  is paralyzed and has not publicly addressed the country since 2013  The protests began last month after he announced that he would run for a fifth term  and they have escalated each week With support from his former allies steadily dropping away  the final blow for Mr  Bouteflika came last week when the powerful army chief of staff called on the country s Constitutional Council to declare Mr  Bouteflika unfit to hold office But even though Mr  Bouteflika is departing  much of the ruling elite he put in place   which protesters refer to simply as  the system    is not On Sunday night  Mr  Bouteflika even appointed a new government  naming the general who had called for his ouster

likeliest to assume the position of interim president is the head of the senate  who has been close to Mr  Bouteflika for years A stage managed departure seemed unlikely to satisfy the street  which has increasingly helped drive the country s political agenda  an unusual development in Algeria s nearly 60 year  post independence history Even some opposition leaders who welcomed the news on Monday urged continued protests  It s a first important victory for the people   said Said Salhi  vice president of the Algerian Human Rights League   But we can t stop here  We ve got to demand positive change toward the emergence of a new  democratic republic   We ve got to continue to mobilize   he added   It s our only guarantee of movement toward final victory  which is the construction of a new republic of rights and liberties  ImageA protest demanding the resignation of Mr  Bouteflika on March 29  The protests began in February with demonstrations calling for him to desist from seeking a fifth term CreditRamzi Boudina ReutersThe situation in Algeria is fluid  with the balance of power appearing to shift every day  It is unclear how much more protest the army  which traditionally is the ultimate arbiter  will tolerate  Nor is it clear how radical the protesters will become in their demands There were other signs Monday of a shift in power  with the authorities seizing the passports of 12 businessmen on corruption allegations  according to Ennahar television  which is usually well informed  The government news service confirmed that corruption investigations had been opened against  some people  While it was not clear why the 12 were targeted  a businessman arrested on Sunday is considered a Bouteflika crony  Ali Haddad  the country s wealthiest man  who owns the country s top construction firm and has grown wealthy from lucrative state contracts  was arrested at the Tunisian border Mr  Haddad is known to be close to Mr  Bouteflika s hitherto influential brother  Said The question for Algerians now is whether Mr  Bouteflika s resignation will lead to real change or whether it is another in a series of feints intended to allow him and his system to retain power ImageNoureddine Bedoui  center  was re appointed as prime minister of Algeria s new government  He is widely described as inflexible CreditRyad Kramdi Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe protest movement began in late February with mass demonstrations calling for Mr  Bouteflika to desist from seeking a fifth term  After Mr  Bouteflika agreed to call new elections if he won the election  originally scheduled for April 18  the protests only grew larger Then he said he would not seek a fifth term  but would remain in office until a successor was chosen in an election that was indefinitely postponed  That offer only seemed to embolden the protesters  who demanded that he step down immediately and that his system had to go as well This is a far more complicated demand  and those who have been pulling the strings for years in Algeria   the army and an extensive nexus of politicians  top businessmen and high civil servants   have been improvising to keep up with the largely peaceful demonstrators  who have turned out in increasing numbers each Friday Mr  Bouteflika learned at the knee of his mentor  the revolutionary leader Houari Boumdine  who ruled Algeria from the mid 1960s to the late 1970s  Like Mr  Boumdine  Mr  Bouteflika installed an extensive patronage network and governed in partnership with the army  The system they and other Algerian rulers put in place is solidly anchored and will probably take more than a month s worth of popular demonstrations to dislodge The muted reaction on Monday suggested that Algerians know that  So Bouteflika is finished  Now everyone knows it   said Atmane Mazouz  a member of Parliament from the opposition Rally for Culture and Democracy party   The struggles now are only little positioning wars to control the next phase of the transition  But I am almost certain that the mobilization of Algerians will continue stronger than ever  because all the decisions being made now are seen by Algerians as a conspiracy against their revolution   

MUMBAI NEW DELHI   Two weeks after a suicide bombing in Kashmir in February killed 40 Indian policemen  a Facebook user called Avi Dandiya posted a live video in which he played a recording of a call purportedly involving India s home minister  the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  and an unidentified woman The trio could be heard talking about arousing nationalist sentiment ahead of India s general election  with the BJP president allegedly saying in Hindi   We agree that for election  we need a war  Within 24 hours  one of Facebook Inc s fact checking partners in India  BOOM  exposed Dandiya s video as fake  An analysis on BOOM s website said the video was created by splicing audio from older political interviews By the time Facebook took down the post  it had received more than 2 5 million views and 150 000 shares  There is no Indian law that specifically targets fake news  but police in New Delhi registered a case of forgery against Dandiya and an official said investigations were ongoing Still  Reuters last week found at least four edited copies of Dandiya s videos on Facebook with about 36 000 views  One on Google s YouTube has been seen 2 800 times while another on Twitter has 22 000 views Messages and e mails to Dandiya  an avid Facebook user who last appeared in a live video on March 23  went unanswered  The home ministry  the BJP president and party s information technology chief did not respond to requests for comment The videos underline how social media companies are struggling with fake news in India despite saying they ve taken steps to tackle the menace ahead of India s general election  which starts on April 11 With 900 million people eligible to vote and an estimated half a billion with access to the internet  fake news can have an enormous impact on the election  Dandiya s video  for example  could have seriously damaged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP if enough people thought it was true Policing content has become a massive global problem for social media giants which have no template for consistently preventing online fake news or eliminating it  Fierce internet disinformation battles gripped countries such as Brazil and Malaysia last year ahead of elections  Authorities in Indonesia and the EU  which are due to hold polls  have warned of the threat of fake news In India  Facebook has partnered with fact checkers and  like Twitter  ramped up efforts to block fake accounts  On Monday  Facebook said it had deleted 1 126 accounts  groups and pages in India and Pakistan for  inauthentic behaviour  and spamming  many linked to India s opposition Congress party  Google has partnered with fact checkers to train 10 000 journalists this year to better tackle fake news Facebook s popular messaging app WhatsApp has launched newspaper and radio campaigns to deter the spread of misinformation Social media companies say they don t outrightly remove all fake posts as that would jeopardise free speech  Facebook has said that circulation of posts which are debunked  or discovered to be fake  is reduced by more than 80 percent NO SILVER BULLETPosts that violate Facebook s community guidelines  including hate speech or content that could incite violence  are completely deleted  the company said  adding that Dandiya s video came under that category But even when content has been identified as fake and removed  slightly modified versions of the same images  video or text can escape detection and spread further  This is a highly adversarial space  so we still miss things and won t catch everything   but we re making progress   said a Facebook spokeswoman  who added that the overall volume of false news had been reduced on the platform   There s no silver bullet solution in fighting misinformation  Twitter said it deeply cares about the potentially harmful effects of misinformation and encourages users not to share unverified information  A YouTube spokesman said the company will continue to embrace the  democratization of access to information  while providing a reliable service to users Twitter and YouTube did not comment on Dandiya s video  SHOWN TO BE FALSE Another fake post that went viral recently was on popular Indian student leader Kanhaiya Kumar  who was arrested and charged with sedition after a 2016 rally to commemorate the execution of a Kashmiri separatist  Opposition parties said Kumar s arrest by federal police was an attempt by authorities to curb free speech Some Facebook posts in February described Kumar as anti India and showed his photo in front of a map that depicted some Indian states as part of Pakistan  Two Facebook fact checkers in India investigated the posts and said the image was doctored  Still  a month later  Reuters found at least two copies of those posts on Facebook with 375 comments and 1 500 shares Facebook in February announced an expansion of its fact checking company partners to seven  from two  Facebook says it also issues an alert to users who try to share a post which its fact checkers have debunked  but doesn t prohibit further sharing Reuters found that when debunked posts of Kumar were shared  an alert popped up with a link to the fact checkers  analysis  However  all four variants of Dandiya s videos could be shared without such fake news alerts from Facebook  There is no way you can solve this problem  quickly      the magnitude of the problem is really huge   said Kanchan Kaur  a Bengaluru based assessor at International Fact Checking Network at U S  based Poynter Institute

videos of captured pilots and photos of earthquake hit regions were spread as depicting current events  Since Pulwama we ve been working seven days a week   said Jency Jacob  managing editor at BOOM

CHICAGO   Chicago  known for its machine politics and corruption  woke up Wednesday to voters choosing an anti establishment candidate who may shake up a city that made history by electing its first African American woman for mayor  Voters in the third largest U S  city on Tuesday elected Lori Lightfoot  who has never held office  in a runoff election  She easily defeated long time local politician and a fellow black woman  Toni Preckwinkle  72  to become the city s 56th mayor Chicago has now become the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  and an openly gay woman as well  The 56 year old Lightfoot is also the latest in a wave of political newcomers to win major elections around the globe as voters upend the status quo  propelling anti establishment candidates to power  She will now take over a city where politics is a blood sport and where corruption has swirled in and around City Hall for generations  But Chicagoans are ready for a change  Lightfoot said on the campaign trail  promising to support mayoral term limits  reforms that would ban elected officials from profiting from their governmental positions and strengthen worker compensation oversight  They want a break from the corrupt political machine that has held back the aspirations of so many people   Lightfoot said during a debate last week   They want a government that is responsive to them and that has integrity   The city got its reputation as a well oiled political machine from the way Richard J  Daley  one of the last big city  bosses   ran the city from 1955 to 1976 with help from armies of patronage workers and crooked city council members  Thirteen years later  his son Richard M  Daley became mayor and for the next 22 years  he ran the city as the powerful political machinery churned in the background  It s refreshing to see somebody who is different  hopefully   said Andrew Tabor  61  a consultant who has lived in Chicago his entire life  Tabor recalled an incident from  years ago  when the so called machine allegedly sent a message to a childhood friend s father who had political connections  They blew up his car  I don t know who he was not playing nice with  but someone blew up his car  That s the machine right there   Tabor said sitting in the living room of his home on the north side days before the historic vote  NOT PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH Lightfoot has held several positions in and out of government  She was an assistant United States attorney  a senior equity partner at Mayer Brown LLP and  most notably  the president of the Chicago Police Board  an independent civilian panel   Some on the left  including Preckwinkle  criticized her as not being progressive enough  noting she made millions as a corporate lawyer representing corporate clients  She and Preckwinckle earned spots on the runoff ballot after they garnered the most votes among 14 candidates  including Richard M  Daley s younger brother Bill  in a February election  Lightfoot will replace Rahm Emanuel  who announced in September he was not seeking a third term as mayor Voters saw Lightfoot as the anti establishment choice compared with Preckwinkle  who was a city council member  or alderman  for almost 20 years before becoming Cook County board president in 2010   Lightfoot will bring more change because Preckwinkle is connected to the old boys club  the establishment   said retired mailman Gary Muckle  77  after voting for Lightfoot this weekend at a polling place on the city s north side   We will have to see what happens now  Lightfoot is not beholden to anyone   he said Lightfoot will also face a raft of thorny problems such as reforms to the police department  rampant gangs and violent crime and a spiraling budget deficit fueled by escalating pensions  Emanuel leaves as corruption continues to seep throughout city hall  Just this year  Alderman Ed Burke  a long time political powerhouse in Chicago  was charged with extortion  Alderman Willie Cochran pleaded guilty to wire fraud and it was revealed Alderman Danny Solis was recently under investigation for corruption  Burke  who has been an alderman for 50 years  won re election in February In all  federal prosecutors racked up 246 public corruption convictions in the Northern Illinois District  which includes Chicago  from 2010 to 2017  That is 80 percent more than in the Southern District of New York  located in Manhattan  according to a report from the Department of Political Science at University of Illinois at Chicago  The race turned on reform of Chicago politics and moving towards a new Chicago   said Dick Simpson  a professor in the department  who studies Chicago politics  noting that 33 city council members have gone to jail over the last four decades   There seems to be a desire to make reforms so that the continuing pattern of corruption     would change permanently   said Simpson  a former city council member    Reporting by Brendan O Brien in Chicago  editing by Bill

LONDON   Twenty five lawmakers in Britain s opposition Labour Party have urged their leader  Jeremy Corbyn  to go the  extra step  if there is a chance of agreeing a Brexit deal in talks with Prime Minister Theresa May May  whose deal to leave the European Union has been rejected in parliament three times  has turned to Corbyn in a last ditch bid to get the support of his Labour Party for an agreement she signed with the bloc s leaders in November Corbyn has welcomed the talks  but the invitation poses a threat for his divided Labour Party   some members and lawmakers are demanding a second referendum on any deal while others fear being blamed for helping pass May s much criticized agreement  The 25 lawmakers  almost all from areas which voted to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum  said the talks  represent a real opportunity  for Corbyn  a way to get a deal which would meet Labour s demands for a Brexit that protected workers  rights They reminded him in the letter that he had told May Labour would support a  sensible deal  that included  a customs union and no hard border in Ireland   protected jobs and workers  environmental and consumer standards   We believe you are close to achieving that in the coming days   said the letter whose signatories include Labour s schools spokesman Mike Kane and three lawmakers who last week voted in favor of May s deal  Rosie Cooper  Caroline Flint and Kevin Barron  At the general election  we were clear about respecting the 2016 vote  and about securing those Labour goals  Therefore  we feel if compromise is necessary to achieve this deal and avoid fighting the European elections  we should go the extra step to secure this   Corbyn  a long standing critic of the EU  has long said he wants Britain to leave the bloc with a deal  respecting the 2016 referendum when 52 percent of voters backed leaving the bloc in Britain s biggest shift in policy since World War Two But the opposition leader has been content to watch the governing Conservative Party take on Brexit  a move that has not only divided the country  but has all but redrawn the political landscape by widening rifts in the main parties In a last gamble  May announced she would bring Corbyn into talks to try to find a way to break the deadlock in parliament  which has voted against leaving the bloc without an agreement  Corbyn is pressing his desire for a  permanent customs union  and alignment with the EU s single market in the talks   red lines for a prime minister who had made controlling immigration one of the key stones of her Brexit policy But the Labour leader is under growing pressure to make any agreement with May conditional on holding a confirmatory referendum on the deal  or asking the public to back it in another vote The 25 lawmakers said such a vote was not part of Labour policy  Our policy  agreed by members  accepts that the public voted to leave the EU and seeks a deal that secure jobs and rights at work  It does not require a confirmatory ballot on any deal that meets those conditions   the letter said  Delaying for many months in the hope of a second referendum will simply divide the country further and add uncertainty for business  A second referendum would be exploited by the far right  damage the trust of many core Labour voters and reduce our chances of winning a general election    Reporting by Elizabeth Piper  editing by Guy Faulconbridge

BANGKOK   The governor of the Bank of Thailand on Monday downplayed risks to the economy from the country s disputed recent election and asserted the central bank can afford to take a wait and see stance on monetary policy While any delay in forming a government following the March 24 election  Thailand s first since a 2014 coup  could affect investor confidence and some investment projects  it would not have much impact on economic policy  Veerathai Santiprabhob told Reuters in an interview  When we made the  2019 growth  forecast of 3 8 percent  we had factored in some effects of the election on the economy   he said The outcome remains uncertain and might not be known until after official results are due  on May 9  Both the Pheu Thai party  which supports ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra  and the pro army Palang Pracharat have claimed enough votes to form a government  Regardless of which camp will be able to form a government  we don t see much impact on the major economic policies going forward   Veerathai said   The main parties of the two camps are fully aware of the need for Thailand to upgrade infrastructure  for Thailand to have a new growth engine  However  he said Thailand faces global risks  citing U S Sino trade tension  Brexit and China s economic slowdown In Asia  rate cut expectations are growing due to slowing global growth and the abrupt end to Federal Reserve policy tightening  NO IMMINENT PRESSURE But Veerathai said Thailand has no need to follow the policy decisions of other countries  and said the Thai policy rate is low compared with others   Monetary policy needs to serve the purpose of each country   he said   The central bank can afford to take a pause and review the situation very carefully   We are not subject to imminent pressure to change our policy rate   Veerathai said  emphasizing that he was speaking in general and not about any particular timeframe  On March 20  the central bank s monetary policy committee  MPC  voted 7 0 to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 75 percent  In December  the rate was hiked for the first time in more than seven years  by 25 basis points At the last meeting  the BOT cut its 2019 growth forecast for the second time in three months  to 3 8 percent from 4 0 percent  Analysts said that the move  together with the unanimous vote to hold fire  reduces the chance of further tightening But Veerathai said that did not suggest that the central bank  had closed the door to any possible increase in the policy rate  Thailand s  515 billion economy had its strongest growth in six years in 2018  at 4 1 percent  but lagged the Philippines  6 2 percent  Indonesia s 5 17 percent and Malaysia s 4 7 percent  Veerathai said exports  a key economic driver  should pick up the second half of 2019 if  the agreement between the U S  and China materializes  as anyone would like to see  He also expected that exports of certain products made in production bases relocated to Thailand will increase in the second half  The governor said capital outflows  at about  1 8 billion so far this year  are not a worry as Thailand has a strong external position with a hefty current account surplus  So these outflows do not pose any systemic risks for the country   Veerathai said  Graphic  Thai policy rate  CPI and GDP  https   tmsnrt rs 2V8IKKd   Additional reporting by Satawasin Staporncharnchai and Kitiphong Thaichareon  Editing by Richard Borsuk  

WASHINGTON    Not any longer  And with that  a triumphant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to close the book Tuesday on a divisive Republican debate  convincing President Donald Trump to shelve plans to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters It was a rare public disclosure of private counsel from the Republican leader  And it signaled that  after two years in Trump s Washington  Republicans on Capitol Hill are figuring out how to handle the president and his impulsive swerves on policy Trump insisted Tuesday it was his idea to switch course  I wanted to delay it myself   Trump said during an event at the White House   I want to put it after the election  Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week  backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   he said Speaking later Tuesday at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump said   Republicans should not run away from health care      If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose  Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  The president stunned Republicans last week by announcing he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  insisting the GOP could become the  party of health care   Republicans wanted no part of a do over after their failure to replace the law in 2017  Facing a revolt from the ranks  McConnell told the president he needed him to listen  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Several times McConnell told Trump to listen  the person said  And it worked  Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much  So we don t have a misunderstanding about that   McConnell said Tuesday Trump s shift   he tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections  when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House    made clear that the health care debate will be left for voters to decide during the race for the White House That arrangement suits Democrats just fine  They are denouncing Trump s attempt to overturn the ACA in court and floating various health care plans  including an expansion of government funded Medicare with so called  Medicare for All   setting up a stark contrast between the parties for the campaign trail Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will  hold Americans hostage through 2020  on an issue that affects millions of people  He said that Trump  insists he has a magic plan that we can see if only the American people re elect him  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats  health care battle with Trump is  a values fight  After Trump dropped the issue on Republicans last week  many hoped it would just go away  They had no comprehensive proposal to replace the ACA law and no big plans to unveil one  Publicly and privately  Republicans tried to talk to Trump McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking Rep  Mark Meadows  R N C   a Trump confidant  called shifting the debate to 2021  a very pragmatic decision   He said Tuesday that  spending quality time to develop a comprehensive strategy  would be  critical  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s 2010 health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017 when Republicans controlled both chambers in Congress  He still

LONDON   Britain could ask the European Union for a long Brexit delay that gives the option to leave as soon as a divorce deal is approved by parliament  finance minister Philip Hammond indicated on Wednesday European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said in Brussels that Britain would not get any further short delays unless its parliament ratified a deal by April 12   the date set by EU leaders as the effective cut off for avoiding the European Parliament elections Hammond said there did not have to be a vote on a deal by the April 10 EU Council summit and that while there would be big advantages to doing that it was probably unlikely   The important thing now is that in any extension that we get from the EU  we have an absolute clarity that as soon as we ve done the deal  we are able to bring that extension to an end   Hammond told ITV  So it s less about the nominal length of time of the extension and more about the mechanism for bringing it to an end once the deal is done   he said   That would be our expectation  When asked if he was comfortable about a long extension  he said he was not comfortable about it but that the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May s deal meant  we are where we are  Hammond said he hoped talks with the opposition Labour Party would very quickly allow an understanding of whether a cross party deal was viable  Some kind of customs arrangement is clearly going to be a part of the future structure   Hammond said  He said that if talks with Labour failed  the government would try to take ideas from the discussions and present them to parliament  If a deal was passed by the eve of the May elections  then they could be pulled  Hammond said  The Sun newspaper said May would seek a delay of nine months As many as 15 ministers in May s government are on the edge of resigning over her Brexit talks with the opposition Labour Party  The Sun reported Five of those considering resigning are cabinet ministers  the newspaper said  Many  many colleagues in government are just seething and a lot of us are on the edge now   the newspaper quoted one unidentified minister as saying    Editing by Guy Faulconbridge

OTTAWA   After promising an open and collaborative way of doing politics  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada on Tuesday axed from his party two prominent former female cabinet ministers who have been at the center of a festering political crisis about his handling of a criminal case Trying to divert the country s attention from the controversy  Mr  Trudeau was in a tough spot politically The two women were seen by many as symbols of his progressive feminist government  But within his Liberal Party  they were seen as untrustworthy backstabbers who kept the firestorm alive for weeks with new morsels of information feasted upon by the press and opposition parties The problems began two months ago when accusations surfaced that Mr  Trudeau and his aides inappropriately pressured Jody Wilson Raybould  the former justice minister and attorney general  to settle a criminal corruption case against SNC Lavalin  a major corporation based in Montreal  A criminal conviction would bar the company from government contracts for a decade Mr  Trudeau has denied that anything inappropriate took place  He said he proposed a civil resolution of the case  with a monetary penalty  because a loss of government contracts by SNC Lavalin would jeopardize thousands of Canadian jobs Still  the criminal prosecution has continued And since then  the standing of the Liberals has fallen in the polls  And Mr  Trudeau s image as a fresh force who practiced politics in a new and transparent way has been severely battered With their re election hopes dimming less than seven months before the national vote  several Liberal members of Parliament have openly expressed frustration with Ms  Wilson Raybould  who resigned from the cabinet on Feb  12  and with Jane Philpott  who was president of the Treasury Board  and later resigned in solidarity with her  It s become clear that Ms  Wilson Raybould and Ms  Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team   Mr  Trudeau told an emergency meeting of the Liberal members of Parliament Tuesday evening   Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided  We cannot afford to make that mistake  He added   In learning to do things and doing them differently  we ve encountered difficult moments  Ms  Wilson Raybould said on Facebook on Tuesday night that she will speak with her supporters about what to do next  I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles   values that must always transcend party   she wrote In a separate Facebook message posted Monday night  Ms  Philpott expressed dismay about not being able to make her case to the national caucus before she was exiled from it  The need has never been greater for a measured re evaluation of how the government should respond to this issue   she wrote   What I have heard from Canadians is that they want to know the truth   Jenny Kwan  a member of the New Democratic Party from British Columbia  said Mr  Trudeau s action undermined his claim of being a feminist  This is about really speaking truth to power and the government shut it down   she said But Carolyn Bennett  the minister of Indigenous Relations  tried to repair any damage  telling reporters after Mr  Trudeau spoke that the prime minister s commitment to feminism was not a sham  It s not about gender   she said  saying that her former colleagues had to go simply because they could not be trusted Until Tuesday  Mr  Trudeau had studiously avoided criticizing either of his former ministers   I ve approached this situation with patience and understanding   he said ImageThe former attorney general  Jody Wilson Raybould  appearing before the House of Commons Justice Committee in February CreditSean Kilpatrick The Canadian Press  via Associated PressBut he called last week s revelation that Ms  Wilson Raybould secretly recorded a conversation with the country s top public servant  unconscionable The two were discussing the case against SNC Lavalin  which has been charged with bribing Libyan officials during the dictatorship of Col  Muammar el Qaddafi Mr  Trudeau s government was asking Ms  Wilson Raybould to consider using a new measure  similar to ones in the United States and some European countries  that would allow the company to avoid conviction in exchange for a substantial financial penalty A criminal conviction would have barred the company from government work  which could potentially have imperiled thousands of Canadian jobs  Mr  Trudeau and his aides have repeatedly denied any impropriety Ms  Philpott also angered her Liberal colleagues by saying in a magazine interview that Ms  Wilson Raybould was being blocked by the government from revealing important information about the case While Mr  Trudeau made the decision to expel the two former members  a movement within the caucus to remove them began escalating over the weekend Wayne Easter  a former cabinet minister and veteran member of Parliament  told the Canadian Press news agency on Monday that recording the call without the knowledge of Michael Wernick  the clerk of the privy council  was  as low as you can go  He added   Jody Wilson Raybould  Should be gone  Gone  Should ve been gone long ago  While neither woman found many allies within their party  they have been celebrated by opposition members of Parliament for their actions In a statement  Andrew Scheer  the leader of the opposition Conservatives  said their expulsion showed that  if you tell the truth  there is no room for you in the Liberal Party  The Conservatives are filibustering debate on Mr  Trudeau s budget legislation in a bid to force a public inquiry into the matter Hours before she was removed from the Liberal caucus  Ms  Wilson Raybould urged her colleagues  in an unapologetic letter  to allow her to remain in the party  Now I know many of you are angry  hurt and frustrated   she wrote   And frankly so am I  I am angry  hurt and frustrated because I feel I was upholding the values that we all committed to  In her statement on Monday evening  Ms  Philpott dismissed the criticisms of several of her former colleagues  I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal  of trying to bring down the prime minister  of being politically motivated  and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson Raybould   Ms  Philpott wrote   These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods  I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister  Nor did Jody Wilson Raybould  The two former cabinet ministers will not be allowed to seek re election under the Liberal Party banner in October s election and are likely to face Liberal opponents in their electoral districts if they choose to run for re election Unless they join one of the opposition parties  they will also not have access to party financial  logistical and polling resources Both were political neophytes during the last election  in 2015  Ms  Philpott is a doctor and Ms  Wilson Raybould a lawyer who was also an Indigenous leader in British Columbia  Neither has a well developed  personal political machine Mr  Trudeau s efforts to turn political attention away from the case have so far faltered On Tuesday  he ended his announcement with a campaign style speech in which  among other things  he highlighted the government s efforts to mitigate climate change and attacked the Conservatives  plan to kill carbon taxes

LONDON   Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday broke with her own party  appealing to the opposition to work with her on a plan in a move that could keep Britain closely tied to the European Union after the country leaves the bloc Mrs  May made the announcement after her cabinet had met for seven hours  amid a growing sense of crisis  With only 10 days left until Britain is due to leave the European Union  she also said she would ask leaders of the bloc for an extension Parliament is deadlocked on the issue  and lawmakers are increasingly alarmed by the prospect of careering out of the bloc without an agreement Her overture to the Labour Party could mark a turning point in Brexit  as Britain s exit from the European Union is known  ending months of stalemate between Mrs  May and Conservative hard liners  who have adamantly refused to support the deal she negotiated with the European Union  This basically rips up the last two and a half years as far as her stance goes   said Tim Bale  professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London  It seems the calculation has changed  and finally the country s interests have been put above those of the Conservative Party   he added Mrs  May s deal with Europe has two parts  a withdrawal agreement  which details the practical terms of the divorce  and a political declaration  which outlines Britain s future relationship with the bloc The prime minister said the withdrawal agreement must stand  even though Parliament has rejected it three times already  European leaders have insisted upon this Under the withdrawal agreement  Britain would remain in the European Union customs and trading system until at least the end of 2020 Negotiations with the Labour Party will center on changes to the political declaration  However  these would be nonbinding and could be dismantled by a future British government Mrs  May s plan had envisioned eventually severing ties with the bloc s customs and trading system  and taking control over immigration from continental Europe Until now  she has refused to consider softening any of these so called red lines The only option Mrs  May will not negotiate with the opposition is canceling Brexit altogether  Closer economic ties with the bloc through a customs union or membership in its single market are up for discussion and even a referendum confirming any deal has not been excluded  Mrs  May s aides said Within an hour of Mrs  May s announcement  pro Brexit Conservatives began to express their dissent  amid reports that a number of cabinet ministers had argued against a further extension Whether the prime minister can win the cooperation of the Labour Party   and whether the European Union will grant her request for another delay   remained unclear  I m very happy to meet the prime minister   said Jeremy Corbyn  the Labour leader  after Mrs  May s announcement  We recognize that she has made a move   he added   I recognize my responsibility to represent the people who supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn t support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future  And that s the basis on which we will meet her and have those discussions  Still  to move forward with this plan  he will have to become involved in the tumultuous negotiation  and share responsibility for the success or failure of Brexit  Some Conservatives expressed dismay that the Labour Party would now be more involved  It is very disappointing that the cabinet has decided to entrust the final handling of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party   said Boris Johnson  who resigned from Mrs  May s cabinet and is considered a front runner to replace her  in an interview with the BBC  I think the result will almost certainly be  if Corbyn gets his way  that we remain in the customs union so that we can t control our trade policy  that there are huge areas of lawmaking we can t control  and Brexit is becoming soft to the point of disintegration   he said It has never been clear whether Mrs  May was willing to lead the country into a no deal exit  a threat she raised repeatedly in tough talking speeches at the start of negotiations A powerful faction in the Conservative Party  to which she has devoted most of her adult life  has shifted to a hard line position  shrugging off warnings of severe economic consequences with a no deal exit  and advocating what they called  a clean break  It was unclear whether Mrs  May had shifted as well  Her remarks on Tuesday  however  suggested that she had not  When it came down to it  she was just too sensible   said Rosa Prince  the author of a biography of Mrs  May   She s got to be thinking of her legacy now  and if people are dying for lack of medicine  if there are food shortages  if Britain goes feral  that s not how she wants to be remembered  Speaking at 10 Downing Street  Mrs  May said it was clear Britain would need an extension to Brexit  but  one that is as short as possible  Mrs  May s immediate plan is to try to reach an agreement with Mr  Corbyn and get Parliament s support for it before next week s European Union summit in Brussels on April 10 Alternatively  she said  Parliament would vote on an array of alternatives  with the government promising to accept the outcome Mrs  May hopes Britain might still be able to leave the bloc next month and avoid holding elections to the European Parliament  Failing that  she would ask for an extension that could be curtailed as soon as Britain had ratified its withdrawal agreement After Tuesday s extraordinary cabinet meeting  ministers were held in Downing Street without access to cellphones until Mrs  May had spoken  a sign she wanted to get her version out before her fractious cabinet started leaking  Chilean wine was served as they waited Upon emerging  cabinet members told journalists that they had discussed the option of calling a general election  but that polling suggested that the Conservative Party might fare poorly if a new election was called now Mrs  May s willingness to adjust her position on Brexit came  too late   said Ayesha Hazarika  a political commentator and former Labour adviser   This should have been done right at the beginning  She added   It shows how catastrophically badly she has handled the chronology of the process  By this stage  Ms  Hazarika said   the politics are too raw on both sides   and Mr  Corbyn will be under intense pressure to call for a second referendum Mr  Corbyn himself is a longtime euroskeptic  but many of his party members are pushing strongly for a second referendum or for canceling Brexit altogether  Labour is also intent on holding a general election in the near future Mr  Corbyn  who has safely criticized the government from the margins  risks being held responsible for an unpopular result if he cooperates with Mrs  May  Ms  Hazarika said  Their strategy has been to have a clean hands Brexit  the Tories will mess it all up   she said   If she s co opting him to be a co pilot  does he want to take that responsibility   He s got a big strategic question to ask   she added She said the next days were likely to bring all kinds of bizarre twists  like collaboration between Mr  Corbyn and Conservative backbenchers in an effort to bring Mrs  May down in a no confidence vote  Anything is possible right now   she said   There are so many wheels within wheels right now  I have never seen anything like it

to say that she will ask her European counterparts to grant Britain another short extension to try to pass a withdrawal agreement  Parliament has already rejected her plan three times by margins varying from historic to hefty A majority in Parliament opposes a no deal Brexit  but agrees on little else To show the Europeans that the extension is worth providing  Mrs  May announced that she would try to meet with the head of the opposition Labour Party  Jeremy Corbyn   to agree a plan that we would both stick to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal  Mr  Corbyn favors a much closer trading relationship in the future with the European Union than Mrs  May  But if the two leaders can agree on a softer Brexit  then a parliamentary majority might be found to leave the European Union with a deal  initiating a transition period of at least two years while a future relationship is negotiated In his comments on Tuesday morning  Mr  Barnier made it clear that even if Britain asks for a long extension  the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened  and that negotiations on the country s future relationship with the European Union cannot legally take place until Britain is no longer a member Having failed to achieve a breakthrough on Monday  a group of lawmakers working across party lines were on Tuesday planning a new strategy to try to avert the increasing risk of a no deal Brexit What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union If approved in a vote expected to take place Thursday  the measure introduced by a Labour member  Yvette Cooper  would require Mrs  May to request another delay But the proposed legislation  which will mostly likely be discussed on Wednesday  does not specify what the extra time would achieve  so it remains unclear whether such a request would satisfy European Union leaders  They have said that Britain could get another extension only if it has a new strategy  such as holding a general election or second referendum  and if it agrees to take part in the European elections in May The cabinet held two meetings on Tuesday as Mrs  May attempted to find a way out of the crisis  Though she said she wanted to avoid leaving without a deal and noted that Parliament would try to stop it  the prime minister s office also said that a no deal exit was the default scenario if there were no agreement Britain could also leave without an agreement  which Mr  Barnier said is  day after day more likely   He insisted that the European Union was prepared for this scenario But even then  he said  Britain would have to return to talks with Brussels in a badly strained relationship to manage day to day dealings  including air transportation  trade and customs  The bloc could then negotiate a free trade agreement with Britain  as with Japan or Canada  but key issues would  still be on the table   Mr  Barnier said  listing protections for citizens  rights  preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland  and Britain s legal and financial obligations to Brussels It would be much simpler for Parliament  which Monday night could find no majority for the Brexit plan  to pass the legally binding withdrawal agreement  Mr  Barnier said  Then the two sides could immediately begin to negotiate their future relationship  since the nonbinding political declaration  leaves the door open for a variety of outcomes  and could be easily adjusted to Britain s wishes  If the U K  still wants to leave the E U  in an orderly manner  this agreement  this treaty  is and will be the only one   Mr  Barnier said   If there is no deal  there is no transition  ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain in Parliament in London on Monday  Lawmakers have already rejected her withdrawal agreement three times CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Barnier spoke and took questions on Tuesday at the European Policy Center  a think tank based in Brussels The mood in Brussels has been somber as the British Parliament floundered in its attempts either to pass the withdrawal agreement or to find a majority for any alternative  But that agreement  including the so called Irish backstop  will not change  Mr  Barnier and other European leaders have said Some member countries  like France  tend to favor a no deal Brexit so the issue does not affect European parliamentary elections at the end of May The fear is that Brexit will be taken up by Europe s various populist and euroskeptic parties as another sign of the supposed indifference of Brussels to democratic expression But others  like Germany  believe that Britain is a crucial neighbor and partner in trade and defense  and argue that it should be given a longer extension  The heads of state and government are to meet in Brussels in an emergency session on April 10  two days before the current Brexit deadline  to hear what Britain has decided To get an extension  Britain must tell the other member states why it wants one   for a general election  another referendum or some other reason that promises a way out of the impasse rather than just allowing more time for bickering and deadlock But a long extension has political and economic costs for both sides  Mr  Barnier noted  citing uncertainty that is damaging business relationships and investment and the need for the European Union to concentrate on other pressing issues  like migration  economic growth  inequality  refugees and terrorism  The leaders  he said  would have to  balance the different costs  between no deal  even if by accident  and a long prolongation  The European Union will protect its single market no matter what  Mr  Barnier said  since 500 million people and 22 million businesses depend on it   We will never fragilize or unravel the single market   he said in English   If we fragilize or unravel the single market  we are lost

KIEV  Ukraine   Volodymyr Zelenskiy has no political experience  but that s no problem for the people of Ukraine who have already seen him performing the role of president In a striking example of fiction morphing into reality  the 41 year old comic actor seems set to take the top office for real  following in the footsteps of the man he plays in a wildly popular television series   an ordinary teacher who becomes an unlikely president and succeeds in bringing the country together Zelenskiy took a commanding lead against the incumbent in Sunday s presidential election  putting him in a strong position for the runoff in three weeks  time He is the latest candidate with little or no political experience to fare well at the ballot boxes  reinforcing the trend in Europe and beyond for anti establishment leaders  Just a day before Ukraine s election  a liberal environmental activist won a runoff in Slovakia to become the country s first female president Zelenskiy is much more moderate than far right populists who have had recent success in elections  and he appealed for reconciliation with separatist held eastern Ukraine  A new life begins   Zelenskiy said in his trademark raspy voice after the vote   A life without corruption and without bribes  A life in a nation of dreams comes true  His easygoing manner and snappy talk on the campaign trail strongly resembled his character in  Servant of the People    a schoolteacher catapulted into the presidential seat after a student s video of him blasting official corruption goes viral  Zelenskiy has  however  refused to hold standard campaign meetings with voters  and his political program remains a mystery The TV series that premiered in the fall of 2015 painted a grotesque satirical picture of Ukraine s officialdom  complete with easily recognizable parodies of serving politicians  It has been immensely popular  attracting up to 20 million viewers in the nation of 42 million   a sign that it hit a nerve in a country fed up with endemic corruption and grinding poverty Zelenskiy s character  Vasyl Holoborodko  at first looks too naive and soft hearted to survive in the cruel world of Ukraine s corruption ridden elite  But he learns quickly and soon turns into a strong leader capable of defeating his wily and experienced foes without losing his integrity  The series is full of profanities and crude humor  but Holoborodko turns serious when he talks about the country s challenges The latest season of  Servant of the People   shown just days before the election  opens with Holoborodko thrown into prison on trumped up charges fabricated by his pitiless foes Inmates hired by his enemies try to kill him  but he survives and gets out  to find Ukraine sunken deeper in poverty and broken into multiple fiefdoms   in a nod to the ongoing separatist conflict in the east  On screen  Zelenskiy s character regains the presidential post and leads the country to peace  prosperity and reunification These are the challenges incumbent President Petro Poroshenko has sorely failed to meet  and Zelenskiy s electoral success clearly reflects public aspirations that he could be just as successful in real life as his character was on screen Ukraine has suffered from economic meltdown  endemic corruption and a spiraling conflict with Russia sponsored separatists in eastern Ukraine that has killed 13 000 people since 2014  Its hopes for integration into the European Union and NATO remain as elusive as ever  and there is no realistic way for Ukraine to reclaim control over the Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 in a move that most of the world sees as illegal For those who cast ballots for Zelenskiy  his lack of political skills is a major advantage  a welcome break from the cast of familiar political figures associated with the country s woes  Both incumbent Petro Poroshenko and Yulia Tymoshenko  who polled second and third  respectively  have been on the political stage for more than a decade Born to a professorial family in the industrial city of Kryvyi Rih when Ukraine still was part of the Soviet Union  Zelenskiy is a native Russian speaker  something that helped him sweep the vote in central  eastern and southern regions where many speak the language The comedian has had a low key campaign  In his rare public appearances  Zelenskiy wouldn t offer his views on specific political or economic issues  promising to rely on a team of professionals Zelenskiy rejects Poroshenko s claim that his lack of experience will make him unable to stand up to Russia  pledging to firmly defend Ukraine s interests  He charged late Sunday that he will make sure that Russia not only returns Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine held by pro Russia rebels  but pays compensation for the  disgusting and horrible  land grabs In Moscow  lawmakers and commentators have described Zelenskiy s strong showing as a sign of public disillusionment with the current government  but most predict that the tug of war between the two neighbors will continue Poroshenko has sought to disparage Zelenskiy  accusing him of being a  puppet  of self exiled billionaire businessman Ihor Kolomoyskyi  whose station has aired  Servant of the People  and given him the platform to announce his candidacy in a New Year s speech  Zelenskiy  who has bitingly mocked the president in his stand up performances  shot back by ridiculing Poroshenko and his associates accused of corruption Kolomoyskyi  who lives in Israel  denied bankrolling Zelenskiy s bid  but hailed him as a bright and honest man of a new generation who can deliver what the country needs  He s absolutely independent   Kolomoyskyi said of Zelenskiy in a recent interview released by the UNIAN news agency   His quick reaction  humor and a broad horizon make him hard to beat in an argument  Volodymyr Fesenko  the head of the Kiev based Penta Center independent think tank  said that Kolomoyskyi hopes that Zelenskiy s victory will help him regain his clout  but added that Zelenskiy could distance himself from the tycoon  Kolomoyskyi will try to fill Zelenskiy s team with his people and fill Zelenskiy s head with his ideas  but he could have problems with it   he said    Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report

president  was possibly interested in running for New York mayor  some people were skeptical After all  the gossip column called the news  a wild rumor flying around the TV industry  and published it on April Fools  Day Others  like Monica Klein  a political consultant who once worked for Mayor de Blasio  saw it as another reminder that the city has never elected a woman to its top office  In contrast  yesterday Chicago elected Lori Lightfoot as mayor  becoming the largest American city to ever choose a black woman as its top official In New York  Mr  Zucker joined a list of men who have been named as potential 2021 mayoral candidates  City Comptroller Scott Stringer  City Council Speaker Corey Johnson  Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr  and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams  Letitia James  the former city public advocate  was thought to be a promising candidate before she became the state attorney general  The question in New York  isn t so much who could run and win as a

Christine Quinn  the first woman to be City Council speaker  So far  it s unclear whether Ms  Quinn or Melissa Mark Viverito   who followed Ms  Quinn as council speaker and recently lost the race for public advocate   will toss their names into the hat for the mayoral contest Ms  Klein  who after working for Mr  de Blasio co founded a consulting firm aimed at electing progressive women to office  pointed to a couple of reasons more women haven t run for mayor   The pipeline  Many elected officials get their start working for lawmakers  Ms  Klein said  Women miss out on that experience if they are not hired for those jobs   The signals  In big and small ways  society encourages men to speak up and women to be quiet  she said  Those messages can steer women out of the running long before any

WASHINGTON   Barbara Bush didn t bite her tongue in recent years when it came to Donald Trump  She just didn t like him  But a new biography of the former first lady finds that her disdain for the Republican president  who transformed the party her own family had embodied for generations into his likeness  dates as least as far back as a 1990s diary entry She referred to Trump in the entry as  the real symbol of greed in the 80s  Mrs  Bush  who was 92 when she died last April   gave Susan Page  author of  The Matriarch  Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty   access to volumes of her diaries  which she began keeping in 1948  The former first lady recounts in a January 1990 entry about reading a news article on Trump speaking at a Los Angeles charity awards dinner for Merv Griffin  Former President Ronald Reagan and his wife  Nancy  attended the gala  and Trump needled the former president over pricey speeches he had given in Japan Mrs  Bush later showed a friend news clips about Trump s separation from his first wife  Ivana  and noted that allies of the soon to be ex Mrs  Trump were saying a  25 million settlement in the prenuptial agreement she signed wouldn t be enough  The Trumps are a new word  both of them   Mrs  Bush wrote   Trump now means Greed  selfishness and ugly  So sad  Her dislike of Trump spiked more recently over the way he belittled her son  Jeb  when the New York businessman and the former Florida governor competed for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination  Trump also had criticized other members of the Bush clan  including George W  Bush over starting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Page  the Washington bureau chief for USA Today  also reveals that Mrs  Bush blamed Trump for causing her  angst  during the 2016 election   she called it a  heart attack    and leading her to question whether she was still a Republican  Asked in the months before she died whether she still considered herself a Republican  Mrs  Bush answered   I d probably say no today  The book  based also on five interviews Page conducted with Mrs  Bush  is due in bookstores Tuesday  It comes nearly a year after the passing of the second woman in U S  history to be the wife of one president and the mother of another The former first lady had drafted a tongue in cheek letter to send after the November 2016 election welcoming former President Bill Clinton to the club of first spouses  Clinton s wife  Hillary Clinton  was the Democratic candidate  and Mrs  Bush thought  as did many voters  that she would be the next president The letter never saw a mailbox  She woke up the morning after the election  and discovered  to my horror  that Trump had won  Weeks later  however  she wrote to Melania Trump  At the time  Mrs  Trump was the subject of intense speculation over whether she would relocate to the White House from her family s penthouse at New York s Trump Tower  Mrs  Bush encouraged the incoming first lady to do what was best for her and for the couple s young son  Barron  Mrs  Trump attended her predecessor s funeral Until the day she died  Mrs  Bush also kept on her bedside table a red  white and blue digital clock  given to her as a joke  that counted down to the end of Trump s term Mrs  Bush  who had been living in constant pain  fell and broke her back shortly before she died  In the hospital  after receiving the news that she was dying  she asked her doctor to keep it a secret  Once back at her Houston home  receiving only palliative care  she sat in the den holding hands with her husband of 73 years  They had the longest presidential marriage in U S  history He gave  Bar   as he called her  permission to die  and she gave her then 93 year old husband permission to live Then they each had a drink  bourbon for Mrs  Bush  a vodka martini for the former president She died two days later     

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is taking his interpretation of special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation well beyond the facts He says he s been fully exonerated based on a four page summary of Mueller s nearly 400 page report and is casting himself as a victim of illegal practices by the FBI because the agency investigated him in the first place But Trump is overstating his case  The FBI has legal grounds to open a probe if investigators have information they believe could lead them to a crime  even if one is not ultimately found  And the summary released by Attorney General William Barr says Mueller did not reach a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice Nor was the Russia probe hatched by Democrats  as Trump asserts  He often cites a so called dossier funded by the Democratic Party  but the probe s origins in fact were based on other evidence Trump s claims came in a week of plentiful exaggerations and misstatements  seen most prominently in a speech to Michigan supporters in which he sought credit for all manner of things  including money to clean up the Great Lakes  The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative actually was already getting that money   Trump had proposed slashing it Meanwhile  Democratic presidential candidate Beto O Rourke misstated the length of U S  involvement in the Iraq war A look at the political rhetoric and the facts RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONTRUMP   People were hurt so badly  so badly  Their lives have been ruined and over   you know  over something that should have never taken place  an investigation that should have never happened  There was no crime  as you know  You re only allowed to do this legally if there is a crime  There was no crime     Fox News interview Wednesday THE FACTS  Trump is wrong to suggest that the FBI acted illegally by investigating him  The FBI does not need to know if  or have evidence that  a crime occurred before it begins an investigation In fact  many investigations that are properly conducted ultimately don t find evidence of any crime  The FBI is empowered to open an investigation if there s information it has received or uncovered that leads the bureau to think it might encounter a crime  Apart from that  the investigation into the Trump campaign was initially a counterintelligence investigation rather than a strictly criminal one  as agents sought to understand whether and why Russia was meddling in the 2016 election    TRUMP   The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans  Many of them  they suffered  with an elaborate hoax     rally Thursday in Grand Rapids  Michigan THE FACTS  He falsely suggests that the Russia investigation was started by Democrats after losing the 2016 election Trump typically points to a dossier of anti Trump research financed by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton s campaign  which he incorrectly claims was the basis for the Russia probe  The research that was ultimately compiled into the dossier was initially financed by anti Trump conservatives  and later by the Democrats The FBI s investigation actually began months before it received the dossier Last year  the Republican controlled House Intelligence Committee found the Russia investigation was initiated after the FBI received information related to Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos  not the dossier  Trump praised the committee s final report at the time    TRUMP   Everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the No Collusion  No Obstruction Trump Campaign began     tweet Sunday TRUMP   After three years of lies and smears and slander  the Russia hoax is finally dead  The collusion delusion is over  The special counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction     Total exoneration  complete vindication     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Mueller did not vindicate Trump in  total  in the Russia probe  explicitly declining to clear him of obstruction Mueller s exact words in the report  as quoted by Barr  say   While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  The summary of principal conclusions by Barr notes Mueller did not  draw a conclusion   one way or the other   as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction   but rather set out evidence for both sides  leaving the question unanswered of whether Trump obstructed justice  Barr wrote in the summary that ultimately he decided as attorney general that the evidence developed by Mueller was  not sufficient  to establish  for the purposes of prosecution  that Trump committed obstruction Barr s summary also notes that Mueller did not find that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 presidential election in Trump s favor  To establish a crime  Mueller must generally meet a standard of proving an offense beyond a reasonable doubt  The summary did not clear the president of improper behavior regarding Russia but did not establish that  he was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference   Mueller said in a passage from the report quoted by Barr The summary signed by Barr gave the bottom line only as he and his deputy saw it  Democrats are pushing for release of Mueller s full report  Barr is expected to release a public version of the document in the coming weeks    TRUMP  speaking about allegations in a so called dossier about contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election   It came out after the election and everybody had a big fat yawn     All of the sudden I hear   Were you involved with Russia  I say   Russia  What the hell does Russia have to do with my campaign      Michigan rally THE FACTS  Russia actually had plenty to do with Trump s campaign According to U S  intelligence agencies and lengthy indictments brought by Mueller s team  Russia orchestrated a multipart influence campaign aimed at hurting Clinton s candidacy  undermining American democracy and helping Trump get elected That effort included the hacking of the Democratic National Committee  Clinton s campaign and other Democratic groups  Russian intelligence officers then coordinated the release of stolen emails and internal documents There were also plenty of people around Trump receptive to Russia s help  though Mueller s report ultimately did not find that those contacts amounted to a criminal conspiracy  according to Barr s summary In the middle of the campaign  Donald Trump Jr  met at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer thinking he would be getting  dirt  on Clinton  Trump Jr  agreed to the meeting  which included Trump son in law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort  despite it being described to him as part of a Russian government effort to help his father    TRUMP   You look at all of the different things  Russia would ve much rather had Hillary than Donald Trump  I can tell you that right now     Fox News interview Wednesday THE FACTS  Not according to Russian President Vladimir Putin  Asked at a news conference with Trump in July whether he wanted Trump to win the 2016 election  Putin responded   Yes  I did   Putin said he favored Trump  because he talked about bringing the U S  Russia relationship back to normal     MIGRANT CHILDRENTRUMP  on the care of migrant children apprehended at the border and the Dec  8 death of Jakelin Caal Maquin  7  of Guatemala   I think that it s been very well stated that we ve done a fantastic job      The father gave the child no water for a long period of time   he actually admitted blame     to reporters Friday THE FACTS  That s a misrepresentation of the circumstances behind the girl s death as Trump seeks to steer any potential blame for it away from his administration  An autopsy report released Friday found she died of a bacterial infection just more than a day after being apprehended by the U S  Border Patrol  The El Paso County Medical Examiner s office said Jakelin experienced a  rapidly progressive infection  that led to the failure of multiple organs Neither the autopsy report  nor accounts at the time by Customs and Border Protection   spoke of dehydration  The Border Protection timeline on her case said she was checked for medical problems upon her apprehension and   The initial screening revealed no evidence of health issues   And through family lawyers  Nery Gilberto Caal Cuz said after his daughter s death that he had made sure she had food and water as they traveled through Mexico  He did not say her death was his fault    IRAQ WARO ROURKE   We will ensure that this country does not start yet another war before every peaceful  diplomatic  nonviolent alternative is explored and pursued  and those wars that we ask our fellow Americans  these service members  to fight on our behalf  17 years and counting in Afghanistan  27 years and counting in Iraq  let s bring these wars to a close     remarks Saturday in El Paso THE FACTS  The U S  has not been fighting in a military conflict in Iraq for  27 years and counting   The Iraq war started 16 years ago By O Rourke s count  U S  involvement would date back to 1992  in an apparent reference to Operation Desert Storm  which ended in February 1991  President George H W  Bush launched that operation in response to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein s invasion of Kuwait  Bush declared a ceasefire in 1991 There was no ongoing military conflict after 1991  In 2003  President George W  Bush  the elder Bush s son  authorized the invasion of Iraq by a U S  led coalition that toppled Saddam s government  Later known as the  Iraq War   that conflict was part of what the younger Bush described as a U S  war against terrorism following the Sept  11  2001  attacks    GREAT LAKESTRUMP   I support the Great Lakes  Always have  They are beautiful  They are big  very deep  record deepness  right  And I m going to get  in honor of my friends  full funding of  300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative  which you have been trying to get for over 30 years  So we will get it done     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Trump s recent budget proposal sought to cut federal financing of that program by 90 percent  His comment actually meant that his administration would   presumably   give up its efforts over the last few years to cut the program  which has been receiving about  300 million a year since 2010 His assertion that this money has eluded supporters of the lakes for three decades is wrong The program is popular with lawmakers from both parties and it was unlikely that the Trump cut would prevail Also  the Great Lakes are not the world s deepest  or even among the 20 deepest     SPECIAL OLYMPICSTRUMP   I have overridden my people  We re funding the Special Olympics     remarks to reporters Thursday THE FACTS  In this instance  unlike in the Great Lakes matter  Trump is acknowledging that it was his administration that had proposed to cut the money  though by blaming  my people  he did not take direct responsibility In any event  spending is up to Congress  not him  What he means is that the White House is dropping its budget proposal to deny federal money for the games    HEALTH CARETRUMP   We will always protect patients with pre existing conditions  always     Michigan rally THE FACTS  He s not protecting health coverage for patients with pre existing medical conditions  In fact  the Trump administration is pressing in court for full repeal of the Affordable Care Act   including provisions that protect people with pre existing conditions from health insurance discrimination Trump and other Republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve those safeguards  but the White House has provided no details  And it s a stretch to think they could get a Republicans only plan passed through Congress with the House under Democratic control President Barack Obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants  regardless of medical history  and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones  Bills supported in 2017 by Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions    TRUMP   The Republican Party will become the party of great health care      Republicans want you to have an affordable plan that s just right for you     Michigan rally TRUMP   If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out  we will have a plan that s far better than Obamacare     remarks Wednesday to reporters THE FACTS  Republicans may aspire to great health care but they don t have a comprehensive plan for it  And there s no indication that the White House  executive branch agencies like Health and Human Services  and Republicans in Congress are working on one Trump s recent budget called for repealing  Obamacare  and setting hard limits on federal spending for Medicaid  which covers low income people  Some Republicans argue that would be better  because the federal government would create a new program of health care grants to states  But when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed similar proposals a couple of years ago  it estimated such changes would result in deep coverage losses  not to mention weaker insurance protections for people with pre existing medical conditions Trump s budget also called for hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare cuts to hospitals and other service providers  a nonstarter with lawmakers in Congress worried about re election next year The Supreme Court has upheld the health care law twice in previous challenges  The five justices who first upheld it in 2012 are still on the court Congressional Republicans are generally trying to steer away from Obamacare spats  Some are trying to focus on areas where they might find common ground with Democrats and the president  such as reducing prescription drug costs    AUTOSTRUMP   We are bringing a lot of those car companies back      They are pouring back in    Michigan rally TRUMP   We re opening up car plants in Michigan again for the first time in decades  They re coming in  really pouring in      And this has been happening pretty much since I ve been president  It s really amazing what s going on     We ve brought back so much industry  so many car companies to Michigan  so we re very happy     remarks Thursday while departing for Michigan THE FACTS  There is very little truth in those remarks The only automaker announcing plans to reopen a plant in Michigan is Fiat Chrysler  which is restarting an old engine plant to build three row SUVs  It s been planning to do so since before Trump was elected  GM is even closing two Detroit area factories  one that builds cars and another that builds transmissions Automakers have made announcements about new models being built in the state  but no other factories have been reopened  Ford stopped building the Focus compact car in the Detroit suburb of Wayne last year  but it s being replaced by the manufacture of a small pickup and a new SUV  That announcement was made in December 2016  before Trump took office GM  meantime  is closing factories in Ohio and Maryland Trump can plausibly claim that his policies have encouraged some activity in the domestic auto industry  Corporate tax cuts freed more money for investment  and potential tariff increases on imported vehicles are an incentive to build in the U S But automakers have not been  pouring in  at all  as he persistently claims  and when expansion does happen  it s not all because of him Fiat Chrysler has been planning the SUVs for several years and has been looking at expansion in the Detroit area  where it has unused building space and an abundant  trainable automotive labor force Normally it takes at least three years for an automaker to plan a new vehicle  which is the case with the three row Jeep Grand Cherokee and the larger Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs that will fill the restarting Detroit area plant and an existing one  Several years ago then CEO Sergio Marchionne said the Wagoneer would be built in the Detroit area Detroit automakers usually build larger vehicles in the U S  because the profit margins are high enough to cover the higher wages paid there versus Mexico or another lower cost country    IMMIGRATIONTRUMP  on diversity visas   They are giving us their worst people     Michigan rally THE FACTS  That s false The diversity visa lottery program is run by the U S  government  not foreign governments  Other countries do not get to sort through their populations looking for bad apples to put in for export to the U S  Citizens of qualifying countries are the ones who decide to bid for visas under the program  Trump routinely blames foreign states The program requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the last five years in a selection of fields  Out of that pool of people from certain countries who meet those conditions  the State Department randomly selects a much smaller pool of winners  Not all winners will have visas ultimately approved  because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly  Those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks  like other immigrants The lottery is extended to citizens of most countries  except about 20  The primary goal is to diversify the immigrant population by creating slots for underrepresented parts of the world    JOBSTRUMP   We have created  since my election  5 5 million new jobs  Nobody would have believed that was possible     Michigan rally THE FACTS  His number is about right  but he s counting jobs created before he became president  And the progress does not defy belief  The economy created about 6 million jobs in the roughly two years before the election  then again in the roughly two years after    VETERANSTRUMP   They ve been trying to get VA Choice for over 40 years  Couldn t do it  I got it  We signed it six months ago     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Not true  He s not the first president in 40 years to get Congress to pass a private sector health program for veterans  he expanded it  Congress first approved the program in 2014 during the Obama administration  The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles  65 kilometers  to a VA facility Now  starting in June  they are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days  28 for specialty care  or their drive is only 30 minutes    TRUMP   Instead of waiting online for one day  one week  two months    now they go outside  they see a private doctor  we pay the bill  they get better quickly     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Also not right  Veterans still must wait for weeks before they can get private care outside the VA system And the expanded Choice eligibility may do little to provide immediate help  That s because veterans often must wait even longer for an appointment in the private sector  Last year  then Secretary David Shulkin said VA care is  often 40 percent better in terms of wait times  compared with the private sector  In 2018  34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians  down from 36 percent in 2017 At a hearing Tuesday  the top health official at VA  Dr  Richard Stone  described the start of the expanded Choice program to  almost be a non event   in part because wait times in the private sector are typically longer than at VA The VA also must resolve long term financing because of congressional budget caps after the White House opposed new money to pay for the program  As a result  lawmakers could be forced later this year to limit the program or slash core VA or other domestic programs    Associated Press writers Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar and Chad Day in

SANTA ANA  Calif    Michael Avenatti is insistent that  justice will be done  after facing fraud charges Monday in federal court in California  a week after the attorney famous for representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in legal battles against President Donald Trump was arrested in New York After a brief hearing in the Orange County city of Santa Ana  Avenatti said he has long represented  Davids versus Goliaths  in the same justice system in which he now is charged with bank and wire fraud  I am highly confident that when the process plays out  that justice will be done   he told a group of reporters outside the courthouse without taking questions Avenatti  48  is charged in Southern California with filing bogus tax returns to fraudulently obtain  4 million in loans from a Mississippi bank and pocketing  1 6 million that belonged to a client He has long faced allegations from a former client and a former partner that he was hiding money to avoid paying what he owed them Now  federal authorities have added their voices to that chorus  with the specter of a long prison sentence that could be the downfall of a man who once considered challenging Trump in his re election bid He was arrested last week in New York  where he was charged in a separate case with trying to extort millions of dollars from Nike  He was released on  300 000 bail and has said he expects to be exonerated On Monday  Avenatti waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the charges in California and was scheduled to be arraigned April 29  His lawyer said Avenatti may seek a waiver so his attorneys can enter a not guilty plea on his behalf In New York  prosecutors allege that Avenatti tried to shake down Nike for millions of dollars so he wouldn t reveal allegations the apparel company paid off high school basketball players  He has denied the charge to reporters and began tweeting what he called evidence of the scandal the day after he was arrested Avenatti is known for his outspoken challenge of Trump and his lavish lifestyle  He represented Daniels in her claim that Trump paid her to keep quiet about their alleged affair ahead of the 2016 election Federal prosecutors said he rented a  100 000 a month home in upscale Newport Beach for about a year  a claim that Avenatti called  completely false  in a Twitter post He also claimed loans to the Mississippi bank were repaid  years ago IN FULL  A former partner of Avenatti s won a  10 million judgment against the law firm where they worked and is still seeking to collect it

For weeks  millions of protesters filling Algeria s streets have demanded the end of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika s 20 year rule  as well as the  System  of cronyism and corruption he oversaw  On Tuesday night  the wheelchair bound  82 year old president was finally forced from power The final push came from the army chief of staff  Ahmed Gad Salah  a former ally who belatedly came around to the protesters  view that the president was physically unable to perform his role  and was being used by a tight circle of family members and businessmen to preserve their privileges The country s constitutional council ratified the resignation on Wednesday  formally ending the rule of a man who had locked down Algeria s politics for a generation  but leaving the country on the threshold of new uncertainties Even though the protesters remarkably succeeded in removing Mr  Bouteflika from office without a single life lost or shot fired by the security services  the standoff is far from over What happens now ImageSenate Speaker Abdelkader Bensalah  a Bouteflika ally  is to oversee an interim government for 90 days  while elections are organized CreditFethi Belaid Agence France Presse

 Bouteflika on Sunday night is still in charge  It will be presided over by a Bouteflika ally  the elderly head of the country s senate  Abdelkader Bensalah  for 90 days  while elections are organized The prime minister named by Mr  Bouteflika  former Interior Minister Noureddine Bedoui  is seen as a Bouteflika loyalist and hard liner  castigated by the political opposition and protesters as the man who organized rigged legislative elections in 2017 and has violently put down protests before Who is running things ImageThe ailing President Bouteflika  shown on state television  handing over his resignation letter to the head of the constitutional council  Tayeb Belaiz  as Mr  Bensalah  looked on Creditvia ReutersThe interim government presided over by Mr  Bedoui and Mr  Bensalah is nominally in charge  But it is certain that the army will keep a close watch on it  It is equally certain that its credibility with the street is limited  And it is an open question as to how long it lasts The images on Algerian television were telling  A feeble looking Mr  Bouteflika handing his resignation letter to the elderly president of the country s constitutional council  watched by another elderly man  Mr  Bensalah  who will decide the country s destiny as Mr  Bouteflika s temporary replacement That scenario is unlikely to reassure the thousands of youthful protesters who gathered to celebrate Mr  Bouteflika s departure Tuesday night in central Algiers  Although their main demand has been met  the two other men in the televised images symbolize the protesters  other complaint  that Algeria remains in the hands of the  System   the nexus of compromised politicians  businessmen and military who have kept democracy firmly at bay Will this satisfy the protesters ImageA protest against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algiers last week CreditMohamed Messara EPA  via ShutterstockThat is unlikely  The interim government is already seen as Mr  Bouteflika s creature  and Mr  Bensalah is widely known as a Bouteflika loyalist and the beneficiary of the ex president s patronage The protesters have been unified under the slogan    Systme degage   or   System Get Lost    Everybody associated with the Bouteflika regime is suspect in their eyes and has no legitimacy  They are demanding nothing less than a clean slate   new leaders  real elections  and a real rule of law  Algeria has known none of these things Meetings of opposition politicians and civil society groups are taking place in Algiers to map out a future for the country  Out of these meetings a few figures have emerged who could play a leading role  notably the human rights lawyer Mostefa Bouchachi What is the military likely to do ImageThe army chief of staff  Gen  Ahmed Gaid Salah  gave Mr  Bouteflika a final push CreditAnis Belghoul Associated PressThe unresolved question for the coming days is  how far is the military likely to let the protesters go in their demand for an overhaul of the  System   General Salah himself  though now proclaiming himself on the side of the crowd  was very much part of the old regime The army has been the ultimate arbiter of political life since independence 57 years ago  This time  too  it was the army that gave the final push to Mr  Bouteflika  Without the army s support it is unlikely the protest movement would have been successful in its goal to oust the ex president Is the army now willing to turn the country s future entirely over to civilians  with no say  Unlikely  They are not going to stop Algerians from searching for a new Algeria  but they want to be present   an actor   because they have interests to protect   said Hasni Abidi  Algerian Swiss director of the Center for Study and Research on the Arab and Mediterranean World  in Geneva  It this role that is problematic   Mr  Abidi said   The army is the only decisive actor  But since Feb  22    the date of the first demonstration    there is another actor  the

WASHINGTON   His border shutdown went from imminent to uncertain  A major health care push was declared and then delayed  Funding cuts were inserted in his proposed budget and just as quickly taken out President Donald Trump has been exploring the art of the climb down Trump pivoted on two big policy fronts this week  easing up on his threats to quickly close the southern border and deciding that a fresh effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act should wait until after the 2020 election The moves came as Republicans  outside groups and aides expressed anxiety about the potential economic and political fallout from Trump s proposals The president s swift backpedaling underscored his off the cuff style and suggested that more such drama is likely ahead as he tries to sync his policymaking with his re election campaign To many  the Washington whiplash was another reminder that Trump tweets first and governs later  Most presidents and even most CEOs  when they make a decision that is going to have financial impact or personnel impact  you seek a lot of input   said Republican strategist Rick Tyler   He doesn t do that  Even his own communications staff says he goes by his gut  The president s pronouncements and social media blasts are often surprise attacks  They can vanish as quickly as they emerge if political expedience warrants a different tack His announcement last week that the GOP was going to take on health care again despite a bruising and unsuccessful effort in 2017 stunned most in his own party and seemed driven in part by a lingering desire to fulfill his oft repeated 2016 campaign promise to repeal  Obamacare  He surprised his own education secretary with the declaration that he was reversing a plan to ax federal aid for the Special Olympics after the proposed cuts sparked a public outcry Few working for him ever want to get out in front of a Trump announcement for fear it will change at the last minute Trump s latest policy twists come after the conclusion of the special counsel s Russia investigation and as the president is turning his attention to his 2020 campaign His loose style also reflects his current leadership team  Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is viewed as a less controlling figure than previous chiefs  seeking to provide Trump with analysis and information  but not trying to restrict his conversations or steer his decisions After threatening last week to seal the border if Mexico did not immediately halt all illegal immigration into the U S   Trump on Tuesday appeared to be laying the groundwork for a delay  saying he was happy with steps taken by Mexico and that he would like to see Congress pass legislation revising the immigration system  Still  he held open the possibility of a border shutdown  saying   I m totally ready to do it  Trump has been threatening the closure privately for months  but his staff has been trying to slow him down with data about the economic impact and suggestions on ways to lessen the financial hit The president acknowledged the economy was on his mind Tuesday but played down those concerns  saying   Let me just give you a little secret  Security is more important to me than trade  On health care  Trump plunged into the fight again last week  prompted by a court deadline  But his motivations were always as political as they were legislative  with the president not wanting to cede a 2020 campaign issue to Democrats  And allies stressed Tuesday that the president had never laid out a timeline for legislation With his tweet Monday night  Trump made clear there would be no vote until after the 2020 election  though he insisted a GOP plan still was in the works His downgrade came after pressure from congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who said he told Trump  we were not going to be doing that in the Senate  Asked if he was acting at McConnell s behest  Trump insisted   I wanted to delay it myself  Heading into 2020  Trump sees border security and health care as key issues for his political base and he is expected to keep pushing them even if he dials back specific threats Speaking Tuesday night at the National Republican Congressional Committee s spring dinner  he declared that Republicans  should not run away from health care   If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose   Trump said    Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Kevin Freking contributed to this report

WASHINGTON   He flew across the ocean to celebrate NATO s 70th anniversary with the largest and most important member of the military alliance  So to outsiders it appeared to be an awkward moment on Tuesday for Jens Stoltenberg  the NATO secretary general  as he sat stiffly by while President Trump criticized German defense spending and predicted that the United States would get along with Russia  I accept there are differences  but when it comes to defense spending we all agree   Mr  Stoltenberg said in an interview after his meeting with Mr  Trump  putting a positive spin on the situation He said the president had helped push member states to budget an additional  100 billion in defense spending and credited Mr  Trump with  having a real impact   I say that because it is a fact   Mr  Stoltenberg said   Allies are now really stepping up  But not all  Germany will most likely slow the growth of its defense spending   meaning that Europe s economic powerhouse will defy a spending target set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  And other member states are struggling to reach the current goal of spending 2 percent of their economic output on the military by the end of 2024 The scene on Tuesday was just the latest example of Mr  Stoltenberg s unenviable efforts to bridge seemingly irreconcilable positions between Europe and the United States He is the European leader who has shown the most deft hand with Mr  Trump  A trained statistician  Mr  Stoltenberg came to the White House with charts showing how defense spending has risen But his credit of Mr  Trump for the spending increases has annoyed European leaders  He is a little too diplomatic   said Jim Townsend  a former Pentagon official who oversaw relations with NATO and is now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security   Sometimes he has a hard time whacking an ally over the head  Mr  Stoltenberg has sought to balance Mr  Trump against German politicians  who have made clear they are sick of the president s demands  The challenge will only grow throughout this week as Mr  Stoltenberg appears before members of Congress to praise both their support of the military alliance and Mr  Trump s drive for a more equitable share of military burdens Germany this year is putting 1 35 percent of its gross domestic product toward defense spending  and in 2020 will spend 1 37 percent  New budget projections by Berlin show Germany will spend 1 25 percent of its economic output by 2023 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the defense minister  Ursula von der Leyen  have said they remain committed to the 2 percent goal   Germany will keep its promise   Ms  von der Leyen said Tuesday on German public radio Hours later  fueling the pressure  Mr  Trump said member states should spend potentially even more than 2 percent on defense In the Oval Office  Mr  Stoltenberg sat stone faced as Mr  Trump criticized Germany for  not paying their fair share   The president also predicted   I think we ll get along with Russia   ImageGerman armored vehicles and an American helicopter during NATO led exercises  Germany s defense spending levels fall below what President Trump is demanding from alliance members CreditIrakli Gedenidze ReutersSince 2014  NATO has deployed military forces to Eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression  It has also intensified efforts to rebuild European militaries that have eroded since the end of the Cold War But the alliance faces an array of challenges it has not previously confronted  and does not yet know how to tackle   including Russian interference in elections and domestic politics  and China s economic investments in telecommunications networks In the interview with The New York Times  Mr  Stoltenberg suggested the alliance s policy on Russia was consistent with Mr  Trump s desire for better relations  He pointed to the cooperation by his own home country  Norway  with Russia on fisheries and other matters  We now have a strong  common understanding of how to approach Russia   Mr  Stoltenberg said   Those allies who were skeptical of dialogue with Russia have seen that we have delivered on deterrence and defense  The gatherings to commemorate NATO s anniversary were originally planned as a week of events in Washington for heads of state and government  But Mr  Trump s angry speeches  public and private  at other alliance gatherings over the last two years persuaded allies to downgrade the anniversary celebration to a meeting of foreign ministers The goal  according to current and former American and European officials  was to limit Mr  Trump s participation Even Tuesday s meeting with Mr  Trump was not originally on Mr  Stoltenberg s agenda  But then Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had invited the NATO chief to address Congress  a speech that is scheduled for Wednesday European officials said Mr  Stoltenberg had not yet accepted the invitation when Ms  Pelosi announced it  That put him in the position of potentially leaving Washington without seeing the president but addressing the Democrat led House  which has approved a measure that seeks to block Mr  Trump from withdrawing from the military alliance Last week  NATO made the unusual move of extending Mr  Stoltenberg s term a second time  by two more years  meaning he would leave office in 2022  It is an acknowledgment of Mr  Stoltenberg s deft touch not just with Mr  Trump  but also with other difficult alliance leaders  including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary Mr  Trump endorsed the extension on Tuesday   I had no doubt in my mind who I wanted   he said European officials said their worries about Mr  Stoltenberg s cozy relationship with Mr  Trump were pushed aside  largely to avoid giving the president an outsize role in selecting a new NATO leader  Mr  Stoltenberg was scheduled to step down in 2020  at the height of an intense election in the United States In the interview with The Times  Mr  Stoltenberg said he had consulted with Ms  Merkel  and noted that the new budget unveiled by Germany was not final  Germany has submitted a spending plan to NATO that shows defense spending rising by 80 percent between 2014 and 2024  he said  adding that he expected Berlin to live up to that plan  The Germans have told me it will further increase   he said Friction is growing in Germany  The Social Democrats  Ms  Merkel s center left coalition partners who control the finance ministry and were in charge of the latest budget plan  are using the dislike of Mr  Trump in their election campaign ahead of European parliamentary elections in May Julianne Smith  a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin and a former Obama administration national security official  said the Social Democrats were using the military budget to show they were the party  that stands up to Donald Trump   This decision became a bit of a referendum on Donald Trump  instead of a referendum on Germany s hollowed out forces that desperately need these resources   she said  

CAIRO   Egypt has sentenced more than 70 suspected members of the Muslim Brotherhood group to prison on terror related charges The Ismailia criminal court on Tuesday sentenced nine of the defendants to 15 years in prison and 43 others to 10 years  Another 22 were sentenced to three to seven years  and 14 were acquitted  Nearly half of the defendants were tried in absentia The defendants were accused of burning police vehicles and attacking a coffee shop  The violence came in response to the dispersal of two mass sit ins in Cairo in 2013  in which security forces killed hundreds of Brotherhood supporters The Brotherhood won a series of free elections following Egypt s 2011 uprising but was branded a terrorist group after the military overthrew an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013  

On Election Day in 2016  the Republican Party was divided against itself  split over its nominee for president  Donald J  Trump In Ohio  a crucial battleground  the state party chairman had repeatedly chided Mr  Trump in public  amplifying the concerns of Gov  John Kasich  a Republican dissenter  In New Hampshire  the party chairman harbored deep  if largely private  misgivings about her party s nominee  The Republican Party of Florida was listing  hobbled by local feuds and a rift between donors loyal to Senator Marco Rubio and former Gov  Jeb Bush and those backing the man who humiliated both in the primaries Those power struggles have now been resolved in a one sided fashion  In every state important to the 2020 race  Mr  Trump and his lieutenants are in firm control of the Republican electoral machinery  and they are taking steps to extend and tighten their grip It is  in every institutional sense  Mr  Trump s party As Mr  Trump has prepared to embark on a difficult fight for re election  a small but ferocious operation within his campaign has helped install loyal allies atop the most significant state parties and urged them to speak up loudly to discourage conservative criticism of Mr  Trump  The campaign has dispatched aides to state party conclaves  Republican executive committee meetings and fund raising dinners  all with the aim of ensuring the delegates at next year s  convention in Charlotte  N C   are utterly committed to Mr  Trump  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  To Joe Gruters  who was co chairman of Mr  Trump s campaign in Florida and now leads the state party  the local Republican Party is effectively a regional arm of the president s re election effort  I ve had probably 10 conversations with the Trump team about the delegate selection process in Florida   Mr  Gruters said  adding of a potential Republican primary battle   The base of the party loves our president  and if anybody runs against him  they are going to get absolutely smashed  State and local Republican organizations typically operate below the radar of national politics  but they can be vital to the success of a presidential candidate  Party chairmen and their deputies are tasked with everything from raising money to deploying volunteers to knock on doors  and in many states they help choose delegates for the nominating convention ImageVal DiGiorgio is the chairman of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania  one of the most vulnerable states from Mr  Trump s 2016 coalition CreditHannah Yoon for The New York TimesFor Mr  Trump  who prevailed in 2016 as an outsider with little connection to his party s electoral apparatus  the ability to control the levers of Republican politics at the state level could make the difference in a close election or a contested primary  It also leaves other Republicans with precious little room to oppose Mr  Trump on his policy preferences or administrative whims   on matters from health care to the Mexican border   for fear of retribution from within the party Mr  Trump s aides have focused most intently on heading off any dissent at the Charlotte convention  To that end  two of Mr  Trump s top campaign aides  Bill Stepien and Justin Clark  have worked quietly but methodically in a series of states where control of the local party was up for grabs  They have lifted Mr  Trump s allies even in deep blue states like Massachusetts  and worked to make peace between competing pro Trump factions in more competitive states such as Colorado The devotion to Mr  Trump was on clear display Saturday outside Denver  where the state party gathered to elect a new chairman  Though Mr  Trump s unpopularity helped drive Colorado Republicans to deep losses last fall  there was no sign of unrest  Mr  Trump s name was emblazoned on lapel pins and a flag toted by one candidate for the chairmanship  and his slogan    Make America Great Again    was printed on the red hat from which the candidates drew lots to determine their speaking order Mr  Trump himself stayed out of the race  and campaign aides sent the White House a short memo last month urging the president not to pick sides between allies after Representative Ken Buck  a deeply conservative candidate  lobbied administration officials for support But when Mr  Buck claimed victory in the race for chairman  he described his mission in terms of unflinching loyalty to the president  The key is that we make sure that the voters of Colorado understand the great job the president has done   Mr  Buck said   That is what my job is  Mr  Trump faces at least a quixotic challenge in the Republican primaries from William F  Weld  a moderate former governor of Massachusetts  and other Republicans have toyed with entering the race  But advisers to Mr  Trump view it as an urgent priority to maintain Republican support  With low approval ratings among voters at large  including educated whites who once leaned Republican  Mr  Trump can ill afford additional fractures on the right ImageDevotion to President Trump was on display Saturday outside Denver  where the Colorado Republican Party met to select a new chairman for the coming presidential campaign CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesSo far  loyalty has prevailed  There is no challenge to the president   declared John Watson  a former supporter of Mr  Kasich who now leads the Georgia Republican Party   The party is in near unanimous lock step in support of him  certainly at the activist and delegate level  In some respects  the shift toward Mr  Trump in Republican state organizations has been organic  driven by the president s immense popularity with the party s most committed voters  In Arizona  an emerging presidential swing state  conservative activists in January ejected a chairman aligned with the Republican establishment in favor of Kelli Ward  a former Senate candidate with fringe views who tied herself closely to Mr  Trump But Mr  Trump and his aides have also taken a more active hand in shaping the party leadership around the country  mostly to their own great advantage  according to half a dozen Republicans briefed on the Trump campaign s loyalty operation  A division of the Trump campaign known as the Delegates and Party Organization unit has closely tracked state party leadership elections and occasionally weighed in to help a preferred contender In Michigan  for instance  Mr  Trump s campaign manager  Brad Parscale  recently endorsed a former state legislator  Laura Cox  to take over Michigan s discombobulated state party The Trump campaign has also taken steps to blunt the influence of a few Republican governors who are hostile to the president  In Massachusetts  Trump aides worked in January to help a hard line candidate  Jim Lyons  win the chairmanship against a candidate linked closely to the state s Republican governor  Charlie Baker  who is a critic of Mr  Trump   As a candidate  Mr  Lyons vowed to  make the Massachusetts Republican Party great again   In Maryland  where Gov  Larry Hogan has mused about challenging Mr  Trump  presidential loyalists in the party apparatus are prepared to flout Mr  Hogan s wishes in selecting delegates  In Maryland and some other states  convention delegates are selected by a combination of primary voters and members of the state party committee   constituencies overwhelmingly supportive of Mr  Trump  No other candidate  no matter if it s Governor Hogan  Bill Weld or anybody else  will get one single delegate out of Maryland   said David Bossie  the state s R N C  committeeman and an adviser to Mr  Trump Image The key is that we make sure that the voters of Colorado understand the great job the president has done   said Representative Ken Buck  the Colorado G O P  chairman   That is what my job is  CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesSome states are so fully in the grips of Trump enthusiasts that the campaign has sought to keep Mr  Trump neutral in local races  out of concern that he could alienate one supportive faction or another  In Rhode Island last weekend  the campaign dispatched an aide to answer questions from party activists about Mr  Trump s view of the race for state chairman  after Sean Spicer  the former White House press secretary  reportedly made calls on behalf of a candidate who was ultimately defeated  The Trump campaign made clear that Mr  Spicer had been acting on his own  a person familiar with the conversations said Last month  several top Trump strategists  including Mr  Stepien and Mr  Clark  informed the president directly on the efforts to lock down party organizations for his re election  people briefed on the meeting said  In a statement  Mr  Clark described the operation as part of a long run up to the 2020 convention  Like any good campaign operation  we are working to ensure that state party chairs and delegates reflect the will of Republican voters  who support President Trump in record numbers   Mr  Clark said   Our goal is to pave the way for a convention in Charlotte that gives the president a multiday platform to share his achievements with 300 million Americans  Though the Republican National Committee has stopped short of formally endorsing Mr  Trump  state chairmen elected with the help of Mr  Trump s campaign have defended him fiercely  even from Mr  Weld s long shot effort  When the former Massachusetts governor rolled out his campaign  Mr  Lyons blasted him harshly  as did Stephen Stepanek  a former co chairman for the Trump campaign in New Hampshire who now leads that state s Republican Party That hard edge approach has stirred some discomfort in New Hampshire  where some traditional Republicans prize the state s reputation for political independence and have resisted efforts to quash an open primary  Steve Duprey  a member of the Republican National Committee from the state  hosted Mr  Weld there in late March and argued that New Hampshire s  special role  as an early voting state required it to be open to candidates besides Mr  Trump  He said in an interview he believed primary competition was healthy  as a general matter  Our job is to be neutral and treat them all equally  period   argued Mr  Duprey  who was a close adviser to John McCain There are still elements of the Republican Party that have yet to fall fully in line behind the president  Republicans acknowledge  The party suffered serious defections in 2018 among moderate white voters who have historically tended to support Republicans  and some of the party s traditional financial backers have not yet committed to supporting him in 2020  Advisers to Mr  Trump acknowledge that mobilizing the party s major donor base remains one of the most important challenges for his campaign But there is no comparable reticence among the Republican Party s field captains in the states  At the meeting in Colorado over the weekend  Vera Ortegon  the state s R N C  committeewoman  alluded to the president s nagging Republican critics in the form of a stern warning  If you know any Never Trumpers   Ms  Ortegon said   send them to me   

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump took a shot on Tuesday at former Vice President Joe Biden  a possible Democratic rival in the 2020 race for the White House  mocking him over allegations of unwanted physical contact with women In a speech to a fundraising dinner for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump twice alluded to the allegations from two women that are hanging over Biden as he weighs whether to enter the contest to become the Democratic candidate in November 2020 presidential elections A former Nevada state legislator last week accused Biden of kissing her on the back of the head at a 2014 event  and a Connecticut woman said Biden rubbed noses with her at a 2009 event  Biden has said he did not believe he ever acted inappropriately  and his defenders have said he is known for hugging and being physically affectionate In wide ranging remarks that meandered for more than 80 minutes but often circled back to the 2020 race  Biden was the only potential rival Trump mentioned by name   a sign that he would view Biden as a strong challenger  were he to enter and win the Democratic race Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama and had a long career in the Senate before that  He had been expected to announce his bid for the Democratic primary race this month and has led the large field of Democratic hopefuls in opinion polls Trump told the dinner  which raised  23 million for Republicans running for the House of Representatives  a story about wanting to kiss a general he met in Iraq who had promised an expedient end to a campaign against Islamic State militants in Syria  I said   General  come here and give me a kiss   I felt like Joe Biden   Trump said  drawing laughter and applause Earlier  he told the crowd   which was dotted with members of the House   that they would be  going into the war with some socialists  in the next election  It looks like the only non   sort of  heavy socialist is being taken care of pretty well by the socialists   Trump said One of Biden s accusers has been a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders  who has already entered the Democratic primary race  and whose views are to the left of Biden  I was going to call him   I don t know him well   I was going to say   Welcome to the world  Joe  You having a good time  Joe  You having a good time   Trump said Trump struggled during his 2016 run for office with multiple accusations of unwanted sexual contact from women  particularly after videotaped remarks emerged of Trump bragging about groping women Biden  while campaigning for Trump s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton  had said he would like to take Trump  behind the gym  to beat him up for the comments   Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland  Editing by Michael Perry  

LONDON   The Latest on Britain s exit from the European Union  all times local  10 50 p m The European Parliament s top Brexit official says the U K  has a  last chance  to break the deadlock on leaving the European Union Guy Verhofstadt tweeted the comments soon after Britain s Parliament again rejected alternative options to Prime Minister Theresa May s Brexit deal  Parliament has carved out time on Wednesday for another series of indicative votes on Brexit options Verhofstadt said   The House of Commons again votes against all options  A hard  Brexit becomes nearly inevitable  On Wednesday  the U K  has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss  Britain is legally due to leave the EU on April 12  after the bloc agreed to extend the March 29 deadline    10 20 p m U K  Conservative Party legislator Nick Boles says he is quitting the party after one of his Brexit proposals was voted down Boles made the dramatic statement in Parliament moments after the results of the votes were announced  saying he couldn t remain in the party  Boles  proposal called for Britain to remain in the European Union s single market for goods and services  It was narrowly defeated by 282 261 Boles said that  I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise   He said he regretted that he could no longer be part of the party The Conservative Party led by Prime Minister Theresa May is deeply split between those who favor a hard Brexit with few ties to the EU and those seeking a softer divorce deal    10 15 p m British government says it will continue to pursue support for Prime Minister Theresa May s Brexit deal Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay says that May s deal is the only way forward in light of Parliament s inability to find a clear majority for an alternative arrangement  May s deal has already been rejected three times Barclay says the default position calls for Britain to leave the European Union in 11 days  He says if Parliament agrees to May s withdrawal agreement this week it  may be possible  to leave the EU without participating in European elections in late May He says the Cabinet will meet Tuesday to discuss options    10 10 p m British lawmakers have failed to find a majority for any proposal in votes on alternatives to the government s rejected Brexit deal Lawmakers rejected four options in votes in the House of Commons The votes were an attempt to forge an alternative to the government s rejected European Union divorce deal The options included remaining in a customs union with the EU   which failed by just three votes   and holding a new referendum on Britain s membership in the bloc The government is still trying to build support for Prime Minister Theresa May s Brexit deal  which has been rejected three times by Parliament Britain is due to leave the EU on April 12 without an agreement unless it passes a divorce deal or secures an extension from the bloc    8 p m British lawmakers have started voting on four alternatives to the government s thrice rejected Brexit deal Rather than the usual procedure of voting with their feet by walking through  aye  and  no  lobbies  members of Parliament are each receiving a paper ballot listing all four options Legislators have half an hour to vote before ballots are collected and counted  Results are due around 2100 GMT  5 p m  EDT  The options include remaining in a customs union with the EU and holding a new referendum on Britain s membership in the bloc    5 20 p m British lawmakers are considering four alternatives to Prime Minister Theresa May s rejected Brexit deal  in hopes of finding a plan that can command majority support The options up for votes Monday night in Parliament include two proposals that aim to retain close economic ties between Britain and the European Union  One would keep the U K  in a customs union for goods with the EU after Brexit  while another calls for Britain to stay in the bloc s single market for both goods and services Another option wants any Brexit deal to be submitted to a public referendum  and the fourth says Britain should cancel its departure from the EU if it comes within two days of crashing out of the bloc without an agreement House of Commons Speaker John Bercow chose the options from eight ideas submitted    2 55 p m A leading credit ratings agency has reiterated the array of economic difficulties it foresees Britain encountering if the country crashes out of the European Union without an exit deal Standard   Poor s said in an update Monday that a disorderly Brexit would  adversely affect income levels and growth prospects  as well as government finances  S P also is warning that Britain s withdrawal could  significantly limit  access to key European markets  The ratings agency says if that happens  it would expect  downward pressure  on house prices  a significant increase in the country s debt and a further drop in the value of the pound S P has said such a scenario could lead it to downgrade Britain s AA long term credit rating U K  lawmakers are voting later Monday on alternatives to the European Union withdrawal deal proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May  Parliament has voted down May s deal three times The EU gave Britain until April 12 to come up with a new plan or to leave the bloc without a deal It s unclear if May would accept any option that might win approval in the House of Commons    1 25 p m The chief executive of industrial manufacturer Siemens U K  is imploring British lawmakers to unite around a compromise Brexit deal  saying the country s political chaos is making the U K  a  laughing stock  Parliament is set to vote Monday on several alternatives to the European Union withdrawal deal proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May Siemens U K  CEO Juergen Maier urged lawmakers in an open letter to choose an option that keeps Britain in a customs union with the EU  He said that choice would allow frictionless trade to continue between the U K  and the EU  something many firms have come to rely on Maier also wrote that Britain s political paralysis is  making it hard to win support for finely balanced investment decisions that in the end have an impact on U K  jobs  innovation and the competitiveness of our activities here  May s spokesman  James Slack  says the prime minister understands that  business wants certainty   He said lawmakers should support May s Brexit deal  which the House of Commons has rejected three times    1 p m The head of the European Union s executive is stressing that Britain will have to take part in May s European Parliament elections if it remains an EU member beyond April 12 Britain either has to leave the EU on April 12 or come up with an alternative plan  which   unless it decides to revoke Brexit   is likely to involve delaying its withdrawal from the bloc well beyond the May 23 26 European Parliament vote Some British politicians have suggested the U K  could stay for longer without participating in the EU elections  But European Commission chief Jean Claude Juncker told reporters in Saarbruecken  Germany that  if the British haven t left by April 12 and there is an extension  then Britain must take part in the European election  He added  that is  in  the treaty  Whether I want that is another question     12 35 p m European Commission chief Jean Claude Juncker says it s time for the British Parliament to spell out what it wants on Brexit   and says the mythical sphinx is easier to decipher than U K  lawmakers After rejecting British Prime Minister Theresa May s divorce deal three times  U K  lawmakers are holding a series of votes on Brexit alternatives Monday in an attempt to find the elusive idea that can command a majority Juncker said in a speech Monday to the Saarland state legislature in Saarbruecken  Germany   We now know what the British Parliament doesn t want  but we haven t heard what it wants  A sphinx is an open book in direct

from the European Union is likely to hurt earnings in the second half of its financial year as travelers hold back on booking tickets amid the impasse over future relations EasyJet says its first half

ALGIERS   Algeria s caretaker government faces the prospect of persistent popular demands for the removal of a scletoric ruling elite and wholesale reforms after ailing 82 year old President Abdelaziz Bouteflika quit in the face of mass protests  We want a president who understands what we want   25 year old Bouzid Abdoun  an engineer at state owned energy concern Sonelgaz  told Reuters on Wednesday   We want to live here  not to migrate to Europe  Bouteflika ended 20 years in power on Tuesday after a final nudge by the military following six weeks of protests calling for democratic reforms after almost 60 years of monolithic rule by veterans of the 1954 62 independence war against France That leaves Algeria extraordinarily in the hands of a caretaker government until elections in three months and with no successor in sight However  protesters made quickly clear that they would accept no new president from  le pouvoir   the popular nickname for the entrenched establishment of elderly veterans  business tycoons and National Liberation Front  FLN  party functionaries   What is important to us is that we do not accept the  caretaker  government   Mustapha Bouchachi  a lawyer and protest leader  told Reuters just before Bouteflika stepped down   Peaceful protests will continue  Ali Benflis  a former head of the ruling FLN party  said other leading figures should also quit  naming Abdelkader Bensalah  chairman of the upper house who is standing in for Bouteflika for 90 days  interim premier Noureddine Bedoui and constitutional council head Tayeb Belai  The Algerian people have just closed one of the darkest chapters in the history of our country   he said in a statement  calling the protest a  peaceful popular revolution Protesters have brushed aside especially Bedoui  whom Bouteflika appointed on Sunday as his grip on power was fading  Bedoui is seen by many in the street as a stalwart of the ruling circles   as interior minister he oversaw elections which the opposition said were not free or fair Algeria s streets were quiet on Wednesday but the next test for the interim rulers looms on Friday  the day of the weekly mass marches since Feb  22 Bouteflika s exit is seen only as a first gesture for young Algerians demanding jobs in a country where one in every four under the age of 30 is unemployed in a highly statist  undiversified economy dependent on oil and gas exports In an emotional letter published by state media  Bouteflika bade farewell to the nation  thanking Algerians several times for having him rule the country for 20 years  Algeria will soon have a new president and I pray that God will help him to pursue the ambitions and hopes of its brave children   he wrote CORRUPTION AND CRONYISMThe outpouring of dissent is also over systemic cronyism that has seen Algeria effectively run by Bouteflika s brothers  tycoons and ex military intelligence officers since he suffered a stroke in 2013 and largely vanished from view  analysts say Protests were initially ignited by Bouteflika s plan to seek a fifth mandate in elections this month  since postponed  but the agenda broadened to calls for root and branch change The top priority for any successor would be to liberalize the economy  shifting away from an expensive but unproductive welfare state  and create jobs for young people who comprise almost 70 percent of the population The North African country has almost no foreign debt burden but its hard currency reserves have halved to  70 billion since 2014 due to a slide in volatile oil and gas prices  Definitely the top priority is to address economic issues to diversify away from oil and gas revenues   said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity  One name with an economic background respected by many protesters who has emerged as a potential successor is Ahmed Benbitour  who served as prime minister under Bouteflika before resigning over lack of progress on reforms He is a technocrat with no ties to political parties  though he is also in his 70s like many senior Algerian officials Earlier this week  in a sign of Bouteflika s imminent political demise  authorities seized the passports of a dozen politically connected businessmen under investigation for alleged corruption  One of them  Bouteflika loyalist Ali Haddad  has been taken into custody  Ennahar TV reported on Wednesday  Bouteflika s group captured the state  so the top priority for whoever replaces Bouteflika is really to re connect with the millions of protesters who marched because they no longer trust the pouvoir   said independent analyst Farid Ferrahi Western powers  some of which had demanded a peaceful solution  will be relieved at Bouteflika s departure  valuing stability in the OPEC oil producer  which is also a key gas supplier for Europe and partner in fighting Islamist militants U N  Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he  looks forward to a peaceful and democratic transition process that reflects the wishes of the Algerian people   a statement said   Additional reporting by Aziz El Yaakoubi  Hesham Hajali and Michelle Nichols  Writing by Ulf Laessing  Editing

CHICAGO   Lori Lightfoot s victory in the Chicago mayor s race signaled hope among voters that the nation s third largest city may someday move beyond long entrenched divides  racial and otherwise  that have left large parts of the metropolis feeling ignored by people in power Lightfoot became the city s first black female and first openly gay mayor when she defeated another black woman  Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle  in Tuesday s election  She joins Chicago s top prosecutor and police chief as black leaders in a city that continues to struggle with race relations But the significance of her win also transcended race or gender  Lightfoot was the outsider  a little known former federal prosecutor who grew up in Ohio and had never been elected to public office  much less climbed through the ranks of Chicago s Democratic machine  Yet she toppled some of the biggest political names and most powerful leaders in the city with a promise to end political corruption and be a voice for low income and minority people and neighborhoods  Today is April 3  a new day for all of Chicago   Lightfoot said Wednesday at a news conference called by the Rev  Jesse Jackson to promote postelection unity  Preckwinkle stood beside her Chicago has long struggled with issues of segregation  housing discrimination mostly targeting blacks and Hispanics and a generationally engrained mistrust of the city s mostly white police department The tension between police and residents exploded in protests following the 2014 fatal shooting of 17 year old Laquan McDonald by a white police office  Jason Van Dyke was sentenced earlier this year to fewer than seven years in prison for second degree murder Chicago also has seen its population drop  due largely to thousands of black residents leaving neighborhoods on the South and West sides   areas South Side resident and political consultant Delmarie Cobb describes as  gutted   At the same time  downtown and predominantly white neighborhoods on Chicago s North Side have been growing and glistening with new investment For black residents   you can t help but feel that the city and the city leaders have turned their backs on you   Cobb said  When you see hundreds of thousands of black people leaving  a city that once had a reputation as being the land of opportunity for black people   people want to know that somebody is going to speak for them   Cobb added Joyce Ross  64  supported Lightfoot and said one of the reasons she s most excited about her taking office stems from her own unsuccessful efforts to get a city job decades ago  She recalled it as a time when who she knew seemed more important than what she knew Then came the election of Harold Washington  the city s first African American mayor  who also was on the outs with the Democratic establishment  I got three calls really quick about jobs I could apply for   recalled Ross  who lives on Chicago s West Side  She did apply  and soon she was working for the city John Allison  a 64 year old dog catcher  also compared Lightfoot with Washington  and said he believes she has a better chance of bringing the city together  She had more of a unity type thing that kind of reminded me of Harold Washington  where she would let everybody in   Allison said Finley Campbell  a spokesman for the Chicago based Unitarian Universalist Multiracial Racial Unity Action Council  said part of what makes Lightfoot s win historic is also that she reached out successfully to white voters She earned broad support  receiving about three fourths of the total vote and winning all 50 Chicago wards  Her margins of victory ranged from about 8 percentage points in a largely black South Side ward to as high as 75 percentage points in predominantly white wards on the North and southwest sides  It is historic because a black  openly gay sister is out there   Campbell said   What s also historic for me is she reached out very successfully to the white ethnic community  where you have traditional Polish  German  Irish type people  There s also a connection to the firefighters and police department  and working class people   Her ability to say  I will represent you  too   accounts for it being successful  Lightfoot said she took Tuesday s results as a mandate for change  and that she plans to  take full advantage of it   But she noted there is much difficult work ahead She said her priorities upon taking office will be to get a handle on violence  rebuild the public school system  ensure Chicago is welcoming to immigrants and confront the city s deep financial problems  Honeymoons come and go  and I want to make sure we re doing all we can to really breathe life into the historic nature of this election   she said    Williams reported from Detroit  Associated Press writer Don Babwin and video producer Noreen Nasir in Chicago also contributed to this report

WASHINGTON   President Trump backed off plans to introduce a Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act after Senator Mitch McConnell privately warned him that the Senate would not revisit health care in a comprehensive way before the November 2020 elections Reversing himself in the face of Republican consternation  Mr  Trump said his party would not produce a health care plan of its own  as he had promised  until after the elections  meaning he will only try to fulfill his first term promise to repeal and replace his predecessor s signature program if he wins a second term The president s abrupt about face  announced on Twitter on Monday night after talking with Mr  McConnell  all but ensured that health care will take a central place in next year s campaign  elevating an issue Democrats consider one of their strengths  But it may take the legislative heat off Republicans exasperated by Mr  Trump s unexpected push to devise a wholesale replacement for President Barack Obama s health law in the coming months  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   Mr  McConnell  the majority leader from Kentucky  said on Tuesday   He did say  as he later tweeted  that he accepted that and that he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign  ImageListen to  The Daily   Trump Wanted to Scrap

are saying they feel the Mueller report fully vindicates the president after nearly  archived recording 2There s no way to take this letter other than a huge win for the president archived recording 3To say White House officials are happily telling the American people I told you so  well  that would frankly be a bit of an understatement archived recording  donald trump And after three years of lies and smears and slander  the Russia hoax is finally dead  The collusion delusion is over alexander burnsThat s what makes it all the more surprising that his administration decided to dive right back into one of the most politically damaging fights of his whole presidency  which is health care archived recording 1The Trump Justice Department just announced a major reversal on Obamacare archived recording 2Today  he called the Affordable Care Act horrible and is mounting a push to kill it off archived recording 3Fresh off his Mueller investigation victory  some of his biggest supporters are questioning the timing archived recording 4Here you have a huge messaging win for the president and the White House with this Mueller summary  Why now  Why do this archived recording 5Why now  maybe even why at all michael barbaroAnd how does he dive back into that politically damaging fight alexander burnsHe directs the Justice Department to take sides in a lawsuit that has been making its way through the federal courts  It was brought by Republican legal officials in a number of states  It has been ruled on by one judge in Texas that the Affordable Care Act is invalid archived recordingA federal judge in Texas has just struck down Obamacare  True story  Judge Reed O Connor says the individual mandate  the part of the law that requires you to participate  is unconstitutional  And because it cannot be separated from the rest of the law  which it cannot be  the entire law is invalid alexander burnsIt is seen as a really long shot challenge to the Affordable Care Act  something that  in all likelihood  will probably not result in the law being struck down as a whole  but the White House was going to have to decide at some point whether they were going to defend the A C A  at the highest levels of the legal system or whether they were going to take sides against a law that s on the books that Congress failed to repeal when it had the chance  And that s what they did archived recording  donald trump We think it will be upheld  and we think it will do very well in the Supreme Court  And if the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out  we will have a plan that s far better than Obamacare michael barbaroAnd my sense is that under normal circumstances  the White House almost reflexively defends laws put on the books by Congress alexander burnsIt s a pretty extraordinary step for the president to take sides  not just against a law that s already on the books  but really the biggest piece of social legislation that s been passed in recent history  And he does it at the urging of some of his most conservative advisers in the White House  including the chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  archived recording  mick mulvaney And it s hard to know where to begin when you re talking about how bad the current health care legislation is for small business alexander burns  who  before he was a member of the Trump administration  was a hardliner in the House of Representatives waging war on the Affordable Care Act from Capitol Hill archived recording  mick mulvaney It s almost as if the folks who wrote this piece of legislation last year either have no idea how small business works or they don t care how small business works  Either way  the current health care legislation is a complete disaster for small business  and  alexander burnsThe argument that Mulvaney and others make is that if the president is going to run for re election as a guy who made promises and kept his promises  especially to conservative voters who still care a lot about getting rid of Obamacare  he has got to take every chance he has to go against it michael barbaroAnd given the dynamics of Congress  this is perhaps his best chance alexander burnsMaybe his only chance  because Democrats now control the House  There is really no shot for Republicans to pass a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act  So if they re going to take it down  they re going to take it down in the courts michael barbaroO K   well  what is the response to this announcement alexander burnsWell  Democrats are totally elated archived recording  nancy pelosi This is actually an opportunity for us to speak to the American people with clarity archived recording  chuck schumer It s a stark reminder of the difference between our two parties  Democrats are fighting to expand and improve health care coverage and lower costs while Republicans are trying to take it all away and raise costs alexander burnsThey have spent  at this point  several days on the defensive about some of the claims that they made about what was likely to be in Robert Mueller s report  They are desperate to get away from their own divisive fights about the nature of liberal health care policy  You have had  in the presidential primaries  in the House of Representatives  even in the Senate where Democrats aren t in control  just endless tugs of war between moderate liberals  very liberal Democrats  far left Democrats over what kind of health care system the country ought to have in an ideal world  Should it be European style single payer health care  Should it be a system that just totally does away with private health insurance  All these kinds of divisive debates on the left that have had Democrats tripping over each other  But President Trump weighs in the way he does on the Affordable Care Act  and all of a sudden all those conflicts hit pause archived recording  nancy pelosi Oh  no  please archived recording SINGING  Happy birthday to you alexander burnsAnd the timing on the Democratic side is sort of comical in that it is literally Nancy Pelosi s 79th birthday  archived recordingHappy birthday to you alexander burns  the morning after this Justice Department announcement comes out  And when you have Democrats singing  Happy Birthday  to her  there was this sense in the caucus that she had gotten the best gift a president could have given her michael barbaroWhat is the reaction from Republicans in Congress alexander burnsWell  real dismay and surprise and sort of horror archived recordingEven Republicans appear bewildered by President Trump s promise to make the G O P  the party of health care alexander burnsAnd not just from the few remaining relatively moderate Republicans archived recordingSome Republicans are nervous about that  including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy  According to Axios  McCarthy called the president and told him the decision made no sense  saying the health care battle helped Democrats win the House and several state capitals last year alexander burnsEvery Republican analysis of the midterm elections concluded that they lost the House because of health care more than any other individual policy issue  So if you are Kevin McCarthy  the new House minority leader  you are just appalled at the idea that your members are now going to have to have this fight all over again michael barbaroRight  We had talked about this with you during the midterms   that there had been this huge public shift on Obamacare and that voters who might have previously been against it now do not want it taken away alexander burnsThat s right  It was less of a thank you to Democrats than a punishment for Republicans  that Democrats never got the political boost back in 2010  2012  2014 that they hoped they would get for passing a big new social benefit  But what they did ultimately get was the benefit of voters turning against Republicans who wanted to take those benefits away  So Obamacare as a term  as a law  still kind of a mixed bag politically  but there are elements in that law  like protections for people with pre existing medical conditions  that are enormously popular  And Republicans look back on the last campaign  the one that ended really rather badly for them  and see that as  more than anything else  the fatal political mistake they made michael barbaroSo why would President Trump  the leader of the Republican Party  who had to have watched that same midterm that you re describing  why would he do this if the takeaway of that midterm is that the Affordable Care Act is no longer toxic and might even be liked by a wide cross section of Americans alexander burnsIn the president s public statements  and as far as we can tell based on his personal thinking  he recognizes that health care is a huge political vulnerability for Republicans  that the last thing they did on health care  that big repeal drive  was politically devastating to them  And his proclamation that they need to become the party of health care clearly reflects an understanding that a problem needs to be fixed archived recording  donald trump So we re going to get rid of Obamacare  And I said it the other day  The Republican Party will become the party of great health care  It s good  It s important michael barbaroI guess I can see President Trump s argument there  It feels kind of legitimate  Wouldn t it be smart for Republicans heading into the next presidential election  2020  to recognize that there are things that voters like about the Affordable Care Act  But in order for it to be a benefit for the Republicans and not the Democrats  they need to convince voters that the Democratic plan is a bad one and that Republicans will give them a better one alexander burnsRight  But giving voters a better version of health care provided by the Republican Party has always had to mean more than just getting rid of the system that currently exists  It s this strange kind of bifurcated mental space that Republicans have been living in politically  where they want to run against Democrats for trying to blow up the health care system and replace it with single payer  and  on the other side  they want to get rid of much of the existing health care system and replace it with something to be named later michael barbaroIn other words  they don t really have a plan to replace it alexander burnsThey don t  and they kind of never have  not a consensus plan that s supported by a broad cross section of the party and voters  And that s why when the president came out with this position through the Justice Department and then suggested that Republicans in Congress ought to come up with something great  the backlash from Republicans at the highest levels of the congressional party was swift and severe  The view among congressional Republicans was that this was just sort of a total fantasy coming from the president  The idea that they would not only come up with a plan and come up with a plan that would be popular and meet the standards that the president has laid out in rally after rally  but that they would do it within a year and then run on it in 2020 just seemed like it was cut from whole cloth michael barbaroIs there also a feeling among Republicans toward the president along the lines of  dude  we just want to stop calling attention to this issue  It s a losing issue for us  Stop drawing attention to it alexander burnsOh  absolutely  And if the concern among folks like Mick Mulvaney is that walking away from the fight looks like surrender  the view from a lot of Republicans on the Hill is they ve already lost  They can talk about how they lost  or they can talk about other stuff  and the president is choosing to talk about defeat michael barbaroRight  Instead of talking about what I had imagined Republicans would be talking about for the next couple of months and maybe even the next year  which is the Democratic fight over  Medicare for all   the Democratic fight over whether private insurance should even exist   I had expected that that would be the consuming discussion in the political world and in the political campaigns to come when it came to health care alexander burnsSo did I  and I think so did a lot of Republican candidates down the ballot preparing for 2020  There was always going to be tension in the Republican message about Democratic radicalism on health care  because if you are running in 2020 on the idea that Democrats are going to blow up the current system and replace it with European style medicine  you re kind of implicitly defending the status quo system as it exists under Obamacare  It s an extraordinarily awkward position for Republicans to be in  Can you be opposed to Democratic proposals to make the health care system even more liberal  even more regulated or structured by the government  without essentially defending the system that Barack Obama put in place  We don t know how they re going to walk that line  We don t know to what extent they ll even try  But the president s current approach  which is to say that Democrats will do something drastic and bad to your health care  and I m not quite going to tell you what I m going to do yet  doesn t seem sustainable michael barbaroSo what happens in the last 24 hours or so to this Trump led project to try to strike down  repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act alexander burnsWell  after days of other Republicans expressing public discomfort with where the president was headed  archived recording  mitch mcconnell So I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate alexander burns  Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader  conveyed in no uncertain terms to the White House that this was a non starter in the Senate  that the president was free to do what he wanted to do on health care  but that Senate Republicans were not going to be taking the lead on this  It was not a fight they wanted  period  full stop archived recording  mitch mcconnell So we don t have a misunderstanding about that  We will not be doing comprehensive in the Senate alexander burnsThe president seemed to have gotten the message archived recordingPresident Trump on the retreat archived recording  donald trump No  I wanted to delay it myself  I want to put it after the election alexander burnsAnd his response was to go onto Twitter and to declare that they are totally going to do all the things that he said they were going to do  but at a much later date  after the 2020 election michael barbaroRight  He cited the date 2021  We will do all this right after the election alexander burnsRight after an election when  in his construction  he would be re elected  Republicans would hold the Senate  and they would take back control of the House  So that s not just a delay of game  That is setting a whole bunch of other conditions on what would need to happen to get there michael barbaroWere you surprised  Alex  that the president backed down on this so quickly alexander burnsI was surprised by how fast it happened  I wasn t surprised that he sort of came up with a really big theory of what should happen next and then eventually let it disintegrate  because we ve seen that pattern a number of times  But to pick a fight this big and to stick with it for so little time is the definition of politically counterproductive michael barbaroSo now  we are basically back where we started  The Affordable Care Act is likely to remain the law of the land  So what did we learn from this weeklong ordeal alexander burnsWell  the biggest thing we learned is that the politics of health care have been turned on their head in the last couple of years  and that the Affordable Care Act is no longer a liability for Democrats  and that Republicans  whether they want to acknowledge it or not  have largely abandoned the fight  music  The fact that you had the senior most members of the congressional party saying so clearly to a president they helped elect and have loyally supported  we don t want to touch health care   it would have been sort of unimaginable to someone five years ago that that would happen with a Republican president in office michael barbaroAlex  thank you very much alexander burnsThank you  music alexander burnsTomorrow s my birthday  so this is like a little birthday special michael barbaroYay  Is that on the mic lisa tobinHappy birthday tomorrow michael barbaroWe ll be right back   MUSIC   Here s what else you need to know today archived recording  theresa may Despite the best efforts of M P s  the process that the House of Commons has tried to lead has not come up with an answer  So today  I m taking action to break the logjam michael barbaroIn her latest attempt to rally support for Brexit after a series of embarrassing setbacks  British prime minister Theresa May said she would seek a new delay for leaving the European Union and would begin negotiating a Brexit plan with her political rivals in the Labour Party archived recording  theresa may I m offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan that we would both stick to to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal michael barbaroThe attempt to work across the aisle with the Labour Party suggests that May cannot win enough support within her own Conservative Party to pass her Brexit plan archived recording  theresa may The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum that both the leader of the opposition and I could put to the House for approval  and which I could then take to next week s European Council michael barbaroUnless May secures another delay  Britain is currently scheduled to leave the E U  without a negotiated plan on April 12  That s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow The president s last attempt to replace Mr  Obama s health care program blew up in 2017 when his party controlled both houses of Congress  Democrats seized the House in last year s midterm elections in part on a promise to defend the most popular parts of the Affordable Care Act  so when Mr  Trump revived the issue last week  it distressed Republicans who consider it a political liability Mr  Trump had surprised allies by ordering his administration to ask a federal court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act and then promised a Republican replacement  Democrats  consumer groups  doctors  hospitals and insurance companies have said that 20 million people could lose health coverage if courts accept the administration s argument Mr  McConnell said he spoke with Mr  Trump on Monday afternoon to explain that the Senate would not return to the issue in a broad way before the next election   I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans  view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives   Mr  McConnell said But if that warning was meant to quiet the president  it did not work  Hours later  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter   The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums  cost    deductibles than ObamaCare   In other words it will be far less expensive   much more usable than ObamaCare   he said in a string of three tweets posted Monday night   Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House  Democrats jumped at the opening  Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said at a rally in front of the Supreme Court   Translation  they have no health care plan  It s the same old song they ve been singing  They re for repeal  They have no replace  Mr  Trump appeared to be gambling that he could turn the tables on an issue that has long favored Democrats by portraying them as increasingly extreme  Even as party liberals  including some presidential candidates  embrace the idea of  Medicare for all   Republicans have used it to accuse Democrats of favoring a socialist  government run health care system that would close down all private insurers  I see what the Democrats are doing  it s a disaster what they re planning and everyone knows it   Mr  Trump told reporters on Tuesday at the White House   You re going to lose 180 million people under their private insurance  Wary of such attacks  the Democratic congressional leadership has played down a single payer system run by the government and advanced incremental measures to shore up the health care law and lower prescription drug prices Many Republicans in Congress were happy to assail Medicare for all but not enthusiastic about ditching Mr  Obama s program without a ready replacement  No plan of their own could pass the House  but it would invariably require policy choices that Democrats could attack Image The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesEven some of the president s own advisers were confounded by his move  Soon after the president decided last week to intervene in a Texas court case on the side of invalidating the entire Affordable Care Act without a Plan B  Mr  Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with Ronna McDaniel  the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee  and Brad Parscale  Mr  Trump s campaign manager Both Mr  Parscale and Ms  McDaniel tried to tell the president that they could not understand what he was doing  according to a person familiar with the call Mr  Trump replied that if they did nothing  Democrats would continue to own the issue and the other option was being known as the party that could not figure out how to properly draft a health care legislative package  the person said In several private conversations since last week  Mr  McConnell told the president that he believed Democrats owned the dysfunction associated with the Affordable Care Act and that Mr  Trump was essentially letting them off the hook by inserting himself into the debate again  according to another person briefed on those discussions Mr  Trump denied on Tuesday that Mr  McConnell asked him to back off  saying   I wanted to delay it myself  because Republicans do not control the House   So if we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency   which I hope are two good assumptions   we re going to have a phenomenal health care   he said Seeking to capitalize on the issue  the House will vote this week on a resolution urging the Justice Department to reverse its position and defend the 2010 health care law in court  forcing lawmakers to take a side on the case  The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   said Speaker Nancy Pelosi The resolution  offered by a freshman Democrat  Representative Colin Allred of Texas  says that the Justice Department should  cease any and all efforts to destroy Americans  access to affordable health care  and reverse its position  in the court case  Texas v  United States Some of the president s senior advisers pushed him to join the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the entire current health care law  a more expansive position than the administration had taken previously  when it argued that protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down But others raised concerns  including the White House counsel  Pat Cipollone  Mr  Cipollone said that Attorney General William P  Barr had issues with joining the suit  too  But once the president made clear his mind was made up  the Justice Department went along without complaint  people familiar with the events said Among those objecting was Senator Susan Collins  a moderate Republican from Maine who sent a letter to Mr  Barr expressing her  profound disagreement  with the move  Rather than seeking to have the courts invalidate the A C A    she wrote  referring to the Affordable Care Act   the proper route for the administration to pursue would be to propose changes to the A C A  or to once again seek its repeal  The administration should not attempt to use the courts to bypass Congress  Mr  McConnell sought to calm Republican nerves  saying  there s no point in pushing the panic button  because the court system would take a long time to resolve the dispute  I don t think any of these policies are in any immediate danger   he said Mr  Trump has basically commissioned four Republican senators to devise a replacement for the Affordable Care Act  The group consists of two doctors  John Barrasso of Wyoming and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana  as well as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  a close ally of the president  and Senator Rick Scott of Florida  who was the chief executive of a large for profit hospital firm before he entered politics Mr  Scott said on Tuesday that he was focused on bringing down health costs  especially prescription drug prices   Obamacare has made health care way more expensive   he said   Co payments are up  Deductibles are up  Premiums have skyrocketed  When asked about developing a wholesale replacement for the Affordable Care Act  Mr  Scott responded   I m a business guy   adding   I didn t try to do grand bargains   

AUSTIN  Texas   Democratic presidential candidate Beto O Rourke is pledging to sign an executive order requiring Cabinet members to hold monthly town hall meetings  with the American people  The ex Texas congressman proposed the idea while speaking Monday at the  We the People Summit  in Washington  In a statement moments later  his campaign said doing so would  commit to historic levels of transparency  accountability and engagement from the administration  O Rourke has endorsed many sweeping policy initiatives  including overhauling election laws  drastically reducing college debt and legalizing marijuana nationwide  But in the opening weeks of his campaign  O Rourke has provided few specifics on how he d achieve much of that His website features information on some upcoming campaign events  instructions to watch O Rourke livestream videos and a store selling campaign gear   but little policy information

it actually matters a lot of the time  CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesJaden Rams used to be on fire for Donald Trump  Shortly before the 2016 presidential election  when he was 13  he put on

voters turn out at much higher rates  And young Americans who connect to Mr  Trump could retain lasting ties to his party  It s also possible that this generation will be exposed to very different

statistics and political science at Columbia  and Yair Ghitza  the chief scientist at Catalist  have found that impressions about events from ages 14 to 24 are about three times as powerful in shaping

JERUSALEM   The Israeli army on Wednesday said it had recovered the body of a soldier who went missing in a bloody 1982 battle with Syrian forces in southern Lebanon  closing a famous case that has plagued Israel for nearly four decades Lt  Col  Jonathan Conricus  an Israeli military spokesman  told reporters that the remains of Zachary Baumel had been returned to Israel and identified after years of  significant intelligence operations  Conricus declined to elaborate on how the return was arranged or where the remains were found  saying only that  an opportunity arose to locate the body  through an unnamed country Baumel  a U S  citizen from New York  went missing in action along with five other Israeli soldiers near the Lebanese village of Sultan Yacoub Several years later  two of the missing soldiers were returned alive to Israel in prisoner exchanges with Syria  but the fate of the other three had remained unknown In a nationally televised speech  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Baumel s remains  along with his clothing and tzitzit  the knotted ritual fringes worn by observant Jews  had been returned to his family in Jerusalem Netanyahu said that Baumel was  full of Zionist zeal  that led him to Israel and to the battle where he disappeared  He recalled the pain of his late father  who  traveled the world to track down any peace of information about his missing son  Osnat Haberman  Baumel s sister  told Netanyahu   I told my mother years ago that it was not enough to want and to search  There needs to be someone with the winning card and now you have brought it  Cases of missing soldiers have a powerful emotional and political resonance in Israel  where military service is compulsory for most Jewish men  In his remarks  Netanyahu lauded the repatriation of Baumel s remains as an  expression of mutual responsibility and feeling of unity  that epitomizes Israel  He described the homecoming as a  moral obligation  to fallen soldiers and their families Anwar Raja  a Syria based official with the Palestinian militant group PFLP GC  said that insurgents excavated graves in the capital of Damascus last year in search of the remains of the three missing Israeli soldiers  He said that their remains had been transferred to Syria after the 1982 battle Lebanese politician Walid Joumblatt  a harsh critic of the Syrian government  hinted in a tweet Wednesday that Syrian authorities were responsible for the return of the Israeli soldier  Handing over the remains of the Israeli soldier through unknown mediators is a free and valuable gift to Netanyahu in his elections   Joumblatt tweeted Israel holds its general election next week  largely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu s rule Joumblatt poked fun at the Syrian government  adding sarcastically   Greetings to the Syrian regime that is spearheading Arab  regional and international rejectionism  The disastrous battle  which occurred soon after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  resulted in the deaths of 20 Israeli soldiers The military confirmed it was still working to secure the return of the other two missing soldiers    Associated Press writers Sarah El Deeb and Bassem Mroue in Beirut  Lebanon contributed to this report

The invitation was sent to a select group of well heeled potential donors  who were asked to attend a Friday morning fund raiser at a construction company in Boston  Donations of up to  5 000 were expected  The guest of honor would be the mayor   of New York City For Mayor Bill de Blasio  the quick fund raising stop in Boston was the latest in a series of out of town trips aimed at raising cash and boosting his national profile as he toys with a 2020 presidential run For the company hosting him  Suffolk Construction  the fund raiser offered a chance to help Mr  de Blasio at a time when the business is aggressively trying to extend its footprint in the city The company has already one connection to the mayor  Late last year  it hired Shola Olatoye  the former chairwoman of the New York City Housing Authority  who resigned amid scandal last year  but had been roundly praised by Mr  de Blasio throughout her tenure  Ms  Olatoye s responsibilities for Suffolk include generating new business in and around New York Mr  de Blasio has previously faced questions over his fund raising tactics that have appeared to target those with actual or potential business with the city government  State and federal prosecutors investigated his practices but declined to bring charges The mayor is now seeking large donations for his political action committee  Fairness PAC  which has paid for some of Mr  de Blasio s recent cross country travel  Shortly after his fund raiser in Boston  Mr  de Blasio was to travel on Friday to Nevada to meet with local Democrats  We have a political system that requires us to seek individual donations   Mr  de Blasio said at an unrelated news conference in City Hall on Thursday  adding that he hoped the system would be changed   What s important is to follow every law  every rule  and to have a very consistent vetting process  That s what we do  The specifics of Friday s fund raiser  which is scheduled to begin at 8 30 a m  and will last about 90 minutes  were kept solidly under wraps  A spokesman for Fairness PAC declined to provide the name of the host ImageJohn F  Fish  chief executive of Suffolk Construction  is hosting a fund raiser for Mr  de Blasio in Boston at a time when his company is seeking to expand its business in New York CreditCharles Krupa Associated Press Not going into details of private fund raisers   said the spokesman  Michael Casca  a City Hall aide who is using his vacation time to work for the committee   The mayor is continuing his hard work to elect progressive candidates and make bold change all over the country  But one invitee described the contents of the invitation  The outcome of federal and state elections has a huge impact on what the mayor can accomplish in New York City   the invitation read  according to the person   And this PAC is an opportunity to harness the amazing energy in the Democratic Party and help change the direction of our politics on both a local and national level  The invitation came from John F  Fish  the Suffolk chief executive and a prominent Boston figure who helped spearhead the city s failed attempt to lure the 2024 Olympics  In addition to hosting the event  Mr  Fish in December donated  5 000   the maximum contribution amount   to Mr  de Blasio s political action committee  records show  Suffolk is proud to be making strides in the New York region by introducing clients to more sophisticated planning and construction technologies and delivery methods   said a company spokesman  Sam Spokony  The company did not respond to questions about the fund raiser This wasn t Mr  Fish and his company s first foray into national politics In 2017  the Federal Election Commission fined Suffolk  34 000 for donating  200 000 to a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton  Priorities USA  while it was working as a federal contractor in West Point  N Y  The fine was among the larger penalties meted out in connection with the 2016 presidential election  according to the commission   Priorities USA returned the contributions in mid 2016  In the last two years  Mr  Fish has contributed  2 2 million to political campaigns  mostly to elect Democrats to federal office  according to federal filings At the same time  Suffolk has been seeking to increase its presence in New York Among its projects  the company recently completed construction of an apartment tower in Brooklyn Bridge Park  a development that included city subsidized affordable housing  And the company s website featured a panoramic aerial shot of the Brooklyn waterfront and Lower Manhattan on its main page as of Thursday  We ve been focusing on really relationship building   Charlie Avolio  the head of the company s New York office  said in a 2017 interview   We don t chase work  we chase relationships  And if we can create productive relationships  at some point  they ll be fruitful  The hiring of Ms  Olatoye   who faced withering criticism during her tenure at the city s troubled housing authority  in large part because of a high profile lead paint scandal   appeared to be part of those efforts  At every step of my career  I ve been passionate about building relationships   she said in a statement in October when her new job at Suffolk was announced   I will help the company expand its footprint in the region and lead its growing business development team   

JAKARTA    Mama  just killed a man   sings Indonesian President Joko Widodo during a recent ride in a local YouTube celebrity s car while Queen s Bohemian Rhapsody plays in the background  The video  which also shows Widodo dressed in a red zip up jacket and jeans chatting about family life and the pressures of running the world s third largest democracy  was the brainchild of a backroom team that has become a vital part of his campaign for re election on April 17  The team  comprised mainly of people in their 20s  has a sleek  high rise office in central Jakarta  On a recent visit  Reuters saw the team s data of social media activity on the Indonesian presidential election displayed on LED screens covering one wall of a conference room Widodo s aides say the team uses the data to determine the pop culture references that the president will make in his next speech   he s done  Games of Thrones  and the  Avengers  already   or the sneakers he might wear to an event to appeal to young voters  Widodo s sons also sometimes advise him on outfits or speeches  according to one senior campaign aide Millennials   those aged 17 35   account for over one third of Indonesia s 193 million voters and both Widodo and his challenger  former general Prabowo Subianto  have ramped up efforts to appeal to them  Just because of the sheer size of that voter base  the millennials will play an important role in deciding the direction of the election   said Djayadi Hanan of pollster Saiful Mujani Research   Consulting  Most opinion polls show Widodo  57  holding a double digit lead over his opponent  A recent survey by pollster Roy Morgan showed around 60 percent of young voters favoring Widodo  but both campaigns say that wooing the country s largely apolitical youth is a challenge  A former furniture maker who grew up in a riverside slum and is the first national leader to come from outside the political and military elite  Widodo s everyman image resonated in 2014 with voters tired of the old guard  But since taking office  aides say  young supporters  no longer recognized  the president and he was advised to project a more relaxed image  Because he has had to become more stately  that  village boy  narrative was missing this time   said the senior campaign aide  who declined to be identified That s where the backroom team came in  We re able to see in real time what does well or what people react negatively to     We were very blunt in conveying that to the president   the aide said  adding that Widodo gets a summary of the social media data almost daily JEANS AND SNEAKERSWhere his rival often wears fitted suits and oxford shoes  Widodo sports a white shirt with rolled up sleeves  jeans  and brightly colored sneakers  In March  the president posted an animated comic strip on social media that showed him meeting his younger self and discussing the achievements of his government Taking a page from Indian Prime Minister s Narendra Modi s playbook  Widodo has started using a holographic projection of himself to address voters at campaign rallies  Analysts say Prabowo is less popular among young voters  in part because of a strongman image stemming from his time as special forces chief under authoritarian ruler Suharto  Aides have suggested softening the image of the 67 year old  so he now wears a khaki shirt and aviator sunglasses at campaign rallies   It was rare to see his lighter side and sense of humor  We have tried to expose that side of him   said campaign spokesman Dahnil Anzar Prabowo s team has also posted a photograph of him with his cat  which was popular online  The cat now has its own Instagram account Prabowo s running mate  businessman and amateur marathon runner Sandiaga Uno  was chosen in part for his massive appeal both online and offline with young and female voters  As the keynote speaker at a recent event for young entrepreneurs  Uno  49  joined a group of breakdancers on stage before kicking footballs into a crowd of university students Uno s popularity and extensive campaigning across the country has helped boost Prabowo s electability  aides say DESPERATE PROMISESNevertheless  many young voters want policy pledges to address job creation and youth unemployment  not campaign gimmicks  Unemployment  at about 5 percent  is one of the highest in Southeast Asia  and many of those without jobs are graduates of vocational schools In what was widely seen as an attempt to win votes  Widodo last month promised cash benefits to graduates from poor families and the unemployed  but did not offer details  Critics questioned the feasibility of such a plan  citing an already strained national budget Prabowo and his running mate have promised  entrepreneurial training  for graduates  Our biggest concern is how to get a job after we graduate and who is the leader who can give us that   said Haliza Aulia Madina  a 19 year old student studying Arabic in the city of Bandung  who supports Prabowo   Additional reporting by Jessica Damiana  Editing by John Chalmers and Raju Gopalakrishnan  

LONDON   Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Theresa May had not moved far enough in a first round of crisis talks aimed at breaking the domestic deadlock over Britain s exit from the European Union The United Kingdom was supposed to leave the EU last Friday but  nearly three years after it voted by 52 percent to 48 for Brexit in a referendum  it is still unclear how  when or even whether it will quit the bloc it joined in 1973 After her EU withdrawal deal was rejected three times by lawmakers  the Conservative prime minister invited Corbyn  a veteran socialist  to talks in parliament to try to plot a way out of the crisis  There hasn t been as much change as I expected   Corbyn  69  said   The meeting was useful but inconclusive  Asked if May had accepted his preference for a post Brexit customs union with the EU  he said   We did have a discussion about all of that  Corbyn is under pressure from some in his party not to agree a Brexit deal without ensuring that it can be confirmed or rejected in a new referendum that also offers the option to stay in the EU  He himself has said such a vote should be restricted to specific circumstances   I said   Look  this is a policy of our party that we would want to pursue the option of a public vote to prevent crashing out or prevent leaving on a bad deal    he said   There was no agreement reached on that  Talks will continue on Thursday   CONSTRUCTIVE MEETING A Downing Street spokesman said the meeting  which lasted an hour and 40 minutes  had been  constructive  with both sides showing flexibility and a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close   We have agreed a program of work to ensure we deliver for the British people  protecting jobs and security   he added May s overture to Corbyn  whose party has 245 out of 650 lawmakers  offers a possible way for her to secure a majority for an exit deal as she seeks a second short delay to Brexit But some in the Labour Party have cast her gambit as a trap aimed at scaring her own lawmakers into backing the thrice defeated deal  or as a way to extend responsibility for the difficulties of Brexit to the Labour Party  May said on Tuesday she would seek a delay that is  as short as possible  to the current Brexit date of April 12  having repeatedly said she did not want Britain to have to take part in European Parliament elections on May 23 But European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said in Brussels that Britain would not get any further short delays unless its parliament ratified a deal by April 12   the date set by EU leaders as the effective cut off for avoiding the European Parliament elections To secure a longer extension  the leaders have told May that she must present a credible way forward  and also sign up to those elections  something she is adamantly opposed to But Britain could ask the EU for a long Brexit delay that gives the option to leave as soon as a divorce deal is approved by parliament  finance minister Philip Hammond indicated If the talks with Labour fail  May will put different Brexit options for the future relationship to a vote in parliament  in the hope of finding a plan viable enough to present in Brussels  CONSERVATIVE ANGERMay s last ditch approach to Corbyn  who is loathed by many of her Conservatives and mocked by May herself as unfit to govern  provoked anger in her febrile party  Two junior ministers quit on Wednesday   one of them from the Brexit department   It now seems that you and your cabinet have decided that a deal   cooked up with a Marxist who has never once in his political life put British interests first   is better than  no  deal    Nigel Adams said as he resigned as a minister for Wales May turned to Labour after a hard core of Brexit supporters among her own Conservatives repeatedly rejected her divorce deal  saying it would leave Britain a  vassal state  Using a nickname that plays on May s reputed robotic inflexibility  one Brexit supporting Conservative lawmaker told Reuters   The Maybot has gone haywire   we ve got to find the  off  switch   Corbyn  who voted against EU membership in a 1975 referendum  told May he wanted a customs union with the EU  access to its single market  and a guarantee of continued observance of European regulations   as a minimum on the environment  and consumer and workers  rights Many supporters want the party to throw its weight behind a second referendum  But some Labour lawmakers who represent areas that voted strongly to leave the EU not only reject this but also fear that such a  soft  Brexit would be seen as a betrayal Brexit minister Stephen Barclay said the government would accept a soft Brexit if parliament voted for it  Britain could one day review its membership of a possible post Brexit customs union with the European Union  Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told the BBC   If we decided  in some considerable years time that we wanted to review our membership of any such customs union if we signed it   and I m not saying we will   that s a matter for negotiation and discussion   Cox said   Additional reporting

WASHINGTON   U S  congressional Democrats on Wednesday authorized a powerful committee chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 election  moving closer to a legal clash with President Donald Trump s administration The Democratic led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to enable its chairman  Jerrold Nadler  to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller s unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides including political strategist Steve Bannon Nadler has not yet exercised that authority  with the timing of any such move uncertain  The committee vote was 24 17 along party lines  with Democrats in favor and Trump s fellow Republicans opposed Attorney General William Barr  a Trump appointee  issued a four page summary of Mueller s main conclusions last month including that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400 page report by mid April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence gathering sources and methods In addition to Bannon  the committee authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn  former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson They are among 81 people  agencies and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates Nadler s panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would ignore a Democratic demand turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline  Democrats have expressed concern Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign Nadler said he would work with Barr  for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials  and will go to court to get permission to obtain the grand jury material  But if that doesn t work out in a very short order  we will issue the subpoenas   Nadler added       The committee must see everything   The potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government s third branch   the judiciary Representative Doug Collins  the committee s top Republican  said Democrats are  desperate for dirt on this president   This is reckless  It s irresponsible  And it s disingenuous   Collins said   It s also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing  making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy  It was not clear how likely the Justice Department would be to hand over subpoenaed documents  It could ignore a subpoena  running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress  and prepare for a potentially lengthy court battle INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACTIONIn another development  the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic led House Intelligence Committee  led by Trump critic Adam Schiff  is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump s inaugural committee Citing people familiar with the request  the Journal reported that the effort signaled that Congress is expanding its probe of how the inaugural committee raised and spent more than  100 million  The report could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters Barr s March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice  Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller s inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump  Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice  Moscow denied election interference  Mueller and U S  intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U S  Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report  If the department still refuses  then it should be up to a judge   not the president or his political appointee   to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record   Nadler said  Trump ally Lindsey Graham  Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  wrote on Twitter that the House panel s demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was  dangerous and ridiculous  The Justice Department declined comment  Priebus declined to comment  A lawyer for Priebus  Bannon and McGahn  as well as a Bannon spokeswoman  did not immediately respond to requests for comment Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries  Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge s permission to get access to Mueller s grand jury material  which is protected under federal law  Nadler said Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far  Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well  noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report s release to Congress   Reporting by David Morgan  Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld  Sarah N  Lynch  Steve Holland and Mark Hosenball  Editing by

RALEIGH  N C    In a series of clandestine meetings in closed restaurants and small airport terminals  the pressured insurance magnate and his associates offered North Carolina s insurance commissioner money for special treatment  federal prosecutors say Greg Lindberg  in 2017 suddenly a major political donor  wanted the regulator investigating his company replaced or one of his insurance executives made her boss  federal prosecutors described in newly unsealed indictments  State Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey would receive up to  2 million funneled anonymously into his 2020 re election campaign if he went along  prosecutors said Or the deputy insurance commissioner could stay in her post  Lindberg consultant John D  Gray told Causey in a phone call  as long as  she doesn t breathe a word outside that office  or send a slip of paper outside that office  that is not first reviewed by John  Palermo  the Lindberg insurance executive earlier proposed as her replacement But Causey reported the scheme to corrupt his agency by giving favored treatment to Lindberg s company  Global Bankers Insurance Group  which was headed toward a periodic financial examination  prosecutors said  And the review discovered problems  which the company agreed in May to correct  prosecutors said For their efforts to turn Causey to Lindberg s cause  he  Gray  Palermo and the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party  Robin Hayes  were charged with conspiracy and bribery  Hayes agreed to use the state GOP as a conduit to funnel  250 000 to Causey  prosecutors said  and amplified Lindberg s message urging that the unnamed deputy commissioner be sidetracked  They were hoping that you would  and I don t even know the lady that was apparently really  really good  in financial analysis  that they would like to see put back into that department to make sure that things got done that needed to get done   Hayes told Causey in a May telephone call  according to prosecutors Hayes also was charged with lying to FBI agents investigating the case The 73 year old former congressman from Concord announced Monday that he wouldn t seek re election as party chairman  citing health problems  His attorney said Tuesday that Hayes  steadfastly denies the allegations made against him  In October  as the federal investigation was building steam  Causey turned over  250 000 in campaign donations from the state GOP to U S  Marshals  Lindberg also had donated  5 000 directly to Causey s campaign  but the commissioner returned the money  Everything I did was in cooperation and with direction of the federal investigators   Causey told The Associated Press in a phone interview Tuesday Lindberg   largely unknown in political circles until his contributions started flowing heavily in 2017   has given more than  5 million to North Carolina candidates  party committees and independent expenditure groups  Recipients also include the state Democratic Party and outside groups that supported then Insurance Commissioner Wayne Goodwin  who s now chairman of the state Democratic Party  and Republican Lt  Gov  Dan Forest  who is running for governor in 2020 Federal prosecutors alleged that between April 2017 and last August  Lindberg  Gray  and Palermo met with Causey repeatedly to discuss favors and money  prosecutors said  Palermo was an executive for Lindberg s Eli Global LLC and until last fall was chairman of a county Republican Party Palermo created an independent expenditure committee able to spend unlimited amounts on political campaign with limited public disclosure that was funded with  1 5 million of Lindberg s money  prosecutors said  In all  Lindberg and his associates promised Causey  2 million in donations The case also threatens to embroil an unidentified official who prosecutors described as speaking to Causey several times on Lindberg s behalf  Lindberg made a  150 000 contribution to a political committee backing  Public Official A  on the same February 2018 date he learned the politician was willing to help sway Causey  prosecutors said Federal Election Commission records show Lindberg made a contribution in that amount to Republican U S  Rep  Mark Walker s  Mark Walker Victory Committee  around the same time  It s the only  150 000 contribution by Lindberg listed in 2018 on the FEC website Walker s spokesman  Jack Minor  said he couldn t confirm if Walker was  Public Official A   adding that the February 2018 contribution eventually went to the Republican National Committee and wasn t used for Walker s campaign  Walker is not and never has been a target of this investigation  and has committed no wrongdoing   Minor said in a statement  adding that Walker helped federal investigators The four defendants appeared Tuesday before a federal magistrate Palermo  63  of Pittsboro  didn t return calls seeking comment  A published number for Gray  68  of Chapel Hill  was disconnected  Greg Lindberg is innocent of the charges in the indictment and we look forward to demonstrating this when we get our day in court   his attorney  Anne Tompkins  said in a statement The state GOP cooperated with the investigation  including turning over requested documents  attorney Josh Howard said in a statement A spokesman for Global Bankers and Eli Global noted the companies were not charged  Global Bankers

RALEIGH  N C    The chairman of North Carolina s Republican Party  an insurance magnate and two of his associates are facing federal charges for a plan to shower the state s top insurance regulator with campaign contributions to ensure special business treatment  a criminal indictment unsealed Tuesday said State GOP Chairman Robin Hayes and insurance and investment firm founder Greg Lindberg were among those charged with bribery  conspiracy and other crimes The four defendants appeared Tuesday before a federal magistrate Hayes also was charged with lying to the FBI  The 73 year old former congressman announced Monday that he wouldn t seek re election as party chairman  citing health problems Hayes  steadfastly denies the allegations made against him  and is eager to clear his name  his attorney  Kearns Davis  said in a statement Lindberg   largely unknown politically until his contributions started flowing heavily in 2017   has given more than  5 million to North Carolina candidates  party committees and independent expenditure groups Federal prosecutors allege that between April 2017 and August  Lindberg sought to shower Republican state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey with contributions through the state GOP and an independent committee in exchange for actions helping Lindberg s businesses  Lindberg sought  among other things  the removal of a Causey deputy responsible for examining Lindberg s Durham based Global Bankers Insurance Group The unidentified deputy commissioner was  deliberately and intentionally and maliciously hurting my reputation with other regulators   the indictment quoted Lindberg as saying to Causey Lindberg  political consultant John Gray  and John Palermo   a former county Republican chairman who was working for Lindberg s investment company Eli Global LLC   met with Causey at least five times in the winter and spring of 2018 to discuss favors and money  prosecutors said Lindberg s team urged Causey to hire Palermo to replace the deputy commissioner or become her boss  prosecutors said  Causey eventually refused  fearing Palermo s ties to Lindberg s company would be discovered by journalists  the indictment said  Lindberg then proposed  we recruit someone brand new to the Department with the same skill set   the indictment said Palermo then created an independent expenditure committee with limited public disclosure and the ability to spend unlimited amounts on political campaigns that was funded with  1 5 million of Lindberg s money  prosecutors said  In all  Lindberg and his associates promised Causey  2 million in donations Lindberg asked Hayes to direct  250 000 to Causey s re election campaign  Hayes initially protested  saying transferring so much money would attract attention  but he went along  prosecutors said  Whatever you all want to do  we ll do   Hayes said  according to the indictment   Alright  I ll get  er done  In October  as the investigation was building steam  Causey turned over  250 000 in donations from the state GOP to U S  Marshals  The commissioner also returned  5 000 that Lindberg had donated directly to Causey s campaign Causey   first elected to a four year term in 2016   was not charged in the indictment  Prosecutors said in a news release that he voluntarily reported the scheme  Everything I did was in cooperation and with direction of the federal investigators   Causey said in a phone interview Causey said he was sorry to hear about the indictments   but everybody makes their own decisions  The case also threatens to embroil an unidentified official who prosecutors described as speaking to Causey several times on Lindberg s behalf  Lindberg made a  150 000 contribution to a political committee backing  Public Official A  on the same

NEW DELHI ISLAMABAD   Facebook has deleted 712 accounts and 390 pages in India and Pakistan for  inauthentic behavior   it said on Monday  many linked to India s opposition Congress party days before a national election  and others related to Pakistan s military Facebook has come under increasing pressure around the world to ensure its social media platform is not abused for political purposes or to spread misinformation The action against accounts with alleged links to Congress  the party led by the Gandhi family that has dominated Indian politics for much of its post independence era  marks a bold move by Facebook The platform has more than 300 million users in India  where it has been a key political campaigning tool in the election   the largest democratic exercise in the world   starting on April 11 While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his rivals use official Facebook accounts to send political messages to millions of followers  thousands of unverified pages also share posts to support or criticize politicians Among the most significant things it has removed  Facebook said it had taken down 549 accounts and 138 pages linked to India s Congress for  coordinated inauthentic behavior   In a Tweet  Congress said none of its official pages or those run by its verified volunteers had been taken down  The party is awaiting a response from Facebook to provide a list of all pages and accounts which were removed  it said Also removed were 15 accounts linked to an Indian IT company which  among other things  issued posts on Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  and alleged misconduct of political opponents including Congress  Facebook said The Digital Forensic Research Lab at think tank Atlantic Council  which partnered with Facebook for the review  said the accounts linked to Congress pushed satirical posts  while pro BJP pages  carried vitriolic posts against opposition leaders   The fact that partisans on both sides resorted to such tactics is a troubling feature   it said in a blog post In the face of increasing calls for tougher regulation of online content  Facebook has been taking similar measures elsewhere  In Pakistan  it removed 57 accounts  24 pages  seven groups and 15 Instagram accounts  also for inauthentic behavior  as part of a network that originated there and was linked to employees of a unit of the Pakistani military Nuclear armed neighbors India and Pakistan both sent warplanes to attack each other s territory in February after a suicide bomb attack claimed by a Pakistan based militant group killed 40 Indian paramilitary police in the disputed region of Kashmir  The attack also led to a deluge of fake news  another issue social media companies have been grappling with CRITICISM OF POLITICIANSFacebook s head of cybersecurity policy  Nathaniel Gleicher  said the firm had removed accounts based on their behavior  not their content The company s review found individuals using fake accounts and issuing posts including criticism of the BJP who were  associated with an INC  Indian National Congress  IT Cell  Two of the samples shared by Facebook were of posts that criticized Modi s initiatives and called for supporting the Congress party and its president  Rahul Gandhi Separately  Facebook removed 12 accounts and one page  plus one group and one Instagram account  which linked to individuals related to an Indian IT firm Silver Touch  Asked what Silver Touch s link with politics was  Gleicher told Reuters earlier it was  associated with  a mobile app promoted by Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  After BJP s IT head  Amit Malviya  told Reuters both the party and the app had  nothing to do with Silver Touch   Facebook in a new statement late on Monday said it had  seen no evidence to date of Silver Touch being associated with the NaMo App on our platform   referring to the Narendra Modi app   We won t be speculating about off platform connections of the actors we took down today   a spokeswoman said Facebook s actions on Monday also included the removal of a  pro BJP  page called  The India Eye   which had more than 2 million followers   was strongly nationalist   a vocal supporter of Modi and a critic of Gandhi  Atlantic Council said Facebook said it had also removed another 227 pages and 94 accounts in India for violating its policies on spam and misrepresentation In Pakistan  Facebook said it removed pages and accounts on Facebook and Instagram that spread information about Pakistani politics  the Indian government and the Pakistani military  Those accounts were being run by employees of the Pakistani military s public relations arm  the Inter Services Public Relations  ISPR   Facebook said No comment was immediately available from ISPR These Pakistani accounts  pages  groups and Instagram accounts removed from Facebook had more than 2 8 million followers  Last week the firm removed a social media network in the Philippines and took the unusual step of linking it to a businessman who said he had managed the president s online election campaign in 2016  It has also taken such action recently against accounts in Russia and Iran

WASHINGTON   The Republican led U S  Senate on Wednesday changed its procedures to speed up the confirmation of President Donald Trump s nominees for some lower court judgeships and sub Cabinet level positions The move to shorten debate on such nominees from 30 hours to two hours was resisted by Democrats but they could not block it because Republicans hold 53 seats in the 100 seat chamber Senator Mitch McConnell used his powers as majority leader to make the change  which will set a precedent that will apply to district court judges  the lowest rung of the judiciary  but not vacancies in the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts  The Senate has historically provided greater protection for whichever party is in the minority than the 435 seat House of Representatives by allowing longer debating time before votes and requiring 60 yes votes for most approvals  Those conventions have been whittled away by both Democrats and Republicans in recent years as the mood in Washington has become more and more polarized  however  with each party accusing the other of misusing the rules Reducing the time for debate will  begin to unwind this partisan paralysis  for the good of the Senate   McConnell said on Wednesday  Democrats slammed the procedural change  At a time when leader McConnell brags about confirming more judges than anyone has done in a very long time  he feels the need to invoke the terribly destructive and disproportionate procedure   Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Fifty three district court nominees have been confirmed during Trump s first two years in office against 44 confirmed at the same point in the presidency of Democratic President Barack Obama During Obama s presidency  Senate Democrats took steps to more easily win approval of his nominations by requiring only a simple majority vote for administration posts and judges other than Supreme Court nominees  They also limited debate to two hours  but that move expired at the end of that Congress after Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 elections  In 2017  McConnell expanded the simple majority procedure to include Supreme Court confirmations in order to overcome Democratic opposition to Trump s first nominee  Neil Gorsuch The fight over the confirmation of federal judges has been raging for years  as divisive issues before the courts include hot button issues like abortion  the death penalty and money in politics  Republicans are hoping that they can confirm as many of Trump s conservative picks as possible while they control the Senate and White House Democrats were enraged in 2016 when McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland  Obama s pick to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court At the time  McConnell said that choice should be made by whoever won the November 2016 presidential election Since he became president in January 2017  Trump has won confirmation of 37 appeals court judges  compared to 55 appeals court judge confirmations during Obama s entire eight years  Such confirmation votes would not be subject to Wednesday s procedural change  Click here to see a graphic showing Trump s appeals court appointments  https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL    Reporting By Amanda Becker and Richard Cowan  additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Lawrence Hurley  Editing by Sonya Hepinstall  

In the post Watergate era  most Americans have taken for granted that a president would not fire an F B I  director investigating him  or replace an attorney general for insufficient loyalty to the president s personal interests  Dangling a pardon before potential witnesses to influence their testimony  Unheard of Whatever one s feelings about the end of the Mueller investigation  the Barr letter makes one thing clear  The guardrails that were established after Watergate against these types of abuses have been smashed  We still need to see the full Mueller report  but unless corrective steps are taken  Mr  Trump and Mr  Barr will have changed  perhaps profoundly  the shape of presidential power  and in troubling ways It s therefore up to Congress and the 2020 presidential candidates to step in and harden the policies that for 40 years prevented improper political interference in law enforcement They can do this by enacting comprehensive legislation to codify rules and practices that were previously voluntary  Those who subscribe to the Barr memo view of expansive executive power might claim that such legislation would violate the Constitution  On the contrary  such legislation would help enforce it First  Congress should restrict when and how the White House intervenes in law enforcement actions  giving teeth to the norms of the post Watergate era  One model for such legislation is a reform born out of President Richard Nixon s abuse of the I R S  to target enemies  Congress made it unlawful for certain officials  including the president  to  request  directly or indirectly   any I R S  officer or employee to  in effect  weaponize a taxpayer audit  Congress could apply that approach by prohibiting a president from intervening in individual law enforcement proceedings   or at a minimum require notification when a president or members of the White House staff do so  Such a rule would have imposed an additional bar  for example  on the president trying to get the Department of Justice to block the AT T Time Warner merger in retaliation for CNN s coverage  or from trying to investigate or prosecute political opponents Second  Congress should ensure that if the president issues or even dangles pardons in an attempt to block an investigation into his own interests  legislators will receive documents regarding the underlying investigation  once it s concluded   This will both ensure accountability and deter bad faith behavior  Representative Adam Schiff s Pardon Abuse Prevention Act provides a good start  it could be supplemented to apply to so called dangled pardons and to force disclosure of discussions with pardon seekers in investigations implicating the president Third  Congress can make it harder for the government to mislead the public  A little known law called the Information Quality Act creates a requirement that federal agencies ensure the quality  objectivity  utility and integrity of information they provide to the American people  Strengthening the act so that it applies to the president would help expose disinformation and make it more difficult for presidents to take executive actions based on false  determinations  and  findings   Finally  Congress should prohibit the president from using federal law enforcement powers to interfere in an electoral campaign  Procedures designed to check some such activity exist in the United States Attorneys Manual  but that merely compiles prudential guidelines  Congress should harden these rules and expand them to cover other law enforcement agencies  such as the Department of Homeland Security   It could require a Civil Service process to approve sensitive actions around campaign season  An even stronger measure could require early stage confidential judicial approval before a law enforcement action that might impact the outcome of an election could be taken  Such reforms would make it harder for a president to abuse power   such as by timing investigations or announcements to affect a political campaign  using the security clearance process to silence critics  sending immigration authorities to polling places or intervening in Secret Service activities to protect candidates and events Campaign season shouldn t bring government to a halt  and law enforcement shouldn t ignore actual wrongdoing in an electoral context  But given the abuses we ve seen in the past two years and others that might easily take place in the future  we ignore additional protections at our peril Some of these ideas already have bipartisan support  Clear statements by Congress implementing constitutional principles would also provide standards by which courts and the American people could judge the president s conduct The Constitution commands that the president  take care that the laws be faithfully executed   At its core  this commands the president to act in good faith  The founders thought this directive was so important they put it in the Constitution not once but twice  in the  take care  clause and the president s oath As the founders understood  the only reason We the People would delegate sovereignty to elected officials is if we were assured they would exercise that power in the public interest  If our legal system were to approve of the president exercising that power instead to protect his own interests  as the Barr letter does  we may find that our democratic experiment won t extend much longer Ian Bassin   ianbassin  and Justin Florence   justingflorence  are co founders of the

PARIS   Italy s Deputy Prime Minister  Matteo Salvini  on Thursday praised the collaboration with France s interior minister over immigration issues  in a sharp change of tone after months of acrimonious exchanges between Italy and France Ties between the two traditional allies had grown increasingly tense since Salvini s decision to close Italian ports to migrant ships last year  culminating with France briefly recalling its ambassador to Rome in February  On these topics  I found myself absolutely in sync with Minister  Christophe  Castaner   Salvini told reporters on the sidelines of a G7 meeting of interior ministers in Paris  citing illegal immigration and counter terrorism in particular  However  Salvini   leader of the far right League party  and who is also in charge of Italy s interior ministry   said nationalist leader Marine Le Pen remained his main ally in France and that he would meet her in Paris on Friday Asked about his relationship with President Emmanuel Macron  who has vowed to fight nationalists in upcoming European parliament elections  Salvini said   I have never met Macron  We have different histories  different interests    Reporting by Michel Rose  Editing by Sarah White  

WASHINGTON   The U S  State Department on Tuesday called on Burundi to rescind its decision to suspend the U S funded Voice of America and ban the BBC and to allow journalists to operate freely in the run up to elections in 2020  This decision raises serious concerns for the freedom of expression enshrined in Article 31 of Burundi s constitution  as well as for Burundi s human rights obligations   State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters  We call on the government to rescind its decision and we urge the government of Burundi to allow all journalists to operate in an environment free from intimidation   he added Both broadcasters were suspended  initially for six months  in May last year in the run up to a referendum that opposition politicians and activists said was designed to extend the president s rule for at least a decade Hundreds of Burundians have been killed in clashes with security forces and half a million have fled since President Pierre Nkurunziza announced in 2015 he would run for a third term in what his opponents saw as a breach of the constitution  He won reelection  Last May s referendum overwhelmingly approved changes that could let the president stay in power to 2034   Reporting by Lesley Wroughton  Editing by Leslie Adler  

WASHINGTON   The House voted Wednesday to condemn the Trump administration for pushing a federal appeals court to obliterate the Affordable Care Act  and it urged the Justice Department to defend the law in court The vote  240 186  was nonbinding  but it documented the House s support of the health law  which was passed nine years ago without the votes of any Republicans  With the resolution  Democrats sought to put Republicans on the record for failing to come to the defense of the health law s most popular provisions  such as protecting people with pre existing medical conditions and mandating coverage for  essential health benefits   like mental health coverage  prescription drugs  emergency services and maternity care Eight Republicans voted for it  One Democrat opposed  The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land  and it is the responsibility of the Justice Department and the administration to defend the law of the land in court   Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said   What are they doing  Just the opposite  Why  Because they don t believe in governance  That is why they are happy to shut down government  The resolution  which expresses the sentiment of the House but is not subject to approval by the Senate or by President Trump  states   The actions taken by the Trump administration seeking the invalidation of the A C A  s protections for people with pre existing conditions  and later the invalidation of the entire A C A   are an unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people  Republicans called it an empty gesture  This will do nothing for your health care   said the House Republican leader  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California   But what will it do  It will make a great press release  Representative Greg Walden  Republican of Oregon  said the resolution was a political screed and  doesn t do a darn thing to protect people with pre existing conditions   Democrats would rather play politics with health care and attack the president for political purposes  rather than work with us on what could and should be bipartisan solutions   Mr  Walden said Democrats relished the opportunity to test Republicans  commitment to health care  an issue sure to figure in 2020 elections  I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeatedly claim that they stand for protections for people with pre existing conditions and for other protections included in the Affordable Care Act   said Representative Frank Pallone Jr  of New Jersey  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee   Well  now is your chance to show it  A federal judge in Texas invalidated all of the Affordable Care Act in December  Last week the Trump administration told the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  in New Orleans  that it agreed with the judge s decision  California and other states that support the Affordable Care Act have appealed the decision If the entire law is struck down  millions of people could lose coverage provided through the expansion of Medicaid and through private insurance subsidized by the federal government ImageRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California  the House Republican leader  called the House resolution an empty gesture   This will do nothing for your health care   he said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesRepublicans have voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act  and many were reluctant this week to criticize the position taken in court by the Trump administration  But they said they would be ready to respond if the law falls to a legal challenge  If the court strikes down the Affordable Care Act  Republicans will act to protect those with pre existing conditions   said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas  the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee   We will work to make health care more affordable  guaranteeing that folks can see local doctors or go to their local hospitals  and we will preserve other important provisions  such as no lifetime limits and allowing kids to stay on their parents  plans until age 26  At the same time  Mr  Brady called the existing health law unconstitutional and called the resolution criticizing the Justice Department a  political stunt  The House Energy and Commerce Committee is working on legislation to hold down insurance costs and reverse what Democrats describe as the administration s efforts to sabotage the health law But Senate Republicans have been badly divided as they consider a response to Mr  Trump s announcement late Monday on Twitter that the party was  developing a really great HealthCare Plan  to replace the Affordable Care Act Some  averse to an election year fight on the issue  have said they would wait to see what Mr  Trump might propose  Some have praised him for raising the issue again  Back home  what we have right now is an unmitigated disaster   said Senator David Perdue  Republican of Georgia   As an elected official  it s our responsibility to bring solutions  And what President Trump is saying is that if Congress is gridlocked right now  which it is on this topic  then he wants to start a dialogue about what it is he stands for  And I applaud that  But Mr  Trump pulled back his request for a health law replacement after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  told him no such legislation would be coming before the 2020 election Opinion polls show that Democrats have a political advantage on health care  Asked why voters should trust Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act  after they failed in 2017  Senator Ron Johnson  Republican of Wisconsin  said   I would understand their skepticism  The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the health law s requirement for people to have insurance   the individual mandate   as an exercise of Congress s taxing power  Judge Reed O Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth ruled that the requirement became unconstitutional after Congress brought that tax penalty to zero in the tax cut signed by Mr  Trump in 2017  and he said that other provisions of the law could not survive because they were inextricably linked to the mandate Two Republican state attorneys general  Dave Yost of Ohio and Tim Fox of Montana  filed a legal brief this week saying there was  no basis  to strike down the whole law just because the individual mandate was unconstitutional They said the mandate could be severed from the health law without throwing out other provisions  like the protections for people with pre existing conditions  The Justice Department under Mr  Trump initially said that the mandate and the protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down  But last week  the department went further and said it agreed with the Texas judge who ruled the entire law was invalid  

When it comes to explaining why Facebook  YouTube and Twitter have become hotbeds for extremism  propaganda and bigotry  there s a tendency to overcomplicate things  That s understandable  The algorithms that govern the platforms are unknowable trade secrets  There are  in some cases  billions of users to account for  There are meaty issues of free speech and copyright law playing out in real time across borders  Technology is confusing  And  yes  it s true that the tech companies are dealing with thorny problems that most likely have no universally satisfying outcome  Big Tech s problems are indeed dizzying and manifold  but the last few years have taught us that there s an Occam s razor quality to any explanation of the toxicity of our online platforms  The original sin  it seems  isn t all that complicated  it s the prioritization of growth   above all else and at the expense of those of us who use the services The most recent example came on Tuesday morning when Bloomberg News published a story chronicling YouTube s struggles to quash misinformation  conspiracies and incendiary content  According to the report  current and former YouTube employees said that the company had ignored warnings to change YouTube s recommendation engine and that they were  in some cases  discouraged from seeking out videos that might violate YouTube s rules to preserve a sense of plausible deniability  Employee fears  were sacrificed for engagement   Ambitious goals were set to hit one billion hours of viewing a day  and algorithms were tweaked accordingly   We were so in the weeds trying to hit our goals and drive usage of the site   one former senior manager confessed in the piece   I don t know if we really picked up our heads   As technology advances  will it continue to blur the lines between public and private  Sign up for Charlie Warzel s limited run newsletter to explore what s at stake and what you can do about it  The story shouldn t be shocking  Reports from inside YouTube echo insider tales from other large tech platforms   a familiar pattern of ruthless optimization for users and of attention gone wrong The YouTube employee s quote reminded me of a conversation I d had a few years back with a former member of Twitter s product team   Leading up to I P O   it was all about revenue growth  from C E O  on down   the employee told me  suggesting that  in a frantic race to look good for Wall Street  the company deprioritized fixing systemic issues  including its rampant harassment problem  Others inside Twitter back then agreed   I did see a lot of decisions being made in terms of growth when it came to how to handle abuse  which I get   Leslie Miley  a former engineering manager at Twitter  told me at the time Growth at any cost  It s a mantra familiar inside Facebook as well  as an internal memo surfaced last year by BuzzFeed News revealed   We connect people  Period  That s why all the work we do in growth is justified   a Facebook senior executive  Andrew Bosworth  wrote in the memo in June 2016  In a separate section  while advancing the argument that more human connections via Facebook are a  de facto good   he appears to grapple with the downsides of connection   Maybe it costs someone a life by exposing someone to bullies   maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools   he wrote Mr  Bosworth has suggested the memo was a thought experiment   I don t agree with the post today and I didn t agree with it when I wrote it   he said  But Facebook s rapid rise to two billion plus users  numerous privacy debacles and a steady stream of reported negative revelations suggest that  like its counterparts  the company s quest for expansion trumped pressing concerns of privacy and transparency  A New York Times investigation last year reported that   bent on growth   Facebook executives  ignored warning signs  that Facebook could  disrupt elections  broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe  Scale is also seductive at an engineering level  bottom line aside  Adding users and engagement  in one interpretation  might signal that you re giving people what they want  In 2017  I asked a former senior Facebook employee if staff members had felt a sense of blame for Facebook s inability to stop the spread of misinformation that plagued the platform during the 2016 election  Not exactly  the employee explained   They believe that to the extent that something flourishes or goes viral on Facebook   it s not a reflection of the company s role  but a reflection of what people want  And that deeply rational engineer s view tends to absolve them of some of the responsibility  probably  We want to hear from youOpinionLosing Your Privacy in the Digital Age  Share Your StoriesFeb  13  2019We can see this sensibility today in the way the platforms tend to obfuscate and deflect responsibility  Just last week  a YouTube executive argued that its recommendation algorithms weren t designed to nudge users toward more extreme videos  Similarly  Twitter has and will continue to argue it was not designed specifically to be disproportionately hostile to women and people of color  And Facebook will argue that it was certainly not designed to help foreign countries interfere in our elections But this defensive posture seems only concerned with intent  Even if we take the platforms at their word that they did not intend to profit from extremism or to become hubs for radicalization online  that doesn t mean it doesn t happen  Intent is far less important than the actual outcomes  And the outcomes appear to suggest that these platforms were intentionally designed to keep you glued to your screen for one more video  one more retweet  one more outraged share of a hate read  How can the mess be unwound  Can it be fixed  Those are the complicated questions  But the answer as to how we got here in the first place is much less complicated than Big Tech wants you to think  Intentionally or not  it was designed this way  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear

ALGIERS  Algeria   Algeria s Constitutional Council formalized President Abdelaziz Bouteflika s departure Wednesday from the office he held for two decades  as rattled international partners watched closely to see what s next for an energy rich country that is a key player in fighting terrorism Bouteflika himself asked the Algerians people for forgiveness the day after he stepped down following weeks of protests and the loss of the army s support  He urged citizens in a farewell letter  to stay united  and never divide yourselves  Bouteflika himself asked for forgiveness from his compatriots after stepping down in the wake of mass protests  and urged them in a farewell letter  to stay united  and never divide yourselves  Algerians faced a new and uncertain era  after the resignation of a man who had ruled Algeria for 20 years and had been a fixture in the Arab world s political landscape for decades A discreet  77 year old Bouteflika ally   the president of the upper house of the Algerian Parliament  Abdelkader Bensalah   is expected to take over as interim leader while Algeria plans elections  But that might further anger the protesters who drove Bouteflika from power  and who want to overhaul a political system seen as secretive  elitist and corrupt  Our session today is related to establishing the vacancy of the post of president of the republic  following the resignation of Mr  Abdelaziz Bouteflika yesterday   said Constitutional Council president Tayeb Belaiz at Wednesday s meeting The 12 member body then formally notified Parliament that Algeria no longer has a president  Both chambers of the national legislature are expected to meet to name the president of the upper house as interim leader for 90 days while elections are organized A much diminished Bouteflika  82  appeared on images shown on national television Tuesday night handing his resignation letter to the Constitutional Council president  Bouteflika  who hasn t spoken publicly to the nation since a 2013 stroke  appeared pale and weak and wore a traditional robe instead of his habitual suits In the public farewell letter released Wednesday by state news agency APS  Bouteflika acknowledged that some of his actions as president were less than successful  writing   I ask your forgiveness for any failing toward you  But he also said   I am leaving the political scene without sadness or fear  for the future of our country   He said he hoped Algeria s new leaders take the nation to  horizons of progress and prosperity  Women and young people  who led the protest movement that pressured him out of office  are  the beating heart of our nation  and deserve special attention  Bouteflika wrote He notably praised those who fought alongside him for Algeria s independence from colonial France and urged Algerians to live up to their example and honor their sacrifices Algerian protesters celebrated his departure with songs and flag waving in the capital Tuesday night New protests are already planned for Friday  after six straight Fridays of massive  peaceful gatherings that surprised the entrenched leadership by their strength and persistence Bensalah  the man expected to serve as interim leader  has led the upper house for most of Bouteflika s four terms  A one time journalist and former ambassador  Bensalah has held senior political positions for the past 25 years but has kept a low profile  rarely giving interviews or appearing at public events He s known as a politician who works behind the scenes to strike compromises and solve problems  and who avoids controversial debates   and is very much part of the political elite Demonstrators worry that those who would play a role in the political transition are too close to the distrusted power structure  including Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui  accused of contributing to fraud in the last presidential election in 2014 and cracking down on past protests However  the protest movement doesn t have a single  unifying alternative to the current political system Another question is what the influential military and Bouteflika s entourage will do next  Military chief of staff Ahmed Gaid Salah appeared to trigger Bouteflika s departure by pushing to get him declared unfit for office Countries around the world are watching Algeria s political crisis  wondering whether a transfer of power could impact gas and oil deliveries to Europe  Cuba and around Africa   or crucial security cooperation with Europe and the U S Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned against foreign interference in Algerian politics and said Wednesday that  we hope the internal processes in that country     will by no means affect the friendly nature of our relations   Algeria s foreign minister recently visited Russia  and the countries have been economic and geopolitical allies since the Soviet era French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian expressed hope that Algerians would  pursue this democratic transition in the same spirit of calm and responsibility  that has marked the protests that drove Bouteflika from office  France  Algeria s former colonial ruler and a key trading partner  had come under fire for seeming to support Bouteflika earlier in the movement The U S  State Department  which has expressed support for the peaceful protests  said it s now up to Algerians to decide the next steps  Since fighting an Islamist insurgency in the 1990s  Algeria has cooperated closely with the U S  and Europe against terrorism The United Nations   where Bouteflika often defended Third World countries as Algerian foreign minister in the 1960s and 1970s   offered Algeria support in its transition  The U N  said Wednesday that Secretary General Antonio Guterres  salutes the mature and calm nature in which the Algerian people have been expressing their desire for change  In Sudan  organizers behind months of anti government demonstrations expressed hope that Sudan s Omar al Bashir would follow Bouteflika s footsteps Sarah Abdel Jaleel  a spokeswoman for the Sudanese Professionals Association  told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Bouteflika s

DUBLIN   With Westminster deadlocked over Britain s departure from the European Union  one small party is potentially positioned to rescue Britain from its self induced paralysis   but it refuses to vote Having won seven seats on an anti Brexit platform  the party s support would have reversed Monday s three vote defeat for a proposal to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union s customs union  ending the risk of a catastrophic no deal Brexit The party is Sinn Fein  the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army  which does not consider itself British and has formally renounced any involvement in Westminster politics This week  despite renewed criticism in Ireland  Sinn Fein repeated that it has no intention of ending its Westminster boycott   It s a matter of principle  We are a party that is for a United Ireland  for Irish independence   said the party s president  Mary Lou McDonald  on Tuesday Speaking outside the Irish Parliament in Dublin  Ms  McDonald told reporters that Sinn Fein members would not be prepared to  swear an oath to a foreign power   a reference to the royal oath of allegiance required of new lawmakers at Westminster  Irish interests in this Brexit debacle are not best advanced at Westminster   she said   Irish interests in this scenario were always going to be advanced and protected  or not  by the government in Dublin  whose duty it is to defend Irish interests in conjunction with our European partners  ImageThe former president of Sinn Fein  Gerry Adams  center  joined a protest against a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland last week CreditPaul Faith Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesA cross border party whose central goal is a united Ireland  Sinn Fein actively participates in both the Republic of Ireland s Parliament and in the  currently suspended  assembly for Northern Ireland  a devolved region of the United Kingdom  Its refusal to take up its seats in Westminster at a time when the Parliament is debating and voting on issues of critical importance to the whole island of Ireland has been repeatedly criticized by other Irish parties  north and south Sinn Fein is a determined competitor in Northern Ireland parliamentary elections  using any seats it wins at Westminster as a source of electoral legitimacy   and of public funds from the British exchequer  At the last elections in 2017  it won seven seats  with the rival  pro Brexit Democratic Unionist Party taking 10 of the other 11 Northern Ireland constituencies  But Sinn Fein insists that its candidates are elected on a clearly stated abstentionist policy  and that they therefore have no mandate to vote in Britain s Parliament  whatever is at stake A poll taken in the Republic of Ireland last month suggested that 57 percent of voters there felt that Sinn Fein should be prepared to vote at Westminster on matters relating to Brexit  with only 20 percent against  But within its core support group in Northern Ireland  where Sinn Fein is the main voice of Catholic nationalism  the boycott is seen by many as a matter of principle  not political tactics  and strongly supported Prof  Jennifer Todd  a political scientist at University College Dublin  said that going to Westminster would do little to change Sinn Fein s popularity in the Republic  where it runs mainly on leftist social democratic issues  but would alienate some core supporters in the north  benefiting hard line dissidents who never recognized the peace deal  Nor  she thought  was the party s tactical route in Westminster as straightforward as arithmetic might suggest If it did it enter Parliament on a one off basis to vote on Brexit   it might work   she said   They could come in and out and make a difference without committing to a parliamentary presence  But with British parliamentary politics so chaotic and unpredictable  she said  they could  get caught in the Westminster process and they would lose Northern Ireland support to the dissidents  Sinn Fein s president  Ms  McDonald  made a similar point in Dublin on Tuesday   Don t imagine for a second that seven Sinn Fein M P s could enter Westminster and make sense of the utter chaos and circus that we ve witnessed over the last number of months   she said  

NEW DELHI   NASA has criticized India for the antisatellite test it carried out with great fanfare last week  saying it was riskier than officials claimed and created debris that could threaten the International Space Station  That kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight that we need to see have happen   Jim Bridenstine  NASA s administrator  said on Monday at a town hall event in Washington organized by the agency He said that India  in shooting down one of its own satellites with a rocket  had left debris high enough in orbit to pose a risk to the International Space Station  calling that a  terrible  terrible thing   The space station currently hosts a crew of six people Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the downing of the satellite last Wednesday  a test launch that put India in an exclusive group of nations   along with the United States  China and Russia   with the capability to destroy targets in space ImageIndia said its launch was carried out in the lower atmopshere  to ensure that there is no space debris   But NASA says it has identified 400 pieces of orbital debris from the test CreditIndian Space Research Organization EPA  via Shutterstock India stands tall as a space power   Mr  Modi tweeted after the announcement  He said the test had been  indigenous   accomplished entirely by Indians  Scientists estimate that the satellite India destroyed was moving around the Earth at 17 000 miles per hour India s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement that the test   called Mission Shakti  the Hindi word for  power    had been carried out in the lower atmosphere  to ensure that there is no space debris   The statement said that if the test created debris  it would  decay and fall back onto the earth within weeks  But Mr  Bridenstine said NASA had identified 400 pieces of orbital debris from the test  including about 60 trackable pieces at least 10 centimeters in size  Two dozen pieces were identified above the highest point of the International Space Station s orbit  The station serves as a research laboratory and has hosted astronauts from 18 countries since it was launched into orbit in 1998  The good thing is  it s low enough in Earth orbit that over time this will all dissipate   Mr  Bridenstine said of the debris But that process takes time  he said  Much of the debris from a 2007 Chinese antisatellite test  for instance  is still in orbit  That test generated more debris than any other on record  with more than 2 000 trackable pieces Sync your calendar with the solar systemNever miss an eclipse  a meteor shower  a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that s out of this world Even small pieces of debris in orbit can be dangerous because of the speed at which they move  In 2011  crew members on the International Space Station took refuge in escape capsules because of an unidentified piece of debris  which passed within 1 100 feet of the station at a speed of 29 000 miles per hour NASA estimated that India s test increased the risk of small debris impact to the International Space Station by 44 percent  Mr  Bridenstine said There was no immediate response to his remarks from the Indian government NASA s announcement was not the first negative reaction to India s antisatellite test  Some analysts said last week that it could have worrying geopolitical consequences  intensifying a space race with China and threatening the delicate balance of power between India and Pakistan  which are both armed with nuclear weapons Mr  Modi made his announcement in a rare televised address to the nation  and some suspected the prime minister was trying to drum up support for his governing Bharatiya Janata Party  with voting set to begin next week in hotly contested general elections The elections are expected to be the biggest in history  with nearly 900 million people eligible to cast ballots  Mr  Modi saw a burst in support in the polls after India conducted airstrikes in Pakistan in February  in retaliation for a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed Indian soldiers

CHICAGO   Cook County State s Attorney Kim Foxx was elected in 2016 mainly because of anger that the prosecutor she ousted had waited a year to charge a Chicago police officer in the killing of black teenager Laquan McDonald  Then Foxx  who is a survivor of sexual assault as a child  grabbed national attention by charging singer R  Kelly with aggravated sexual abuse But in the course of just a few days  her reputation as rising political star and legal crusader was badly tarnished by her office s handling of two celebrity cases involving  Empire  actor Jussie Smollett and Kelly  The dismissal of all charges against Smollett enraged many  from President Donald Trump to Chicago s mayor and the city s police union  They accuse her of allowing Smollett to walk away from faking a hate crime attack and lying about it to police without so much as an apology or admission of guilt And adding to her woes  Kelly s attorney Steve Greenberg on Monday accused Foxx of caving in to pressure from celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti to charge Kelly  Avenatti  who is accused by federal prosecutors in a separate case of trying to shake down shoe company Nike  said he had provided Foxx with a video of Kelly having sex with a 14 year old girl David Erickson  a former state appellate judge who teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law  said you d have to go back 50 years to find a Chicago prosecutor so embroiled in controversy  Edward Hanrahan was charged with conspiracy in the deaths of two Black Panther members in a raid by agents from Hanrahan s office in 1969  He was acquitted  but ultimately ousted by voters  Looking back  that s the only thing that comes close to this   said Erickson  pointing out that Foxx s troubles may be far from over Retired Illinois Appellate Justice Sheila O Brien vowed on Monday  in an opinion piece posted on the Chicago Tribune s website  to file a petition to the courts asking that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate Foxx and her office  This is exhausting  but it has to be done   O Brien wrote Foxx declined to comment for this article  Her fate was literally debated in the streets of Chicago Monday at dueling protests   one organized by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson in support of Foxx and another by the police union where demonstrators chanted  Foxx must go  The praise she received for opening up about being raped as a small child  and then taking on R  Kelly   a Chicago native who had beaten child pornography charges in 2008   has been drowned out  Her office has been severely criticized by two major legal groups for what they called ethical lapses in the Smollett case Kelly s attorney on Monday asked a judge to order all of Foxx s communications with Avenatti preserved and suggested that Foxx fed clients to Avenatti  They got in bed with Avenatti and Avenatti is toxic   Kelly attorney Greenberg said in reference to Avenatti s cooperation with Foxx s office in the Kelly investigation Even Foxx s decision to recuse herself from the Smollett case is being questioned  Former judge O Brien said a special prosecutor should answer whether Foxx really stepped back from the Smollett case after she said she was removing herself because of communications with a relative of the actor  I can say without any reservation that her reputation has been damaged among people who work in the criminal justice system   said Terry Ekl  a local defense attorney How it plays out politically is anyone s guess  Voters may have to wait until next year s primary election to do anything about Foxx Dick Simpson  a University of Illinois at Chicago political scientist  said the only way he knows of to remove Foxx from office before an election would be to impeach her  But she hasn t done anything impeachable   he said  citing her recusal from the case  

Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  He kissed a senator s wife on the lips  He joked about the attractiveness of several senators  teenage daughters and granddaughters  And he told a female senator to  spread her legs  because she was  going to be frisked   A  MeToo moment That s not how it was

Biden of leaning into her  smelling her hair and kissing her head in a way that made her uncomfortable at a 2014 campaign rally  has thrust the possible presidential candidate into a major

the 76 year old Mr  Biden can get right with his party s current mores around race and gender may be the most fraught question hanging over his presidential aspirations In the  MeToo era  we talk a lot about  open secrets   But Mr  Biden s touchy feely behavior wasn t a secret at all  It was photographed  televised and widely discussed  And  for years  it was viewed as a political asset  Mr  Biden was a skilled retail politician  according to the conventional wisdom  someone who could work a room  charm a crowd  win them over booth by booth in a New Hampshire diner This weekend s accusations could transform that strength into a weakness In response to Ms  Flores s account  Mr  Biden said he didn t believe he had ever acted inappropriately in public life but was willing to  listen respectfully  to those who may feel differently  Ms  Flores flipped the frame  saying Mr  Biden s perception didn t matter  How his actions made her feel was more important   Frankly  my point was never about his intentions  and they shouldn t be about his intentions   she said in an interview with CNN   It should be about the women on the receiving end of that behavior  Now  the political world finds itself litigating a series of thorny questions  Does intent matter  Are we allowed to think that a back of head kiss is  not as bad  as a mouth kiss  even though they are both kind of gross  Can a progressive male politician issue a denial  while still saying he believes women The debate  which should come as no surprise to Mr  Biden or his team if they ve been following the news over the past two years  will ultimately be decided by voters  should Mr  Biden jump into the race Last month  Mr  Biden referred to himself as a  tactile politician  during a speech in Dover  Del

WASHINGTON   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  using a little known provision in the federal tax code  formally requested on Wednesday that the I R S  hand over six years of President Trump s personal and business tax returns  starting what is likely to be a momentous fight with his administration Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  hand delivered a two page letter laying out the request to Charles P  Rettig  the Internal Revenue Service commissioner  ending months of speculation about when he would do so and almost certainly prompting a legal challenge from the Trump administration Responding to questions from reporters in the Oval Office  Mr  Trump suggested that he would fight the request because  he said  he was being audited  I guess when you have a name  you are audited  but until such time as I m not under audit I would not be inclined to do that   he said  Read Mr  Neal s letter to the I R S  commissioner  The move by Mr  Neal came as other panels controlled by House Democrats were flexing their muscles  The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning authorized its chairman to use a subpoena to try to force the Justice Department to give Congress a full copy of the special counsel s report and all of the underlying evidence used to reach his conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 election And the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee said that he would soon ask for a vote on a subpoena of his own to compel Mazars USA  an accounting firm tied to the president  to produce a decade s worth of Mr  Trump s financial records  They have told us that they will provide the information pretty much when they have a subpoena   the chairman  Representative Elijah E  Cummings of Maryland  told reporters   And we ll get them a subpoena  Unlike the chairmen of other committees  Mr  Neal is not relying on a subpoena or standard congressional processes  Instead  he is invoking an authority enshrined in the tax code granted only to the tax writing committees in Congress that gives the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee the power to request tax information on any filer Mr  Neal gave the agency until April 10 to comply with the request  and if he receives the information  he will then confidentially review it with his committee staff The provision  which dates in some form to the Teapot Dome scandal of Warren G  Harding s administration  at least on its face gives the Trump administration little room to decline a request like Mr  Neal s  It only says that the Treasury secretary  shall  furnish the information  President Trump is the first president in nearly a half century to break precedent and refuse to voluntarily release his tax returns   said Representative Dan Kildee  Democrat of Michigan and a member of the Ways and Means Committee   The president is the only person who can sign bills into law  and the public deserves to know whether the president s personal financial interests affect his public decision making  The Treasury Department and the I R S  did not immediately respond to requests for comment But Democrats anticipate that the Trump administration will object to the request and force the matter into the courts  where its adjudication could take months or longer  Though the provision   No  6103 in the tax code   is invoked frequently by the committee  there is little precedent for using it to view the returns of a president who has not invited the scrutiny Republicans have vigorously argued against the request  saying that whatever justification Democrats produce will belie their true intent  to fish for information that could embarrass the president politically VideoThe House Judiciary Committee approved the authorization of a subpoena for a full copy of the Mueller report  The chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  said he would not issue this subpoena right away CreditCreditT J  Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesRepresentative Kevin Brady of Texas  the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee  called the request  an abuse of the tax writing committees  statutory authority   Weaponizing our nation s tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans  privacy rights   Mr  Brady said in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin   As you know  by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns  Defying modern presidential norms  Mr  Trump has refused since he became a candidate for president to release any of his tax returns  Democrats suspect the tax information could provide clues to wrongdoing by Mr  Trump  and they made getting the documents one of their top oversight priorities when they reclaimed control of the House in January  A New York Times investigation showed that the president engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father  Mr  Neal said he was making the request as part of his committee s oversight of  the extent to which the I R S  audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president   Under I R S  policy  the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year  Mr  Neal said the committee was considering legislation related to the issue  I take the authority to make this request very seriously  and I approach it with the utmost care and respect   Mr  Neal said in a statement   This request is about policy  not politics  my preparations were made on my own track and timeline  entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration  He added   I trust that in this spirit  the I R S  will comply with federal law and furnish me with the requested documents in a timely manner  In addition to Mr  Trump s personal returns for 2013 to 2018  Mr  Neal requested returns for Mr  Trump s trust and seven other core Trump business entities that control scores of other Trump operations  including his golf club in Bedminster  N J  He also asked the I R S  to share any information it had related to the entities  including whether they had been audited Liberal Democrats have complained for weeks that Mr  Neal  70 and a roll up your sleeves legislator  was dragging his feet on making the request  They have organized events in his district  taken out advertisements and produced legal briefs meant to make a case that he should act and act quickly Mr  Neal said throughout that he was chiefly concerned with crafting a request  alongside the House general counsel and the Ways and Means Committee staff  that could withstand legal challenge  I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative  legal and oversight rights   he said on Wednesday In the Judiciary Committee  the chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  said he would not immediately issue the subpoena for the Mueller report  But the party line vote won by Democrats who control the committee ratchets up pressure on Attorney General William P  Barr as he decides how much of the nearly 400 page report to share with lawmakers  I will give him time to change his mind   Mr  Nadler said in his opening statement   But if we cannot reach an accommodation  then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials  The committee also approved subpoenas for five former White House aides who Democrats said were relevant to an investigation into possible obstruction of justice  abuse of power and

FERGUSON  Mo    Michael Brown s mother was defeated Tuesday in her bid for a seat on the City Council in Ferguson  Missouri  where her son died in a police shooting that helped give rise to the national Black Lives Matter movement Lesley McSpadden finished third in a three way race in Ferguson s 3rd Ward  Unofficial St  Louis County election results show the winner was Fran Griffin  The race also featured Keith Kallstrom  who was the incumbent  I congratulate Fran on her victory  I feel proud of the positive race we ran  and I loved talking to the Ferguson community   McSpadden said late Tuesday night in an emailed statement   Tomorrow  the work continues and I intend to be a part of it no matter my position  I m not going anywhere  Brown  a black 18 year old  was fatally shot by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug  9  2014  touching off months of protests and violence  Wilson claimed he was forced to shoot when the unarmed Brown came at him menacingly after attacking the officer during a street confrontation  A St  Louis County grand jury s November 2014 decision not to indict Wilson sparked renewed unrest in the St  Louis suburb  where two thirds of the 21 000 residents are black  I wanted to go back and do something right in a place that did something so very wrong to my son  and I think that s what my son would want as well   McSpadden  39  said in an interview with The Associated Press prior to the election  She had pledged to make police accountability one of her top priorities McSpadden  who spelled her first name  Lezley  for an autobiography but said she otherwise goes by Lesley  was new at being a candidate but has been at the edge of politics since her son s death  She s been front and center in the national Black Lives Matter movement  She endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in early 2016  at a time when Clinton was fending off a primary challenge from Vermont Sen  Bernie Sanders She was among seven  Mothers of the Movement  who appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention in 2016  Those mothers lost children in police shootings  in police custody or from gun violence  Also in 2016  McSpadden testified in favor of a Missouri Senate bill aimed at increasing use of police body cameras In the aftermath of Brown s death  Ferguson s criminal justice system drew heavy criticism for its treatment of poor and minority residents  Police were accused of singling out blacks for unnecessary traffic stops and harassing them on the street  The municipal court was accused of heaping on fines for minor offenses While the U S  Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson  the agency s blistering report of the police and municipal court practices led to a consent agreement requiring reforms that are still being implemented McSpadden s campaign drew skepticism from some in Ferguson  LaTasha Brown  president of the Southeast Ferguson Neighborhood Association  said she was concerned that McSpadden mostly campaigned from afar rather than getting in touch with the community  The 3rd Ward needs somebody who s going to mingle with the people   Brown said   You can t make change from a distance  If you don t know what your constituents are going through  if you re not there to hear what they re saying  how can you lead these people and make decisions for these people  Griffin did not immediately return a phone call for comment Tuesday night  Both she and Kallstrom have long been active in Ferguson Griffin has served on several boards and commissions  including serving on the city s Parks and Recreation Board  Kallstrom was a councilman for 10 years  took seven years off  then won three year terms in 2013 and 2016 McSpadden said she moved to Ferguson a year ago from a neighboring community specifically to run for the council  I wanted to come back to a place that caused me so much pain and did me so wrong  and to do something right   McSpadden told the AP  

How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives  David E  Sanger  a national security correspondent based in Washington  discussed the tech he s using You previously were a bureau chief for The Times in Japan  one of your many roles for the newspaper  When you arrived in Tokyo in the late 1980s  what tech were you equipped with In retrospect  nothing very impressive  Our  portable  computers weighed about the same as an electric typewriter  had a tiny cathode ray tube screen that showed a paragraph or two at most and stored stories on magnetic bubble memory  which in the 1980s was supposed to replace hard drives Needless to say  it was a technology whose time never arrived  Oh  and the computer had two black rubber cups on the top  You put the handset of a hard line phone into them and dialed up a computer in New York to transmit at the astoundingly slow speed of 300 bits per second  Half the time we had to give up and call the dictation room  where someone would type out the story that you read to them When we gave up on bubble memory computers and moved to the first laptops  I sent a note to New York asking what to do with

deadlines are tightest  There was the time I was rushing off the back stairs of Air Force One in the Middle East with an open laptop  story half written and late to the editing desk  and managed to

Forty years after the 1979 revolution  Islamism is exhausting itself as a legitimizing force for the Islamic Republic of Iran  Studies sponsored by the Iranian government show that resentment toward the state s religious symbols is at an all time high  According to the research arm of the Iranian parliament  around 70 percent of Iranian women do not strictly follow the official diktats for wearing a veil  Anticlerical sentiments have turned violent  Regardless of their ties to the government  clerics are routinely attacked and stabbed in the streets by angry anti regime individuals Iran is responding by cautiously downplaying Islamism and emphasizing nationalism and foreign threats to win over disgruntled citizens  Iran s leaders acknowledged the societal shift away from Islamism by making unprecedented references to nationalism and showing their determination to incorporate patriotic sentiments into the state ideology during the 40th anniversary celebrations of the revolution in February Iran s supreme leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  has repeatedly appealed to Iranians to back the government  even if they do not endorse its Islamist ideology  for the sake of their country and for their own security The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  which was established to preserve the Islamic Republic and the ideals of the 1979 revolution  now portrays itself as the guardian of the nation and the symbol of Iranian power against foreign aggression  Images of the ancient Persepolis ruins and references to the pre Islamic Persian past have become omnipresent in the state controlled media The change in government strategy came as Iranians demonstrated a new yearning for nationalism  challenging the self proclaimed religious political system  Impromptu grass roots gatherings at the Tomb of Cyrus  the founder of the Persian Empire known for his tolerance toward conquered nations and other religions  surprised observers and prompted crackdowns by security forces Iranian leadership s anti Americanism is increasingly at odds with the Iranian people s long held desire for an end to their international isolation  People have openly rallied against the regime s use of religion  anti Americanism and its support of the Syrian government and proxy groups at the expense of their well being  During countrywide protests in 2018  many Iranians shouted   Let go of Syria  think about us  Popular pressure also played an important role in getting Iran to sign the 2015 nuclear deal  Iranians hoped that the deal would be a step toward forcing the regime to further open up to the world  In his book  National Security and Nuclear Diplomacy   President Hassan Rouhani acknowledges that the leadership paid close attention to the government s classified public surveys before making critical decisions with regard to the nuclear program Iran s supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guards commanders made no secret about their reluctance to accept the deal and what could follow  In his campaign for re election in 2017  Mr  Rouhani promised that after securing the nuclear deal  he would resolve other outstanding issues  implying establishing relations with the United States The election of Donald Trump  followed by his withdrawal from the nuclear deal and renewed American sanctions against Iran  has brought Mr  Rouhani s reformist momentum to a halt  Instead  a sense of betrayal by the United States and of a threat to the country s territorial integrity appears to be emerging among Iranians Iranian hard liners have sensed the beginning of a change in the popular mood  Two weeks ago  Kayhan  a daily newspaper known for its close ties to the supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guards  declared  The End of the Western Illusion  as  the greatest achievement  of the last Persian year  which ended on March 20  Iranian elites who once galvanized society and received votes with the promise of better relations with the United States now simply repeat the angry anti American rhetoric of their conservative rivals These days  Javad Zarif  Iran s once smiling foreign minister and the chief nuclear negotiator  sounds more like the former hard line president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  Even Ali Akbar Salehi  the M I T  educated head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and nuclear negotiator  recently said that everyone from the proponents to the opponents of the regime  and from the revolutionaries to the anti revolutionaries have come to believe that the United States is our enemy  In taking away Iran s nuclear leverage  reimposing the sanctions and heavily arming its regional rivals  the United States has intensified anxieties about national security in the republic  Consequently  a national security discourse that brings the elites and the masses together is being constructed  and the Trump administration is providing credibility for it The Islamic Republic of Iran has survived not just because of its security apparatus but also because its leaders have been able to manage public sentiments and intra elite conflicts  And Iran s leaders have found that President Trump s hostility toward Iran is helping to rally otherwise resentful citizens behind the regime and create a new cohesive Islamist nationalist ideology This could have a demobilizing effect on Iran s underground but still vibrant civil society and further boost the Revolutionary Guards  influence over foreign policy  There is less and less popular and elite opposition to Mr  Khamenei s claim that if the Revolutionary Guards did not fight terrorists in Damascus  it would be fighting them in Tehran  It is likely that many will consider investment in the regime an investment in their own and their homeland s security  What was once considered regime security is increasingly seen as national security For four decades  the American and Iranian governments have simultaneously pursued a system of reward and punishment against Iranian citizens for opposite goals  Washington has hoped to foment public uprisings leading to regime change  Tehran has sought compliance and regime durability Sanctions and isolation together with regime repression have often bred popular discontent  turning elections into political movements  and students and women into courageous protesters  Tapping into these sentiments  President Barack Obama conditioned better opportunities for the nation on a nuclear agreement in his messages on Nowruz  the Persian New Year  President Trump set a new bar for Iranian citizens in his Nowruz message on March 20  regime change Washington s unreliable policy toward Iran is jeopardizing the Iranian people s favorable view of the United States  Sanctions may have passed their optimal point of channeling public grievances against the regime  beyond which they only alienate Iranian citizens from the United States  The statements of American officials that they target the Iranian regime and not the people are a bad joke  To ordinary Iranians  they are targeting the people American policies are effectively empowering the hard liners and pushing Iranian citizens toward the regime  Exhausted by 40 years of state repression and international pressure  Iranian citizens may very well shift their anger from sponsors of the former to the latter and signal a reluctant preference for those who wear the garb of Persian nationalism and national security Mohammad Ayatollahi Tabaar  an associate professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A M University  is

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump told House Republicans on Tuesday that they need to embrace health care reform and make it the first thing they vote on following the 2020 election Speaking at an annual fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump told GOP lawmakers and supporters they have the advantage on a variety of issues  but conceded that Democrats have the advantage on health care  We have to take that away from them   Trump said  Republicans should not run away from health care   he added   You can t do it  You re going to get clobbered  He told the GOP House members   You are the minority  I hate to say  That s not going to last long   Democrats hold a 235 197 majority in the House with three vacancies The Democrats found success in 2018 by attracting support from women  minorities and college educated voters  particularly in suburban districts  Many wanted a check on the president  That success filtered down to state and local races  with Democrats flipping hundreds of seats in state legislatures and picking up seven governorships To turn that momentum  Trump is focusing on the economy and casting Democrats as outside the mainstream in their support for policies such as  Medicare for all  and the  Green New Deal  to combat climate change  If they beat me with the Green New Deal  I deserve to lose   he said The buzzword for Republicans is  socialism   and Trump turned to it on several occasions Tuesday night Still  he said some of the Democrats  proposals could prove enticing to votes in the short term  He said free health care sounds very seductive  Don t underestimate the power of socialism to get a vote   Trump said  

LONDON   Prime Minister Theresa May has brought a new word to the Brexit lexicon  compromise May met Wednesday with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to avoid Britain s chaotic departure from the European Union in little over a week The shift came after lawmakers rejected the government s Brexit deal on three occasions and twice failed to agree on any other option What might happen next NO DEALIf Britain can t break its Brexit impasse  it risks crashing out of the EU in nine days Last month  the EU agreed to postpone the original departure date of March 29  but gave Britain only until April 12 to pass a deal  come up with a new plan and seek a further extension  or leave without an agreement or a transition period to smooth the way Most politicians  economists and business groups think leaving the world s largest trading bloc without an agreement would be damaging for the EU and disastrous for the U K  It could lead to tariffs imposed on trade between Britain and the EU  and customs checks that could cause gridlock at ports and shortages of essential goods A hard core of pro Brexit legislators in May s Conservative Party dismiss this as  Project Fear  and argue for what they call a  clean Brexit   But most lawmakers are opposed to leaving without a deal  Parliament has voted repeatedly to rule out a  no deal  Brexit   but it remains the default position unless a deal is approved  Brexit is canceled or the EU grants another extension  The bloc says it will only do that if Britain comes up with a new Brexit plan    A COMPROMISE DEALAfter almost two years of negotiations  Britain and the EU struck a divorce deal in November  laying out the terms of the departure from the bloc and giving a rough outline of future relations But it has been thrice rejected by Parliament amid opposition from lawmakers on both sides of the Brexit divide  Pro Brexit lawmakers think it keeps Britain too closely tied to EU rules  Pro EU legislators argue it is worse than the U K  s current status as an EU member On Tuesday  May she said she would be prepared to compromise with her Labour opponents to try to win their backing for the withdrawal deal  That s likely to include a pledge to keep closer economic ties with the bloc than she has long advocated    SOFT BREXIT May s offer of opposition talks suggest she is pivoting to a softer form of Brexit than the one she has described for almost three years May has always insisted Britain must leave the EU s single market and customs union in order to forge new trade deals around the world  but those ideas have strong opposition support Tweaking her deal to adopt a customs union  which would ensure seamless trade in goods with the EU  could gain May valuable votes in Parliament It also would probably be welcomed by the EU and would allow Britain an orderly departure in the coming months However  it could also create a schism in the Conservative Party  leading to potential resignations of pro Brexit government ministers That instability increases the chance of an early British election  which could rearrange Parliament and break the deadlock    BREXIT DELAYEDMay has conceded that Britain will need a further delay to its departure in order to sort out the mess and avert a  no deal  departure The EU is frustrated with the impasse and has said it will only grant another postponement if Britain comes up with a whole new plan Both Britain and the EU are reluctant to have the U K  participate in May 23 26 elections for the European Parliament but have signaled it could happen if necessary EU Council President Donald Tusk has urged the bloc to  be patient  and give Britain a Brexit extension if it plans to change course    BREXIT RECONSIDEREDThis week  Parliament narrowly rejected a proposal for a new referendum on whether to leave the EU The proposal for any Brexit deal to be put to public vote in a  confirmatory referendum  was backed by opposition parties  plus some of May s Conservatives The government has ruled out holding another referendum  saying voters in 2016 made their decision to leave But with divisions in both Parliament and in May s Cabinet  handing the decision back to the people in a new plebiscite could be seen as the only way forward    Follow AP s full coverage of Brexit at  https   www apnews com Brexit 

LONDON   Britain was no nearer to resolving the chaos surrounding its departure from the European Union after parliament failed on Monday to find a majority of its own for any alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May s divorce deal After a tumultuous week in which May s divorce strategy was rejected by lawmakers for a third time  despite her offer to quit if it passed  the future direction of Brexit remains mired in confusion In a bid to break the impasse  lawmakers on Monday voted on four last minute alternative Brexit options for what is the United Kingdom s most far reaching policy change since World War Two  All were defeated The option that came closest to getting a majority was a proposal to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU  which was defeated by three votes A proposal to hold a confirmatory referendum on any deal got the most votes  but was defeated by 292 280 The government is firmly opposed to both of these  the first  because it would mean giving up the freedom to make independent trade deals that many of her eurosceptic lawmakers long for  the second  because May says it would betray the voters who were promised that the result of the 2016 referendum would be implemented  and potentially solve nothing Brexit minister Steven Barclay said after the results were announced that the default position was still that Britain would leave the EU on April 12 without a divorce deal   the nightmare scenario for many international businesses FOURTH TIME LUCKY  The only option is to find a way through which allows the UK to leave with a deal   told parliament  He hinted that May could put her deal to a fourth vote this week in the hope of securing an orderly exit before European elections are held from May 23 onwards   an unpredictable complication that May s government is determined to avoid  If the house were to agree a deal this week  it would still be possible to avoid holding European parliamentary elections   Barclay said  May is due to hold five hours of cabinet meetings with senior ministers on Tuesday to plan the government s next moves Sterling fell almost 1 percent to  1 3048 after the vote results were read out by the speaker  John Bercow  to stand around 0 5 percent lower on the day  The third defeat of May s withdrawal agreement on Friday   the date Britain was originally scheduled to leave the EU   has left one of the weakest British leaders in a generation facing a spiralling crisis Her government and her Conservative Party  which has been trying to contain a schism over Europe for 30 years  are now riven between those who are demanding that May engineer a decisive break with the bloc and those demanding that she rule out such an outcome If May were to throw her weight behind either camp  she would risk tearing her party apart and bringing down the government  RIDDLE OF THE SPHINXSome Conservative lawmakers have warned they will support a motion of no confidence if she accepts calls for a Brexit that maintains many of the existing close economic ties with the EU From EU officials watching from Brussels  there was one plea   make up your minds   A sphinx is an open book compared to the UK   said Jean Claude Juncker  European Commission president   Nobody knows where it is heading  Would like to make the sphinx talk and tell us in which direction they would like to go  But while government and parliament struggle to solve the riddle  business is already suffering Two of Britain s biggest carmakers  BMW and Peugeot  both said that  despite the delay to Brexit  they would go ahead next week with factory shutdowns that had been deliberately scheduled to minimise disruption to their cross border supply lines in the event of a no deal departure on March 29 The political deadlock in London forced May to ask for a delay but as things stand  Britain will now depart at 2200 GMT on April 12   unless May can present another viable option to EU leaders holding an emergency Brexit summit on April 10 Hardline Conservative eurosceptic Mark Francois told Reuters   What took place in the House of Commons this evening was an attempted coup against the British people and the coup has failed     I think  no deal  is now highly likely   Brexit meaningful votes   https   tmsnrt rs 2V4on0S     Writing by Guy Faulconbridge  Elizabeth Piper and Michael Holden  Additional reporting by Costas Pitas  Alistair Smout  Kate Holton  Paul Sandle  David Milliken and Andy Bruce  Editing by Kevin Liffey  

ALGIERS   Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika will resign before his mandate ends on April 28  state news agency APS said on Monday  bowing to weeks of mass protests and army pressure seeking an end to his 20 year rule There was no immediate reaction from leaders of the protest movement that has buffeted Algeria  a major oil producer  since Feb  22  Many protesters want a new generation of leaders to replace an elderly  secretive ruling elite seen by many as out of touch and unable to jump start a faltering economy hampered by cronyism In a sign that protesters might demand more changes  most opposition parties rejected a new caretaker cabinet appointed by Bouteflika late on Sunday  saying the prime minister was too close to ruling circles APS said Bouteflika  who is 82 and in poor health  would take important decisions to ensure  continuity of the state s institutions  before stepping down  It did not spell out a date for his departure or give more details immediately Under Algeria s constitution  Abdelkader Bensalah  chairman of the upper house of parliament  would take over as caretaker president for 90 days until elections are held Bouteflika  rarely seen in public since he suffered a stroke in 2013  at first sought to defuse the unrest by saying on March 11 he was dropping plans to run for a fifth term But he gave no timetable for his exit  advocating a national conference on reforms to address the outpouring of discontent over corruption  nepotism  economic mismanagement and the protracted grip on power of veterans of the 1954 62 war of independence against France Bouteflika s hesitation further enraged protesters  spurring the powerful army chief of staff to step in by proposing last week to implement a provision of Algeria s constitution under which a constitutional council would determine whether Bouteflika was still fit to govern or allow him to resign But Bouteflika signalled late on Sunday that he was on his way out when he appointed a caretaker cabinet headed by interim Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui  An interim leader cannot appoint ministers under the constitution Central Bank Governor Mohamed Loukal was named finance minister  while the former head of the state power and gas utility  Mohamed Arkab  will take up the energy portfolio  OPEC member Algeria is a major oil and natural gas exporter Most opposition parties rejected the cabinet because they see Bedoui as too close to the ruling elite  They also say past elections he supervised as interior minister were not fair Several opposition leaders on Sunday supported the army chief s proposal that Bouteflika s capacity to govern be assessed under article 102 of the constitution 12 BUSINESSMEN PROBED FOR ALLEGED GRAFT The announcement of Bouteflika s pending resignation came hours after private Ennahar TV said Algeria had seized the passports of 12 businessmen in an apparent swoop on associates of the president It said an investigation into alleged corruption had been ordered by the army without informing the presidency    part of a struggle between the military and Bouteflika s circle  analysts said On Sunday  authorities had arrested Ali Haddad  a leading Algerian businessman close to Bouteflika On Monday  the state prosecutor opened cases against  some people  over alleged corruption and banned them from transferring assets abroad  APS said It gave no details  but Ennahar TV  a well informed media outlet throughout the wave of unrest  said 12 businessmen had been targeted and their passports seized  citing a statement from the general prosecutor Apart from Haddad  two tycoons close to Bouteflika  Mahieddine Tahkout and Reda Kouninef  were also on the list  according to Ennahar Some demonstrators have rejected Algeria s tradition of military intervention in civilian matters and want to dismantle the entire power elite  known locally as  le pouvoir   which includes army officers  the long ruling National Liberation Front  FLN  party and business tycoons Several close allies  including FLN figures and union leaders  had in the past weeks abandoned Bouteflika He established himself in the early 2000s by ending a civil war with Islamist militants that claimed 200 000 lives But dissatisfaction grew with an establishment widely seen as unaccountable  raising pressure for a new generation to take over  capable of modernising the oil dependent state and giving hope to a young population impatient for a better life   Reporting by Lamine Chikhi  Hamid Ould Ahmed  Ulf Laessing and Aziz El Yaakoubi  Writing by Ulf Laessing  Editing by Mark Heinrich and Catherine Evans  

LONDON   Britain is running out of time and options for Brexit U K  lawmakers have thrice rejected the divorce deal struck between Prime Minister Theresa May s government and the European Union  Facing an April 12 deadline to present the EU with a new Brexit proposal or crash out of the bloc  lawmakers met for new votes Monday to try to agree on a plan   and rejected all the options With May clinging to hope of persuading Parliament to back her Brexit deal if she asks a fourth time  a look at the most likely options NO DEALMost politicians  economists and business groups think leaving the world s largest trading bloc without an agreement would be disastrous  It would impose tariffs on trade between Britain and the EU  bring customs checks that could cause gridlock at ports  and could spark shortages of essential goods Brexiteer lawmakers in May s Conservative Party dismiss this as  Project Fear  and argue for what they call a  clean Brexit   They have urged her not to compromise and to ramp up preparations to leave the bloc without an agreement on April 12 Parliament has voted repeatedly to rule out a no deal Brexit  but that remains the default position unless a deal is approved  Brexit is canceled or the EU grants Britain another extension May says the only way to guarantee Britain does not leave the EU without a deal is for Parliament to back her deal   which lawmakers have already rejected three times    MAY S UNDEAD DEALAfter almost two years of negotiations  Britain and the EU struck a divorce deal in November  laying out the terms of the departure from the bloc and giving a rough outline of future relations But it has been roundly rejected by lawmakers on both sides of the Brexit divide  Pro Brexit lawmakers think it keeps Britain too closely tied to EU rules  Pro EU legislators argue it is worse than the U K  s current status as an EU member Parliament has thrown it out three times  although the latest defeat  by 58 votes  was the narrowest yet  It was rejected even after May won over some pro Brexit lawmakers by promising to quit if it was approved May is considering one last push this week  arguing that Parliament s failure to back any other deal means her agreement is the best option available    SOFT BREXITOn Monday  Parliament voted on four alternative proposals to May s rejected deal after lawmakers seized control of the schedule from the government None got a majority  but the votes revealed a solid block of support for a  soft Brexit  that would maintain close economic ties between Britain and the EU  A plan to keep the U K  in an EU customs union  ensuring seamless trade in goods  was defeated by just three votes May has ruled those options out  because sticking to EU trade rules would limit Britain s ability to forge new trade deals around the world But tweaking her deal to adopt a customs union could gain May valuable votes in Parliament  It also would likely be welcomed by the EU and would allow Britain to leave the bloc in an orderly fashion in the next few months    NEW BREXIT REFERENDUMParliament also narrowly rejected a proposal for a new referendum on whether to leave the EU or remain The proposal for any Brexit deal to be put to public vote in a  confirmatory referendum  was defeated by 12 votes  It was backed by opposition parties  plus some of May s Conservatives   mainly those who want to stay in the bloc Her government has ruled out holding another referendum on Britain s EU membership  saying voters in 2016 made their decision to leave But with divisions in both Parliament and in May s Cabinet  handing the decision back to the people in a new plebiscite could be seen as the only way forward    BREXIT DELAYEDThe alternative to a  no deal  departure is to delay Brexit for at least several months  and possibly more than a year  to sort out the mess  The EU is frustrated with the impasse and has said it will only grant another postponement if Britain comes up with a whole new Brexit plan The bloc is reluctant to have a departing Britain participate in the May 23 26 European parliament elections  but that would have to be done if Brexit is delayed  Still  EU Council President Donald Tusk has urged the bloc to give Britain a Brexit extension if it plans to change course A long delay raises the chances of an early British election  which could rearrange Parliament and break the deadlock    Follow AP s full coverage of Brexit at  https   www apnews com Brexit 

WASHINGTON   Some of Robert S  Mueller III s investigators have told associates that Attorney General William P  Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr  Barr indicated  according to government officials and others familiar with their simmering frustrations At stake in the dispute   the first evidence of tension between Mr  Barr and the special counsel s office   is who shapes the public s initial understanding of one of the most consequential government investigations in American history  Some members of Mr  Mueller s team are concerned that  because Mr  Barr created the first narrative of the special counsel s findings  Americans  views will have hardened before the investigation s conclusions become public Mr  Barr has said he will move quickly to release the nearly 400 page report but needs time to scrub out confidential information  The special counsel s investigators had already written multiple summaries of the report  and some team members believe that Mr  Barr should have included more of their material in the four page letter he wrote on March 24 laying out their main conclusions  according to government officials familiar with the investigation  Mr  Barr only briefly cited the special counsel s work in his letter ImageListen to  The Daily   New Insights Into the Mueller ReportThe attorney general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four page summary  Members of the special counsel s team say something was lost transcriptBack to The Dailybars0 00 25 58 25 58transcriptListen to  The Daily   New Insights Into the Mueller ReportHosted by Michael Barbaro  produced by Theo Balcomb  Lisa Tobin and Paige Cowett  and edited by Larissa AndersonThe attorney general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four page summary  Members of the special counsel s team say something was lost michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  The Mueller team sent its report to the attorney general  William Barr  The attorney general sent a summary of that report to Congress  Now  new reporting shows members of Mueller s team feel that Barr s summary did not reflect the report they wrote  It s Thursday  April 4  So take us back to the beginning of last week  What do we know at that point nicholas fandosSo we knew that Bill Barr  taking Bob Mueller s 300  to 400 page report  had gone through it extensively and boiled down what he called the  principal conclusions  to just four pages michael barbaroNick Fandos covers Congress  Mike Schmidt covers national security michael schmidtWe were in this unusual situation where the special counsel  Robert Mueller  had sent his report to the attorney general  said  I found no evidence that the campaign conspired with Russia to impact the election  But he declined to make a decision on obstruction nicholas fandosAnd what he said was Mueller didn t reach what Barr called a  traditional prosecutorial decision   In other words  Mueller presented evidence for the fact that the president may have obstructed justice but didn t go as far as to conclude that he had  He essentially punted to the attorney general s office michael schmidtAnd in this case  by Mueller not reaching a determination  he leaves the door open for Barr to come in to say  O K   Mueller didn t make a determination on this issue of obstruction  He did on collusion  I m going to look at all the facts  And he makes his determination   no case to be made here on both of these issues  The problem  though  is that the perception is that Mueller  the independent investigator who s there to do an inquiry free of politics  has not made a call on this central question  But Barr  the president s appointee  who s been there just for a few months  is making the decision  So the question is  is the fix in  Why is it  if Mueller didn t come to an answer  the attorney general did michael barbaroSo at the beginning of last week  we know that Mueller made the unusual decision not to make a call  And Barr made the unusual decision to make a call  And the question is  why michael schmidtIt s not unusual that Barr made a call  The Justice Department is there to decide whether people broke the law or not  And he was doing that  What s different and unusual here is that Barr and Mueller don t look like they re on the same page  music michael schmidtMueller said  I can t make a determination on this issue  And Barr did  So why is it that they looked at it differently  Why was it that Mueller  the prosecutor here  didn t do the one thing that prosecutors at the Justice Department do  which is make a call nicholas fandosAnd that was the question that we ve spent the last week trying to figure out  What is the difference here  What is the evidence that they re looking at  And why did Mueller and Barr make the decisions that they made around this question of obstruction of justice michael barbaroAnd what have we now learned nicholas fandosWhat we ve now learned is that nobody s happy  The team that was working   or at least some of the team that was working with Bob Mueller feels that Barr stepped in and filled the vacuum in a way that didn t properly capture what their 22 month investigation found  And Barr s team feels that Bob Mueller fell short of doing his job michael barbaroSo let s start with the Barr side  Explain more about why the attorney general and those around him are upset michael schmidtSo in not reaching a decision on obstruction of justice  Barr has to go out on his own and make that determination without the top cover of the independent investigator who went out and was supposed to make a determination on whether the president broke the law michael barbaroAnd what do you mean by  top cover  michael schmidtOne of the reasons you have a special counsel is to insulate an investigation from politics and then  when the investigation is concluded  have a way of holding up the product of the inquiry  the fruits of it  to the public and saying  look  this was done free of politics  We assessed this matter based on the facts  And now you have a result that is exposed  at least in part  to the perception that the president s guy made the decision michael barbaroThe attorney general michael schmidtCorrect nicholas fandosUndercutting one of the key points of Mueller s appointment in the first place michael barbaroAnd you re saying that the people in the Justice Department and that Barr himself are upset to be put in that position michael schmidtWell  the system s not working the way it s supposed to  You had Mueller there for one reason   yea or nay on crimes  And on one of these central questions  he couldn t get there  And by stepping back and saying  I don t know  it allows at least the Democrats to say  what  How was this decision made  How did they get to this  How is it that the president s political appointee was the ultimate decider nicholas fandosAnd it gives them real credence to go and say  we need to see all the evidence  We need to see the whole file here because the president s handpicked man made this decision  Maybe we d reach a different conclusion if we looked at the evidence  Bob Mueller seems to have michael barbaroSo then why did Barr choose to make a call on obstruction of justice if he knew and was upset that this was going to be seen as hyper political and that it would fan the flames of Democrats in Congress nicholas fandosThe problem for Barr was that when he got the report and looked at the evidence  to him  it was a pretty clear case that you would not press this kind of charge  that the president hadn t obstructed justice  Now  you ve got to remember that Barr comes to the job with a pretty expansive view of executive power  As Democrats made famous  he wrote a memo before he was appointed attorney general arguing that certain acts by the president shouldn t be construed as obstruction of justice  They re part of his executive powers  And so he looked at this and  I mean  he can t make the same decision that Mueller did  Somebody has to make a choice about whether or not this is a chargeable offense  And he looked at it and says  well  in our judgment and this team s judgment  it s not michael barbaroSo Barr reads the report and thinks  what are you talking about it s not clear whether or not there was obstruction of justice  There  in his mind  clearly wasn t nicholas fandosBarr does acknowledge that there is evidence  basically  of behavior that could be construed as obstructive  He gives credence to what Mueller is presenting but says  when you add it all up  it doesn t tip into  michael schmidtCriminality nicholas fandos  criminal obstructive territory michael barbaroRight  And while it felt political for Barr to reach a conclusion  to make a call that Mueller wouldn t  I have to think it would have felt even more political in Barr s mind for Congress to be the one to perform that role  And so he was upset to have to make this call  but  it sounds like  felt that he had to michael schmidtI don t know if he s upset as much as he looks at this situation and says  this is not the way it s supposed to be working  Someone needs to make a decision on whether the president broke the law  I ll step in and do that  And I think I can do that based on the facts nicholas fandosAnd Congress can still play a role  I m redacting the report  I ll give it to you with sensitive information blacked out  And then you can make your own judgment  But the public has an intense interest in this  And I ve got to say something  And I decide whether acts broke the law or not  And I don t think this one did michael barbaroDo we know if Mueller s team expected Barr to make this call on obstruction of justice after they declined to do so nicholas fandosWe don t know precisely what the Mueller team expected on this obstruction question  It seems that they were not clear in communicating to the Justice Department what they wanted  It may not have mattered anyway  But what we do know is that after Barr came out with this four page summary  which essentially exonerated the president on collusion and said he did not break the law on obstruction  some members of Mr  Mueller s team felt that he had inadequately and only partially represented the work of their 22 month investigation michael barbaroSo this is the other side of your reporting   that not only was the Barr side disappointed with the Mueller side  the Mueller side was disappointed with the Barr side nicholas fandosWhat we have learned is that since Barr made his public statement about a week ago  members of the Mueller team have told associates that they feel  essentially  that his work   if it wasn t misrepresentative of theirs   didn t give the full picture  which they believe is more damaging to the president than the attorney general s letter lets on  Now  we are not saying that every member of the Mueller team is frustrated by this  We don t know what Bob Mueller himself thinks  He remains one of the black boxes at the center of this investigation  But there are members of the team who were involved in the decision making around these issues that we ve been talking about who have watched and been disappointed and angry about how it s being characterized michael barbaroAnd what is the focus of their disappointment  to the degree you understand it nicholas fandosSo when they read Bill Barr s concise four page letter  they were frustrated that he had not drawn more from their own work  And in fact  what we discovered in reporting this piece out is that they had prepared summaries of their own work that were part of the report that they handed over to the Justice Department a couple of weeks ago and felt that some of that material could have easily been drawn into what Mr  Barr handed over  So not that he shouldn t have made a decision about whether the president obstructed justice or not in a criminal sense  but that concurrent with that  he should have put out more of their evidence or analysis to fill out the public picture  The Justice Department says those summaries had sensitive information in them  classified information  secretive grand jury information that couldn t become public  and ultimately didn t use any of it michael schmidtSo what Mueller s folks are essentially saying is  hey  we wrote these summaries  If you were going to go out and say something about this investigation  and you were going to do something as extreme or as declarative as clearing the president  why is it that you didn t include some of the things that we found michael barbaroAnd specifically  why didn t you include some stuff that we found that was pretty damning  You re making it seem like the president didn t do anything wrong michael schmidtDonald Trump has come out in the days after Barr s declaration and said the Mueller report was beautiful  And it completely exonerates him  If you re an investigator who spent the last two years looking at Donald Trump  and you think there s a lot of questionable behavior there  that is something that is going to irritate you mightily michael barbaroI mean  do either of you think that the Mueller people have a legitimate point here  Or is this a classic case of pride of authorship  They wanted to see their work in the public summary nicholas fandosI don t think that we fully know  What seems clear in our reporting is that there was no specific communication or agreement by the Mueller team to the Barr team   you should use these things  or we want these things to be out  They seem to have had an intention  And they certainly now have a regret about it  But we don t know what interaction there was in the actual decision making process that happened that weekend two weeks ago michael barbaroWell  so why do we think that Barr chose not to include more of what was in these summaries  especially the negative material  in his four page summary michael schmidtI think there s one big  broad reason and another contemporary reason  the broad reason being that Barr and many Justice Department officials and  for many years  prosecutors believe that if they decide not to charge someone  the fruits of the investigation should not be just thrown out there for the public or for the enemies of the person who were investigated michael barbaroDirty laundry should not be aired if the subject of those dirty laundry are not charged with a crime michael schmidtIf you cannot meet this incredibly high bar of bringing a federal prosecution  that doesn t mean you then get to just take the trash and just throw it out in the street and let the public rummage through it michael barbaroAnd Mike  by the contemporary example you referred to  I m assuming you re talking about James Comey michael schmidtI m talking about the July 2016 press conference that James Comey held  It s right in the heat of the presidential election  He stands up and says  we  the F B I   have done this investigation into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email account  We don t think there is a case to be made here  But we found some very questionable behavior in how she handled sensitive national security secrets  The press conference was seen as very damaging to Clinton even though a case was never made michael barbaroAnd so you re saying that Barr s view would be  I m not going to be the one to replicate that by drawing from these Mueller team summaries and putting those out into the public sphere michael schmidtCorrect  We don t use criminal investigations to go out and find damaging things that may not be crimes that we then simply release to the public to be used against someone nicholas fandosThe problem is  this was never a normal or average criminal investigation  It has broad national security implications  And it has implications for almost every decision that s made at the highest levels of the government michael schmidtThis is more about a pathway of how you deal with the president s conduct  And what it appears from the Mueller side is that they re saying  look  this is the president of the United States  There s some conduct here that we think the public and Congress should see  And O K   Justice Department  it may not be criminal  But this is the president  And this needs to be examined more thoroughly by the political process and by Congress  It s about a pathway of dealing with the president nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr doesn t seem to disagree with that  fundamentally  He said throughout that he wants to make as much of this report public as possible  But he doesn t think that that absolves him of the Justice Department s role of saying whether or not the president or his campaign broke the law  And so he s grappling with the Justice Department s aversion to talk about individuals that it s not saying broke the law  But yet he knows that the public and the Congress want and probably are owed more information about what did happen  And so he s kind of operating somewhere in the middle of those two things michael schmidtThe difference here is that if I was under investigation  and the Justice Department determined that I didn t break the law  then there s no other process that really needs to be dealt with me  Maybe my company needs to decide whether I get fired or not for that conduct  In this instance  there s another issue with the president  O K   the president didn t break the law  But maybe the president did things with his power that the public should know about  Congress should know about  and need to be more closely examined  Because maybe it s not just about breaking the law  It s about how he conducted himself as president  And does Congress need to deal with that  And what we are starting to see from Mueller s side is this frustration that  hey  we think there s some bad stuff that happened here  But by Barr coming out and not disclosing that but saying the president didn t break the law  he is casting the die on how the public will later look at the president s conduct  It will say that for several weeks after we finished our report  the only thing that was out there was Bill Barr saying the president didn t break the law  and the president turning around and saying  I was fully exonerated  And they re saying  hey  America  we think more of this process needs to play out michael barbaroRight michael schmidtSo this all comes down to the vexing question of  how do we investigate a sitting president  And how is that done in a way that the public has the utmost confidence in that  And in that is this tension between how much independence the investigator should have  In Nixon  that pendulum swung too far in the president s direction  In the Starr investigation of Clinton  it went the other way  The investigator had too much power  And here  between Mueller and Barr s teams  they are fighting that same fight and have different understandings of how this should all be dealt with  And it s the same issue that we ve been looking at for 50 years  just the latest episode of it michael barbaroSo inside of one presidential investigation  these two teams are embodying all the tensions that have basically been present since Watergate nicholas fandosCorrect michael schmidtIt s how much you can tell the public  and how is apparent misconduct by the president dealt with  And there s no clear pathway on that  So whatever Barr does will be viewed by one side as political and laying on the brakes for the president  Whatever Mueller does will be viewed by the president s enemies as trying to get him  And the confidence in that process then erodes  And it s messy  And it s hard to figure out  What are the real facts here  What really happened michael barbaroBut at this point  we re just talking about the summary that Bill Barr sent to Congress  We re still waiting on the full report  So won t this tension that you re describing eventually be more or less resolved when we learn how much information we ll ultimately have access to nicholas fandosIt may be  And we may see a very different set of facts at the end of the day  But I think the question here is about who sets the narrative for the intervening period of time  It may end up being a month before we see a fuller version of the Mueller report  And for that time  Bill Barr s conclusion that the president didn t break the law is going to be the dominant narrative  And I think that what we re hearing from members of the Mueller team is a concern that by the time their fuller work does come out  the narrative is baked   so much so that even if it shows  for instance  that the president didn t break the law but abused his office or conducted acts that Congress will deem inappropriate for his office  that there s not room to have a full debate around that  that the conclusions about the work that they did for 22 months will have been prejudged at that point  and that it won t quite matter what the report says for the president s political fate michael barbaroNick  Mike  thank you very much nicholas fandosThank you guys michael schmidtThanks for having us archived recording  jerry nadler The committee has a job to do  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct michael barbaroOn Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the use of subpoenas to obtain a full copy of the Mueller report archived recording  jerry nadler That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence michael barbaroThe committee s chairman  Democratic representative Jerry Nadler of New York  said he would not immediately issue a subpoena  But his power to do so will intensify pressure on the attorney general  William Barr  to quickly release an unredacted copy of the report archived recording  jerry nadler I will give him time to change his mind  But if we cannot reach an accommodation  then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials michael barbaroWe ll be right back  music michael barbaroHere s what else you need to know today  A Times analysis of deadly terror attacks involving white extremists has found that at least a third of them were inspired by fellow white men who carried out similar attacks and had either professed admiration for them or interest in their tactics  In one case  a school shooter in New Mexico corresponded with a gunman who attacked a mall in Munich  All together  the two men killed 11 people  The connections between the killers crossed continents and highlight how the internet and social media have spread white extremism  And  archived recording  joe biden I ve always tried to be   in my career  I ve always tried to make a human connection  That s my responsibility  I think  I shake hands  I hug people  I grab men and women by the shoulders and say  you can do this michael barbaroOn Wednesday  former vice president Joe Biden responded to a series of complaints from women that his close physical contact had made them uncomfortable archived recording  joe biden Our social norms have begun to change  They ve shifted  And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset  And I get it  I get it  I hear what they re saying  I understand it michael barbaroIn a video message sent as Biden prepares for a possible presidential run  he defended his behavior but said he is able to change archived recording  joe biden But I ll always believe governing  quite frankly   life  for that matter   is about connecting michael barbaroThat s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow However  the special counsel s office never asked Mr  Barr to release the summaries soon after he received the report  a person familiar with the investigation said  And the Justice Department quickly determined that the summaries contain sensitive information  like classified material  secret grand jury testimony and information related to current federal investigations that must remain confidential  according to two government officials The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III Mr  Barr was also wary of departing from Justice Department practice not to disclose derogatory details in closing an investigation  according to two government officials familiar with Mr  Barr s thinking  They pointed to the decision by James B  Comey  the former F B I  director  to harshly criticize Hillary Clinton in 2016 while announcing that he was recommending no charges in the inquiry into her email practices The officials and others interviewed declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Mr  Barr explained  although the report is believed to examine Mr  Trump s efforts to thwart the investigation  It was unclear how much discussion Mr  Mueller and his investigators had with senior Justice Department officials about how their findings would be made public  It was also unclear how widespread the vexation is among the special counsel team  which included 19 lawyers  about 40 F B I  agents and other personnel At the same time  Mr  Barr and his advisers have expressed their own frustrations about Mr  Mueller and his team  Mr  Barr and other Justice Department officials believe the special counsel s investigators fell short of their task by declining to decide whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed the inquiry  according to the two government officials  After Mr  Mueller made no judgment on the obstruction matter  Mr  Barr stepped in to declare that he himself had cleared Mr  Trump of wrongdoing Representatives for the Justice Department and the special counsel declined to comment on Wednesday on views inside both Mr  Mueller s office and the Justice Department  They pointed to departmental regulations requiring Mr  Mueller to file a confidential report to the attorney general detailing prosecution decisions and to Mr  Barr s separate vow to send a redacted version of that report to Congress  Under the regulations  Mr  Barr can publicly release as much of the document as he deems appropriate Read Attorney General William Barr s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter  by Attorney General William P  Barr  details the main findings of the special counsel s two year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election A debate over how the special counsel s conclusions are represented has played out in public as well as in recent weeks  with Democrats in Congress accusing Mr  Barr of intervening to color the outcome of the investigation in the president s favor In his letter to Congress outlining the report s chief conclusions  Mr  Barr said that Mr  Mueller found no conspiracy between Mr  Trump s campaign and Russia s 2016 election interference  While Mr  Mueller made no decision on his other main question  whether the president illegally obstructed the inquiry  he explicitly stopped short of exonerating Mr  Trump Mr  Mueller s decision to skip a prosecutorial judgment  leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime   Mr  Barr wrote  He and his deputy  Rod J  Rosenstein  decided that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that Mr  Trump had committed an obstruction offense Mr  Barr has come under criticism for sharing so little  But according to officials familiar with the attorney general s thinking  he and his aides limited the details they revealed because they were worried about wading into political territory  Mr  Barr and his advisers expressed concern that if they included derogatory information about Mr  Trump while clearing him  they would face a storm of criticism like what Mr  Comey endured in the Clinton investigation VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S  Mueller III s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started CreditCreditDoug Mills The New York TimesLegal experts attacked Mr  Comey at the time for violating Justice Department practice to keep confidential any negative information about anyone uncovered during investigations  The practice exists to keep from unfairly sullying people s reputations without giving them a chance to respond in court Mr  Rosenstein cited the handling of the Clinton case in a memo the White House used to rationalize Mr  Trump s firing of Mr  Comey Though it was not clear what findings the special counsel s investigators viewed as troubling for the president  Mr  Barr has suggested that Mr  Mueller may have found evidence of malfeasance in investigating possible obstruction of justice   The report sets out evidence on both sides of the question   Mr  Barr wrote in his March 24 letter Mr  Mueller examined Mr  Trump s attempts to maintain control over the investigation  including his firing of Mr  Comey and his attempt to oust Mr  Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to install a loyalist to oversee the inquiry Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation The fallout from Mr  Barr s letter outlining the Russia investigation s main findings overshadowed his intent to make public as much of the entire report as possible  a goal he has stressed since his confirmation hearing in January  He reiterated to lawmakers on Friday that he wanted both Congress and the public to read the report and said that the department would by mid April furnish a version with sensitive material blacked out  He offered to testify on Capitol Hill soon after turning over the report Mr  Barr  who took office in February  has shown flashes of frustration over how the unveiling of the investigation s findings has unfolded  In his follow up letter to lawmakers on Friday  he chafed at how the news media and some lawmakers had characterized his March 24 letter Mr  Barr and Mr  Mueller have been friends for 30 years  and Mr  Barr said during his confirmation hearing in January that he trusted Mr  Mueller to conduct an impartial investigation  He said he told Mr  Trump that Mr  Mueller was a  straight shooter who should be dealt with as such   Mr  Mueller served as the head of the Justice Department s criminal division when Mr  Barr was attorney general under George Bush  and their families are friends Mr  Barr s promises of transparency have done little to appease Democrats who control the House  The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to let its chairman use a subpoena to try to compel Mr  Barr to hand over a full copy of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence to Congress  The chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York  has not said when he will use the subpoena  but made clear on Wednesday that he did not trust Mr  Barr s characterization of what Mr  Mueller s team found  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct   Mr  Nadler said   That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence  Republicans  who have embraced Mr  Barr s letter clearing Mr  Trump  have accused the Democrats of trying to prolong the cloud over his presidency and urged them to move on Mr  Trump has fully embraced Mr  Barr s version of events  For days  he has pronounced the outcome of the investigation a  complete and total exoneration  and called for the Justice Department and his allies on Capitol Hill to investigate and hold accountable those responsible for opening the inquiry

BRUSSELS   Britain has become more likely in the recent days to crash out of the European Union without a divorce agreement  the bloc s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Tuesday  Over the last days a no deal scenario has become more likely  but we can still hope to avoid it   Barnier said  adding the EU was ready to accept Britain staying the EU s customs union or a relationship akin to the one the EU has with Norway Speaking at an event in Brussels after the British parliament rejected alternatives to Prime Minister Theresa May s divorce deal  Barnier said Britain now had three choices before the April 12 leaving date  The UK should now indicate the way forward or indicate a plan   Barnier said   More today than ever  He said Britain could still accept the stalled deal negotiated by May  reiterating it was  the only way  for Britain to leave the bloc in an orderly way  Other options were the most damaging no deal Brexit  or a long delay of the UK s leaving date  Barnier said  adding the factious UK parliament would hold the responsibility for these Barnier said a long postponement of Brexit would entail organising European Parliament elections in the United Kingdom in May and London naming its representatives for the new European Commission The Frenchman said there was no added value to Brexit and stressed the 27 EU states staying on together were now ready for an abrupt split  Being prepared for no deal doesn t mean that everything will be smooth  There will be disruptions  there will be problems  Being prepared means all unforeseen disruptions could be managed by the EU   Barnier said EU leaders including May meet in Brussels on Apr 10 to decide on next steps   Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska  writing by Jan Strupczewski  

TORONTO   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ousted Canada s former attorney general and another ex minister from the Liberal party caucus Tuesday amid a scandal that has rocked his government in an election year Trudeau cited repeated questioning of his leadership as well as the fact that former attorney general Jody Wilson Raybould publicized a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick  Canada s top civil servant Trudeau called that  unconscionable  Trudeau also ousted Jane Philpott  a former Cabinet minister who stepped down from her role after she said she lost confidence in how the government has handled the affair Both Wilson Raybould and Philpott had remained as members of Trudeau s party in Parliament after resigning from Cabinet but kept making remarks that damaged the prime minister and the party The two were two high profile women ministers in Trudeau s Cabinet  half of which are women  Wilson Raybould was Canada s first indigenous justice minister Trudeau and Liberal lawmakers met Tuesday evening to discuss Wilson Raybould and Philpott Wilson Raybould tweeted that Trudeau had removed her and she will not be a Liberal candidate in the fall election  What I can say is that I hold my head high   that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles   values that must always transcend party   she tweeted   I have no regrets  I spoke truth as I will continue to do  Wilson Raybould believes she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to veterans  affairs minister in January because she didn t give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company accused of bribing officials in Libya That potential solution would avoid a potential criminal conviction that would bar engineering giant SNC Lavalin from receiving any federal government business for a decade  The company is a major employer with 9 000 employees in Canada and more than 50 000 worldwide The scandal has led to multiple resignations  including Gerry Butts  Trudeau s top aide and best friend  And it has damaged the party for eight weeks In a letter released earlier Tuesday  Wilson Raybould pleaded with her colleagues to remain and acknowledged they are enraged but said she was  trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess   Now I know many of you are angry  hurt  and frustrated  And frankly so am I  and I can only speak for myself  I am angry  hurt  and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to   Wilson Raybould wrote to colleagues earlier Tuesday Trudeau has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb  7 via sources that Trudeau s staff put pressure on Wilson Raybould  She denied she was the source of the story  writing  I am not the one who made it public  The secret recording Wilson Raybould made public shows Wernick telling Wilson Raybould that Trudeau  is determined  quite firm  in finding a way to avoid a prosecution that could put 9 000 jobs at risk It also reveals Wilson Raybould saying she regards the pressure as  inappropriate  Philpott said neither she nor Wilson Raybould initiated the crisis now facing Trudeau and the party  Rather than acknowledge the obvious   that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision   and apologize for what occurred  a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious   to attack Jody Wilson Raybould s credibility and attempt to blame her   Philpott said in posting on social media  That approach now appears to be focused on whether Jody Wilson Raybould should have audiotaped the Clerk instead of the circumstances that prompted Jody Wilson Raybould to feel compelled to do so  Wilson Raybould has refused to express support for Trudeau for weeks  a demand many Liberal lawmakers said was necessary if she was to remain in Parliament as part of the party caucusTrudeau said past civil wars within the Liberal party damaged the party  The team has to trust each other  With Jody Wilson Raybould and Jane Philpott that trust has been broken  Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided   Trudeau said to a loud ovation in caucus Nelson Wiseman  a political science professor at the University of Toronto  said Wilson Raybould is angling to eventually replace Trudeau  Her letter  I believe  sets the stage for her run at the Liberal leadership if the Liberals lose in October and Justin Trudeau steps down   Wiseman said  She is a victim of the parliamentary system which in Canada imposes sturdier party discipline than in any of the other Westminster parliamentary systems  The letter reveals her naivet  as a rookie Member of Parliament  about how the system works   

LONDON   Britain s Parliament has spoken   and it has said no  again Lawmakers seeking a way out of the country s Brexit morass on Monday rejected four alternatives to the government s unpopular European Union divorce deal that would have softened or even halted Britain s departure With just 12 days until the U K  must come up with a new plan or crash out of the bloc in chaos  the House of Commons threw out four options designed to replace Prime Minister Theresa May s thrice rejected Brexit deal   though in some cases by a whisker The result leaves May s Conservative government facing difficult and risky choices  It can gamble on a fourth attempt to push May s unloved deal through Parliament  let Britain tumble out of the bloc without a deal  or roll the dice by seeking a snap election to shake up Parliament Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the government would continue to seek support for a  credible  plan for leaving the EU  This House has continuously rejected leaving without a deal just as it has rejected not leaving at all   he told lawmakers in the House of Commons after the votes   Therefore the only option is to find a way through which allows the U K  to leave with a deal  May has summoned her Cabinet for a marathon meeting Tuesday to thrash out the options  The prime minister  who is renowned for her dogged determination  could try to bring her Brexit agreement back for a fourth time later this week Monday s votes revealed a preference among lawmakers for a softer form of Brexit   but not a majority to make it happen The narrowest defeat   276 votes to 273   was for a plan to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU  guaranteeing smooth and tariff free trade in goods  A motion that went further  calling for Britain to stay in the EU s borderless single market for both goods and services  was defeated 282 261 A third proposal calling for any Brexit deal Britain strikes with the EU to be put to a public referendum was defeated 292 280 The fourth  which would let Britain cancel Brexit if it came within two days of crashing out of the bloc without a deal  fell by a wider margin  292 191 May had already ruled out all the ideas under consideration  But the divorce deal she negotiated with the EU has been rejected by Parliament three times  leaving Britain facing a no deal Brexit that could cause turmoil for people and businesses on both sides of the Channel Conservative lawmaker Nick Boles  architect of the single market option  acknowledged he had failed in his attempt to break the deadlock  I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise   Boles added  announcing that he was quitting the Conservatives to sit as an independent in Parliament The April 12 deadline  imposed by the EU  gives Britain s politicians less than two weeks to bridge the hostile divide that separates those in her government who want to sever links with the EU and those who want to keep the ties that have bound Britain to the bloc for almost 50 years Lawmakers have carved out more time on Wednesday for further votes on Brexit options The impasse is raising expectations that lawmakers or the government could try to trigger a snap election in the hope a new configuration in Parliament would break the Brexit logjam  But the Conservatives are worried that could hand power to the opposition Labour Party The lack of consensus reflects a Parliament and a government deeply divided over how   and whether   to leave the EU Justice Secretary David Gauke said leaving the bloc without a deal was  not the responsible thing for a government to do  But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said it would be better than a soft Brexit  I don t have any fear of no deal   she said The Brexit impasse has alarmed businesses  who say the uncertainty has deterred investment and undermined economic growth The chief executive of industrial manufacturer Siemens U K  implored lawmakers to unite around a compromise deal  saying  Brexit is exhausting our business and wrecking the country s tremendous reputation as an economic powerhouse  Juergen Maier urged lawmakers to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU  saying that would allow frictionless trade to continue  In a letter published by the Politico website  Maier said  where the U K  used to be beacon for stability  we are now becoming a laughing stock  EU leaders have called a special summit on April 10 to consider any request from Britain for a delay to Brexit   or to make last minute preparations for Britain s departure without a deal two days later The European Parliament s Brexit coordinator  Guy Verhofstadt  warned that a no deal Brexit was looming unless Britain changed course  The House of Commons again votes against all options   he tweeted   A hard  Brexit becomes nearly inevitable  On Wednesday  the U K  has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss     Associated Press writers Gregory Katz in London and Geir

BRUSSELS   Spain has claimed victory in an argument with Britain over the status of Gibraltar  after the European Parliament passed a law that referred to the peninsula as a  colony of the British Crown  The row may be a foretaste of Britain s diminished heft once it leaves the European Union  which is always likely to take the side of a member against a non member The reference upset London and held up the bill  already approved by the EU executive  which guarantees that Britons will be able to visit the European Union for up to 90 days without visas even if Britain leaves the EU without a deal  as long as Britain reciprocates A Spanish government spokesman said it was  the first time that the European Parliament and the     member states have recognized that Gibraltar is a colony   and  a great step forward for the position and claims made by Spain  Spain ceded the port at the mouth of the Mediterranean to Britain in 1713 after a war  but claims sovereignty over it Gibraltar was a  crown colony  when Britain joined the European bloc in 1973  but London reclassified it as a  British overseas territory  in 2002 Officials say Britain did not object when the European Court of Justice said in rulings in 2006 and 2017 that Gibraltar was  a colony of the British crown  rather than part of the United Kingdom  But London has been irritated by Spain s push to raise the sovereignty dispute in the Brexit process A British spokeswoman said in February that Gibraltar was a  full part of the UK family  and that it was  completely inappropriate  to call it a colony Gibraltarians  whose economy depends on an open border with Spain  voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU in Britain s 2016 referendum  Spain  which is holding national elections on April 28  sees Brexit as a chance to rally the rest of the EU behind its claim to the territory of 33 000 inhabitants It has already secured a right of veto over whether future Brexit arrangements can apply to Gibraltar once Britain has left the EU   Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska in Brussels and Joan Faus in Madrid  Editing by Kevin Liffey

LONDON   After months of tortured debate over Britain s departure from the European Union  a new word has entered the jargon strewn Brexit lexicon   flextension   It could hold the key to the next phase Flextension is how insiders are describing the type of delay to Brexit that Prime Minister Theresa May now seems likely to seek from the bloc  a long extension that could be cut short if Parliament finally approves an exit deal If it sounds dubious  it is nevertheless considered an improvement on an earlier term for the process   terminability  Whatever it is called  analysts are far from sure that Mrs  May will succeed in selling the idea when she meets European Union leaders at a summit in Brussels next Wednesday  And any one of them could veto any extension  leaving Britain facing a disorderly Brexit without an agreement on April 12  a deadline that was already pushed back once On Tuesday  Mrs  May sought to break months of deadlock when she reached out to her adversary  Jeremy Corbyn  leader of the opposition Labour Party  to try to reach agreement  They met on Wednesday and teams from both sides continued the discussions on Thursday  The session ended with no breakthroughs or breakdowns  Prime Minister Theresa May asks the E U  for a Brexit extension until June 30  But with the talks currently grinding on slowly between Britain s two  fractured  main political parties  there is probably not enough time from a practical standpoint to finalize a deal in time   even if the parties could agree on one in the next few days So Mrs  May is now having to contemplate asking for a long Brexit delay  anywhere from nine months to possibly two years  That would mean that Britain takes part in elections to the European Parliament next month  something that Mrs  May insisted she had wanted to avoid  But her government is protectively preparing the paperwork for that vote to go ahead ImageTrucks line up on the main road into the port of Dover  in southern England  slowed by a job action on the French side  Analysts fear similar tie ups if Britain leaves the European Union without an exit deal CreditGareth Fuller Press Association  via Associated PressThat is where flextension comes in  If she could get the bloc to agree to an extension that could be shortened  it would calm the fears of some in her Conservative Party who think Brexit might never happen if there is a long extension But time is short and common ground between the government and the opposition is limited  There are hints that Mrs  May could accept a customs union with Europe that could protect manufacturing companies by ensuring there are no tariffs on imports and exports to continental Europe But there is little sign that she will accept a Labour proposal to remain close to the bloc s single market  That would remove many more barriers in goods and services but would almost certainly involve accepting free movement of people  perhaps the one thing that Mrs  May has vowed to stop as part of Brexit  I can t quite see how they make an agreement  I can see Labour moving to single market membership but I can t see May moving even halfway there   said Simon Tilford  a Europe expert at Chatham House  a research institute in London The alternative to striking a joint deal is to try to persuade Labour to commit to honoring the outcome of a series of votes on different Brexit options in Parliament  But Mr  Corbyn is expected to resist that suggestion  The risk is that we get a pretty hard Brexit out of that and Labour is portrayed as having facilitated it   said Mr  Tilford  something that would appall many of the party s supporters Even if some cross party agreement can be reached  it looks unlikely to be approved by Parliament before Britain s immediate fate is decided at a meeting in Brussels next Wednesday Mrs  May s allies are now talking less about achieving a final agreement by then  and more about being able to show European leaders next week that at least a process is underway to resolve the impasse ImageThe leader of Britain s opposition Labour Party  Jeremy Corbyn  leaves his home in north London on Thursday CreditTolga Akmen Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMrs  May s Brexit deal has been rejected three times by British lawmakers  and there is likely to be a lively debate in Brussels on whether   or more particularly   on what terms to grant a second extension Britain was supposed to leave on March 29 and has already had one postponement  Last month European Union leaders indicated that they would only be open to a second postponement if it were a longer Brexit delay and if Britain takes part in the elections to the European Parliament But several leaders are growing impatient with Britain  and might want to consider another short extension that would force the British Parliament to choose next month between approving Mrs  May s unpopular exit plan  agreeing on something similar or leaving without any agreement The desire to avoid a potentially disastrous no deal exit is one of the few things shared by a majority in Parliament  and on Thursday the House of Lords debated a law that would oblige Mrs  May to request a delay to Brexit The highly unusual legislation was passed by the House of Commons late on Wednesday by a single vote amid protests from those who see it as a power grab by lawmakers With Mrs  May now facing further delay  she is expected to raise the possibility of flextension with Europe s leaders Mr  Tilford expressed doubt that European Union leaders would agree to the idea   I think those that are arguing for a long extension are doing it because they think Britain needs a long time to come to terms with itself   he said  Their idea is not to help May push through a deal that doesn t have the support of Parliament or of the country as a whole   

JERUSALEM   Israel s economy has barely featured in the run up to next week s general election  yet the central bank and many economists warn the new government will need to cut spending and raise taxes to rein in a growing budget deficit The pre election debate has been dominated by security issues and the possible indictments facing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in corruption cases  Opinion polls ahead of the April 9 vote suggest a close race between the premier s right wing Likud party and the centrist Blue and White party  Netanyahu  who has been in office for a decade  has long touted the economic successes of Israel  Indeed growth is robust  unemployment is low  the Israeli high tech sector is second only to Silicon Valley globally and foreign investment is strong  However he and his finance minister  Moshe Kahlon  have cut taxes while spending generously on policies like pay rises for police and subsidies for kindergartens in recent years  leading to a widening budget deficit  Now the Bank of Israel and many economists warn that the economy is set to slow as a result of weaker global growth  which would hit Israeli exports  The central bank  which has started a gradual process of raising interest rates  said the next government would have to cut spending in coming months as well as raise some taxes Analysts expect the spending reductions and tax hikes to reach 10 12 billion shekels   2 8  3 3 billion  to narrow this year s budget gap  The government that will be chosen will have to make fiscal adjustments   said Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron  He added these steps should be taken when the economy was in good shape as they would be tougher to implement if conditions worsened  The grey clouds on the horizon should not be ignored   he said on Sunday  referring to reductions in global growth forecasts A higher budget deficit and public debt reduce the ability of a country to withstand economic shocks  like another financial crisis  and can also threaten its credit rating and borrowing costs  Ratings agencies Fitch and S P said Israel was not at risk of a downgrade in the near term  but also stressed the next government would have to take steps to rein in the deficit  The country s budget deficit is projected by analysts to rise to close to 4 percent of gross domestic product this year   above a target of 2 9 percent  The deficit was 2 9 percent of GDP in 2018  widening to 3 5 percent in the 12 months to February this year  The central bank believes the state must stick to a deficit target of 2 5 percent of GDP  At 3 percent  the public debt burden would rise from a current level of 61 percent to 65 percent of GDP by 2025  or as much as 75 percent should the economy worsen  Yaron warned The finance ministry  which expects a budget deficit of at least 3 5 percent this year  says the situation is being blown out of proportion  noting Israel is one of the only Western countries to have reduced its debt ratio over the past decade  There is a gap of 6 billion shekels that we need to close in a budget of 400 billion shekels     It s not a big problem and certainly not a catastrophe   Shai Babad  the ministry s director general  told Reuters   We are monitoring it  When you have 37 8 Celsius fever you don t go to surgery  By comparison  the U S  deficit is expected to be 5 percent of GDP in 2019  France s deficit 2 8 percent  Spain s 2 3 percent  Britain s 1 7 percent and Germany s 1 5 percent  according to International Monetary Fund estimates  PUT BRAKES ON The next Israeli government is likely to be in place by late May Leader Capital Markets Chief Economist Jonathan Katz said the new administration could implement so called fiscal consolidation measures in two stages   in the middle of this year and then in early 2020  I don t think they will necessarily have to cut immediately the budget by 12 billion shekels and raise taxes  to put the brakes on right away and sharply  I think they have the leeway to do it in two stages   he said   The budget should have been balanced by 2017 when you are at full employment  and this would allow you fiscal tools to expand spending during a slowdown  Finance ministry chief Babad said updated forecasts for state income and expenses would be available in June  when the ministry would determine if action was needed  The 2020 state budget is expected to be ready for a cabinet vote by early August  he added He said if there was an issue with Israel s fiscal policies  global rating agencies would be more concerned Last week  Fitch affirmed its sovereign debt rating of  A   with a  stable  outlook  but believes the new government must take steps to narrow the budget deficit Similarly  Standard   Poor s last year raised its rating to  AA   from  A    also with a stable outlook  It affirmed the rating in February  If the fiscal slippage or relaxation of fiscal performance were to be repeated or happen consistently  we might conclude that there is a shift in the government s fiscal stance   said Karen Vartapetov  a sovereign ratings director at S P   The next government  whatever it might be  will have to take some difficult decisions including potential tax hikes or cost controls  This is for sure     Reporting by Steven Scheer and Tova Cohen  Additional reporting by Jason Lange in Washington  Editing by Pravin Char  

Hundreds of ads on Facebook promised U S  homeowners that they were eligible for huge state tax breaks if they installed new solar energy panels  There was just one catch  None of it was true The scam ads used photos of nearly every U S  governor   and sometimes President Donald Trump   to claim that with new  lucrative tax incentives  people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes  Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses  email  utility information and phone number to find out more Those incentives don t exist While the ads didn t aim to bilk people of money directly   and it wasn t possible to buy solar panels through these ads   they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come ons  both scammy and legitimate  It s not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner Facebook apparently didn t take action until notified by state government officials who noticed the ads The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months  undetected  They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads  especially as the 2020 elections   and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation   loom  This is definitely concerning   definitely  it s misinformation   said Young Mie Kim  a University of Wisconsin Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections   I keep telling people  We don t have any basis to regulate such a thing  Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms Last year  Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs  including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience  But it didn t make that information available for other ads until Thursday  when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads  Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets  Google has an archive for political ads only The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester  One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won t see them  That allows people to do more dirty tricks   said Ian Vanderwalker  senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice s Democracy Program In mid March  some websites linked in the fake solar energy ads disappeared  After complaints from governors  offices  Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them  These scammy ads have no place on Facebook   company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement   We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action  Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images  text  targeting and position of ads posted to its site  In some cases  employees review the ads  Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies Governors  offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as  you can get paid to go solar  Helen Kalla  a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov  Steve Sisolak  said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them Facebook took them down days later  although some continued to re appear days after that complaint  Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas  Illinois  Colorado  Arizona  South Carolina and other states  But the ads had already been running for some time After researching solar panel options for his two story home in Mount Tabor  New Jersey  37 year old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for  free  solar panels because Gov  Phil Murphy planned to release   100 million solar incentives   He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives  but worried others might not be  It s very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people   Fitzpatrick said The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar energy websites that listed the same business address   a mailbox in Carlsbad  California   that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission  the government s consumer protection agency  In 2012  the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company   then called Coleadium  also known as Ads 4 Dough   for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products  according to court records Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a  1 million fine  Akatiff changed his company s name to A4D Inc  in 2015  according to California business filings Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business Though the FTC can investigate fake ads  sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims  thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily  making it harder to catch suspect advertisers Scam ads are popular in certain industries  such as insurance or solar power  where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services  said Peter Marinello  vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers  Marinello said   That s how this whole process plays out     Associated Press investigative researcher

KIEV   A comedian with no political experience took a commanding lead in the first round of Ukraine s presidential election  offering a fresh face to voters fed up with corruption in a country on the front line of the West s standoff with Russia  With 94 percent of votes counted late on Monday  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  a 41 year old comic who plays a teacher turned president in a popular TV series  had won 30 percent President Petro Poroshenko was trailing in a distant second with just under 16 percent  a hole that may be too deep to climb out from  He faced a public furious at his failure to stamp out corruption or improve living standards five years after a pro Russian leader was swept out by a popular revolt In a field of 39 candidates  former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko placed third with 13 percent That leaves Zelenskiy and Poroshenko set to face each other in a run off in three weeks In a cheerful victory speech on Sunday night  Zelenskiy provided little insight into what he would do if he wins  I would like to say  thank you  to all the Ukrainians who did not vote just for fun   Zelenskiy told cheering supporters   It is only the beginning  we will not relax  In keeping with a laid back campaign that blurred the line between fiction and reality  his election night venue provided a bar with free alcohol and table football Poroshenko  53  attacked Zelenskiy as fundamentally unserious  a reckless choice at a time when the country still faces a conflict against Russian backed separatists President Vladimir Putin  dreams of a soft  pliant  tender  giggling  inexperienced  weak  ideologically amorphous and politically undecided president of Ukraine  Are we really going to give him that opportunity   Poroshenko said But analysts said it would be tough for Poroshenko  a confectionary billionaire  to fight back to win the second round   I find it hard to imagine how a gap that wide could be closed   said Serhiy Fursa  a Kiev based investment banker at Dragon Capital Two women in Kiev who had backed defeated candidates said they were now likely to vote for Zelenskiy  Only thanks to the fact that I loathe Poroshenko  and am tired of Tymoshenko    In my opinion it s a protest against the old guys  and I m tired of them too   Natalia  70  said  Natalia said she was worried about Zelenskiy s lack of experience in politics but was hopeful because  he s smart  he s young  and his father is a lawyer   he will help him  Kristina  27  said she was concerned the TV star  had no strategic program  no clear answers  not on the economy   but she would now vote for him   He is the lesser of two evils   WHAT TO EXPECT Zelenskiy s advisers were predicting he would win the lion s share of votes from the other defeated candidates  who campaigned against the status quo  If we believe the research done before the first round  then there will be big outflows  to Zelenskiy  from everyone   said Dmytro Razumkov  Zelenskiy s political adviser In a country dependent on foreign loans  economists are trying to figure out whether Zelenskiy would stick to reforms and fiscal policies demanded by the International Monetary Fund  We would expect Zelenskiy to be put under greater pressure in the run up to the second round to flesh out his policy agenda   said Stuart Culverhouse  head of sovereign and fixed income research at investment bank Exotix Poroshenko has tried to integrate the country with the European Union and NATO while strengthening the military More than 13 000 people have died in the conflict against separatists and Ukraine has lost control of parts of its industrial heartland  Major combat ended with a ceasefire in 2015 but deadly clashes still take place regularly Crimea has been annexed by Russia in a move that triggered international financial sanctions on Moscow  and Poroshenko has campaigned hard to keep the pressure on Russia But public opinion has turned firmly against the political establishment  Voters say politicians failed to deliver on expectations of honest government  despite the sacrifices made during the revolt that overthrew pro Russian leader Viktor Yanukovich and the years of hardship and war that followed  Just 9 percent of Ukrainians have confidence in their national government  the lowest of any electorate in the world  a Gallup poll published in March showed Zelenskiy tapped into this anti establishment mood with a campaign packed with jokes  sketches and song and dance routines that poked fun at his political rivals  One supporter in Kiev said corruption was the main issue for him  and he trusted in Zelenskiy s abilities as a manager and that he would put together a good leadership team   I work for a government agency and I know first hand how easy it is to steal a few million   said the 27 year old who declined to give his name   You can steal freely until someone notices    Reporting by Matthias Williams  Natalia Zinets  Pavel Polityuk and Polina Ivanova in KIEV  Tom

that the two countries were headed toward an agreement that might be  the biggest deal ever made    But there was no announcement  as had been hinted  of a meeting with President Xi Jinping  U S

bloodiest ImageStockades in which some of the leaders of the Taiping Rebellion were beheaded in 1863 CreditHulton Archive  via Getty ImagesThe mass internments in Xinjiang reflect the leadership s view that the religion and culture of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are widely  infected  by antigovernment sentiments that could foment unrest and terrorism Uighurs   a Turkic people   have had an uneasy  sometimes violent  relationship with the Chinese Communist authorities since 1949 In the 1980s and 1990s  the government allowed more space for the Uighurs  language and customs  But

be a central theme in the 2020 elections  after Mr  Trump said Republicans would not produce a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act before then Mr  Trump s reversal followed a warning from Senator Mitch McConnell  who said on Tuesday   I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans  view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives  Catch up  A previous Republican effort to replace President Barack Obama s health care law failed in 2017  but Mr  Trump revived the issue last week  promising a Republican replacement after his administration

was involved in the case told our reporters   The discovery well was worthless  Why it matters  One dry hole doesn t mean there s no oil  but discouraging results could embolden opponents of drilling

BOGOTA   Colombia on Tuesday rejected a Russian warning against foreign military intervention in Venezuela and said it supported a peaceful transition to democracy in the neighboring South American country  Colombia reiterates that the transition to democracy must be conducted by the Venezuelans themselves peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution and international law  supported by political and diplomatic means  without the use of force   Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said in a statement  He was responding to a March 28 letter from the upper house of Russia s parliament  forwarded to Colombia s Congress by Russian Ambassador Sergei Koshkin  that said the  illegitimate use of military force against Venezuela by other states that support the opposition will be interpreted     as an act of aggression against a sovereign state  Russia has emerged as a staunch backer of Venezuela s leftist President Nicolas Maduro as his nation descended into political turmoil this year  The United States and dozens of other nations have backed opposition leader Juan Guaido  who invoked the constitution to assume Venezuela s interim presidency in January  arguing that Maduro s 2018 re election was illegitimate Colombia  which supports Guaido  has repeatedly denied it has any intention of launching a military offensive across its border with Venezuela But in his statement on Tuesday  Trujillo said military support for Maduro s socialist government risked harming the transition to democracy while threatening regional peace and security The March touchdown near Caracas of two Russian air force planes carrying some 100 Russian special forces and cyber security personnel has raised international concerns about Moscow s backing for Maduro Russia  which has supplied fighter jets  tanks  and air defense systems to Venezuela  has dismissed U S  criticism of its military cooperation with Caracas saying it is not interfering in the Latin American country s internal affairs and poses no threat to regional stability Colombia acted as a staging ground in February as the United States and other countries supported Guaido s effort to transport hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid into Venezuela  Maduro  who dismisses Guaido as a U S  puppet  blocked the aid and Venezuelan troops pushed back protesters with tear gas  Millions of Venezuelans have fled to Colombia to escape widespread food and medicine shortages in their chaotic homeland  seeking jobs locally and passage into other Latin American countries   Reporting by Helen Murphy  Editing by Julia Symmes Cobb and Tom Brown  

KUALA LUMPUR  Malaysia   Najib Razak  the former prime minister who sat at the pinnacle of a political machine that dominated Malaysia for more than 60 years  on Wednesday began to face the first of multiple corruption trials stemming from the disappearance of billions in public funds The allegations of graft at 1Malaysia Development Berhad  or 1MDB  the state owned investment fund he founded  led to widespread public anger and to Mr  Najib s electoral defeat last year  The upheaval reoriented Malaysian politics and left the former leader  who was once considered untouchable  facing the prospect of decades in prison  This is a sea change for Malaysian politics for the very simple reason that for the first time a former head of government has been charged with corruption   said James Chin  director of Asia Institute Tasmania at the University of Tasmania Mr  Najib  65  went on trial in Kuala Lumpur  the capital  as part of one of the biggest corruption cases in history to go to court  He faces dozens of charges over allegations of graft at 1MDB  which lost  4 5 billion that prosecutors in Malaysia and the United States say was funneled to his circle  including  731 million that went into his own bank accounts The scandal has tarnished the reputation and economy of Malaysia s government  which has long prided itself as being a thriving leader within Southeast Asia  Now  it is facing a  250 billion national debt that ballooned in part because of 1MDB s heavy borrowing Mr  Najib s first trial  which began on the 10th anniversary of the day he was sworn in as prime minister  will cover a sliver of the accusations of wrongdoing  He will face seven charges of criminal breach of trust  abuse of power and money laundering involving  10 million that prosecutors say was transferred from SRC International  formerly a 1MDB subsidiary  into Mr  Najib s accounts The trial had been delayed for months  and on Wednesday Mr  Najib s lawyers unsuccessfully sought another pause Tommy Thomas  the attorney general of Malaysia  told the court that Mr  Najib had once  wielded near absolute power   noting that it was the first time a former prime minister had faced trial in Malaysia  The accused is not above the law  and his prosecution and this trial should serve as precedents for all future holders of this august office   Mr  Thomas said Initially quiet after his electoral defeat  Mr  Najib has been increasingly vocal on social media  professing his innocence and criticizing the governing coalition His wife  Rosmah Mansor  who is well known for her taste in luxury items like designer pursues and multimillion dollar pieces of jewelry  is facing 17 counts of money laundering and tax evasion  She has pleaded not guilty The purported mastermind of the schemes  the Malaysian financier Jho Low  faces charges in Malaysia and the United States  but he remains at large and is believed to be in China  His representatives have said that he denies wrongdoing and they call the case against him politically motivated Prosecutors have outlined a staggering list of things the money was spent on  a  250 million yacht named Equanimity  works of art by Monet and van Gogh  properties in California  London and New York  jewelry  including a 22 carat pink necklace worth  27 3 million  the production of Hollywood films and a see through piano Mr  Low gave to the Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr  Ms  Kerr has surrendered jewelry given by Mr  Low and has offered to give up the piano  but it was walled into her Malibu  Calif   home  complicating removal  The Malaysian government announced Wednesday that it sold the yacht  which was seized in Indonesia last year  for  126 million to Genting Malaysia  a casino and resort company Last year  the Malaysian authorities said they seized jewelry  purses and other valuables worth at least  273 million and cash worth  30 million from properties owned by Mr  Najib and Ms  Rosmah  Counting the cash alone required 22 officials using six bill counting machines over three days Malaysia has also filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs  accusing the Wall Street bank of making false and misleading statements and defrauding investors by raising more than  6 billion for 1MDB  The bank apologized for the role of a former partner who pleaded guilty to charges in the United States and it has sought to distance itself from the scandal The 1MDB case  as well as concerns about debt to China that piled up at a staggering rate under Mr  Najib s rule  has been a rallying point for the administration of Mahathir Mohamad  the 93 year old former mentor and ally of Mr  Najib who returned to the prime minister s post last year vowing to clean up the mess But some of the shine has already come off Mr  Mahathir s administration  which brought together an unlikely and potentially unruly collection of political blocs with little in common Mr  Mahathir has faced criticism over Malaysia s rising cost of living  and he has been pressured to speed up plans to let Anwar Ibrahim  a former opposition leader who was released from prison last year  succeed him Mr  Najib s first trial was scheduled to begin in February  but was delayed by a series of legal moves by his defense In recent months he has become a more vocal presence  campaigning in support of his party s candidate in a March special election  crooning in a cover of a 1970s R B song and embracing the nickname  bossku   or my boss  given by his supporters The candidate from United Malays National Organization  Mr  Najib s party  won the special election  taking a seat from the ruling coalition  which was seen as a sign of bubbling discontent with Mr  Mahathir s government Mr  Chin said he believed Mr  Najib s public relations efforts were based on the belief that if his party were to return to power  he could receive a royal pardon  He truly believes he will get away with it   Mr  Chin said  

LONDON   Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday she would seek another Brexit delay to agree an EU divorce deal with the opposition Labour leader  a last ditch gambit to break an impasse over Britain s departure that enraged many in her party Nearly three years since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a shock referendum result  it is still unclear how  when or if it will ever indeed quit the European club it first joined in 1973 In a hastily arranged statement from her Downing Street office after spending seven hours chairing cabinet meetings on how to plot a way out of the Brexit maze  May said she was seeking another short extension to Brexit beyond April 12 Her move offers the prospect of keeping the United Kingdom in a much closer economic relationship with the EU after Brexit   though it could also rip her Conservative Party apart as half her lawmakers want a decisive split from the bloc  I am offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan   that we would both stick to   to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal   she said  We will need a further extension of Article 50  divorce notification   one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal  We need to be clear what such an extension is for   to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way  Corbyn said he would be  very happy  to meet May and that he would set no limits ahead of the talks  while reiterating that his party aimed to keep a customs union with the EU  access for Britain to its single market and protections for workers He added that he would hold a vote of no confidence in the government in reserve if any eventual accord still failed to achieve majority support in a deeply split British parliament Germany and France called for more clarity from London  warning that without a clear sense of what Britain wanted it could be heading towards a disorderly Brexit within days  The EU s Donald Tusk called for patience with London MAY S GAMBLE INFURIATES PARTY EUROSCEPTICSKeeping Britain closely tied to the EU after Brexit is anathema to much of the Conservative Party  Many Brexit backing Conservatives were livid at May over her overture to Corbyn  This is a deeply unsatisfactory approach  it is not in the interests of the country  it fails to deliver on the referendum result and history doesn t bode well for it   Jacob Rees Mogg  a prominent Brexiteer  told reporters following a meeting of the party s hardline eurosceptic parliamentary group Boris Johnson  the face of the 2016 Brexit campaign  said a compromise with Labour would betray the referendum  asserting that the world s fifth biggest economy could be outside the EU but still subject to EU rules   Brexit is becoming soft to the point of disintegration   said Johnson  who resigned as foreign minister last July  Still  May faced no immediate resignations from her senior team  Prominent Brexit supporters in May s cabinet  such as Michael Gove  defended her plan in public after a marathon meeting at which ministers haggled for hours over coffee and sandwiches  They finished with Chilean red wine  Any plan  May said  would have to include the current Withdrawal Agreement that she agreed with the EU in November and which the bloc says it will not reopen May last week offered to quit if parliament approved her deal but lawmakers defeated it a third time on Friday  the very day Britain had been due to leave the EU  Brexiteers say her deal would trap Britain in the EU s orbit indefinitely but pro EU opposition parties say her proposed break would isolate Britain and cause lasting economic damage Lawmakers failed on Monday to find a majority of their own for any alternative plan ranging from a permanent customs union to a confirmatory referendum on any deal and a revocation of the divorce papers to avoid a no deal crash out NEW OPTIONS FOR PARLIAMENT May said that if she could not agree a unified approach with Corbyn  a veteran socialist who voted against joining the bloc in 1975  then the government would come up with a number of options on the future relationship with the EU Then  she said  the government would put them before the House of Commons in a series of votes  Crucially  the government stands ready to abide by the decision of the house   May said Her move could cleave apart her Conservatives  who have been grappling with an internal schism over Europe for the past three decades  Over half of her lawmakers voted last week to go for a no deal Brexit  much to the alarm of British business  It seems to me that she wants to rely upon Labour votes to get this extension through   David Jones  a Brexit supporting former Conservative minister  told Reuters   If she does that  then she is putting the future of the party in peril  May said she wanted the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to be passed before May 22 so that the United Kingdom did not have to take part in elections that month to the European Parliament Her spokesman said it was possible to cancel participation in the European elections right up to the day of the vote The impasse has already delayed Brexit for at least two weeks beyond the planned departure date of March 29 to 2200 GMT on April 12  This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands   May said   But we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for    Additional reporting by Jan Strupczewski in Brussels  Andreas Rinke and Michelle Martin in Berlin  Kylie MacLellan  Alistair Smout

KIEV   Comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy is leading the race to become Ukraine s next president thanks to an insurgent campaign that rails against corrupt politicians influenced by rich oligarchs Yet it is his own relationship with one of the country s wealthiest tycoons that could prove an Achilles  heel One of Ukraine s most popular TV channels 1 1  owned by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky  has given Zelenskiy a powerful platform in recent months during his meteoric rise to the brink of the presidency On Saturday  a day before Zelenskiy won the first round of the presidential contest and set up a run off with the incumbent Petro Poroshenko  1 1 filled its schedule with back to back shows by the comedian and actor The fact that Zelenskiy is a major star on the channel has stoked worries among some investors and voters  and accusations from his political opponents  that he is in the pocket of Kolomoisky  Both Zelenskiy and Kolomoisky say their relationship is strictly professional  and centered on the comedian s TV work  Both say no undue influence is being exerted by the oligarch  whose businesses range from banking and energy to aviation  I m more his puppet than he is mine   Kolomoisky said last year   It is impossible to influence me   Zelenskiy told the news website Gordon in December   Neither Kolomoisky  nor any other oligarch  no one will influence me   Zelenskiy said last month he was in the process of exiting all his businesses  which includes the production company whose shows run on 1 1  Asked whether the relationship was a weak spot for him  Zelenskiy told Reuters   We are working according to TV contracts and it is fine  It is business  However President Poroshenko has sought to make political capital out of the connection between the two men as he fights to make up ground to the comedian before the run off vote on April 21   In the past few weeks my opponents have poured on me rivers of shameless lies  The main source of these lies in recent months   deplorable as it may be   has been 1 1  1 1 has turned into the obedient implementer of the political assignments of its owner   Poroshenko said   Though the latter may have fled abroad  he still plays the pre election political chessboard  sometimes moving the Ze  Zelenskiy  pieces  sometimes the Yu  former prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko  pieces  Kolomoisky is motivated by a desire for revenge against the state   he wrote on Twitter Kolomoisky has lived abroad since clashing with Poroshenko over Ukraine s largest bank  which he used to own  In a November interview to Ukrainian news site lb ua  he worried Ukraine s judicial system would stop him from leaving the country if he came back  Zelenskiy announced he was running for president on December 31 on 1 1  upstaging Poroshenko  who was giving a traditional New Year s Eve address to the nation at the same time On Saturday  the channel s Zelenskiy themed schedule included shows where he and fellow actors performed jokes  sketches and songs  and a documentary voiced by Zelenskiy about Ronald Reagan  a popular actor who became U S  president  Poroshenko is part of the same wealthy elite as Kolomoisky  having made a fortune from confectionery that earned him the sobriquet of  Chocolate King    The strategic dilemma will be what do you prefer  an oligarch or someone possibly controlled by an oligarch  the puppet or a puppeteer   said regional analyst and political consultant Radu Magdin   AM I THAT CRAZY  Kolomoisky makes no secret of his dislike for Poroshenko  and the two have clashed repeatedly over issues that threatened Kolomoisky s businesses  No hard evidence has been presented by any of Zelenskiy s opponents that Kolomoisky is indeed pulling the strings behind the campaign But the ties between the two men have led some political analysts and Western diplomats to question how zealously Zelenskiy would try to implement reforms needed to speed up economic growth and keep foreign aid flowing if they clashed with Kolomoisky s interests  In particular  the relationship puts the spotlight on the fate of PrivatBank  Ukraine s largest lender  which the government wrested from Kolomoisky in 2016 in a clean up of the banking system under an International Monetary Fund bailout program The government pumped billions of dollars into shoring up PrivatBank s finances  saying money had been fraudulently siphoned off from the lender while Kolomoisky owned it  Kolomoisky denied any wrongdoing and has challenged the nationalization in court Asked if there were concerns about Zelenskiy s ties to Kolomoisky  Edwin Gutierrez  head of Emerging Market Sovereign Debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments  said   That is there  but at the end of the day the oligarchs always rule the roost in Ukraine    Maybe this will be another Yanukovich moment where everyone gets excited but then in the end Ukraine disappoints   he added  referring to former President Viktor Yanukovich  who fled to Russia after the 2014 Maidan street protests  Asked in a Reuters interview whether he would hand PrivatBank back to Kolomoisky if elected  Zelenskiy said in February   Am I that crazy  Do I want to lose my life  reputation  Accusations from Poroshenko and his allies that Zelenskiy is being controlled by an oligarch has lent an ironic twist to the presidential race  Zelenskiy s campaign has been propelled by his TV show  Servant of the People  where he plays a scrupulously honest history schoolteacher who becomes president by accident  He challenges the old way of doing things  outwitting shadowy oligarchs and corrupt politicians  The series blurs the line between fiction and reality  between the make believe president and the real life challenger  In the first scene of the first series  three shadowy power brokers are surveying Kiev s Maidan square from a rooftop balcony at night while sipping drinks and talking about how they spend money to bring their puppet politicians to power  It s one week before the election  We worked hard for our candidates  They re almost neck and neck  now let the best man win   says one   What good will that bring me   asks another

WASHINGTON   As he threatens to shut down the southern border  President Donald Trump is considering bringing on a  border  or  immigration czar  to coordinate immigration policy across various federal agencies  according to four people familiar with the discussions Trump is weighing at least two potential candidates for the post  former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli  according to the people  who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversations publicly Kobach and Cuccinelli are far right conservatives with strong views on immigration  Cuccinelli was seen at the White House on Monday The planning comes as Trump is threatening anew to close the U S  Mexico border as soon as this week if Mexico does not completely halt illegal immigration into the U S  And it serves as the latest sign that the president plans to continue to hammer his hardline immigration rhetoric and policies as he moves past the special counsel s Russia investigation and works to rally his base heading into his 2020 re election campaign Aides hope the potential appointment  which they caution is still in the planning stages  would serve as the  face  of the administration on immigration issues and would placate both the president and his supporters  showing he is serious and taking action White House press aides  Kobach and Cuccinelli did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment  Kobach previously served as vice chair of the president s short lived election fraud commission  which was disbanded after finding little evidence of widespread abuse A Department of Homeland Security official noted that White House czars have been appointed in the past when there has been an  urgent need  for sustained  inter agency policy coordination  While Homeland Security often plays a leading role when it comes to immigration policy and enforcement  the department is not in charge of officials at the departments of Health and Human Services  State  Defense and Justice  which often play key roles Trump has often complained  both publicly and privately  about how he has not been able to do more to stop the tide of illegal immigration  which he has likened to an  invasion  and described as a national security crisis  Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100 000 arrests or denials of entry in March  More than half of those are families with children Still  Trump has been pushing  He has deployed National Guard troops to the border  forced a government shutdown to try to pressure Congress to provide more money for his long promised border wall  and eventually signed an emergency declaration to circumvent lawmakers  He also moved Saturday to cut direct aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras  where citizens are fleeing north and overwhelming U S  resources at the southern border Those moves have involved a swath of government agencies  The Justice Department manages the immigration courts that decide whether a migrant is deported  Health and Human Services manages the care of migrant children apprehended at the border  agencies within Homeland Security manage the allocation of legal status  immigration enforcement and asylum requests  and the Pentagon and the Army Corps of Engineers manage facets of border wall construction But not all are always on the same page Earlier this year  for example  Health and Human Services closed down a temporary facility being used to house migrant children in Tornillo  Texas  creating a problem for border agents who ran out of bed space when the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border spiked  Homeland Security is not allowed to hold children in detention facilities for longer than 20 days And last year  former Attorney General Jeff Sessions instituted a  zero tolerance  policy at the border without consulting others  causing a spike in the number of migrant children separated from their families The separated children were placed in HHS custody  but there was no tracking system in place to link parents with their children until a federal judge ordered one  causing widespread fear and concern about whether families would ever see each other again It has yet to be decided whether the czar position would be housed within Homeland Security or within the White House  which would not require Senate confirmation A person positioned within the White House could coordinate immigration policy across various agencies  working closely with aides who are deeply involved in the issue  including senior advisers Stephen Miller and Jared Kushner  national security adviser John Bolton and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  who supports the idea Appointing a person based within Homeland Security could be trickier because the department s agency heads are all Senate confirmed positions and  in the case of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U S  Customs and Border Protection  are longtime immigration officials with decades of experience dealing with the border While immigration officials would welcome an adviser focused specifically on policy across the varying agencies  the names being floated are likely to spark backlash and criticism Kobach  an immigration hardliner  ran a failed bid for governor promising to drive immigrants living in the U S  illegally out of the country  He has recently been working for a nonprofit corporation  WeBuildtheWall Inc   which has been raising private money to build Trump s wall Cuccinelli has advocated for denying citizenship to American born children of parents living in the U S  illegally  limiting in state tuition at public universities only to those who are citizens or legal residents  and allowing workers to file lawsuits when an employer knowingly hires someone living in the country illegally for taking a job from a  law abiding competitor  Thomas Homan  the former acting ICE director  has also been mentioned as a potential pick  according to one of the people familiar with the talks     

LONDON   Britain s Parliament on Monday failed to reach a majority on any one of four new proposals for the country s exit from the European Union  worsening the disarray over Brexit less than two weeks before the deadline to depart The votes on Monday were part of a remarkable power grab by lawmakers  frustrated by Prime Minister Theresa May s failure to forge consensus around Brexit  as the process of extricating Britain from the European Union is known  and alarmed that the country could face a disorderly  economically damaging departure without any kind of deal by the deadline of April 12 In the votes  which were nonbinding  lawmakers considered four plans  The failure to agree on any of them means Britain is facing the deadline with nothing resolved and all the options remaining on the table It also underscores the stalemate in Parliament where different factions appear unable to compromise enough to swing behind any one vision for Brexit ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain listening as the opposition leader  Jeremy Corbyn  spoke in the House of Commons in London on Monday CreditUK Parliamentary Recording Unit  via Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesSomething will have to give soon  however  By April 10  Mrs  May needs to get a Brexit agreement through Parliament or ask the leaders of the European Union for a longer delay if she wants to avoid leaving without a deal The plan that lost most narrowly was for a customs union that would keep Britain in the same tariff system as the rest of the European Union countries  tying the country closely to the bloc  It failed 276 273 Mrs  May s own plan would be a starker separation  It would keep Britain in the European Union customs and trading system until at least the end of 2020  but eventually would have the country leave the customs union and single market  and assert control over immigration from continental Europe Mrs  May will hold a cabinet meeting on Tuesday to discuss the next steps  She is likely to seek another vote to pass her plan later this week   possibly on Wednesday   if the Speaker of the House of Commons  John Bercow  permits it But Parliament has rejected her plan three times   resoundingly  And Mr  Bercow has already warned Mrs  May against bringing back a proposition that has been rejected What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union Parliament is expected to debate Brexit again on Wednesday  and it remained unclear whether lawmakers would continue to try to again wrest control from Mrs  May  and make another effort to garner support for any other alternative Jeremy Corbyn  leader of the opposition Labour Party said that  the margin of defeat for one of the options tonight was very narrow indeed and the prime minister s deal has been rejected by very large majorities on three occasions   If it is good enough for the prime minister to have three chances at her deal then I suggest that possibly the House should have a chance to consider again the options that we had before us today  in a debate on Wednesday  so that the House can succeed where the prime minister has failed  After Monday s votes  a lawmaker who tried to forge one of the compromise plans  Nick Boles  said he was resigning from the Conservative Party  because  he said  it  has shown itself to be incapable of compromise  Mr  Boles said he would remain in Parliament as an independent If Mrs  May s plan does not get another vote  she could try to pursue an exit without any agreement  But that would split her cabinet  and some members might resign  Also  Parliament has indicated that it does not support an exit without a deal ImageThe Conservative chief whip of the House of Commons  Julian Smith  arriving at the prime minister s residence last week CreditMatt Dunham Associated PressMrs  May could ask the European Union for another delay but then she would have to agree that Britain take part in European elections  which she has said would be wrong given the 2016 referendum vote by Britons to leave the bloc The other alternative would be to press for a general election  But that would raise the question of who would lead her Conservative Party  given that Mrs  May is widely unpopular and an ineffective campaigner  She promised last week to step aside as prime minister if pro Brexit Tory lawmakers supported her deal Mrs  May s cabinet is now at war  a fact conceded by Julian Smith  the chief whip and responsible for winning votes in Parliament  who told the BBC that Brexit had produced the  worst example of ill discipline in cabinet in British political history  Around 170 Conservative lawmakers have signed a letter to the prime minister insisting that Britain should leave the European Union on April 12  with or without an agreement Still  Mrs  May s thrice rejected deal is not dead yet Last week she managed to win over some pro Brexit supporters  like the former foreign secretary  Boris Johnson  who supported her plan on Friday despite having criticized it for months  calling it a straitjacket  among other things ImageMrs

was  coming onto the table   if all else fails on Brexit Mrs  May is still hoping to win over 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party  which normally supports the government but opposes Mrs  May s Brexit deal The D U P  worries that provisions to keep open the Irish border could mean that Northern Ireland has to obey more European Union rules than the rest of the United Kingdom  effectively changing its constitutional status On Monday one D U P  lawmaker  Sammy Wilson  said Mrs  May could bring her deal back to Parliament  a thousand times   and his party would still vote against it The other plans that Parliament considered on Monday were  one to keep Britain in both the customs union and Europe s single market  another to put any Brexit plan to a referendum  and the option of canceling Brexit altogether if nothing is agreed by April 12 The plan for the customs union and single market failed 282 261  the plan for a second referendum failed 292 280  the plan

BEIRUT   A committee of Lebanese government ministers have agreed most details of a plan to address the country s ruinous electricity crisis  and will present it to the cabinet on Monday  one of the participants said on Thursday  The decades old electricity crisis has pushed Lebanon to the brink of financial disaster  with power cuts hobbling the economy and subsidies helping to rack up public debt equivalent to 150 percent of gross domestic product  GDP  The plan includes increasing generation capacity  reducing losses in transmission and eventually raising consumer electricity tariffs  officials have previously said   The committee has finished its work and will raise its proposals at the cabinet next week to approve the plan and approve the outstanding points   the minister told Reuters  Once agreed by cabinet  the plan must still be approved by parliament  Energy sector activists in Lebanon have warned that implementing a plan may prove harder than agreeing to one  Consumer electricity prices have not risen since 1996 and most power is produced using old  inefficient turbines that run on very expensive fuel oil  Even at the very cheap rates power is sold at  state utility Electricite du Liban  EdL  only collects payment for about half the power it produces because of losses in the transmission system and unregulated connections to the grid  The big difference between the cost of production and money that EdL collects  approximately  1 billion 1 5 billion a year  is made up by the government  mostly through deficit spending Since the government cannot afford to supply 24 hour electricity on this basis  it enforces daily power cuts leaving consumers to pay for expensive secondary supply from local generator companies  The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have both told Lebanon that reforming the sector should be its priority in lifting one of the world s heaviest public debt burdens  The bank and other international lenders last year pledged  11 billion in soft loans and aid to help improve Lebanese infrastructure  but the money is conditional on painful reforms  Prime Minister Saad al Hariri has promised to reduce the state deficit as a proportion of GDP by 5 percent in five years  However  reforms have been delayed over the past year because of the extended negotiations to form the coalition government  lasting from elections in May until the end of January    Reporting By Angus McDowall and Laila Bassam  Editing by William Maclean  

WASHINGTON   For Donald Trump  the rigid rules of golf are flexible  allowing for the kick of a wayward ball into a better location  skipping a putt that looks close enough  What s the big deal That is according to Rick Reilly  a former Sports Illustrated columnist who has just written the book  Commander in Cheat   which alleges Trump is guilty of all sorts of sins on the golf course In an interview with Reuters on Thursday  Reilly laid out a number of accusations to support his view that the U S  president s golf game is  well  not par for the course  particularly for a president who owns a string of golf resorts Among the charges  Playing with pros Tiger Woods  Dustin Johnson and Brad Faxon in November 2017  Trump hit two balls in the water on one hole but didn t charge himself any penalty strokes The pros all saw it happen  but just grinned their way through it  Why didn t they call him out for the violation  Because he s so fun and we want our own stories to tell about the cheating   Reilly said he was told At Winged Foot  a famous golf club in Westchester County  New York  Trump had a reputation among the caddies for kicking his ball into a better position so often that they called him  Pele   the former soccer star  Reilly said While Trump has in the past claimed a golf handicap of 2 8  meaning he typically will average three strokes over par over 18 holes  his handicap is actually about 10  said Reilly  This idea that Donald Trump is a great golfer   he s not   said Reilly   He s good  He s a 72 year old man who s a 10 handicap  That s pretty good  But why isn t that good enough  One time Democrat Hillary Clinton  who Trump defeated in the 2016 election  had her brother  Hugh Rodham  to play a round at Winged Foot but showed up wearing shorts and was told he had to have long pants  Reilly said Rodham ended up wearing Trump s rain pants in order to meet the dress code  and gave them back when he was done  This didn t sit well with Trump when he found out about it  Somebody tells Trump this and he was so mad he made the club buy him a whole new rain suit   said Reilly Reilly said the point of the book is to show what Trump is really like behind the scenes  Golf is a window into a guy s soul and this gives a pretty good view of the guy   he said The White House declined to comment   Reporting by Steve Holland  Editing by Susan Thomas

CARACAS   Venezuela s Constituent Assembly  an all powerful legislature controlled by the ruling Socialist Party  on Tuesday approved a measure allowing for a trial of opposition leader Juan Guaido  in what appeared to be step towards having him arrested Guaido  leader of the opposition controlled National Assembly  in January invoked the country s constitution to assume the interim presidency after declaring President Nicolas Maduro s 2018 re election a fraud He has been recognised by the United States and most other Western nations as Venezuela s legitimate leader  and has said he does not recognise decisions emanating from the Maduro government The Constituent Assembly s decree is necessary for the Supreme Court to move ahead with a trial of Guaido because as a legislator he has parliamentary immunity that makes it more difficult for him to be tried than the average citizen  This formally authorizes the continuation of the trial  of Guaido    said Constituent Assembly Chief Diosdado Cabello  who is also the Vice President of the Socialist Party  The Supreme Court on Monday had reiterated a previous measure blocking Guaido from leaving the country  an order which he openly violated in February when he embarked on a tour of Latin American nations to bolster support for his campaign to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro Venezuela s chief prosecutor s office has opened an investigation of Guaido  into alleged links to  incidents of violence  in January  but has not ordered his detention or officially charged him with any crime  We are not going to evade our responsibility   Guaido told reporters in eastern Caracas after the announcement   They thought this would be easy  But it won t be  If they want to move forward  they will have to assume the consequences  Constitutional lawyer Jose Vicente Haro called the decision a  constitutional fraud  that stripped Guaido of parliamentary immunity without the approval of the legislature  which under the constitution must approve such a decision  The legislature is currently control by the opposition  It also violated due process  because he should have had a hearing to defend himself   said Haro in a telephone interview Maduro has said Guaido should  face justice  and calls him a coup mongering puppet for the United States   but he has stopped short of calling for his arrest  Guaido s international backers  chiefly the Trump administration  have warned Venezuelan authorities not to touch him and threatened ever harsher sanctions against the Maduro administration to further cut it off from foreign financing    Reporting by Angus Berwick and Vivian Sequera  Writing by Brian Ellsworth  Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Michael Perry

BRUSSELS   European Union leaders should be patient with Britain over its struggle to find majority support in parliament for a deal to exit the bloc  EU leaders group chairman Donald Tusk said on Tuesday He was reacting to Prime Minister Theresa May s statement saying she would ask the EU for a further delay to the day of Brexit and would sit down with opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in an attempt to break the impasse in parliament   Even if  after today  we don t know what the end result will be  let us be patient   Tusk said on Twitter Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen cautiously backed Tusk but expressed doubt whether May s attempt for a cross party compromise on Brexit  something EU officials have said May should have pursued three years ago  was to be taken seriously  Since we could agree to postpone Brexit to right before European Parliament election  on May 23 26  given the approval of May s agreement  we should also be patient IF there suddenly is a cross party way forward in UK  But is it to good to believe   Rasmussen said on Twitter May said the extension she would seek beyond the current legal departure day of April 12 should be  as short as possible  without specifying any period  and added that it should end when a deal is ratified by parliament  She did not make clear what kind of solution she would seek together with Corbyn  who supports the option of Britain staying in a customs union with the EU   something May s party rejects EU officials who asked not to be identified said it was not clear what compromise May was trying to achieve and that was why Tusk was calling for patience But patience has limits  the EU officials said  because on April 10 EU leaders will meet in Brussels for a summit to finalize Brexit  April 12 has already been set as the date on which Britain will leave the EU without a deal  unless a request for an extension is approved by EU leaders  I m not sure what her game plan is or where it is headed   one EU official closely involved in the Brexit process said   If it s for real that there s now a cross party process in the UK  everybody here will applaud it  If it actually can go somewhere  with real engagement on both sides  I think leaders would look favorably at possibilities of an extension  If it s a Hail Mary because all other options are closed   because parliament is all no no no    and the cabinet  is  just as split as the parliament   then I think EU leaders will ask themselves if we re not at the end of the road   the official added   Reporting By Jan Strupczewski and Foo Yun Chee  Editing by Mark Heinrich

ISLAMABAD   Pakistan scrapped terrorism trials before special military courts after the tribunals  mandate expired on Monday  ending a measure that had been in place for over four years to help authorities curb militant attacks  a government minister said The country resumed military trials for terror suspects in 2015 and lifted a moratorium on the death penalty after a Taliban attack in December 2014 on a school in Peshawar killed more than 150 people  mostly young students Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the courts were re introduced under special circumstances and  performed well   We were near to eliminating terrorism   he added Chaudhry said Prime Minister Imran Khan s government could not bring the matter of extending the courts before parliament  where opposition parties challenge his every move  The measure had to be backed by two thirds of lawmakers in the 342 seat chamber to pass Terrorism cases will now be handled by regular courts  notorious for their bureaucracy and slow justice Khan came to power after elections last summer  promising to clean house and do away with rampant corruption He has repeatedly demanded that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and former President Asif Zardari return  looted money   Sharif is currently serving a seven year prison sentence for corruption and Zardari is facing an investigation for money laundering Zardari s aide Farhatullah Babar said the opposition Peoples Party would not support extending the military courts   The government should strengthen the regular court system instead   Babar said Analyst Zahid Hussain said that while the closure of the special military courts might not have a direct impact on Pakistan s fight against terror  it s unclear how the remaining cases of those held on terrorism charges would be handled  The regular courts lack the capability to handle terrorism cases   Hussain said   We either have to strengthen the legal system or they need to find a way to extend the military courts  Rights groups have criticized the military courts and have campaigned against the death penalty in Pakistan  which was largely used to execute common criminals According to Pakistani officials  the special military tribunals over the past four years decided 478 cases and sentenced 284 people to death  Of those  56 convicted militants have already been executed  Also  192 other suspects were sentenced to various prison terms  

JERUSALEM   The remains of an Israeli soldier who went missing nearly 37 years ago in a calamitous battle with Syrian forces in Lebanon have been repatriated  the Israeli military said Wednesday  healing a long festering wound to the national psyche and handing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a unifying achievement just six days before he seeks re election The soldier  Sgt  First Class Zachary Baumel  a 21 year old tank driver who was born in Brooklyn  emigrated to Israel with his family in 1970  He was lost and believed killed a few days into the 1982 Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon  in the chaos after his brigade was ambushed near the village of Sultan Yakoub  in the eastern Bekaa Valley Israel s military and intelligence services never stopped searching for him  and two others who remain missing  One key breakthrough came in 1993  during the Oslo peace talks  when half of an identification tag belonging to Sergeant Baumel was delivered by Yasir Arafat  the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman  to an emissary of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin In 2016  Russia returned to Israel  at Mr  Netanyahu s request  a tank that had been seized in the Sultan Yakoub battle  sent by Syria to Moscow and kept on display at the armored corps museum there Last year  a Syrian based Palestinian official told The Associated Press that insurgents had found the remains of three Israeli soldiers  including Sergeant Baumel  in a cemetery in the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus  the Syrian capital  And in the fall  Russia said its soldiers had come under fire while helping Israel search graves in Syrian territory controlled by Islamic State forces Mr  Netanyahu  who a day earlier had announced plans to meet with President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia on Thursday  said Israel had  invested immense efforts  in what he called the  moral duty  of resolving what had happened to Sergeant Baumel  In his last words  written on a postcard before leaving for the battle of Sultan Yakoub  he wrote   Don t worry  everything is all right  but it doesn t seem like I ll be coming home soon    Mr  Netanyahu said in a televised announcement Wednesday evening  It took the state of Israel 37 years to bring him home   he continued   The operation to return Zachary Baumel back home is an example of the camaraderie that defines us as a nation  as an army and as a state  For Israeli Jews  nearly all of whom enter the military at 18  the recovery of a fallen soldier or the return of a prisoner of war can be a galvanizing national event  In 2011  Mr  Netanyahu released 1 027 Palestinian prisoners to retrieve one missing soldier held by Hamas  Gilad Shalit And the prime minister has faced fierce criticism over his policy toward Gaza from the family of Lt  Hadar Goldin  who was believed killed during the 2014 Gaza war by Hamas militants  who still hold his remains  Hamas is also believed to be holding the remains of another soldier  Staff Sgt  Oron Shaul  from the 2014 war  as well as two Israeli civilians who are believed to be alive ImageSgt  First Class Zachary Baumel in an undated photo CreditIsraeli Government Press Office  via Reuters It s something Israelis get excited about   said Amos Harel  a military analyst for the newspaper Haaretz   You have to bring them home  It s a terribly emotional and ideological issue  Mr  Harel noted that the Goldin family had publicly expressed fear that their campaign to recover their son s remains would suffer the same fate as the search for the three soldiers lost at Sultan Yakoub  two of whom remain missing Indeed  Tzur Goldin  Lieutenant Goldin s twin brother  assailed Mr  Netanyahu after the announcement about Sergeant Baumel   Hadar is not overseas or in a faraway country   he wrote on Twitter  It is very clear where he is  He is an hour away from Netanyahu s office  in Israel s military headquarters  he said   held by a loathsome terror organization that is making a fool of a terrified government that follows a failing policy  Shame on you  Still  for Mr  Netanyahu  the closing of such an old case could not have been more propitiously timed  He has run an exceptionally divisive re election campaign  pitting Jews against Arab citizens and his fellow conservatives against the left  but the return of Sergeant Baumel s remains for burial in Israel gave him a victory that could be savored by nearly every voter who has served in the military or has a relative who did Moreover  with Mr  Netanyahu in a tight race with Benny Gantz  a retired three star general and army chief  anything that reminds voters of the prime minister s competence and devotion as Israel s commander in chief would help counteract Mr  Gantz s appeal as a lifelong military man Finally  Mr  Netanyahu s announcement came an hour before   and completely buried in the Israeli news media   a news conference at which Ehud Barak  a former prime minister and army chief  and several other retired senior military  national security  intelligence and diplomatic officials attacked Mr  Netanyahu  Their remarks came in response to a brewing scandal involving Mr  Netanyahu s approval of the sale of advanced German made submarines to Egypt The battle of Sultan Yakoub was a disastrous start to what became a disastrous military adventure for Israel in Lebanon  Sergeant Baumel s brigade entered a narrow valley unaware that a Syrian armored division was positioned in the surrounding hills Survivors told of bedlam as eight tanks were abandoned and soldiers fled on foot  A rescue mission was mounted  and about 20 Israeli soldiers were killed  One of the captured tanks was paraded through the streets of Damascus Yehuda Katz  a gunner in one tank  went missing  In another  Sergeant Baumel  the driver  and Sgt  First Class Tzvi Feldman  a loader and communications operator  were lost  the army said  Two other soldiers who were captured and the remains of one who was killed were returned to Israel by 1985 Eventually  Israel concluded that Palestinians in Syria were holding the other missing at the direction of the P L O   which the Israeli army said undertook a  protracted effort of concealment and deception  that impeded the search for years At an army ceremony on Wednesday  the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces  Lt  Gen  Aviv Kochavi  spoke of the  great obligation  he bears  to take care of every soldier  who swears allegiance to the state   This commitment is to every family that entrusts us with them  and a commitment to Israeli society who puts their trust in us   he said

decade old rule that began on Feb 22 by reversing his decision to seek a fifth term  But he did not say when he would go  further angering protesters Bouteflika submitted his resignation on Tuesday after the army chief of staff demanded immediate constitutional procedures to remove him from office  the APS news agency reported In a report on Monday  APS had said Bouteflika would leave before his term ended on April 28  Two private TV channels said on Sunday he could quit this week A fighter in the 1954 1962 war to end French colonial rule  Bouteflika became independent Algeria s first foreign minister and one of the forces behind the Non Aligned Movement that gave a global voice to Africa  Asia and Latin America He championed post colonial states  challenged what he saw as the hegemony of the United States and helped turn his country into a seed bed of 1960s idealism He welcomed Che Guevara  and a young Nelson Mandela got his first military training in Algeria  Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver  on the run from U S  police  was given refuge  Cleaver held court in his Algiers safe house with Timothy Leary  the drug taking high priest of U S  counter culture As president of the U N  General Assembly  Bouteflika invited Yasser Arafat to address the body in 1974  a historic step towards international recognition of the Palestinian cause By the end of the 1970s  though  Bouteflika had fallen from favor at home and went into exile  He returned to public life when Algeria was being ravaged by a conflict with Islamist militants which killed an estimated 200 000 people First elected president in 1999  he negotiated a truce to end the fighting and wrested power from the secretive military based establishment known as  le pouvoir   the powers that be  Helped by oil and gas revenues  Algeria became more peaceful and richer  But it remains mired in corruption and political and economic torpor in a region where uprisings brought changes elsewhere With a cushion of foreign reserves and a population wary of major upheaval after their civil war  Algeria avoided the Arab Spring revolutions that toppled leaders across the region in 2011 But protests against poor living standards  the lack of job opportunities and services were common even before the mass protests  and foreign investors are keen for economic reforms that will cut the red tape that often hampers business POST COLONIAL STATES  SPOKESMANSome biographers say Bouteflika was born in Tlemcen  western Algeria  and others give his place of birth as Oujda  just over the border in Morocco Aged 19  he joined the rebellion against French rule as a protege of Houari Boumediene  a commander who would later become Algerian president After independence  Bouteflika became minister for youth and tourism at the age of 25  The following year he was made foreign minister Dressed in the tailored suits and sunglasses fashionable in the 1960s  Bouteflika became a spokesman for states emerging from colonial rule  given added authority by the cachet Algeria had earned from defeating France Bouteflika demanded that Communist China be given a seat in the United Nations  He railed against apartheid rule in South Africa The invitation to Arafat to address the General Assembly was controversial  Only two years before  Palestinian gunmen took hostage and killed members of the Israeli team at the Olympic Games in Munich  Bouteflika watched from the chairman s dais as Arafat  a gun holster on his waistband  addressed the assembly in New York When pro Palestinian militant Illich Ramirez Sanchez  better known as  Carlos the Jackal   kidnapped oil ministers from an OPEC meeting in Vienna in 1975  he demanded to be flown with his hostages to Algiers  Bouteflika was shown on camera embracing Carlos at the airport before they sat down to negotiate the hostages  release RETURN FROM EXILEWhen Boumediene died in 1978  Bouteflika lost his mentor  He was replaced as foreign minister and an investigation was launched into financial impropriety  Bouteflika said the allegations were fabricated as part of a political plot He left Algeria in the early 1980s and settled in Dubai  where he became an adviser to a member of the emirate s ruling family  He returned home in 1987 but kept a low profile  refusing offers of government posts In the meantime  Algeria was unraveling  The military backed government annulled a parliamentary election in 1992 that Islamists were on the verge of winning  In the conflict that followed  whole villages were massacred and civilians walking in city streets had their throats slit Bouteflika  backed by the military  was elected president in 1999 with a pledge to stop the fighting  Against fierce opposition from the establishment  he gave an amnesty to militants who laid down their arms  The violence declined dramatically He won re election in 2004 and again in 2009  although his opponents said the votes were rigged  Through a series of ferocious turf battles with his security forces behind the scenes  Bouteflika had  by the start of his third term  become Algerian s most powerful president in 30 years He consolidated that power last year by dismissing about a dozen top military officers Little is known about his private life  Official records mention no wife  though some accounts say a marriage took place in 1990  Bouteflika lived with his mother  Mansouriah  in an apartment in Algiers  where she used to prepare his meals Age and poor health caught up with him  French doctors operated on him in 2005 for what officials said was a stomach ulcer  Leaked U S  diplomatic cables said he was suffering from cancer  He became weaker after his mother died in 2009 Bouteflika said in a speech in Setif  in eastern Algeria  in May 2012 that it was time for his generation to hand over to new leaders   For us  it s over   he said Months later at the start of 2013  a stroke put him into a Paris hospital for three months  He was seen little in public

of 1960s idealism He welcomed Che Guevara  and a young Nelson Mandela got his first military training in Algeria  Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver  on the run from U S  police  was given refuge  Cleaver held court in his Algiers safe house with Timothy Leary  the drug taking high priest of U S  counter culture As president of the U N  General Assembly  Bouteflika invited Yasser Arafat to address the body in 1974  a historic step toward international recognition of the Palestinian cause By the end of the 1970s  though  Bouteflika had fallen from favor at home and went into exile  He returned to public life when Algeria was being ravaged by a conflict with Islamist militants which killed an estimated 200 000 people First elected president in 1999  he negotiated a truce to end the fighting and wrested power from the secretive military based establishment known as  le pouvoir   the powers that be  Helped by oil and gas revenues  Algeria became more peaceful and richer  But it remains mired in corruption and political and economic torpor in a region where uprisings brought changes in neighboring countries With a cushion of foreign reserves and a population wary of major upheaval after their civil war  Algeria avoided the Arab Spring revolutions that toppled leaders across the region in 2011 But protests against poor living standards  the lack of job opportunities and services were common even before the mass protests  and foreign investors are keen for economic reforms that will cut the red tape that often hampers business THIRD WORLD S SPOKESMANSome biographers say Bouteflika was born in Tlemcen  western Algeria  and others give his place of birth as Oujda  just over the border in Morocco Aged 19  he joined the rebellion against French rule as a protege of Houari Boumediene  a commander who would later become Algerian president After independence  Bouteflika became minister for youth and tourism at the age of 25  The following year he was made foreign minister Dressed in the tailored suits and sunglasses fashionable in the 1960s  Bouteflika became a spokesman for states emerging from colonial rule  given added authority by the cachet Algeria had earned from defeating France Bouteflika demanded that Communist China be given a seat in the United Nations  He railed against apartheid rule in South Africa The invitation to Arafat to address the General Assembly was controversial  Only two years before  Palestinian gunmen took hostage and killed members of the Israeli team at the Olympic Games in Munich  Bouteflika watched from the chairman s dais as Arafat  a gun holster on his waistband  addressed the assembly in New York When pro Palestinian militant Illich Ramirez Sanchez  better known as  Carlos the Jackal   kidnapped oil ministers from an OPEC meeting in Vienna in 1975  he demanded to be flown with his hostages to Algiers  Bouteflika was shown on camera embracing Carlos at the airport before they sat down to negotiate the hostages  release RETURN FROM EXILEWhen Boumediene died in 1978  Bouteflika lost his mentor  He was replaced as foreign minister and an investigation was launched into financial impropriety  Bouteflika said the allegations were invented as part of a political plot He left Algeria in the early 1980s and settled in Dubai  where he became an adviser to a member of the emirate s ruling family  He returned home in 1987 but kept a low profile  refusing offers of government posts In the meantime  Algeria was unraveling  The military backed government annulled a parliamentary election in 1992 that Islamists were on the verge of winning  In the conflict that followed  whole villages were massacred and civilians walking in city streets had their throats slit Bouteflika  backed by the military  was elected president in 1999 with a pledge to stop the fighting  Against fierce opposition from the establishment  he gave an amnesty to militants who laid down their arms  The violence declined dramatically He won re election in 2004 and again in 2009  although his opponents said the votes were rigged  Through a series of ferocious turf battles with his security forces behind the scenes  Bouteflika had  by the start of his third term  become Algerian s most powerful president in 30 years He consolidated that power last year by dismissing about a dozen top military officers Little is known about his private life  Official records mention no wife  though some accounts say a marriage took place in 1990  Bouteflika lived with his mother  Mansouriah  in an apartment in Algiers  where she used to prepare his meals Age and poor health caught up with him  French doctors operated on him in 2005 for what officials said was a stomach ulcer  Leaked U S  diplomatic cables said he was suffering from cancer  He became weaker after his mother died in 2009 Bouteflika said in a speech in Setif  in eastern Algeria  in May 2012 that it was time for his generation to hand over to new leaders   For us  it s over   he said Months later at the start of 2013  a stroke put him into a Paris hospital for three months  He was seen little in public after returning to Algeria to convalesce   editing by Ulf

GAZA CITY  Gaza Strip   Over the weekend  Gaza s Hamas rulers marked a year of bloody  weekly protests that have failed to break the Israeli blockade  Rocket attacks brought a wave of Israeli airstrikes and unprecedented protests broke out against the Islamic militants  increasingly unpopular rule And yet Hamas  control over Gaza is tighter than ever The militants  rule has been strengthened by an unlikely overlap of interests with Israel s right wing government  Neither wants to see an independent state established in all the West Bank  Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem  as the resolution of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  And Hamas  refusal to give up power   the asking price of its West Bank based Palestinian rival for reconciliation   aligns with Israel s long standing policy of maintaining a separation between the West Bank and Gaza So even though Israel and Hamas have fought three wars and dozens of skirmishes  and even though Hamas remains committed to Israel s eventual destruction  the two are once again meeting with Egyptian mediators and working to keep things quiet Under an emerging arrangement  Hamas would halt rocket fire and keep border protests peaceful in exchange for Israel easing its border blockade and allowing  30 million a month in Qatari aid into the territory  On Sunday  Israel reopened Gaza crossings to limited traffic Egypt has brokered short lived deals in the past  and it is not clear if the current arrangements will last beyond Israel s April 9 election  In a close race  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under fire for what his challengers say is a Gaza policy that exposes Israel to Hamas blackmail For Gaza residents  open ended Hamas rule is a bleak prospect  Gaza s 2 million people have endured rising poverty and unemployment  undrinkable ground water and frequent electricity outages since Israel and Egypt closed Gaza s borders after Hamas seized power in 2007 In recent weeks  hundreds dared to protest Hamas policies  such as new tax hikes  chanting  We want to live   Many were jailed and beaten  Protester Amer Balousha  a 27 year old unemployed law school graduate  said he and others were mistreated in Hamas detention but will not be deterred  If the situation does not improve  the protests will continue   he said    HAMAS OVER ABBASHamas has demonstrated that it prefers an understanding with Netanyahu over reconciling with its Palestinian rival  President Mahmoud Abbas A deal with Israel would help keep Hamas in power  By contrast  Abbas   who presides over autonomous enclaves in the Israeli occupied West Bank   wants Hamas to hand control of Gaza to him  a demand the group has repeatedly rejected Hamas and Netanyahu both oppose Abbas  goal of Palestinian statehood in the West Bank  Gaza and east Jerusalem  lands Israel captured in 1967  Hamas seeks to establish an Islamic state in the area encompassing Israel and the war won lands  while a majority in Netanyahu s Cabinet and Likud Party reject a two state solution along the 1967 lines Last month  Netanyahu was quoted as saying that those who oppose Palestinian statehood should back his policy of allowing Qatari aid into Gaza and maintaining the separation between the rival Palestinian governments  There is a great confluence of interests  between Israel and Hamas  said Tareq Baconi  an analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank   Netanyahu prefers to deal with Hamas because clear dynamics have been established and Hamas will not seek a final resolution  of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  from Israel     MANAGING THE CONFLICTIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars  most recently in 2014  In between  there have been repeated cross border skirmishes and periods of calm brokered by Egypt  which has close security ties with Israel and controls part of the Gaza border Israel s stated reason for the blockade is to contain Hamas and prevent it from rearming  while rights groups denounce the restrictions as collective punishment Last summer  amid weekly mass protests along the frontier in which scores of Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire and thousands wounded  Egypt started new cease fire talks  Hamas hoped they would lead to an easing of the blockade Early on  Israel consented to Qatari cash shipments and Hamas pledged to halt rocket fire  but then the talks stalled  In March  with Israel s election campaign heating up  Hamas sensed an opportunity to apply pressure on Netanyahu to resume negotiations  twice firing rockets into central Israel It worked  Two Hamas officials  speaking Sunday on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the renewed truce talks  relished in the group s apparent leverage  But they also expressed concern any new deal could quickly unravel    A NEW GAZA POLICY Netanyahu s main challenger  former army chief Benny Gantz  has said he would handle Gaza differently  His party s platform pledges a  powerful response to any provocation and violence   while improving the lives of Gaza civilians and driving a wedge between them and Hamas But the plan is short on specifics Gantz and two other ex military chiefs in his team held top command roles in the last three wars with Hamas  exacting a heavy price for rocket fire but coming up against the limits of military action  A consensus has emerged in Israel that Hamas cannot be brought down by force  short of a bloody reoccupation of Gaza Yet any easing of the blockade  meant to bring relief to Gaza s residents  would also prolong Hamas rule    ODD MAN OUTAbbas has given up on reconciliation with Hamas after years of failed efforts  He has stepped up financial pressure on Gaza  including cutting in half salaries for tens of thousands of ex civil servants who were replaced by Hamas in 2007 but remained on the Abbas government payroll Such cutbacks worsened Gaza s economic deterioration  But instead of stoking a popular uprising against Hamas  anger turned toward Abbas Abbas is also suspicious of multi million dollar Gaza development projects proposed by the U N  and Qatar  with U S  and Israeli backing  He fears it s a plot to turn the territory into a Palestinian mini state and undercut Palestinian political claims to the West Bank and east Jerusalem Baconi  the analyst  said that Abbas  policies are counterproductive  even if his concerns are understandable   Putting more sanctions on Gaza or trying to break the Hamas government will further entrench the division   he said    Laub reported from Ramallah  West Bank

KIEV  Ukraine   The thriving presidential campaign of Ukrainian comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy may seem improbable  but his campaign adviser says the country is at the point where it needs reforms from untraditional sources Oleksandr Danylyuk spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday  three days after an election in which Zelenskiy received the most votes by far  easily outpacing the incumbent president and a former prime minister  Now is the time for a new leader to form a new and strong team  and show everyone that reforms are possible and can be made by those people from whom this is least expected   Danylyuk said Zelenskiy and President Petro Poroshenko are set to face off in an April 21 runoff  If Zelenskiy wins  observers have suggested his adviser might become prime minister Unlike his candidate  who stars on a television series about a teacher who becomes president after a video of him denouncing corruption goes viral  Danylyuk has high level experience in Ukraine s government He served as finance minister under Poroshenko for two years before being dismissed in 2018 after complaining that needed reforms to combat corruption were being stalled Ukraine s pervasive corruption is at the heart of Zelenskiy s appeal  His popularity on TV and at the ballot box reflects widespread disappointment in Poroshenko  who took office in 2014 Danylyuk said he thinks Poroshenko was able to formulate an effective anti corruption program  but unable to implement it  We don t need new promises  to invent something new   we need to do something that  Poroshenko  couldn t do or didn t want to do   Danylyuk said Zelenskiy s first step if he is elected president would be reviving anti corruption and judicial reforms and judicial reforms  Danylyuk said  including the launching of a long awaited anti corruption court His favoring of a referendum to determine if Ukrainians want their country to seek NATO membership prompted criticism the candidate might be too sensitive to views in Russia  Danylyuk said Ukraine s course on joining NATO and the European Union would be maintained under Zelenskiy  As for the foreign policy of both accession to the EU and NATO  the Ukrainians made their choice  There are even changes in the Constitution   he said  referring to Poroshenko s signing an amendment this year committing the country to pursuing membership in both the European bloc and the Western military alliance Economic reforms also would continue  meeting aid conditions set by the International Monetary Fund and encouraging investors  Danylyuk said  I communicate with many foreign investors who look at Zelenskiy as reliable   he said Zelenskiy has proposed direct discussions with Moscow about the war with Russia backed separatists in eastern Ukraine  Danylyuk said the five year conflict that has killed more than 13 000 people cannot be stopped quickly  This is a difficult question  and there is no ready solution   he said  

BRUSSELS   The European Union launched legal action against Poland on Wednesday that alleges recent justice laws undermine the independence of the country s judges and comes amid concern the rule of law is being increasingly abused around the bloc The EU s executive commission sent a letter of formal notice   the first step in legal action   to the nationalist government in Warsaw and wants a reply addressing its concerns within two months Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said disciplinary measures for judges contained in a 2017 law on the Supreme Court of Poland seem designed  to systematically subject judges to the political control of the executive  Timmermans said investigations that were opened since the rule change have  an obvious  chilling effect on the activities of judges  and this is incompatible with the requirements of judicial independence  He said the letter gives Poland a chance to explain or change its mind about the laws Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court established under the 2017 law is necessary to ensure the justice system applies in  equal measure to all citizens   including judges accused of wrongdoing As evidence of the problem the chamber is meant to address  Ziobro cited a case in which the Supreme Court acquitted a judge who had been seen on CCTV appropriating a 50 zloty   13  banknote Poland s government argues that the deep changes it has made to the judiciary were needed to eliminate corruption and inefficiency left over from the country s communist era  Critics say the government has used it to install ruling party loyalists in key positions The EU s move was the latest in a series of procedures launched against Poland that the commission insists is meant to safeguard the rule of law there  The commission has also launched similar action against Hungary Timmermans said Brussels believes it is time for a broader reflection on what can be done to protect democracy  personal freedoms and the justice systems of some EU member countries  There is a growing consensus that further action to protect the rule of law into the whole of the European Union is needed   he told reporters  Asked whether he is worried about the rule of law in Italy  Timmermans said   I do not see at this stage a systemic problem  But he did express concerns about possible back sliding on reform in Romania  particularly in the fight against corruption  I want to warn against any government action that would disrupt the Romanian judicial system by creating a systemic  de facto impunity for high office holders who were sentenced for corruption   he said   Such a move would compel the commission to act swiftly  Wednesday s legal action and warnings have been announced in the run up to the May 23 26 EU elections  Timmermans is running as a candidate to take over from Jean Claude Juncker as president of the commission    Monika Scislowska contributed from Warsaw

PARIS   The president of Algeria resigned Tuesday night under pressure from the army following weeks of mass protests  closing out the reign of North Africa s longest serving leader but not ending a political impasse in a country where the street is demanding revolutionary change The state news agency said that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  who is ailing and paralyzed and has not spoken to his countrymen in seven years  had submitted his resignation His departure followed quickly after a statement from the chief of staff of Algeria s army  the traditional arbiter of political life in the country  calling for an  immediate  declaration from the constitutional council that Mr  Bouteflika was unfit for office Mr  Bouteflika  who was president for 20 years  had sought to prolong his rule  pushed by family members and others in Algeria s ruling elite who sought  the preservation of their narrow personal interests   the army chief of staff  Gen  Ahmed Gaid Salah  said Tuesday night The general s declaration was enough to force Mr  Bouteflika out  Only a day earlier  the president had said he would resign before the end of his term  April 28  but that was not quick enough for either the army or the protesters It was an inglorious end to a career that encompassed nearly 60 years  and some of the most treacherous politics in the Arab world  in a country that is one of the world s major oil and gas producers and is considered a bulwark against Islamist terrorism The Algerian revolution of 2019  peaceful and focused in its demand for radical change  is giving pause to authoritarian neighbors from Egypt to the Gulf to Sudan who have managed to thwart the street and had hoped that this kind of revolt was behind them Mr  Bouteflika began as the world s youngest foreign minister in the 1960s  as the henchman of one of Algeria s revolutionary leaders  and he spent long years in exile after being disgraced in a financial scandal at the end of the 1970s ImageAlgerian students taking part in a demonstration against the government in Algiers on Tuesday CreditMohamed Messara EPA  via ShutterstockHe came back to politics at the behest of the country s generals to salve the wounds of a savage civil war  becoming president in 1999 and quickly bolstering his reputation as a master maneuverer by reaching a deal with insurgent Islamists But in the end  hobbled by severe infirmity  manipulated by his immediate circle  and blinded   according to those who know him   by years in power  he pushed too far  seeking a fifth term in office That enraged a hitherto acquiescent population  which took to the streets on Feb  22 and has not left them since For now  Algerians appear to be stuck with much of the vestiges of the Bouteflika power structure  even with the president stepping down Clearly wanting to maintain control after his initial announced departure on Sunday  Mr  Bouteflika installed a new government on Sunday night  and  ominously  promised  important decisions  before he stepped down The words set off alarm bells throughout the country  Algerians  well aware of their president s reputation as a wily political operator  greeted the announcement with deep suspicion  They do not want  continuity  with any part of Mr  Bouteflika s long regime  They want a clean start Then on Tuesday night  the army  anxious to declare itself in sync with the broad based popular movement  said Mr  Bouteflika had to leave immediately What comes next is uncertain The ministers Mr  Bouteflika appointed as a parting gesture could remain in office for some months ImageThe Algerian Army chief of staff  Gen  Ahmed Gaid Salah  presiding at a military parade in Algiers last year CreditAnis Belghoul Associated PressThe protesters may want a clean break  but it is not certain that the army will go along with that  or with bypassing constitutional provisions that call for the appointment of the president of the Senate  a Bouteflika ally  as the temporary president until elections are held Algeria has known democracy only in fleeting interludes  The only election which clearly reflected popular sentiment was a vote for the Islamists in 1991  after which the army stepped in  canceled a second round and unleashed a brutal civil war that killed more than 100 000 people Yet the crowds that have clogged the streets of Algiers since Feb  22   remarkably peaceful  festive and determined   appear to believe that  if they are to have a democracy  the country must reconstruct everything afresh after decades of corrupt  authoritarian rule This is why they yell  Systme dgage   or   System  get lost   The whole apparatus of the state with its phony legalism and its compromised nomenklatura  they insist  must go Like the master politician he is  Mr  Bouteflika  though barely capable of even a pained grimace  appeared to exploit the vagueness of the crowd s demands  The president   or at least those around him   spoke of  continuity  and a  transition  But the army had lost patience On Tuesday evening the standoff between General Salah and Mr  Bouteflika s circle sharpened as the general accused  certain individuals  of prolonging the crisis  An army statement quoted the general as wondering about  this handful of people  who have  amassed immense riches through illegal means   a clear jab at the businessmen around Mr  Bouteflika He called for the  immediate  application of the constitutional provisions that deem Mr  Bouteflika unfit At the end  Mr  Bouteflika was  playing a kind of liar s poker   Abdelaziz Rahabi  one of his

mustachioed foreign minister  Mr  Bouteflika symbolized the Third World pugnacity of the 1960s  Later  as a crafty leader  he drew a healing line underneath the shocking violence of Algeria s 1990s civil war  at the price of a willful national amnesia And always Mr  Bouteflika proved himself to be a survivor  He s had a reputation for being especially adroit and cunning  not a conviction politician  not someone who stood clearly for any principle   said Hugh Roberts  an Algeria expert at Tufts University His tenacity was a lesson learned over a very long career  In 1965 he helped his mentor  the army colonel Houari Boumediene  overthrow the revolutionary leader Ahmed Ben Bella After Mr  Boumediene s death in 1979  Mr  Bouteflika  faced charges of embezzlement and  almost went to prison   said the Algerian political sociologist Nacer Djabi Mr  Bouteflika had been accused of putting foreign ministry money in Swiss bank accounts  the journalist Mohamed Benchicou reported in his book   The Bouteflika Mystery   His reputation was blackened   said the political scientist Louisa Ait Hamadouche The lesson for Mr  Bouteflika and his circle   You ve got to stay in power  in the presidency  until the end   Mr  Djabi said  He can t reform    Mr  Djabi said    because he doesn t believe in democracy or politics  His former minister  Mr  Rahabi  said Mr  Bouteflika s obstinacy was dangerous  He s got a suicidal obsession with power   Mr  Rahabi said In throwing off Mr  Bouteflika in a so far peaceful revolution  and in forcing the army to take its side  the Algerian protesters have already scored gains beyond those achieved in many countries during the Arab spring of 2011  It s an entire population that is waking up after a long period of national hibernation

LONDON   After years of partisan battling  Prime Minister Theresa May and the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn began an emergency  11th hour effort Wednesday to find common ground on Britain s tortuous effort to withdraw from the European Union The question was  could they overcome their antagonistic history and find a way out of the quagmire The first signs  following a two hour meeting between Conservative and Labour leaders in a wood paneled office in Parliament  were guardedly optimistic  at least from the government s side  Today s talks were constructive  with both sides showing flexibility and a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close   a government spokesman said   We have agreed a program of work to ensure we deliver for the British people  protecting jobs and security  Mr  Corbyn  who is navigating treacherous political terrain in the negotiations  was markedly less enthusiastic  There hasn t been as much change as I expected  but we will have further discussions tomorrow to explore technical issues   he said Mr  Corbyn said he told the government that Labour wanted to remain in a customs union with the European Union  with access to the bloc s single market and regulatory structures  adding   I also raised the option of a public vote to prevent crashing out or leaving on a bad deal  ImageMrs  May at a news conference after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday CreditPool photo by Jack TaylorThe spotlight in the cross party negotiations seemed for now to be falling on Mr  Corbyn  who has spent the last two years dodging it A left wing critic of the European Union  he has played coy throughout the preparations for the withdrawal  known as Brexit Throughout the Brexit debate  Mr  Corbyn has ducked and weaved  trying to bridge the gap between the Remainers and Leavers in his own party while letting Mrs  May take the blame for the shambling effort to steer Britain s departure His trick has been to oppose what Labour calls Mrs  May s  Tory Brexit   insisting that he could negotiate something better  while keeping alive the possibility of holding a second referendum  even if he has shown little  enthusiasm for the idea Ahead of the 2016 referendum  he did the bare minimum for the pro European campaign  and many believe he would be happy were Britain to leave the bloc   providing he is not seen as responsible for the exit  His ideal scenario is that May gets her deal through  he votes against it and is not tainted   said Steven Fielding  a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham But after three large parliamentary defeats of the departure deal that Mrs  May negotiated with the bloc  that looks unlikely to happen And now  Mrs  May s cross party initiative threatens to drag him into the Brexit maelstrom  threatening to tear apart the Labour Party  which  like the Conservatives  is internally divided on the stay leave issue What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union Clearly  for Mr  Corbyn  ducking and weaving is no longer an option  This is his moment of decision   Mr  Fielding said   His policy has been one of constructive ambiguity  but now he has to decide  He has to act  he has to come to a decision  Getting there  however  will be devilishly tricky  requiring the balancing of several strong political currents in his party Many of the new  mainly young  supporters Mr  Corbyn has attracted to Labour in recent years are passionate pro Europeans and favor a second vote  where people would choose between the government s Brexit plan and staying in the bloc  A big group of his lawmakers agree But a sizable number of Labour lawmakers  around 20 percent  represent working class districts that voted to leave  Fearing a backlash among their constituents  many want to honor the referendum result and end freedom of movement from the European Union  primarily to cut immigration from Eastern Europe Further complicating matters  some of Mr  Corbyn s closest allies are left wing Brexit   or  Lexit    supporters who believe the bloc s antitrust rules might prevent a socialist Corbyn government from enacting policies like subsidizing loss making businesses or offering government contracts to local companies without opening them up to tendering So far Mr  Corbyn has managed to straddle the divide and keep to the letter  if not the spirit  of last year s agreement at the Labour Party conference  which supported a second referendum in the absence of his preferred option  a general election The idea of a second referendum is gaining momentum among Labour lawmakers On Wednesday  Emily Thornberry  who would be expected to have the foreign secretary post in a Labour government  endorsed the idea But Mrs  May and her Conservative allies have adamantly opposed a second referendum  saying that in a closely divided nation it would yield another close result that would only make matters worse ImageAnt Brexit campaigners near Parliament in London on Wednesday CreditIsabel Infantes Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesAs the two sides continue their talks  one possible area of agreement is Labour s proposal for Britain remaining in a customs union with the bloc  which eliminates tariffs on goods between member nations  But Mr  Corbyn says he wants a post Brexit Britain to also be able to influence European Union trade policy and the deals the bloc strikes around the world that would apply to Britain too That negotiating point  however  would be hard if not impossible to get the bloc to agree to Mr  Corbyn also wants to align British and European Union environmental and product standards  keeping close to Europe s single market albeit from the outside  That is not as far from the deal Mrs  May has negotiated as it may appear Mrs  May s proposal envisions keeping Britain in its current status until 2020  when it would leave the customs union and the single market  giving it control over immigration But the plan  contained in a nonbinding political declaration that is separate from the withdrawal agreement  leaves open the possibility of staying quite close to those structures  And unlike the legally binding withdrawal treaty spelling out divorce terms  it remains a matter still open to negotiation with the bloc Yet even if Mr  Corbyn could agree to a blueprint with Mrs  May  there would remain the problem of devising assurances to Labour that the government would stick to the plan  Given that Mrs  May has already announced she plans to step aside if she secures agreement for her Brexit plan  Labour worries that she will be succeeded by a hard line Brexit supporter who could tear up any deal struck now Even if she were to remain in office  the complexity in trade negotiations is in the details  and those negotiations would be conducted by the government  So Labour would want any agreement reached written into British law  though even that could be repealed by a different Conservative government following an election But perhaps the biggest problem for Mr  Corbyn  If he refused to demand that any Brexit plan be put to a second referendum  that could provoke a huge backlash from pro European Labour lawmakers Mr  Fielding believes Mr  Corbyn would like Brexit out of the way because he sees it as a distraction from his attacks on austerity  But like the rest of the Brexit riddle  the Labour leader s next moves are impossible to predict  Mr  Fielding said  What one person does or doesn t do at a certain point can shape the rest of British history for the foreseeable future   said Mr  Fielding   Isn t that a scary thought

WASHINGTON   To celebrate the 70th anniversary of NATO  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gathered ministers from all the nations in the military alliance on Wednesday night in the same hall where Harry S  Truman signed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization pact in 1949   No military alliance in the world can remotely do what we do   Mr  Pompeo said  hailing NATO s success But the forces pulling that alliance apart were evident everywhere The bonds among the core nations that signed the original treaty  which was displayed next to Mr  Pompeo  are fracturing  New members that were once Soviet states are turning authoritarian  This week  the Pentagon blocked delivery of equipment for the alliance s most modern weapon  the F 35 fighter jet  to Turkey because the NATO nation would not back down on buying Russia s most sophisticated antiaircraft system Vice President Mike Pence declared at the celebration that Germany risked becoming a  captive of Russia  because of its embrace of a direct energy pipeline to Russia And missing altogether was President Trump  whom European and American officials alike wanted to keep away from the anniversary for fear he would again raise the idea of pulling out of NATO if other member states did not pay a greater share of the defense burden It was  one European diplomat said with mild overstatement at one of the many receptions on Wednesday  a little like showing up at a birthday party and discovering you were attending a wake No one had to pick through this minefield more carefully than Jens Stoltenberg  the Norwegian diplomat currently leading the alliance  Mr  Stoltenberg deftly dealt with Mr  Trump on Tuesday by thanking him at the White House for urging NATO countries to spend more on their own defense  which is estimated to result in  100 billion in new spending by the end of 2020 Mr  Stoltenberg clearly knew his audience  Increasing allied contributions is pretty much the only thing Mr  Trump discusses about NATO  In the president s public comments  he has seemed uninterested in what the alliance is doing to push back against Russia or to take on new threats   like the daily onslaught of cyberattacks  from the annoying to the crippling  aimed at NATO members each day It was only when Mr  Stoltenberg got to Capitol Hill  to address a joint session of Congress  that he publicly delineated what he saw as Russia s many offenses   including the annexation of Crimea  the nerve gas attack in Britain and Moscow s violations of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  the agreement from which the United States is now withdrawing  NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence   Mr  Stoltenberg said  But on Thursday  he left it unclear what form that deterrence would take  In comments to the foreign ministers from the alliance s 29 nations   up from the dozen who signed the original treaty   Mr  Stoltenberg said that even if the standoff with Russia resembled a renewed Cold War  no intermediate range nuclear weapons would be deployed on European soil to counter Moscow s weapons But no amount of celebration or warning could paper over bitter divisions that have erupted within NATO over the past few years  only some of which have to do with Mr  Trump Mr  Pompeo expressed exasperation at the argument he hears so often in Europe  which is that its leaders simply will not spend money on defense at anything close to the levels Mr  Trump   and before him President Barack Obama   had in mind  Now is not the time to repeat tired excuses that our citizens don t support increased defense spending or security spending   Mr  Pompeo said  carefully avoiding repeating Mr  Trump s threats to leave the organization unless other member states step up He did not need to  Last year  Mr  Trump periodically told his aides that he no longer saw value in staying in the alliance  And there was a sense at the 70th anniversary this week that the damage was done   even if he did not make good on the threat In a coming report from the Council on Foreign Relations   titled  Trump s Foreign Policies Are Better Than They Seem    Robert Blackwill  a former national security aide and ambassador to India in the George W  Bush administration  argued that the president s record with the alliance was mixed at best but that he had probably done more harm than good In an interview  Mr  Blackwill praised Mr  Trump for pressuring the allies to spend more and for backing up expanded NATO defenses along Russia s border with American troops and surveillance technology But he said none of that would mean much  if the allies lose confidence that the U S  will come to their defense under Article 5   the provision of the treaty that deems an attack on one to be an attack on all  Mr  Trump s biggest misstep  Mr  Blackwill said  was  undermining deterrence    which he said was often as much a function of psychology as military might Aware of the damage already done  Mr  Pompeo repeated the American commitment to Article 5 in a brief speech to the NATO ministers on Thursday  Yet few in the hall seemed to believe him  recalling that Mr  Trump refused to mention the treaty commitment during a visit to the alliance s new headquarters in Brussels last summer  and only grudgingly did so later  Never before has NATO had a U S  leader who didn t appear to believe deeply in NATO itself   R  Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute  two former American ambassadors to the alliance  argued in an op ed in The Washington Post In a  detailed report about the multiple crises engulfing NATO  the two former envoys pointed up a greater vulnerability that has more to do with how the alliance is focusing its resources rather than how it is raising them For years  NATO s planning and doctrine have seemed hopelessly rooted in old images of Russian military invasions into the Fulda Gap  the German lowlands where tanks could pour in  The alliance s cybercenter  north of Brussels  was focused entirely on defending its own networks that have been under constant assault for years Until a few years ago  NATO s cyberdefenses ran from 9 a m  to 5 p m  on weekdays  the idea that state sponsored hackers might wait to attack on weekends to cripple the alliance s communications or defenses ran afoul of budgets and work schedules  Until recently  there was little discussion of offensive cybercapabilities  nor doctrines of deterrence Only now is NATO beginning to think about the vulnerabilities of civilian and military communications that rely on 5G mobile phone networks  The alliance has been slow to think about how artificial intelligence and the potential of quantum computing could change the challenge of defending member states  This week s meetings in Washington were the first in which threats from China were considered at any length Next week  the NATO center of cyberexcellence in Tallinn  Estonia  will run an exercise envisioning a fictional nation   Berylia   under a combination of attacks on its power grid  its communications networks and its election systems  In the real world  that is what has happened in Ukraine  which is aspiring to join NATO  But Ukraine was not central to the discussions at the 70th anniversary  We ve become blinded by the constant focus on the 2 percent standard   Senator Christopher S  Murphy  Democrat of Connecticut  said during the NATO meetings  He was referring to the current goal of member states of spending 2 percent of their economic output on the military by the end of 2024  What really matters is how they are spending on their defense   Mr  Murphy said   How do we fight Russian election propaganda  or energy bribery

WASHINGTON   In President Donald Trump s estimation  the 2020 census will be pointless unless a question is added that asks people if they are citizens That opinion makes him a distinct outlier in government  business and society  where the big census conducted every 10 years produces a gold mine of information on how people live and  of course  how many there are TRUMP   Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question  Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together     tweet Monday THE FACTS  Trump s disdain for conducting the once a decade census without a citizenship question is not shared by his own Census Bureau researchers  Nor is it consistent with the many operations of government and business that make billions of dollars in spending decisions as well as policy decisions based on the most accurate possible count of the U S  population According to January 2018 calculations by the Census Bureau  adding a citizenship question to the decennial census form would cause lower response rates among noncitizens  leading to an increased cost to the government of at least  27 5 million for additional phone calls  visits to the home and other follow up efforts to reach them  The Constitution requires a count every 10 years of  the whole number of persons in each state   long understood to include all residents of the U S The count goes to the heart of the U S  political system  It s used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House and how the electoral votes that decide presidential elections are distributed It also shapes how 300 federal programs distribute more than  800 billion a year to local communities  according to an analysis by the GW Institute of Public Policy at George Washington University  Communities and businesses depend on it  as well  in deciding where to build schools  hospitals  job training centers  grocery stores and more The GW institute s analysis of the effects of an undercount on five programs administered by the Health and Human Services Department  for instance  found that 37 states lost a median of  1 091 in the 2015 budget year for each person missed in the 2010 census Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has argued that a citizenship question is needed   or is  very important   as Trump puts it   to help the government better comply with the Voting Rights Act  But the Justice Department has been enforcing the 1965 law  which was passed to help protect minority groups  political rights  with citizenship data already available from other government surveys Meantime  civil rights groups and states with higher shares of immigrant populations such as California and New York cite a greater harm to the political rights of minority groups if a citizenship question in the decennial census dissuades immigrants from participating  resulting in diminished representation in the U S  House Not since 1950 has the census collected citizenship data from the whole population The Supreme Court this month is hearing the Trump administration s appeal of a federal judge s ruling in New York that Ross  whose department oversees the census  violated federal law by making an  arbitrary and capricious  decision that twisted contrary evidence  A judge in California also has ruled that a citizenship question would violate the Constitution s requirement to count the population    Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

WASHINGTON   Several Democratic presidential candidates have released fundraising totals for the first quarter of 2019  offering an early measure of how they re faring on the campaign circuit Full details won t be available until campaigns file detailed disclosures with the Federal Election Commission ahead of the April 15 deadline  Here are some developments so far BERNIE SANDERSVermont Sen  Bernie Sanders says his campaign has raised  18 2 million in the 41 days since he launched his Democratic presidential bid   without holding any conventional fundraising events He has  28 million cash on hand  picking up where he left off four years ago in his ultimately unsuccessful bid for the party s presidential nomination Sanders  total could ultimately top all Democratic candidates  and it shows that the senator maintains a wide base following his 2016 bid  His campaign says he has about 525 000 individual donors who chipped in 900 000 contributions  with 88  of his total haul coming from small donors who gave  200 or less Campaign manager Faiz Shakir said the average contribution was  20 and that about 20  of the donors are new Some other key measures the campaign offered  Sanders  donor list includes nearly 100 000 registered independents and 20 000 registered Republicans  a majority of donors are under 40 years old And perhaps the most glaring number for Sanders  opponents  99 99  of his contributors have not given the maximum  2 800   meaning they can contribute again KAMALA HARRISThe California senator s campaign says it collected  12 million from more than 218 000 individual contributions  Harris is running both an aggressive digital fundraising campaign targeting smaller donors  but also is sticking the tried and true fundraising circuit in which she collects larger checks from donors The Harris campaign said 98  of her contributions were under  100  They ve not yet detailed what percentage of her overall collections came from those smaller donors PETE BUTTIGIEGMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend  Indiana  can t match Sanders or Harris  but his  7 million haul may be the most impressive of anyone  And he hasn t even officially announced his candidacy  instead raising money for his exploratory committee It shows that the 37 year old longshot is resonating as he travels to early nominating states  It also essentially guarantees that he will qualify for the Democratic National Committee s June and July debates  For the first time  party officials have set grassroots fundraising thresholds as part of the qualifications for the initial debate stages The debates will be a prime opportunity for underdogs like Buttigieg to gain name recognition and stature alongside perceived front runners like Sanders  Harris and others Buttigieg said the first quarter results were  way ahead  of the campaign s original goals or what people thought he could do  He said 158 550 donors contributed to the effort  with an average contribution of about  36  Of the  7 million raised  64  came from people donating  200 or less  This is a great look for our first quarter   he told supporters at a Monday event     Barrow reported from Atlanta  Associated Press reporter Sara Burnett contributed from Chicago     Follow the reporters on Twitter at https   twitter com jmsummers and https   twitter com BillBarrowAP

TOPEKA  Kan    Top Republican lawmakers in Kansas appear skittish about being able to block Medicaid expansion  offering political cover to moderate GOP colleagues if they back off their push for an expansion this year State Senate President Susan Wagle told reporters Tuesday that GOP leaders plan to have a legislative committee study Medicaid expansion this summer and fall  She said the panel would review proposals that could generate broader support among Republicans  such as a work requirement or drug testing for people receiving the expanded coverage Democratic Gov  Laura Kelly has made expanding Medicaid health coverage for as many as 150 000 additional Kansas residents one of her top priorities after her Republican predecessors thwarted it  Expansion has bipartisan support  but conservative Republicans who oppose it hold key positions in the GOP controlled Legislature Expansion opponents prevented even a legislative committee vote on a plan until supporters forced a debate in the House two weeks ago and passed a modified version of Kelly s plan  The Senate has yet to take up the bill  and expansion supporters are trying to pressure that chamber s GOP leaders into allowing a vote while working on ways to maneuver around them  If it passes  it will be a plan that s affordable for Kansas and it will be catered to our needs   said Wagle  a conservative Wichita Republican who s been a strong expansion opponent   We re willing and open to discuss it  but we want to do the right thing  GOP leaders have argued that Medicaid expansion will be too expensive for Kansas  even with the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act s promise that the federal government will cover most of the cost  Wagle also argued that state lawmakers should wait to see whether Congress overhauls health care again  but President Donald Trump on Tuesday deferred his push for a GOP alternative until after the 2020 election Thirty six states have expanded Medicaid or have seen voters approve ballot initiatives  The federal government would cover 90 percent of the cost for Kansas State Rep  Susan Concannon  a moderate western Kansas Republican who supports Medicaid expansion  said GOP leaders are  feeling the heat  of popular support for it and further study is a  stall tactic  to get them through this year  I have a feeling their districts are starting to show their support for Medicaid expansion as well  and this is their effort to respond   said Sen  Randall Hardy  another GOP moderate from central Kansas Kelly called on legislators to pass an expansion bill this week  Lawmakers are scheduled to begin an annual spring break Saturday and reconvene May 1 to wrap up business for the year  Enough is enough   Kelly told reporters during a news conference   No more stall tactics  No more bait and switch  No more excuses  Kelly s administration estimates that the net cost of an expansion to Kansas would be  34 million during its first full year  Republican leaders believe the figure is far too low Wagle said legislators need months to review what other states have done  study what limits the Trump administration might allow and examine alternatives to Kelly s plan  We want to put caveats in   Wagle said   We want time to look at those  But expansion supporters said an expansion plan will pass the Senate this year if backers can engineer a vote  Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley  a Topeka Democrat  dismissed Wagle s arguments for further study  It s a position of weakness   he said    Follow John Hanna on Twitter  https   twitter com apjdhanna   

SINGAPORE   Singapore submitted wide ranging fake news legislation in parliament on Monday  stoking fears from internet firms and human rights groups that it may give the government too much power and hinder freedom of speech The law would require social media sites like Facebook to carry warnings on posts the government deems false and remove comments against  public interest  The move came two days after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said governments should play a more active role in regulating the online platform But Simon Milner  who works on Facebook s public policy in Asia  said after the law was tabled  the firm was  concerned with aspects of the law that grant broad powers to the Singapore executive branch to compel us to remove content they deem to be false and proactively push a government notification to users   As the most far reaching legislation of its kind to date  this level of overreach poses significant risks to freedom of expression and speech  and could have severe ramifications both in Singapore and around the world   said Jeff Paine  managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition  an industry association of internet and technology companies in the region Speaking to reporters on Monday  Singapore s Law Minister K  Shanmugam said the new legislation would not hinder free speech  This legislation deals with false statements of facts  It doesn t deal with opinions  it doesn t deal with viewpoints  You can have whatever viewpoints however reasonable or unreasonable   he said  Tech giants Facebook  Twitter and Google all have their Asia headquarters in the city state  a low tax finance hub seen as a island of stability in the middle of the fast growing but often turbulent Southeast Asia region  MALICIOUS ACTORS Singapore  which has been run by the same political party since independence from Britain more than 50 years ago  says it is vulnerable to fake news because of its position as a global financial hub  its mixed ethnic and religious population and widespread internet access It is ranked 151 among 180 countries rated in the World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders  a non government group that promotes freedom of information  below the likes of Russia and Myanmar The new bill proposes that the government get online platforms to publish warnings or  corrections  alongside posts carrying false information  without removing them  This would be the  primary response  to counter falsehoods online  the Law Ministry said   That way  in a sense  people can read whatever they want and make up their minds  That is our preference   Law Minister K  Shanmugam told reporters on Monday  Under the proposals  which must be approved by parliament  criminal sanctions including hefty fines and jail terms will be imposed if the falsehoods are spread by  malicious actors  who  undermine society   the ministry said  without elaborating It added that it would cut off an online site s  ability to profit   without shutting it down  if the site had published three falsehoods that were  against the public interest  over the previous six months It did not say how it would block a site s profit streams  The bill came amid talk of a possible general election this year  Law Minister Shanmugam declined to comment when asked if the new legislation was related to a vote  This draft law will be a disaster for human rights  particularly freedom of expression and media freedom   said Phil Robertson  deputy director  Asia division  at Human Rights Watch   The definitions in the law are broad and poorly defined  leaving maximum regulatory discretion to the government officers skewed to view as  misleading  or  false  the sorts of news that challenge Singapore s preferred political narratives     Additional reporting by Aradhana Aravindan  Editing by Nick Macfie  Mark Heinrich and Michael Perry  

Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  This week  hundreds of readers shared their reactions to the unfolding accusations against Joe Biden by women who said he had kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable Many readers defended the former vice president as a product of a different time and questioned if the  MeToo movement had gone too far  Others insisted that making a woman feel uncomfortable has always been wrong Since Lucy Flores  a former Nevada state assemblywoman  made public her accusations against Mr  Biden last Friday  multiple women have come forward  telling The Times  The Washington Post and others that he made them feel uncomfortable  bringing the total to seven as of Thursday afternoon  Mr  Biden released a video on Wednesday vowing to  be more mindful and respectful of people s personal space   though he stopped short of apologizing Here is a selection of our readers  responses  which came from emails sent by On Politics readers  as well as comments across our site  They have been lightly edited for clarity Many of you defended Mr  Biden  saying he was from an older generation when social mores around physical contact were different I am 68  a bit younger than Joe Biden  But I am from a big Irish family and we are always kissing and hugging people  It was an expression of welcome and warmth  Now I understand in this MeToo movement that there are those who are uncomfortable with such intimate physical expressions  So now that Joe has been called out on it  it is up to him to show his changed behavior if indeed he runs for president  which I hope he does    Sally Ziegenfuss  PennsylvaniaI m a 70 year old woman who has always thought that male attention that might involve non intimate touching was something to be pleased about  even proud of  This is definitely a generational issue and younger women need to have perspective and understand that what was very acceptable in the past  even a couple of years ago  should not and cannot be judged by today s standards    Ellen Goodman  MassachusettsBack in the  60s this issue didn t exist  It was a different time  When will we stop looking back over our collective shoulders  and move forward    Whitney Devlin  74  New York But many others said Mr  Biden s age was no excuse for his actions I am in my 60s  Regardless of age or habitat  Joe Biden s touchy feely actions with women  and men  allegedly  are disgusting and inappropriate  I don t believe they arise out of innocent affection  though he may have himself convinced  They arise out of unconscious male privilege and are demeaning and distressing to those on the receiving end    Joan Weis  CaliforniaMen of his generation assumed that the  affection  being given would be welcomed and appreciated  particularly since it was being given by a man in power  The problem has been that nobody bothered to ask the women or girls     Lori Abbott Moreland  Sacramento  Calif This is not a generational misunderstanding  Biden s licentious behavior  let s call it what it is  was never the norm and not what most women wanted or expected    Dwight Dekeyser  63  Cherry Hill  N J Joe Biden is facing a moment of  white man privilege   Just because HE didn t think that gently rubbing shoulders and kissing the back of her head wasn t inappropriate doesn t mean this incident can be dismissed as paternal or innocent  It is the woman s feelings about the kiss touch that matter He lives in a different era and is no longer relevant to most generations  He needs to step aside    Sandra Mathews  51  Madison  N J Some readers said they worried the  MeToo movement risked going off course Is this where we re heading  to ban  jokes  hugs and kisses  from the public sphere  Early on we baby boomers rejected the stiff formalities of an earlier generation for an easy physicality  an appreciative give and take across gender lines that graced daily life with moments of lightness and warmth  Do we really want to push the Joe Bidens and Al Frankens from our lives  Maybe it s generational  but I fear we re losing something I ve long cherished   MeTooMuch    Millie Olson  CaliforniaAs a college student warned constantly about the dangers of life on campus  I worry that the legacy of the MeToo movement will not be empowerment for women  but a generation of women terrified of interaction with males  who see any physical intimacy as a threat When men kiss me on the head or squeeze my shoulders  it does make me uncomfortable  But does it make me uncomfortable because it is creepy or because I have been told I should find it creepy  I hope the pendulum will soon swing back to a more reasonable and thoughtful  less knee jerk political and cultural climate    Meg Edwards  OhioThis story personifies exactly what is wrong with the  MeToo movement  It started off as a positive force  bringing to light predatory behavior  and now we ve gotten to the point where a squeeze or a nuzzle is horrific This is exactly why the Democrats  who I am one of  will lose the 2020 election  We are eating our own  and to what end    Monica Evenson  47  Los Angeles Special thanks to Lela Moore from The Times s Reader Center for help with today s newsletter  To add your own

 Bernie Sanders   18 2 million  525 000 donors  Kamala Harris   12 million  138 000 donors  Beto O Rourke   9 4 million  218 000 donors  Pete Buttigieg   7 million  158 550 donors  Andrew Yang   1 7 million  80 000 donorsWhat do these numbers tell us With early polls largely measuring name recognition  these self reported numbers give us the firmest comparison of strength in a crowded field  More donors  theoretically  means more support For lesser known candidates  the number of donors tells us whether they re likely to qualify for the June debate   a critical opportunity to speak to a larger audience What don t these numbers tell us These are the totals released by the campaigns  so they re going to present the rosiest possible picture  The full filings will be officially released by the Federal Election Commission on April 15   Tax day comes for everyone  it seems  This isn t a perfect comparison because the candidates entered the race at different times over the past three months  Candidates tend to get a big boost of donations when they first enter a race  Whether they can sustain that momentum is an open   and critical   question How do these early numbers compare to past years Pretty dismally  actually  Check out this chart by the Center for Responsive Politics  which compares these numbers to the first quarter fund raising in 2008  the last time both parties faced such an open race Barack Obama s haul of  25 7 million  which neared Hillary Clinton s  26 1 million total  was seen as a significant victory for the then Illinois senator  The fact that today s candidates aren t raising that kind of dough indicates that the race remains wide open                     What to read tonight  In China  high tech surveillance  neighborhood watchers and a constant police presence have turned an entire city into a prison   The details of the most expensive divorce in history are out  MacKenzie Bezos will get 25 percent of the Amazon stock she owned with her husband  and the richest person in the world   Jeff Bezos  Her share is worth about  36 billion   Inspired by the Joe Biden news  a Times science reporter looked at decades of scientific and psychological research on why intrusions of personal space make us so uncomfortable                       SeriouslyThe president tweeted a meme today   No matter how many times we write that sentence  it never sounds any less weird   This one featured a 15 second animated video mocking Joe Biden                      Were you forwarded this newsletter  Subscribe here to get it delivered to your

BRUSSELS   With Britain still feverishly discussing its Brexit plans  the other 27 European Union states are preparing their joint stance for a top level summit with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday  Nearly three years since the shock referendum vote to leave the EU  Britain s political chaos has forced May to ask the bloc for a second Brexit delay Britain was originally due to leave on March 29 but the current date is April 12  Any further postponement would need to be approved unanimously by the 27 nations staying on together after Brexit  And they feel increasingly fatigued Playing the bad cop  European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said on Monday the bloc s patience was wearing thin  On Tuesday  European Council President Donald Tusk took a softer tack  telling the EU   Let us be patient  A balance between the EU s growing exasperation and patience with Brexit will shape the strategic position the 27 adopt at the April 10 summit  Here are the pros and cons of the main options from the bloc s point of view  NO DEALUnless something else is agreed  Britain will crash out from the bloc as soon as April 12  The EU talks of growing risk of no deal Brexit almost daily  partly because it is current legal reality but also to scare the factious UK parliament into accepting the divorce deal May sealed with the bloc but which British lawmakers have rejected three times France has led EU states in adopting a tough line toward Britain and calling for accepting no deal to end the Brexit uncertainty as soon as possible  But the EU appetite for the most damaging break is low and exposed countries like Ireland and Belgium are not fully prepared to manage ensuing disruptions  German Chancellor Angela Merkel s strong opposition to no deal Brexit and the bloc s wariness of being assigned blame for any abrupt split means this is not the most likely scenario for next week SECOND  SHORT BREXIT DELAYBetween preparing for the worst case scenario and plotting a long delay  the EU has been somewhat caught by surprise by May s request for a second  unspecified but short lag  The bloc is waiting to see what comes out of May s talks with the opposition Labour Party to break the parliamentary impasse over Brexit It says London must relay its plan for the summit on Monday or Tuesday morning at the latest to ensure enough time for coordination among the other 27 capitals before the Wednesday evening talks between leaders Several EU diplomats said they thought May 22 was as late as a short delay could possibly go  with that date clearly shaping up as the limit of the bloc s tolerance  They fear anything beyond that would risk compromising the functioning of the EU Juncker said on Wednesday that London would not get another short delay to Brexit unless the UK parliament approves the stalled EU divorce agreement by April 12 KICKING IT INTO THE LONG GRASS For Britain to be allowed to stay much longer  the EU 27 have set a firm condition that it must take part in elections to the European Parliament on May 23 26  They have given London until April 12 to state its intentions EU diplomats discussed in recent days possible postponements of Brexit until the end of 2019  for a year until next spring or even going as far as the end of 2020  Their Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has been vocal about the high economic and political costs of keeping Britain in much longer  as the bloc elects its new parliament and replaces the executive European Commission  It will also be setting its next joint budget for 2021 27 The bloc is considering adding a  sincere cooperation  condition to that option  a gentleman s agreement to minimize any risk that Britain could stall the EU s agenda and vital processes  or undermine its operations or the legitimacy of its key institutions  EU diplomats said that could include Britain removing itself from discussions on the next budget or selecting the new European Commission   Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska  Editing by Catherine Evans  

BRASILIA   Brazil s far right President Jair Bolsonaro appealed to leaders of five big centrist parties on Thursday to back his pension reform plan  resorting to the traditional political methods he had condemned during the election campaign The government s deputy Senate whip  Senator Izalci Lucas  told Reuters that Bolsonaro had done well to form a cabinet without political interference  But parties will now get to share some 2 000 second level federal jobs and have a say on public works that favor their members  districts Bolsonaro  a longtime fringe Congressman  won the top office by criticizing the corruption and extensive horse trading of Brazilian coalition politics  Those practices directly led to the country s  Car Wash  scandal  which has been called the largest political graft investigation ever  in which billions of dollars in kickbacks were funneled through politically appointed executives at state run companies and parties To end that  Bolsonaro pledged during his campaign not to use those methods and has tried to govern without embracing a base of parties across the ideological spectrum  But with 30 parties in Brazil s unwieldy Congress  getting any bill through requires deft negotiating Just over 100 days into Bolsonaro s presidency  his flagship legislative proposal to overhaul the costly pension system and save more than 1 trillion reais   260 billion  over the next decade has gained no traction in Congress  to the dismay of the market The inability of his government to organize backing for the long awaited but deeply unpopular reform bill  which most economists say is vital to shore up Brazil s public deficit and avoid slipping back into recession  was on crystal clear display on Wednesday That s when Economy Minister Paulo Guedes was grilled during an acrimonious  six hour lower house committee hearing and received virtually no support  even from lawmakers within Bolsonaro s own party  The session was cut short after leftist congressmen opposed to the reform traded insults with Guedes   NEW DIALOGUE  Bolsonaro met separately with the heads of five centrist parties on Thursday  all of whom back pension reform in principle but want to see the president s version revised   This meeting marks the beginning of a new dialogue where we can express our concerns and build bridges to guarantee the legislative agenda advances   ACM Neto  head of the powerful Democrats party  told reporters after meeting Bolsonaro Geraldo Alckmin  former Sao Paulo governor and head of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party  said the pension system must be reformed  But he is opposed to changes that reduce benefits for rural  elderly and disabled workers After the meetings  Bolsonaro said in a Facebook live video that he expects Congress to pass the bill  and added that no government job offers were discussed with the party leaders  His chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni told reporters that the president will meet with more leaders next week House Speaker Rodrigo Maia and other key lawmakers have said they were losing patience with the government s refusal to negotiate and called on Bolsonaro and his backers to stop trying to govern the country via Twitter  which Bolsonaro says he counts on to get his message directly to voters  As the political chaos has deepened  Brazilian market volatility has risen  triggering sharp declines in the currency and stocks  and a spike in bond yields  Markets have settled this week  but investors expect volatility to remain high  While a recent decree issued by the government sets qualification requirements for federal jobs  the parties will now be able to put qualified names forward  Izalci said  He is correcting the mistake  By drawing closer to the parties he will get their support   Izalci said   Now things will start moving    Reporting by Anthony Boadle  Additional reporting by Lisandra Paraguassu  Editing by Daniel Wallis  

RICHMOND  Va    Virginia Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax said Wednesday he s asked prosecutors in Boston and North Carolina to investigate sexual assault allegations two women have made against him Speaking at a news conference  Fairfax again said the allegations are untrue and the sexual encounters he had with the women were consensual His lawyer has contacted prosecutors in Boston and Durham  North Carolina  where the women say the assaults took place  and have asked them to investigate the allegations  Fairfax said  He said he would cooperate fully with the investigations  I knew that the allegations against me were false from the moment I first heard them   he said Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson leveled their accusations against Fairfax in February  Tyson says Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex in 2004  Watson says Fairfax raped her in 2000 when both were students at Duke University The Associated Press typically does not identify people who say they were sexually assaulted  but Tyson and Watson stepped forward voluntarily and have expressed a desire to testify in public Their allegations have received new attention after televised interviews this week with CBS News in which they tearfully described their experiences Fairfax said the news media attention has been painful to him and his family  Sensationalizing allegations does not make them true  Yet airing salacious allegations without evidence does enormous damage   Fairfax said Both women have indicated a desire to testify before state lawmakers  who could impeach Fairfax  Republican lawmakers said they are willing to hold a hearing  but Democrats have balked  saying the allegations should be investigated by law enforcement Republican Majority Leader Del  Todd Gilbert said both women made compelling appearances during their CBS interviews and deserved a forum to share their stories with the General Assembly  If anybody who watched that wasn t moved by it  then I would say their heart isn t in the right place   Gilbert said A former prosecutor  Gilbert said he does not believe a legislative hearing would impede any criminal investigation There s been no indication there exists any ongoing law enforcement investigations Jake Wark  a spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney s Office in Massachusetts declined to comment on the status of any sexual assaults investigations in general  or the Fairfax matter in particular  Officials in North Carolina did not immediately respond to a request for comment Fairfax said he is confident law enforcement personnel will reach the same conclusions as a polygraph test he said he s releasing Wednesday that showed he is innocent  Fairfax released a polygraph report conducted by a former FBI agent that said Fairfax did not appear to lie when he answered questions about whether he d assaulted Tyson and Watson Gilbert scoffed at the polygraph test  saying it did not clear Fairfax s name and numerous criminals have successfully duped such tests in the past  Ted Bundy passed a polygraph   Gilbert said The accusations made against Fairfax were part of a series of scandals in early February that upended Virginia politics The women leveled their allegations against Fairfax at a moment when he seemed poised to ascend to the governor s post  Virginia Gov  Ralph Northam was facing numerous calls to resign after a racist photo showing a person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume was found on his medical school yearbook page Then  the next in line after Fairfax  Attorney General Mark Herring  acknowledged he appeared in a photo wearing blackface as a student at the University of Virginia  and the prospect of all three statewide officeholders leaving and handing power to Republicans cooled demands for their resignations  Northam  Fairfax and Herring  all Democrats  have remained in office and at the head of their party ahead of November elections in which Democrats hope to gain control of the General Assembly    Associated Press writer Ben Finley in Norfolk  Virginia  contributed to this report

In May 1987  Senator Gary Hart of Colorado was drummed out of the Democratic presidential contest following reports alleging an affair with Donna Rice  a 29 year old woman who was not his wife Months later  Douglas Ginsburg  a federal judge whom President Ronald Reagan had nominated for the Supreme Court  admitted that he had smoked marijuana years before  including as a young law professor  scuttling his candidacy The next summer  the Republican presidential nominee  George Bush  chose the little known Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his running mate  leading to a frantic investigation into how Mr  Quayle had gotten into the Indiana National Guard instead of serving in the Vietnam War   Rumors  never proven  also swirled about affairs and pot use   Mr  Quayle stayed on the ticket  but never quite recovered The late 1980s and 1990s marked a high water mark for a kind of giddy journalistic derangement over politicians  adultery  drug use and draft avoidance   a somewhat arbitrary trio of offenses inflated into mortal sins  Candidates and nominees for various public positions were barraged with questions on these issues  although no one ever showed that they bore on a person s fitness for office  These orgies of saturation press coverage  feverish speculation and moral righteousness were dubbed feeding frenzies In time  the manias subsided  Bill Clinton was elected president as an admitted philanderer  Barack Obama confessed to having used  a little blow  in his youth and no one cared  Not one of our baby boomer presidents served in Vietnam   a fact that troubles few people today So are we now able to evaluate aspirants for high office dispassionately  on the basis of their experience  achievements and qualifications  It sure isn t looking that way  More likely  we have just dropped one bucket of shark bait and picked up another We are now witnessing a feeding frenzy over Joe Biden s penchant for sometimes unwelcome public displays of affection  Mr  Biden  who is famous for overly tactile friendliness  has been dealing with two women s charges that he upset them by greeting them far too intimately  Pundits are now discussing whether these actions should end Mr  Biden s  as yet unannounced  presidential candidacy and even declaring point blank that he is the wrong man to succeed President Trump Charges about inappropriate touching must be heard and evaluated  But the more difficult question for journalists is whether these charges should become grounds for feeding frenzies   all consuming  multi day stories that  by virtue of their blanket coverage  signal to audiences that they outweigh everything else about a candidate  Front page stories  24 7 coverage and viral tweets can easily knock someone out of contention  Should they  How the press handles Mr  Biden s penchant for handling others will test whether it has learned from its mistakes in the days of Hart and Ginsburg and Quayle A historical lens may help us see things with a bit more dispassion  The media obsession with a specific set of gotcha issues  the conviction that they warrant an expenditure of vast journalistic resources  dates to the years after the Vietnam War and Watergate  Chastened by those national traumas  Americans  including journalists  concluded that they had sprung from the debauched or deformed characters of President Johnson and especially President Nixon   Character  became the watchword in politics But character was defined at once too vaguely and too narrowly  The imperative to evaluate character was too broad in that it gave journalists license to vet aspirants for the presidency  as well as for the Supreme Court  Cabinet appointments and other offices  by prying into their personal lives Yet it was also too narrow  because the peculiar foibles that the press fixated on were hardly sufficient to adequately judge someone s integrity or maturity or temperament  The issues of sex  drugs  and Vietnam loomed large for reporters of the Baby Boom generation because they provided an arena in which to work through unresolved feelings about the cultural transformations of the 1960s Eventually  the maturation of Generation X   whose members were largely unfazed by tales of sex  pot and draft dodging   diminished the potential of the boomers  pet issues to blossom into scandal  More broadly  the public was wearying of hyped up controversies that  it was becoming clear  had little or no relevance to how a politician performed his or her job Recently  though  America experienced another trauma  The election of Donald Trump   a rank misogynist and confessed sexual assaulter   over a woman seemingly destined to be America s first female president jolted many voters  Among its other effects  Trump s election helped spark the explosion of women s activism we have seen since 2016  including the long overdue insistence that we call sexual harassers and assaulters to account  If Mr  Trump couldn t be stopped  others guilty of like offenses would be policed with new vigor As many people recognize  however  for all the big shots  predators and cads rightly brought to justice  there have also been moments of excess   of sober judgment suspended  Most infamously  in late 2017  following multiple claims of inappropriate touching  the Senate peremptorily cast out Minnesota s Al Franken  before an ethics investigation could even occur  Mr  Franken denied that his actions amounted to sexual harassment  and apologized for them anyway  But when two new stories were posted to the internet in early December  his senate colleague Kirsten Gillibrand led a parade of lawmakers who demanded he give up his seat Like Gary Hart  Mr  Franken cannot blame others entirely  since he chose to step down  But a lot of Americans had and still have grave qualms about the lack of due process he was afforded  Clearly  both the media and the political class bore some responsibility for ratcheting up the pressure on him  instead of calling   as they could have   for cool deliberation to determine what actually happened  how severe his offenses were  and whether they should overshadow the many reasons his constituents might wish him to keep serving  as polls suggested they did  It is possible to cover stories such as these without creating feeding frenzies  Journalists can run fewer stories on a subject  talk about it once a day on cable news and not every hour  assume a matter of fact tone  remind themselves that Twitter isn t public opinion  question scandal material shopped by someone s political rivals  and in other ways bear in mind that many people deplore the media proclivity for these furors  When scandals relating to personal behavior arise  they can also ask themselves whether those behaviors reflect at all on how the politician might deal with Vladimir Putin  restore democracy to Venezuela  solve an immigration crisis or economic meltdown  or develop a plan for addressing health care costs or planetary dangers  And thoughtful coverage can illuminate the immense differences between  for example  Mr  Biden s occasionally cringe worthy physicality and Mr  Trump s contempt filled view of women as veritable pieces of meat Without such a tempered media environment  though  it is easy to imagine Mr  Biden or other candidates succumbing to media pressure as Mr  Franken did  without any careful weighing of the nature  severity and relevance of the alleged wrongdoing  Nonetheless  in our scandal soaked past there have also been politicians who withstood a media battering only to find their courage rewarded with the news that the public supported them all along   and that the headlines and headline news did not reflect popular opinion In 1989  for example  after disclosures that Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank had hired a male prostitute and kept the man on his payroll  many politicians  along with the Boston Globe  called on the congressman to resign  Mr  Frank resisted the pressure  submitted himself to the judgment of his constituents  and was reelected twelve more times Read moreOpinion coverage of Joe Biden Opinion   Ross Douthat  The Real Joe Biden DecisionApril 2  2019Opinion   Michelle Goldberg  The Wrong Time for Joe BidenApril 1  2019Opinion   David Leonhardt  In Biden s DefenseApril 2  2019Bill Clinton  too  stoutly rejected the pundits  calls during the Monica Lewinsky scandal that he abdicate  and he withstood impeachment by a Republican controlled House of Representatives  His approval ratings soared as the drama dragged on  showing again that voters don t always agree when a media mob calls for a politician s head More recently  Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia was found to have displayed a photo in his medical school yearbook of a student in blackface beside another one in Klan robes  Despite a cascade of calls for his resignation  he instead vowed to redouble his commitment to racial justice   and  a short while later  it turned out that most African Americans in the state wanted him to stay put These politicians at some level appreciated that a feeding frenzy is typically not a mirror but a distortion of public opinion  Consciously or intuitively  most of us know that public morality is distinct from private morality   that a great president or Supreme Court justice can be a flawed or rotten person  and a noble soul might be a lousy senator or governor   Of course  we can all think of a horrible human being who also made a terrible president   We need to remember that when we grill candidates about the taboo du jour  we aren t helping ourselves understand their suitability for leadership but rather working through other cultural concerns As for character  the real test of it may be whether a politician has the fortitude and self confidence to brave the media storm David Greenberg is a professor of history and of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University and the

WASHINGTON   The NATO secretary general gave a strong defense of the 70 year old military alliance between Europe and the United States  using a high profile appearance before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to urge allies to stand up to a more assertive Russia While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not looking for a new Cold War with Moscow  the alliance s leader  Jens Stoltenberg  said it was important to not be  nave  about the Kremlin s intentions  Proffering a long list of Russian actions that threaten NATO allies  including the annexation of Crimea  the use of a nerve agent in Britain and Moscow s interference in democratic elections  Mr  Stoltenberg cited  a pattern of Russian behavior  that calls for the alliance to be more united than ever in its response  NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence   Mr  Stoltenberg said at the Capitol  He was in Washington for a meeting of foreign ministers from NATO member states But his remarks came in the middle of a poorly timed squabble between two of the alliance s fractious members   the United States and Turkey   with Russia as the potential beneficiary  Earlier this week  the Pentagon announced that it was halting the delivery of parts for F 35 fighter jets to Turkey because Ankara is pursuing plans to buy S 400 missile defense systems from Russia American officials do not want Turkey to purchase the Russian system and have warned that it could collect information on United States stealth fighter jets The Turkish foreign minister  Mevlut Cavusoglu  was adamant in a separate alliance event in Washington on Wednesday that Ankara will not budge   It s a done deal   he said   Turkey doesn t have to choose between Russia and any others  and we don t see our relationship with Russia as an alternative to others  But the Trump administration  so far  is being equally adamant  Turkey must choose   Vice President Mike Pence said at a NATO anniversary event   Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history  or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making such reckless decisions that undermine our alliance  Mr  Stoltenberg  in his speech before Congress  did not directly reference the F 35 squabble  But he characterized fights among alliance partners as  democracy   Open discussions and different views is not a sign of weakness   Mr  Stoltenberg said   It is a sign of strength  He also reaffirmed NATO s core mandate of collective defense   that an attack on one member state is viewed as an attack on all 29  But in doing so  Mr  Stoltenberg aired a principle that President Trump has questioned  exposing the new rift that has developed between his administration and the United States  most important allies Wednesday s speech was the first time that a secretary general of the alliance has been invited to speak on Congress s most high profile stage  and the platform afforded to Mr  Stoltenberg was in many ways a sign of lawmakers  concerns over Mr  Trump s commitment to NATO Mr  Stoltenberg  a careful diplomat  made no criticism of Mr  Trump  and instead credited the president with prodding the alliance to spend more on defense  Still  the overall theme of Mr  Stoltenberg s speech was to make the case for NATO  the value of which Mr  Trump has often questioned Lawmakers gave Mr  Stoltenberg a series of standing ovations  Legislation that has bipartisan support is making its way through Congress  and would explicitly prohibit any president from withdrawing the United States from the alliance without Senate approval In his speech  which was peppered with political and personal details  Mr  Stoltenberg said the military alliance has been good not just for Europe  but for the United States as well  He reminded lawmakers that the only time NATO has invoked Article 5   the pact of collective defense following attacks   was after the terrorist strikes against the United States on Sept  11  2001  The strength of a nation   Mr  Stoltenberg said   is not only measured by the size of its economy or the number of its soldiers  but also by the number of its friends   And through NATO  the United States has more friends and allies than any other power   he said   This has made the United States stronger  safer and more secure

WASHINGTON   The Democratic head of a powerful U S  House committee asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of President Donald Trump s personal and business tax returns on Wednesday  in a long awaited move widely expected to lead to a long court battle with the White House The request  in a letter from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig  is viewed by Democrats in the House of Representatives as a vital first step toward oversight of Trump s income taxes and business network  which some lawmakers believe could be rife with conflicts of interest and potential tax law violations  It is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials  To maintain trust in our democracy  the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly  as laws intend   Neal said in a statement IRS and U S  Treasury officials were not immediately available for comment Trump defied decades of precedent as a presidential candidate by refusing to release the tax documents and has continued to keep them under wraps as president  saying his returns were  under audit  by the IRS  Trump s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recently testified in Congress that he did not believe the president was being audited but may have used the audit claim to avoid scrutiny that could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties  Trump was dismissive of the request but continued to make the audit argument in comments to reporters during a meeting with U S  military leaders on Wednesday   Is that all   the president asked when told Democrats wanted to see six years of his returns   Usually it s 10  so I guess they re giving up   he said   I ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name  you re audited  But until such time as I m not under audit  I would not be inclined to do that   Neal based his request on his committee s oversight jurisdiction of the IRS  specifically its alleged audits of Trump and the extent to which the agency has enforced the tax laws against the president  OVERSIGHT PRESSURECongressional Republicans oppose Neal s effort  saying such a move sets a dangerous precedent by turning the confidential tax documents of a U S  citizen into a political weapon  This particular request is an abuse of the tax writing committees  statutory authority and violates the intent and safeguards of     the Internal Revenue Code   Representative Kevin Brady  the committee s top Republican  said in a statement Independent analysts welcomed the move   The Ways and Means Committee s strongest oversight ability is making sure the IRS is operating properly   said Steve Rosenthal  a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank in Washington  It was the third time this week a Democratic led House committee exerted oversight pressure on Trump  Earlier on Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee authorized its chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full investigation report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed a former White House security chief on Tuesday Neal s committee initially planned to request only Trump s personal tax returns  But some Democrats and independent analysts pressed for them to include business returns to better gauge the president s activity in the private sector  The request includes returns for eight entities  Donald J Trump Revocable Trust  DJT Holdings LLC  DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC  DTTM Operations LLC  DTTM Operations Managing Member Corp  LFB Acquisition Member Corp  LFB Acquisition LLC and Trump National Golf Club A Democratic aide said the committee selected a manageable number of business entities that provide a vital window on Trump s business activity  Although Trump has never released his returns  the New York Times last year cited a  vast trove  of returns and financial records saying it showed he engaged in tax schemes including cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions of dollars in taxes  The White House called the report misleading    Reporting by David Morgan  Doina Chiacu and Alexandra Alper  Editing by Peter Cooney and G Crosse  

BENGHAZI  Libya TRIPOLI   Eastern Libyan military forces have moved to western Libya and were briefly locked in a skirmish with a rival force south of the capital Tripoli  an eastern official and residents said on Wednesday  in an escalation between rival camps in the oil producer The advance took diplomats and analysts by surprise  exploiting their focus on neighboring Algeria where President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on Tuesday after protests  to the relieve of Western countries valuing stability there Libya    in trouble since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011    is divided between the internationally recognized government in Tripoli and a parallel administration allied to Khalifa Haftar Haftar has turned into major player in the North African country  enjoying the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates which see him as bulwark against Islamists  His opponents see in him a new Gaddafi His forces control the east and recently expanded to southern Libya Now in a new escalation Haftar s Libyan National Army  LNA  moved in the past days discreetly forces west with the LNA media office publishing on Wednesday videos of troops traveling on a coastal road from Benghazi  the main eastern city In the evening a brief skirmish lasting one hour was reported near Gharyan  a town south of Tripoli between the LNA and forces allied to Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez al Serraj  who relied on patches of armed groups with flexible loyalties  Right now they are clashes south of Tripoli   in Gharyan   LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari told al Arabiya channel No casualty figures were or details were immediately available There was no immediate comment from the Tripoli government  which had issued earlier a general alert for its forces in response to the eastern advance  There is no military solution   Serraj said in the statement OFFENSIVE Analysts doubt the LNA is capable of launching a full scale attack as it has stretched itself with the southern advance and it also relies on tribesmen and other auxiliary forces Some diplomats say the advance is mainly a psychological campaign to pressure Serraj into a power sharing deal on eastern terms  allowing Haftar to become commander of a national army The confrontation is in any case a major setback for the U N and Western countries which have been trying to mediate between Serraj and Haftar  Both men had met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss a power sharing deal and a national conference is set to follow this month to agree on a road map for elections  Some of Haftar s supporters have called the U N  efforts a waste of time  urging him to carry out a military solution to establish himself as national army commander During the day the LNA had turned up pressure on Tripoli  warning of a military campaign to  liberate the homeland from terrorism   We expect the women of Tripoli to welcome the Libyan army like the women of Benghazi and Derna did   said Mismari  referring to two eastern cities which the LNA took by force Mismari also called on young people in Tripoli to focus on the battle between LNA and Daesh  or Islamic State  in another hint that military action might be looming The comments suggest the LNA might seek to takeover Tripoli working with local groups instead of seeking an invasion In January  the LNA  which is loyal to Haftar  started a campaign to take control of the south and its oilfields with a similar rhetoric The announcements coincided with the arrival in Tripoli of U N  Secretary General Antonio Guterres who is on a regional tour seeking to help avoid a confrontation between the rival Libyan camps On another potential frontline  a resident in Ras Lanuf  an oil town located on the coastal road  said tanks and military convoys were seen heading westwards in the direction of Sirte Sirte is in central Libya controlled by a force from the western city of Mistrata allied to the Tripoli administration Misrata  a port east of Tripoli  is home to powerful armed groups  which could match at least partly the firepower of LNA ground troops  analysts say  Haftar s forces enjoy air superiority   Reporting by Ayman al Warfalli  Ulf Laessing  Ahmed Elumami and Hesham Hajali  Writing by Ulf Laessing  Editing by William Maclean  James Dalgleish and Lisa Shumaker  

FALLS CHURCH  Va    House Republicans said Tuesday that they tried and failed to broker a deal with Democrats that would allow for a bipartisan public hearing in which two women who accuse Virginia Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax of sexual assault could testify under oath Republican Speaker Kirk Cox issued a statement blaming Democrats for refusing to participate in what he said would be a bipartisan hearing  effectively blocking any hearing from taking place  There should be no mistake about what has happened here  the alleged victims are seeking a bipartisan hearing  Republicans are seeking a bipartisan hearing  Democrats in the House of Delegates are refusing to allow that to happen   Cox said Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson leveled their accusations against Fairfax in February  Tyson says Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex in 2004  Watson says Fairfax raped her in 2000 when both were students at Duke University Their allegations have received new attention after televised interviews this week with CBS News in which they tearfully described their experiences Fairfax  a Democrat  has said his encounters with both women were consensual and says he took a polygraph test that determined he s telling the truth Both women have said they want to testify in front of the General Assembly  Cox  in his statement  said Republicans have reached out to both women and they are willing to share their stories at a legislative hearing  but only if there is bipartisan cooperation to conduct the hearing Cox released a letter he received from House Minority Leader Eileen Filler Corn in which she rejected Republicans  overtures for a joint hearing  Law enforcement officials are best equipped to investigate these matters  and we certainly would not want to harm their inquiries or deny due process to either the complainants or the Lieutenant Governor by conducting a hearing that could easily be exploited for political purposes   she wrote In a phone interview  Filler Corn noted that the House Democratic Caucus has called for Fairfax s resignation   You can t help but be moved by these women s stories   she said   They ve shown uncommon bravery  for sure  Fairfax has also said a law enforcement investigation is the better path  My accusers have not filed criminal charges and they have not sued me   Fairfax said in a written statement provided Monday to the AP   Instead  we see escalating media appearances and stated desire for a political process that is unprecedented in Virginia and could not be designed to get at the truth  Such a process would instead be a media circus used for partisan and political purposes  Cox s statement came a few hours after  CBS This Morning  aired a tearful interview with Watson in which she said she had been friends with him for more than a year before he locked her in a room and raped her  I completely trusted him   she said   It was a huge betrayal  He was my friend  I don t understand how you do that to someone that you ve been a friend to  She rejected Fairfax s claim the sex was consensual  saying Fairfax held her down during the attack   If you have to hold someone down  it s not consensual   she said The Associated Press typically does not identify people who say they were sexually assaulted  but Tyson and Watson stepped forward voluntarily and have expressed a desire to testify in public The women leveled their allegations against Fairfax at a moment when he seemed poised to ascend to the governor s post  Virginia Gov  Ralph Northam was facing numerous calls to resign after a racist photo showing a person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume was found on his medical school yearbook page Then  the next in line after Fairfax  Attorney General Mark Herring  acknowledged that he appeared in a photo wearing blackface as a student at the University of Virginia  and the prospect of all three statewide officeholders leaving and handing power to Republicans cooled demands for their resignations  Northam  Fairfax and Herring  all Democrats  have remained in office and at the head of their party ahead of November elections in which Democrats hope to gain control of the state Legislature  

CARACAS   Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro replaced his electricity minister on Monday in a move to address a series of blackouts plaguing the country  while opposition leader Juan Guaido called on supporters to continue taking to the streets  In an address on state television  Maduro said he named Igor Gavidia  a 65 year old electrical engineer who was previously president of state power generator Electrificacion del Caroni  to replace Electricity Minister Luis Motta The change came as Maduro reiterated plans for a 30 day  load administration  plan  which he first mentioned last week and which Venezuelans widely assume will be a way to ration electricity  Some changes are needed to strengthen  take responsibility for  and develop the new phase of this plan   Maduro said  Oil rich Venezuela was rocked by a debilitating blackout on March 7  which dragged on for nearly a week in some parts of the country  Power has been intermittent since another blackout on March 25  and growing water shortages have aggravated the sense of crisis in a country where food and medicine are already scarce with an economy racked by hyperinflation Demonstrators took to the streets throughout Caracas on Sunday and Monday  with small groups of people blocking roads to demand water  On Sunday night  police fired gunshots after some residents in Caracas set up burning barricades  according to Reuters witnesses  Guaido  the leader of the opposition controlled National Assembly who in January invoked the country s constitution to assume an interim presidency in a challenge to Maduro s legitimacy  said it was  very clear that this regime has no solution to the crisis    Every time the power goes out  or we do not have water  or we do not have gas  guess what we are going to do   he said at an earlier rally at the country s Catholic University   We are going to protest  we are going to make demands  we are going to take to the streets of Venezuela  because it is our right   Guaido has been recognised by most Western and South American countries as the OPEC nation s rightful leader on the grounds that Maduro s May 2018 re election was illegitimate Power outages over the weekend prompted Venezuela s main oil terminal  Jose  to halt operations including crude exports  the lifeblood of the country s economy  It was the third time in a month that the port  which only restarted applications last Friday following last Monday s blackout  had stopped operations due to lack of electricity GUAIDO AND IMMUNITYBlackouts and water shortages have long been common in Venezuela  especially in the interior  But the outages in March were more frequent  more widespread and longer lasting than previous incidents  particularly in the capital  They have prompted the government to shorten the workday and cancel classes  though Maduro said school would resume on Wednesday  Maduro  a socialist who calls Guaido a puppet of the United States  has blamed the blackouts on  attacks  by the U S  government and the domestic opposition on the country s main hydroelectric facility  He has said Guaido should  face justice   but has not openly called for his arrest The pro government Supreme Court on Monday reiterated a previous measure blocking Guaido from leaving the country  a measure which he openly violated in February  It added that the Constituent Assembly  an all powerful legislature controlled by the Socialist Party  should discuss the issue of whether or not to strip Guaido of parliamentary immunity   a move that could pave the way for his being jailed But state institutions loyal to the Socialist Party appear reluctant to act against Guaido  given his strong public backing and international pressure not to detain him The chief prosecutor s office has opened an investigation of Guaido  but has not ordered his arrest or officially charged him with anything Maduro has not given details on his electricity load administration plan  which Venezuelans on social media interpreted as a programme of power rationing Maduro s critics reject his contention that the blackouts have been caused by attacks  Local electrical engineers consulted by Reuters said the years of underinvestment and lack of maintenance of the country s electrical infrastructure have contributed to the outages   Additional reporting by Brian Ellsworth  Angus Berwick and Luc Cohen  Editing by Lisa Shumaker  Bill Berkrotand Leslie Adler  

TRIPOLI BENGHAZI  Libya   After years of sabre rattling  eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar ordered his troops on Thursday to march on the capital Tripoli  escalating a conflict with the internationally recognized government Seeking to encircle the capital his forces approached from south and west  seizing one town south of the city before stopping for the night some 60 km  37 miles  south of Tripoli  eastern officials said The offensive marked a dramatic escalation of a power struggle that has dragged on in Libya since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 The capital is the ultimate prize for Haftar s eastern parallel government  In 2014 he assembled former Gaddafi soldiers and in a three year battle seized the main eastern city of Benghazi  then this year took the south with its oilfields The offensive surprised the United Nations  whose Secretary General Antonio Guterres flew on Wednesday to Tripoli to help organize a reconciliation national conference Asked about the offensive  Guterres said Libya needed a political  not a military  solution  His Libya envoy Ghassan Salame sat next to him stone faced with folded arms Guterres stayed in the fortified U N  compound on Tripoli s outskirts for the night and plans to meet Haftar on Friday  a U N  spokesman said But there was no sign that the east was willing to stop a move that was announced by Haftar in a speech full of talk about victory  To our army which is stationed at the outskirts of Tripoli  Today we complete our march   he said in an audio tape Haftar  called  Mushir  by supporters  which means  field marshal  in Arabic  has built his name by fighting Islamists  But many of his opponents see him as a new Muammar Since Gaddafi s downfall  the country has been divided between the U N  backed government in Tripoli and the parallel administration allied to Haftar Armed groups from the coastal city of Misrata  who oppose Haftar  moved to Tripoli to defend it  residents said The governments of France  Italy  the United Arab Emirates  Britain and the United States said in a joint statement that they were deeply concerned about the fighting  The offensive stared with the capture of Gharyan  a city some 80 km south of Tripoli after brief skirmishes with forces allied to Tripoli based Prime Minister Fayez al Serraj SETBACKThe offensive is a setback for the United Nations and Western countries which have been trying to mediate between Serraj and Haftar  who met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss a power sharing deal  The conference the U N  is helping to organize is aimed at forging agreement on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya  an oil producer and a hub for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara in the hope of reaching Europe Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates  which see him as bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily  according to U N  reports Haftar has also fostered ties with Saudi Arabia where he was received by King Salman last week  No details have emerged  but analysts say the visit likely helped him boost ties with ultra conservative Muslim Salafists  who are counted among his troops and follow Saudi preacher Rabae al Madkhali The Salafists are also based in the west of Libya including Tripoli  where a Salafist force controls the airport  It is allied to Serraj  but has changed sides before like other groups in the capital  Serraj has no full time troops The offensive followed the same pattern used by anti Gaddafi rebels in 2011  with the main thrust at Tripoli coming from the south  Gharyan is strategic because it is the last town before a coastal plain  and a base for fighters to fall back to if a battle for the capital drags on A group allied to Haftar also moved to take a checkpoint 27 km west of the capital  hoping to cut the coastal road to Tunisia  Tripoli s lifeline  residents said Haftar s biggest opponent is Misrata  a western city home to strong forces which also have aircraft  analysts say  It is known for resisting old regime figures  including in 2011 when forces loyal to Gaddafi besieged it for three months Evoking this spirit  members of Misrata armed groups said in video message they will they stop Haftar and his  zahaf   Arabic for crawl  a word used by Gaddafi for his popular marches   Reporting by Ulf Laessing  Ahmed Elumami  Ayman al Warfalli and Tom Miles  writing by Ulf Laessing  Editing by Andrew Heavens  Richard Chang and Daniel Wallis

DENVER   Colorado lawmakers gave final approval Wednesday to a measure that would dramatically change the way the state regulates its booming oil and gas industry  shifting the focus to protecting public health instead of encouraging production Democratic Gov  Jared Polis is expected to sign the measure  Opponents immediately announced an attempt to repeal and replace the measure Driven by majority Democrats  the bill survived fierce challenges from the industry and GOP lawmakers  who warned it could gravely damage a multibillion dollar industry Final passage came on a 19 16 party line vote in the Senate Conservation groups praised the bill as a step toward protecting people and the environment  These are the protections Coloradans are clamoring for   said Sam Gilchrist  Western campaigns director for the Natural Resources Defense Council   They re vital for our health and safety and are needed nationwide  Industry groups said it threatens a vital segment of the state economy  Our industry remains firmly opposed to this bill because it threatens one of the pillars of Colorado s economy   the Colorado Oil and Gas Association and the Colorado Petroleum Council said in a joint statement Colorado is a major energy producing state  ranking fifth in the nation for crude oil production and sixth in natural gas  But fast growing communities north of Denver have expanded into the rich Wattenberg oil and gas field  triggering frequent complaints from residents about noise  lights  air pollution and the threat of explosions Besides changing the priority of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission  which regulates the industry  the bill gives local governments the power to restrict the locations of new wells  Under current law  only state regulators have that authority The bill changes the makeup of the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to weaken industry influence  It also sets tougher requirements for  forced pooling   a practice that allows an energy company to extract oil and gas owned by multiple parties   even those who object   and then distribute the profits among them Republicans and the industry won a few concessions  including a change in the bill s language so new state and local restrictions would have to be  necessary and reasonable  The bill also makes Oil and Gas Conservation Commission members full time professionals instead of part time volunteers  in hopes of minimizing delays in rule making and approving drilling permits Weld County Commissioner Barbara Kirkmeyer and former Arapahoe County Commissioner John Brackney said Wednesday they will try to put a measure on the November ballot asking voters to annul the changes and create a nonpartisan state regulatory body  What we re trying to do is narrow it to one independent commission and prevent one party or another from politicizing it   said Kirkmeyer  an outspoken proponent of oil and gas development The bill is the first significant setback the industry has suffered in Colorado in years  Energy companies spent heavily on advertising to defeat a ballot issue in November that would have increased the minimum distance between new wells and homes and schools to 2 500 feet  750 meters   up from the current 500 feet  150 meters  But in the same election  Democrats won control of the state Senate while retaining their hold on the House and governorship  allowing them to push through the new rules The oil and gas industry says it contributes  32 billion annually to the state economy  including taxes and 89 000 direct and indirect jobs Analysts have so far avoided making predictions on the impact of the new rules  They point out that it may have little effect in the heart of the Wattenberg field  where energy friendly Weld County is unlikely to impose tighter rules But communities on the edges of the field  including Boulder and the Denver suburbs  are expected to impose their own restrictions Even before the bill passed  Adams County  on the southern fringe of the Wattenberg  imposed a moratorium on new drilling  County officials said they feared a rush of permit applications from companies trying to get projects approved under the old rules The overall impact of the bill would be to raise the cost of producing oil and gas in Colorado  which could drive some production to states with more lenient rules  said Bernadette Johnson  vice president for market intelligence for Drillinginfo Inc   which provides data and analysis to the oil and gas industry  I would say in general  what the bill does is it makes it harder to do business in Colorado   Johnson said in an interview last week  

RICHMOND  Va    More than a dozen state lawmakers filed onto the stage  summoned by the smiling leader of their state  Ralph S  Northam  the governor of Virginia On the governor s right were a handful of House Democrats  who as a group in February said they were  no longer confident in the governor s representation of Virginians   after learning of a shocking racist photo on Mr  Northam s medical school yearbook page On his left were mostly Republicans  including the speaker of the House  Delegate Kirk Cox  who d declared that Mr  Northam s  ability to lead and govern is permanently impaired  Some on stage were members of the legislative black caucus  which called the yearbook photo  disgusting  reprehensible  and offensive  and  a complete betrayal  Even so  as Mr  Northam took out a pen at the event last week and signed bills to overhaul the state s foster care system  the lawmakers of both parties stood behind him  grinning and clapping This is the strange  suspended state of Virginia politics  just two months after scandal after scandal seemed to be devouring the state s government from the top down In the space of a week in early February  the public was stunned by revelations about each of the three highest statewide elected officials  all Democrats  the racist photo in the governor s yearbook  accusations of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor  and the attorney general s appearance in blackface at a party in college  Protesters and news crews swarmed the Statehouse  Calls for resignations came from fellow Virginia Democrats  Republicans and even 2020 presidential candidates And then   It just went poof   said Natalie Draper  a librarian sitting in the back of a coffeehouse last week in Richmond   It s like it never happened  Virginians have various theories as to how this surreal normalcy set in Some say the whole mess was so exhausting and embarrassing that by the time the legislature adjourned on Feb  24  the outrage had burned itself out  Others point to polls that showed Virginia voters were considerably less hungry for resignations than their representatives were  Some political observers mused about more fundamental changes to the life span of scandal  describing President Trump s approach to bad press as if it were a revolutionary medical breakthrough  Don t apologize  move on  and everybody will talk about something else next week   is how Ben Tribbett  a Democratic strategist  described it   Maybe we ve been doing it wrong over the last 100 years  For the Democrats  perhaps above all  there are the blunt political realities  Whatever may happen in the 2021 election for governor  every seat in the Republican controlled Virginia General Assembly will be up this November  and Democrats have a chance to take back power in at least one chamber of the legislature  That will be hard enough now  given the bales of fodder Republicans now have for attack ads  But the idea of trying to raise money and hold rallies while spurning the three highest officeholders in the state came to be seen by many Democrats as just a needless handicap Betsy Carr  a Democratic delegate  said shortly after stepping off the stage last week with Mr  Northam that voters  want to move on    They want positive things to happen  they re concerned about the elections   she said That sort of hard pragmatism is common among Democratic figures these days  But it is not unanimous  Many younger people in the party  in particular  are frustrated by what they see as the leadership s hurry to move on from the scandals rather than come to grips with them ImageGov  Ralph Northam and his wife  Pam Northam  third from left  posing for photos after the dedication of a historical marker for the civil rights leader Dr  Dorothy Height at a library in Richmond CreditParker Michels Boyce for The New York Times Winning is important   said Taikein Cooper  the 30 year old chairman of the Prince Edward County Democratic Party   but we also have to have some morals  In the immediate wake of the scandals  the governor all but disappeared  either avoiding public events or being explicitly disinvited from them The gears of state government kept turning   bills were signed or vetoed  cabinet secretaries did their work   but Mr  Northam s public resurfacing was slow  beginning with an appearance in early March at the third annual Public Safety Unmanned Aircraft Systems Conference Still  it is only in recent days that his public schedule has approached normal   or at least  something that looks normal from the outside  I think groups are struggling with   What do we do  What do we do about inviting him  Do we want him the centerpiece of an announcement    said Mr  Cox  the House speaker  who spoke with Mr  Northam at the bill signing for the first time since February   It s going to be pretty hard to say we re just going to have a normal governorship for the next three years   Mr  Cox said Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax  too  has been showing up at public events more often  But rather than trying to change the subject from the allegations against him  he dives right into them  even unprompted  as he did on the last day of the legislative session in a surprise speech comparing himself to a victim of lynching Mark Herring  the attorney general  has taken questions from the public on a few occasions since his own blackface scandal broke  But when he talked recently with reporters in Washington  after a Supreme Court hearing on gerrymandering  no one asked him about the episode Democrats fully acknowledge that there is unfinished business in all this  But they cite the lack of resolution as a reason to slow down on those immediate calls for resignations  Most people wanted to give the governor time to sort out what had happened   said State Senator Scott A  Surovell   I think a lot of people question whether he s in that picture  and they re waiting for more information about who s actually in it  Initially  Mr  Northam apologized for appearing in the yearbook photo  which shows a man in blackface makeup standing next to someone wearing a Klan robe and hood  But since then  he has insisted that he is actually not either of the people in the picture  and he has pledged to get to the bottom of the matter  The mechanism for that appears to be an inquiry that began last month  conducted on behalf of Eastern Virginia Medical School by the law firm McGuireWoods That investigation into the role of racism in the past and present culture of the school was also examining the circumstances of the infamous photo  No findings have been announced yet  and the investigation is expected to wrap up in the next few weeks Still  Mr  Northam made another pledge around the time he announced that he was staying put  to focus for the rest of his term on addressing racial inequities in American life  a theme he now repeatedly emphasizes in speeches The governor  welcomes the opportunity for future conversations  on improving racial equity  said a spokeswoman  Ofirah Yheskel  who pointed out various measures the governor has supported in recent weeks that reflect  his focus on the equity issues  One of the chief barometers of Mr  Northam s success on this front has become the opinion of the legislative black caucus  to which other Democrats have readily deferred since the scandals broke  Members of the caucus have laid out their priorities in meetings and conversations with the governor  and they say he has mostly abided ImageAt a memorial service for Dr  Dorothy Height at a church in South Richmond  Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax spoke about Dr  Height s advocacy against lynching  false accusations and denial of due process  themes he has hit repeatedly since the scandals erupted CreditParker Michels Boyce for The New York Times He s been trying hard  from what I can see   said Delegate Lamont Bagby  the chairman of the caucus   He s stumbled on his own feet a couple times  I think he would agree to that   But Mr  Bagby gave his approval to the governor s choice of bills to veto and amendments to propose over the past few weeks  and he said he believed that long delayed but badly needed conversations about race had begun At a Baptist church in Richmond on a recent Sunday afternoon  Mr  Northam delivered brief remarks referring to lingering inequities at a ceremony in honor of Dorothy Height  a grande dame of the civil rights movement  He was followed at the pulpit by Mr  Fairfax   the first time they appeared in public together since the scandals erupted The contrast was stark Mr  Fairfax began with praise for Ms  Height s  oratory around the issue of anti lynching   but it quickly became clear he was also talking about other matters  She saw what was happening in this country  where people were being falsely accused   Mr  Fairfax said   They were not given due process  They were having their lives in so many ways impacted negatively  in some ways taken away  because people wanted not to get to the truth but ultimately wanted things changed in a negative way for nefarious reasons  It was barely subtext  and he would revisit these themes more forthrightly two nights later at a Women s History Month mixer in Hampton  Va   an event sponsored by the local chapter of the N A A C P  After the lieutenant governor gave a short speech on his fight against  fabricated claims and false allegations   the crowd erupted in cheers of support Like Mr  Northam  Mr  Fairfax has insisted on an investigation into the accusations against him  He contends that he is being accused of sexual assault and rape for encounters that were consensual His demands for an investigation are echoed by fellow Democrats  as Mr  Northam s are  But it remains unclear where exactly such an investigation is to come from  If it s proved in a court of law  something needs to be done  but we re not there yet   Ms  Carr  the lawmaker  said Prosecutors in North Carolina and Massachusetts have been in contact with the two women who accused Mr  Fairfax   Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson   but there has been no public indication yet that a criminal investigation has been formally opened  Republican lawmakers announced plans for an investigative hearing  and both accusers have said repeatedly that they are willing to testify publicly as part of a bipartisan process  but Democratic lawmakers have balked  seeing such a hearing as a fruitless exercise prone to partisan grandstanding  At this point  there are few other obvious options  We are actually engaged in initiating processes that will make the truth known   Mr  Fairfax said at the event in Hampton  speaking over the live jazz music and pleas for him to join in group photos  He declined to elaborate further On Sunday  a lawyer for Mr  Fairfax issued a news release saying that Mr  Fairfax had undergone polygraph examinations administered by a former F B I  agent  and that the results  demonstrated that Lt  Gov  Fairfax was telling the truth  in denying the allegations  A spokeswoman said these exams were separate from the  processes  that Mr  Fairfax had spoken of earlier And so life goes on in Virginia  with the legislature coming back this week for a quick session and with the political jockeying getting underway before the primaries in June  Democratic lawmakers who are asked what may come next on the scandal front have no concrete answer  most say their constituents would rather hear about roadwork  school financing and health care Those  after all  are matters that state politicians can actually change  as opposed to the things that apparently they cannot  The calls for resignation have not been rescinded   Delegate Jeff Bourne  a member of the legislative black caucus  said a few days before appearing with the governor at a bill signing ceremony   But I think it s one of those things where we are operating in the current state of affairs  And the current state of affairs is that the governor and lieutenant governor are still there   

To the Editor Re  A Pragmatic Fix for the Climate Crisis   by Steven Rattner  Op Ed  March 21  Schemes like Mr  Rattner s are a knife in the heart to saving the earth from climate change  Under the guise of political and economic practicality  they set us up for failure The indisputable fact is that we must fully meet the goals determined by climate experts if the planet is to be kept from crossing the tipping point where global warming spirals out of control  The Green New Deal goals that Mr  Rattner calls  ludicrous  are the bare minimum to that end He says  a hefty carbon tax would go a long way toward winning the war  against climate change  But  a long way  means nothing  We must go all the way  Being close doesn t count  Compromise isn t an option here If it is politically inconvenient to do what needs to be done  then we must change the politics  not cave to them  If the fossil fuel industry and our energy use pattern are driven by economic forces resistant to the required action  then we must change the economics  not skimp on the action This is not about losing in an election cycle  or risking a recession  It s about global catastrophe Art SalukPembroke Pines  Fla To the Editor As a former Republican appointee at the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies  I was delighted to see Steven Rattner s support for a carbon tax  The Times last year published an Op Ed by Senator Trent Lott  former majority leader  supporting a carbon tax  and another Op Ed promoted a carbon tax plan backed by former Secretaries of State James A  Baker III and George P  Shultz and a former Treasury secretary  Henry M  Paulson Jr   among others All of these Republicans are certifiable as  conservatives   and the current elected Republicans in the White House and Congress would be well advised to end their  no new taxes  mantra and face the realities of our climate issues by adopting market forces as one workable remedy to carbon emissions As Mr  Rattner correctly noted  market forces can provide a significant answer to the problems without an increase in the federal bureaucracy  A carbon tax does that  It is also a matter of ethics  A livable planet with clean air is an ethical responsibility that we owe to posterity Howard A  CohenPhiladelphiaThe writer teaches business ethics at Temple s Fox School of Business To the Editor The carbon tax plan put forward by the Climate Leadership Council that Steven Rattner calls  particularly thoughtful  has the support of companies like Exxon because it contains a little known provision that would grant the oil and gas industry blanket immunity from all the climate change damages it knowingly caused Big oil has been sued by at least 14 government entities seeking to recover the enormous costs of adapting to climate change  A liability waiver  like the one buried in the council s proposal  is the holy grail of industries seeking to avoid massive damage litigation  Tobacco and asbestos sought congressional immunity from liability and failed  The gun industry succeeded  and it is clear in that case that depriving citizens access to the courts served only to empower the National Rifle Association and block progress toward desperately needed regulations Climate change demands bold action  now  The Green New Deal is exactly the visionary and ambitious plan that meets the challenge  A carbon tax may in fact be part of a comprehensive plan to tackle climate change  But it is not enough on its own  and it should never serve as cover for an effort to deny communities access to the courts Richard WilesWashingtonThe writer is executive director of the Center for Climate Integrity To the Editor Steven Rattner states accurately that we need a climate solution  but that the Green New Deal is not the right one  As a college student  I could not agree more  The climate threat is a worldwide emergency that needs to be addressed to secure the livelihoods of my generation and subsequent ones  And although the Green New Deal has done much to bring national attention to climate change  many of my peers and I do not believe that it is feasible  At best  it would be highly partisan  at worst  it could stifle the economy A far superior solution is the carbon dividends plan that Mr  Rattner mentions  Not only does it have the capability to reduce our emissions  but it will also stimulate our economy and spur sustainable innovation  Furthermore  its bipartisan support allows the plan to be long lasting  A carbon dividends plan is the strongest tool we have at our disposal to combat the climate threat  We should all support this plan to secure the future of our country and our world Rohit GiridharanNew HavenThe writer  a Yale University student  is media outreach team leader for Students for Carbon Dividends To the Editor Steven Rattner proposes a tax on retail gasoline sales but does not mention the Yellow Vest reaction to the same policy proposal in France  since abandoned  that is destabilizing the French government and society in the most severe way since 1968  Do we not need to worry about that because of American exceptionalism  I don t think so Sandy K  FeldmanNew York 

There s a lot we don t know about the legacy Donald Trump will leave behind  And it is  of course  hugely important what happens in the 2020 election  But one thing seems sure  Even if he s a one term president  Trump will have caused  directly or indirectly  the premature deaths of a large number of Americans Some of those deaths will come at the hands of right wing  white nationalist extremists  who are a rapidly growing threat  partly because they feel empowered by a president who calls them  very fine people  Some will come from failures of governance  like the inadequate response to Hurricane Maria  which surely contributed to the high death toll in Puerto Rico   Reminder  Puerto Ricans are U S  citizens  Some will come from the administration s continuing efforts to sabotage Obamacare  which have failed to kill health reform but have stalled the decline in the number of uninsured  meaning that many people still aren t getting the health care they need  Of course  if Trump gets his way and eliminates Obamacare altogether  things on this front will get much  much worse But the biggest death toll is likely to come from Trump s agenda of deregulation   or maybe we should call it  deregulation   because his administration is curiously selective about which industries it wants to leave alone Consider two recent events that help capture the deadly strangeness of what s going on One is the administration s plan for hog plants to take over much of the federal responsibility for food safety inspections  And why not  It s not as if we ve seen safety problems arise from self regulation in  say  the aircraft industry  have we  Or as if we ever experience major outbreaks of food borne illness  Or as if there was a reason the U S  government stepped in to regulate meatpacking in the first place Now  you could see the Trump administration s willingness to trust the meat industry to keep our meat safe as part of an overall attack on government regulation  a willingness to trust profit making businesses to do the right thing and let the market rule  And there s something to that  but it s not the whole story  as illustrated by another event  Trump s declaration the other day that wind turbines cause cancer Now  you could put this down to personal derangement  Trump has had an irrational hatred for wind power ever since he failed to prevent construction of a wind farm near his Scottish golf course  And Trump seems deranged and irrational on so many issues that one more bizarre claim hardly seems to matter But there s more to this than just another Trumpism  After all  we normally think of Republicans in general  and Trump in particular  as people who minimize or deny the  negative externalities  imposed by some business activities   the uncompensated costs they impose on other people or businesses For example  the Trump administration wants to roll back rules that limit emissions of mercury from power plants  And in pursuit of that goal  it wants to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from taking account of many of the benefits from reduced mercury emissions  such as an associated reduction in nitrogen oxide But when it comes to renewable energy  Trump and company are suddenly very worried about supposed negative side effects  which generally exist only in their imagination  Last year the administration floated a proposal that would have forced the operators of electricity grids to subsidize coal and nuclear energy  The supposed rationale was that new sources were threatening to destabilize those grids   but the grid operators themselves denied that this was the case So it s deregulation for some  but dire warnings about imaginary threats for others  What s going on Part of the answer is  follow the money  Political contributions from the meat processing industry overwhelmingly favor Republicans  Coal mining supports the G O P  almost exclusively  Alternative energy  on the other hand  generally favors Democrats There are probably other things  too  If you re a party that wishes we could go back to the 1950s  but without the 91 percent top tax rate   you re going to have a hard time accepting the reality that hippie dippy  unmanly things like wind and solar power are becoming ever more cost competitive Whatever the drivers of Trump policy  the fact  as I said  is that it will kill people  Wind turbines don t cause cancer  but coal burning power plants do   along with many other ailments  The Trump administration s own estimates indicate that its relaxation of coal pollution rules will kill more than 1 000 Americans every year  If the administration gets to implement its full agenda   not just deregulation of many industries  but discrimination against industries it doesn t like  such as renewable energy   the toll will be much higher So if you eat meat   or  for that matter  drink water or breathe air   there s a real sense in which Donald Trump is trying to kill you  And even if he s turned out of office next year  for many Americans it will be too late The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee approved subpoenas Wednesday for special counsel Robert Mueller s full Russia report as Democrats pressure the Justice Department to release the document without redactions The committee voted 24 17 to give Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler  D N Y   permission to issue subpoenas to the Justice Department for the final report  its exhibits and any underlying evidence or materials prepared for Mueller s investigation  Nadler has not yet said if he ll send the subpoenas  which would be the first step in a potentially long fight with the Justice Department over the materials The Judiciary panel also voted Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trump s former top advisers  stepping up a separate  wide ranging investigation into Trump and his personal and political dealings On the Mueller report  House Democrats had given Attorney General William Barr until Tuesday to provide an unredacted verson to Congress  along with underlying materials  The Justice Department ignored that deadline  with Barr telling committee chairmen in a letter last week that he was in the process of redacting portions of the almost 400 page report and it would be released by mid April   if not sooner  The vote further escalates the Democrats  battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see  a fight that could eventually head to court if the two sides can t settle their differences through negotiation  Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr In the letter last week  Barr said he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material  in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that  would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties  Democrats say they want access to all of that information  even if some of it can t be disclosed to the public  Nadler said he will give Barr time to change his mind on redactions  but if they cannot reach an agreement they will issue the subpoenas  in very short order   He also said he is prepared to go to court to get the grand jury information  This committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job  not the attorney general s  to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his office   Nadler said The five former Trump advisers who could receive subpoenas are strategist Steve Bannon  communications director Hope Hicks  chief of staff Reince Priebus  White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson  Donaldson served as McGahn s chief of staff before both left the administration The five were key witnesses in Mueller s probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month  along with dozens of other people connected to Trump  Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Mueller s investigation  were sent outside the White House   meaning the committee should have access to them because they may not be covered by executive privilege The top Republican on the Judiciary panel  Georgia Rep  Doug Collins  said at the vote that the five subpoenas are misguided because two of the individuals have already provided 3 000 documents to the committee and that the other three have indicated a willingness to cooperate Collins said the authorization for all of the subpoenas is  reckless  and that Democrats shouldn t be asking for documents that the Justice Department can t legally disclose to the public  The committee rejected a GOP amendment that would have blocked the subpoenas from applying to grand jury information  We have a pre emptive chairman who has gone out with pre emptive subpoenas today on a report that has already been promised him   Collins said   This is nothing but political theater  Trump himself has largely deferred to Barr on the report s release while also saying he wouldn t mind if the full version was made public  Still  he has criticized Democrats for seeking the unredacted information  He tweeted Tuesday that  there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy  Nadler or House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff  who has also called for the full release Mueller notified Barr that he had completed the investigation March 22 and sent him the report  In a four page summary of that report released two days later  Barr wrote that the special counsel did not find that Trump s campaign  conspired or coordinated  with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election  He also said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation  instead setting out  evidence on both sides  of the question Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter  declaring that Mueller s evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe  Democrats criticized Barr s assessment  saying they instead want to see what Mueller wrote

ALGIERS   Algeria s ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on Tuesday  succumbing to six weeks of largely peaceful mass protests driven by youth and pressure from the powerful army against his 20 year rule Hundreds took to the streets of the capital after the announcement of the 82 year old s departure  capping protests which called for the removal of an elite seen by many as out of touch with ordinary people and presiding over an economy riven by cronyism Earlier in the day  army chief of staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah demanded the veteran ruler  who has been long in poor health  be declared immediately unfit for office State TV later showed a frail looking Bouteflika  dressed in a traditional winter robe  handing his resignation letter to the head of a constitutional council  Also present was Abdelkader Bensalah  chairman of the upper house of parliament  who will run the country for 90 days until elections are held  I have taken this step because I am keen to put an end to the current bickering   Bouteflika said in a letter released on state media  using his main means of communication since suffering a stroke in 2013 and largely disappearing from public view Western powers  some of which had demanded a peaceful solution  will be relieved that Bouteflika has quit  valuing stability in the OPEC oil producer  which is also a key gas supplier for Europe and partner to fight militants Analysts say it was unclear whether the demonstrations will end  however  They were started initially to protest Bouteflika s plan to seek a fifth mandate but then widened to include calls from some youth and lawyers for wider reforms As Bouteflika s grip on power started to loosen over recent days  some protesters began shifting their focus to rejecting a caretaker government appointed on Sunday The lineup included respected technocrats but was headed by Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui  who the opposition said was too close to the ruling elite dominated by business tycoons and veteran fighters of the 1954 62 independence war with France  What is important to us is that we do not accept the  caretaker  government   Mustapha Bouchachi  a lawyer and protest leader  told Reuters before Bouteflika quit   Peaceful protests will continue  Hundreds of students marched early on Tuesday through the capital Algiers  calling for a new system in a country where more than one in four Algerians under the age of 30   some 70 percent of the population   are unemployed Bouteflika s supporters had sought to stop the dissent by evoking the 1990s when some 200 000 were killed in civil war with Islamists  warning even of a scenario like Syria  embroiled in an eight year long conflict But only around one person was confirmed to have died during the protests  a man believed to be around 60 years old who suffered a heart attack  with most rallies peaceful and protesters cleaning up the streets before going home In Egypt  more than 800 people were killed in the 2011 uprising that brought down Hosni Mubarak CHANGESAlgeria has transformed during the protests  with people losing fear of criticizing the government and state media first ignoring and then  after a mutiny of reporters  covering the dissent Supporters in the ruling FLN party and business people gradually abandoned Bouteflika  The military at first stayed in the barracks but step by step increased pressure  first only indirectly in an army magazine editorial saying the military shared the same vision as the people Then chief of staff Salah proposed last week to invoke a constitutional clause to remove Bouteflika on health grounds In another sign the end was approaching  several oligarchs close to his camp had been banned from traveling abroad in the past few days Tuesday started like any other weekday since the protests began  with some students protesting and others going to work after joining a mass rally on Friday  Algeria s weekend With many at home or in restaurants at dinner time  TV stations flashed a blitz of comments from Salah that Bouteflika s removal should happen immediately  There is no more room to waste time     We decided clearly     to stand with the people so all their demands get fulfilled   Salah said after a meeting with senior officers  state news agency APS said A veteran of Algeria s war for independence and the only leader many Algerians have known  Bouteflika was first elected president in 1999 and established himself by ending the civil war He had only on Monday said he would quit before the end of his term on April 28 without giving a date  He had also vowed to undertake unspecified measures for the sake of stability  making many wonder what would happen next An hour later  he announced he was standing down in a statement posted by APS on Twitter Hundreds took to the streets in the city center  where the Feb  22 mass protests first broke out  waving Algerian flags  The army and the people are one  and  Game over   banners read   Additional reporting by Mohamed Elsherif and Dalia Nehme  Writing by Ulf Laessing  Editing by John Stonestreet and Sonya Hepinstall  

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee will prepare subpoenas this week seeking special counsel Robert Mueller s full Russia report as the Justice Department appears likely to miss an April 2 deadline set by Democrats for the report s release The Judiciary panel plans to vote on subpoenas Wednesday  a day after the deadline  The chairmen of several House committees asked for the full  unredacted report last week after Attorney General William Barr released a four page summary laying out the report s  principal conclusions   Barr said in a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary committees on Friday that a redacted version of the full 300 page report would be released by mid April   if not sooner  The planned committee vote  announced Monday morning  would not automatically issue subpoenas but authorize House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler  D N Y   to send them if he decides to do so  As I have made clear  Congress requires the full and complete special counsel report  without redactions  as well as access to the underlying evidence   Nadler said in a statement   Attorney General Barr has thus far indicated he will not meet the April 2 deadline set by myself and five other committee chairs  and refused to work with us to provide the full report  without redactions  to Congress  The vote comes as Democrats are escalating their battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see   a fight that could eventually end up in court  Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and will almost certainly be unhappy with the amount of information provided by Barr when the department releases the report in the coming weeks The panel will also vote Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to a number of President Donald Trump s former top advisers  including strategist Steve Bannon  Communications Director Hope Hicks  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  White House Counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson  Donaldson served as McGahn s chief of staff before both left the administration The five were key witnesses in Mueller s probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month  Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Mueller s investigation  were sent outside the White House   waiving executive privilege rights that would block document production  To this end  I have asked the committee to authorize me to issue subpoenas  if necessary  to compel the production of documents and testimony   Nadler said Nadler sent requests to 81 people connected to Trump s political and personal dealings as he launched a wide ranging investigation into possible obstruction of justice  public corruption and abuses of power Barr said in the letter Friday that he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material  in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that  would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties  Democrats say they want all of that information  even if some of it can t be disclosed to the public  They are citing precedents from previous investigations involving presidents and also information disclosed about the Russia investigation to Republicans last year when they held the House majority If the committee does issue subpoenas  the path forward is uncertain  If the administration decides to fight  lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena   a fight that could  in theory  reach the Supreme Court  Generally such disputes are instead resolved through negotiations The Democrats could also formally ask Mueller to send the Judiciary committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump  But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  backed by the majority of her caucus  has said she s not currently supportive of impeachment Barr wrote in his summary that the special counsel did not find that Trump s campaign  conspired or coordinated  with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election  He said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation  instead setting out  evidence on both sides  of the question Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter  declaring that Mueller s evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe Democrats say they want to know much more about both conclusions and they want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr Republicans have said the Democratic demands are overreach  Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not  in truth  require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department   said Georgia Rep  Doug Collins  the top Republican on the Judiciary committee  

Americans borrowed an estimated  88 billion over the last year to pay for health care  according to a survey released on Tuesday by Gallup and the nonprofit West Health The survey also found that one in four Americans have skipped treatment because of the cost  and that nearly half fear bankruptcy in the event of a health emergency There was a partisan divide when respondents were asked whether they believed that the American health care system is among the best in the world  Among Republicans  67 percent of respondents said they believed so  that number was 38 percent among Democrats But Democrats and Republicans had similar responses about putting off medical treatment  Asked if they had deferred treatment because of the cost  27 percent of Democrats said they had  compared with 21 percent of Republicans and 30 percent of independents  President Trump retreated on health care Tuesday  saying a G O P  plan would appear after the 2020 election   Respondents from across the political spectrum also reported pessimism about their leaders  abilities to reduce health care costs  About 70 percent of respondents said they had no confidence in their elected officials to bring prices down  And 77 percent said they were concerned that rising health care costs would damage the American economy  Our data shows an American public that s beaten down from this really serious issue   said Dan Witters  a senior researcher at Gallup At the same time  64 percent of respondents said they were mostly satisfied with their experiences in the health care system  When asked if they were satisfied with how well the system was serving Americans generally  only 39 percent said they were The survey s authors noted that Americans  feelings were complicated and at times conflicted  But one thing was clear  High health care costs had created significant anxiety The Best Health Care System in the World  Which One Would You Pick Assessing the systems in eight countries can inform the debate in the U S  over universal coverage Even among households earning  180 000 or more a year  a third of respondents said they were concerned about the specter of personal bankruptcy because of a health crisis   There has been fierce debate among researchers about the extent to which health care costs can be blamed for bankruptcies  Many American families earning less than that  of course  feel the effects of high health care costs acutely  They are forced to cut back on other expenses to pay for health care  or skip appointments and prescription refills  creating health risks down the road Twelve percent of respondents said they had borrowed money for care  including 11 percent of those with health insurance  who may still face high deductibles and other out of pocket expenses Most survey respondents said they believed that Americans were paying too much for health care relative to what they receive  Asked to choose between a hypothetical freeze in their health care costs or a 10 percent increase in household income  61 percent of respondents chose the freeze  Those in low income households were most likely to choose that option  When we re talking about health care and the debate right now  it usually bifurcates between the financial impact of health care or the health outcomes themselves   said Tim Lash  chief strategy officer for West Health  a nonpartisan nonprofit that aims to lower health care prices  But those two things intersect at access   which can have dire health consequences  he said The organization believes that Congress should allow Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies  that there should be more transparency about the prices of medicines and procedures  and that the health care industry should shift toward  value based care    in which doctors are paid based on patient outcomes   rather than the current  fee for service  model Mr  Lash noted that other wealthy countries spend much less on health care than the United States does  while achieving better outcomes in areas like life expectancy and infant mortality  Although about 87 percent of Americans have health insurance  according to data from Gallup  an individual s plan may not cover all costs associated with treatment President Trump  who has sought to undo the Affordable Care Act  tweeted about high deductibles under the law on Monday morning  promising that  Good things are going to happen   and tagging several Republican lawmakers The administration asked a federal appeals court to invalidate the law last week  while Democrats announced a health care bill that builds on the Affordable Care Act and seeks to lower premiums  among other goals The partnership between West Health and Gallup  the analytics and consulting company  was a first  The survey results are based on phone interviews conducted in English and Spanish in early 2019 with a random sample of 3 500 adults across the country  The margin of sampling error ranged from one to two percentage points for results based on the total sample  and three to five percentage points for results based on subgroups such as political identity or income level  so differences of less than those amounts are statistically insignificant Gallup and West Health said they would conduct similar surveys in the coming years  

As President Abdel Fattah el Sisi of Egypt prepares constitutional changes that could keep him in power until 2034 and enhance military control over the country  President Trump is preparing to welcome him to the White House  This is the second time Mr  Trump will bestow this diplomatic gift on Mr  el Sisi  one of the most authoritarian leaders in the Middle East After taking power in a 2013 coup that ousted the country s first elected president  the Islamist Mohamed Morsi  Mr  el Sisi  a former army chief  promised his people that he would build democracy and leave office in 2022 after completing a second term Instead  he has built a reputation for brutality and repression  torturing and killing hundreds of Egyptians and jailing perhaps as many as 60 000 others  including students and American citizens It is not unusual for American presidents to work with strongmen to advance national interests  But if Mr  Trump welcomes Mr  el Sisi to Washington now  without pressing him for reforms rather than acquiescing to his power grab  he will be crushing hopes that Egypt could become democratic any time soon Mr  el Sisi made his move in February when the rubber stamp Parliament gave preliminary approval to a package of amendments to Egypt s 2014 Constitution  which was adopted after the 2011 Arab Spring uprising ended the 30 year rule of President Hosni Mubarak  leading to Mr  Morsi s election In addition to extending presidential terms to six years from four  and allowing him to run two more times  the amendments would grant the armed forces expansive authority to intervene in the government  give Mr  el Sisi more control over appointing senior judges and provide military courts broader jurisdiction to try civilians A final parliamentary vote is due by mid April  then the amendments are supposed to be submitted to a referendum  But officials are stifling all dissent No members of the political opposition have been allowed to participate in the government s national dialogue sessions on the changes  Several people who posted videos on Facebook criticizing the amendments have been arrested  Two Egyptian actors who criticized Mr  el Sisi on a panel with a congressman in Washington last week were subsequently expelled from their union  which accused them of treason There s been no pushback on any of this from Mr  Trump  who has shown great affection for autocrats  fawning over Mr  el Sisi on his first White House visit  in 2017 Mr  Trump might be able to salvage the April 9 visit if he warns that some of the  1 3 billion in annual American military aid could be at risk if the Egyptian leader doesn t pursue a democratic path  For many years  the United States has been reluctant to use aid as leverage  concerned that doing so could jeopardize Egypt s peace treaty with Israel  along with American access to the Suez Canal  overflight rights and counterterrorism cooperation  But peace with Israel  international use of the canal and cooperating in the fight against terrorism are in Egypt s own interest  and they are unlikely to be abandoned if America stands up for democratic principles Under pressure from Congress  which set certain conditions for aid  the Trump administration in 2017 temporarily withheld  300 million  That helped persuade Egypt to acquit employees of several American and European institutes who were charged for doing democracy related work and to suspend implementation of a law cracking down on such groups  Millions more dollars from 2018 and 2019 are being held in abeyance pending certification that Egypt met congressional conditions  congressional sources said  If Mr  Trump will not call Mr  el Sisi to account  Congress can try  American aid should not come in a blank check  Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee  has placed a hold on  105 million of aid to get Egypt to compensate April Corley  the American injured in 2015 when Egypt s armed forces  using American weapons  mistakenly shot up a tourist group  Mr  Leahy also wants more clarity about Egypt s secretive military campaign against an Islamic State group in Sinai  Barring a principled response to Mr  el Sisi  the United States will be further complicit in shoring up his military dictatorship  disenfranchising most Egyptians and fueling the kind of

WASHINGTON   A White House whistleblower has said the Trump administration overruled security experts to give questionable security clearances to more than two dozen people  including the president s daughter Ivanka and son in law Jared Kushner Tricia Newbold  a White House security adviser  told Democrats in Congress that clearances were initially denied to dozens of administration officials because of concerns over possible foreign influence  conflicts of interests  questionable or criminal conduct  financial problems or drug abuse She said President Donald Trump s former White House personnel security director  Carl Kline  personally overruled the career officials  judgments in the cases of two senior officials  Newbold s allegations were laid out in a letter sent to the White House on Monday and released by Elijah Cummings  chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee   I would not be doing a service to myself  my country  or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security   his letter quoted Newbold as telling his committee   I feel that right now this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office  Cummings said he plans to subpoena Kline and warned that more subpoenas would be issued if the White House does not provide requested documents In his letter to the White House  Cummings referred to three unnamed  senior White House officials  whose security clearance cases are addressed in some detail by Newbold  Two sources familiar with the information obtained by the Oversight Committee said two of those three senior officials are Ivanka Trump and Kushner  her husband Asked about the whistleblower s assertions  Kushner said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he had complied with various investigations  I disclosed all of my holdings for the Office of Government Ethics  and what I did with them is they told me what to divest  what to keep  what rules to follow  We followed all that   Kushner said The White House did not respond to a request for comment Jim Jordan  the top Republican on the House committee  issued a statement calling the letter a  partisan attack  that was  an excuse to go fishing through the personal files of dedicated public servants  Cummings said Newbold  a manager in the White House personnel security office  said she was targeted for retaliation after declining to approve applications based on national security protocols   I m terrified of going back  I know that this will not be perceived in favor of my intentions  which is to bring back the integrity of the office   she is quoted as saying in the letter Cummings sent to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone  Separately  the House Judiciary Committee said on Monday that it will this week issue subpoenas to obtain Special Counsel Robert Muller s full report on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election Attorney General William Barr issued a summary of Mueller s findings to Congress on March 24  saying the special counsel did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia  Mueller left unresolved the question of whether Trump obstructed justice during the probe  and Barr concluded the evidence was insufficient to charge the president Barr has said he will issue a redacted copy of Mueller s full report by mid April  but Democrats want it without redactions and have demanded it be given to them this week The new round of subpoenas signals increased pressure from Democrats on the Republican Trump White House The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the letters  The Department of Justice declined to comment about the request from the Judiciary Committee   SIGNIFICANT DISQUALIFYING FACTORS Cummings  memo on White House security clearances said career officials  including Newbold  initially rejected the application from  Senior White House official 1  after a background investigation revealed  significant disqualifying factors   including  foreign influence  and  personal conduct  The memo said Kline overruled the career officials  judgments  saying the activities that concerned security officials  occurred prior to federal service  It also said Newbold told congressional investigators that a second person  referred to as  senior White House Official 2  was the subject of a 14 page memo laying out  multiple disqualifiers  including foreign influence and outside activities  Kline also approved a clearance for that unnamed official Newbold told congressional investigators that in a third case she was pressured by Kline to reverse a recommendation that the clearance application be rejected  Newbold refused  and the third official ultimately left the White House  the Democrats  memo said    Reporting by Ginger Gibson  Mark Hosenball and David Morgan  Editing by Bill Trott  Howard Goller and Michael Perry  

The Trump administration s decision to cut off aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras to punish their governments for failing to curb migration is a rash response to a real policy dilemma  Cutting off aid will needlessly deepen tensions between Congress and the administration  and it will exacerbate migration from the region without twisting Central American politicians  arms  But we shouldn t pretend that the aid itself was doing much good   in fact  the best move right now would be to significantly change the way aid to Central America is structured  to push those countries to alleviate the political  economic and social pressures driving people north in the first place Immigration fueled tensions between Congress and the White House are likely to reach a new high as a result of the decision to cut off aid to Central America  The president s declaration of a state of emergency to build his wall already triggered a battle over the power to legislate  that fight will now grow to include the power of the purse  The potential cost is greater than heightened acrimony  As each side will surely dig in its heels  sensible immigration and foreign policies  such as bipartisan efforts to address the rising number of asylum seekers or to prevent Guatemala from sliding into authoritarianism  will get lost in the scuffle The decision to cut off aid is bound to drive up migration numbers  American aid to Central America has a lot of problems  Its total amounts are paltry  and it is mostly distributed inefficiently in large blocks by foreign contractors  Nonetheless  that aid is about the only outside support available to Central American governments confronting relentless poverty and violence  And some of the aid does work  There is good evidence that violence prevention assistance to El Salvador has contributed to a decrease in the homicide rate  a likely factor behind the drop in migration to the United States ImagePeople waiting at the border crossing in Nuevo Laredo  Mexico  to apply for asylum sometimes stay at this overcrowded migrant shelter for weeks  even months CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesCutting off foreign assistance is unlikely to persuade Central American governments to take actions that reduce the migratory flow  The amount of aid provided pales in comparison with revenue accrued through migrant remittances  The  500 million sent to these countries in 2017 was less than 3 percent of the money received as remittance each year  And as Venezuela has shown  the United States isn t the only source of support   Mr  Trump s aid cutoff simply opens the door for China or Russia  Governments of the region  especially of Guatemala and  to a lesser degree  of Honduras  are indifferent to the plight of their poor who migrate  Especially as these governments turn increasingly authoritarian and criminal  they are more than happy to rid their countries of real and prospective opponents  For too long  Central American governments and elites have gotten away with abdicating their fiduciary  social and legal responsibilities to their citizens  They have failed to collect tax revenue and to invest in social programs and job creation that alleviate the plight of their poor  And they have aligned themselves with vast organized criminal networks  These networks  acting either independently or in alliance with increasingly sophisticated gangs  are responsible for terrorizing community members into fleeing their countries and for transforming migration into a lucrative criminal enterprise If the Trump administration is serious about forcing the hand of Central American governments  it can t just cut off aid   an alternative policy approach is urgently required  Rather than turn a blind eye to creeping authoritarianism  it should pressure governments to become more democratic and less beholden to corrupt elites and criminal networks ImageEl Salvador s president elect  Nayib Bukele  at the Heritage Foundation in Washington in March CreditEric Baradat Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThere could not be a more opportune or urgent moment to do so  particularly in El Salvador and Guatemala  Mr  Trump should reach out to the Salvadoran president elect  Nayib Bukele  and help him make good on his campaign promise to ensure transparency by establishing a commission to investigate corruption and criminality  Timing is even more critical in Guatemala  Congress has already pushed the country s government to improve accountability by revoking the visas of corrupt public officials and business people  The administration should embrace and further these efforts  especially in the run up to elections this year  in which several factions are trying to block the candidacy of Thelma Aldana  a crusading former attorney general  for president In all of these cases  American aid can be used both as a carrot to promote reform and as a support mechanism to help politicians like Ms  Aldana achieve needed reform  As sometimes happens with this administration  Mr  Trump is half right  American aid is not working  and Central American governments need to be called to account for their mismanagement  But ending that aid will just make everything worse  Instead of being a giveaway  it needs to be structured as an incentive for domestic reform  Not only will that cut down on migration  but it will help give Central Americans what they have been longing for  a safe and prosperous region where they can imagine a future for their children Read moreOpinion articles on

Last Sunday  Attorney General William Barr sent us a letter summarizing what he says are the  principal conclusions  of the special counsel  Robert Mueller  The next day  together with five other committee chairmen  I wrote back to the attorney general  demanding that he provide us with the full Mueller report   not a summary  but the full report and all of the relevant evidence   by April 2 For nearly two years  the country has waited to read the report  Over those many months  President Trump has raged against the institutions that make our democracy possible   among them  the free press  the courts and his own Department of Justice  When the special counsel indicted members of the president s inner circle  his attacks got louder Before the formal investigation began  Mr  Trump fired his F B I  director  He later fired his attorney general  He reportedly attempted to fire the special counsel himself  Despite this profoundly unacceptable behavior  the special counsel persevered and wrote his report We   the members of the Judiciary Committee  the House of Representatives and the entire American public   are still waiting to see that report  We will not wait much longer  We have an obligation to read the full report  and the Department of Justice has an obligation to provide it  in its entirely  without delay  If the department is unwilling to produce the full report voluntarily  then we will do everything in our power to secure it for ourselves  The entire reason for appointing the special counsel was to protect the investigation from political influence  By offering us his version of events in lieu of the report  the attorney general  a recent political appointee  undermines the work and the integrity of his department  He also denies the public the transparency it deserves  We require the full report   the special counsel s words  not the attorney general s summary or a redacted version We require the report  first  because Congress  not the attorney general  has a duty under the Constitution to determine whether wrongdoing has occurred  The special counsel declined to make a  traditional prosecutorial judgment  on the question of obstruction  but it is not the attorney general s job to step in and substitute his judgment for the special counsel s  That responsibility falls to Congress   and specifically to the House Judiciary Committee   as it has in every similar investigation in modern history  The attorney general s recent proposal to redact the special counsel s report before we receive it is unprecedented  We require the evidence  not whatever remains after the report has been filtered by the president s political appointee On its face  the attorney general s letter raises more questions than it answers  He tells us  for instance  that he declined to charge the president with obstruction in part because there was no underlying crime to obstruct  Did he discuss that conclusion with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   who  while a federal prosecutor  routinely charged individuals with obstruction without charging the underlying crime  Did the attorney general forget that the special counsel indicted 37 other people  including the president s campaign chairman  deputy campaign chairman and former national security adviser  for various crimes  including conspiracy against the United States  Did he lose track of his own prosecutors  who effectively named the president as an unindicted co conspirator in the Southern District of New York Second  we require the report because Congress has a role that is fundamentally different from that of the Department of Justice  The special counsel s mandate was narrow  investigate allegedly criminal conduct stemming from links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government  Our job is to hold the president accountable any time he undermines the rule of law  and is not limited to his involvement with the Russian government during the campaign Whether or not the president could have been charged with a crime  even the attorney general acknowledges the existence of evidence that has so far been hidden from view  We have every reason to suspect that the unedited obstruction section of the Mueller report resembles the report that Congress received from the Watergate grand jury in 1974  That evidence showed that President Richard Nixon had attempted to obstruct justice  It did not recommend that the president should be prosecuted  It did not say the president should be impeached  It simply stated the evidence so that Congress could do its job Finally  we require the report because one day  one way or another  the country will move on from President Trump  We must make it harder for future presidents to behave this way  We need a full accounting of the president s actions to do that work  When the full scope of the president s misconduct has been revealed  when his lies are debunked and his abuses have been laid bare  I believe that members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will draft legislation to curb the worst of his offenses  Put another way  If President Trump s behavior wasn t criminal  then perhaps it should have been RelatedMore on the Mueller report  Opinion   The Editorial BoardNo Collusion  No  Exoneration March 24  2019Opinion   Neal K  KatyalThe Many Problems With the Barr LetterMarch 24

Good Tuesday   Want this by email  Sign up here  Lyft shares come back down to earthThat was fast  On their second day of trading yesterday  shares in Lyft fell 12 percent  to  69 01  below their I P

Facebook considers a news serviceFacebook still hasn t solved its many problems with hosting false or misleading information  but Mark Zuckerberg says that it may start a dedicated news service   In India  Facebook is struggling to cope with disinformation and hate speech circulating ahead of elections  When local news outlets have raced to post  exclusive  information about hostilities between India and Pakistan  for instance  much of it has been false   Singapore has stopped waiting for Facebook to clamp down on false information and introduced draft legislation that would  among other things  require websites to run corrections alongside  online falsehoods  and would  cut off profits  of sites that spread it Against that backdrop  Mr  Zuckerberg is pitching the idea of a dedicated

WASHINGTON   The House on Thursday rebuffed a furious lobbying campaign by the National Rifle Association and approved a revamped Violence Against Women Act that would expand law enforcement s ability to restrict gun purchases by convicted domestic abusers The legislation passed easily  263 to 158  but the divided vote came on what was once a broadly bipartisan measure first passed in 1994  In recent years  partisan rancor over efforts to expand the protections of the legislation have clouded efforts to renew it  and this year  the divide was over gun control The provisions would close the so called boyfriend loophole and bar those under a restraining order or who were convicted of abusing  assaulting or stalking a domestic partner from buying guns  The N R A  seized on the new measures and warned Congress that it would track and publish how lawmakers voted  hoping to intimidate Republicans and Democrats in Republican leaning districts  Do not let the N R A  bully you   Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  urged her colleagues before the vote  noting that her recently deceased husband  former Representative John Dingell Jr   also a Democrat  was a member of the organization Thirty three Republicans bucked the threat and voted with the Democratic majority in favor of the legislation   among them  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania  the sole Republican sponsor of the reauthorization  Representative Jeff Fortenberry  Republican of Nebraska  voted present Democrats  including all of the freshman members who won in districts swept by Donald J  Trump in 2016  stood up to the gun lobby  with only one   Representative Collin C  Peterson of Minnesota   voting no Many in the new majority campaigned on tightening access to guns  and they appeared to embrace condemnation from the gun lobby as a badge of honor  Lawmakers should be reading the tea leaves   said Shannon Watts  the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  a group that supports restricting gun laws   In the midterm elections  it was gun safety that got people to the polls  Other supporters of the legislation argued that the gun provisions made up only a fraction of the protections offered by the bill  and included invaluable resources for survivors  This wasn t a gun bill   this is a bill to protect women   said Lisette Johnson  a member of the Everytown Survivor Network and a survivor of domestic abuse   This passing today is really a huge support for women and keeping them safer  Republicans had advocated a clean one year extension of the current law  which expired in February  arguing that new elements of the legislation were controversial and overreached   in particular  the gun restrictions and language offering additional protections to transgender people  Can we stop playing political games at the expense of vulnerable women   asked Representative Elise Stefanik  Republican of New York  before the vote  arguing that the bill put forward by Democrats would  collect dust in the Senate    Democrats  who booed vigorously during her speech  rejected her motion  The vote highlighted the stark contrasts between the new Democratic majority  with its historic number of women  and the Republican minority  which has struggled to attract female voters and to increase the number of conservative women holding office on Capitol Hill  Democrats framed opposition to the legislation s renewal as a denial of protections for survivors of abuse  efforts to prevent domestic violence and support for law enforcement Representative Sharice Davids  Democrat of Kansas and one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress in November  presided over the final vote on the measure  which contains a number of protections for women on tribal lands   including a new provision that would allow tribal courts to prosecute nonnative people accused of domestic crimes or dating violence on tribal lands A number of Democrats  including Ms  Dingell and Representative Katie Porter of California  offered passionate defenses of the legislation  repeatedly drawing on their own experiences as survivors of domestic abuse  I know that fear  I know that terror and I just want to try to save another family from going through that terror   Ms  Dingell said at a news conference on Wednesday  recalling being afraid as a child that her father  who had mental illness and owned a gun  would harm her mother or her siblings   Why would you not close that loophole  Republicans  beyond objecting to what they said was an infringement on gun ownership  argued that the measure contained other proposals that were too broad for a law intended to protect survivors of assault  In previous hearings and speeches  they had singled out provisions that would expand protections for transgender people and require the Bureau of Prisons to consider the safety and protection of transgender prisoners when giving housing assignments  We find ourselves debating a VAWA reauthorization act that is literally a Christmas tree of progressive liberal policy objectives  rather than an honest approach to reforming and updating such an important law   said Representative Debbie Lesko  Republican of Arizona  who is a survivor of domestic abuse The legislation heads to the Senate  where Senators Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  and Joni Ernst  Republican of Iowa  have said they will lead efforts to pass a version  It is unclear how many of the new gun provisions in the House legislation will prevail in the Republican controlled Senate  There are a number of improvements in the House bill that I think should be in our version  including preserving improvements already made in the 2013 reauthorization   Ms  Feinstein said in a statement after the vote   I hope the Senate will move quickly  This is an important law and one the Senate should take very seriously and act upon expeditiously   

 Reuters    Venezuela s state run energy company  PDVSA  kept oil exports near 1 million barrels per day in March despite U S  sanctions and power outages that crippled its main export terminal  according to PDVSA documents and Refinitiv Eikon data The OPEC member stabilized exports in March after shipments fell about 40 percent in February from the prior months  in the immediate aftermath of the United States announcing it would impose sanctions on oil sales to choke off the main source of revenue for socialist President Nicolas Maduro The United States and many Western governments have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country s rightful leader  Guaido in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency on the grounds that Maduro s 2018 re election was illegitimate March s exports of 980 355 barrels per day  bpd  of crude and fuel were only slightly below February s shipments of 990 215 bpd  according to the documents seen by Reuters and the Refinitiv Eikon data U S  restrictions on Venezuelan exports will tighten further in May  when the grace period for winding down purchases expires for importers of Venezuelan oil who use U S  subsidiaries or the U S  financial system for transactions   We will  continue to take action to ensure Venezuela s energy resources are preserved for the legitimate government of interim president Juan Guaido  for the people of Venezuela  and the reconstruction of a country destroyed through mismanagement and corruption   a senior U S  administration official told Reuters on Tuesday U S  President Donald Trump is considering imposing sanctions on companies from other countries that do business with Venezuela  White House national security adviser John Bolton told Reuters TV on Friday Most oil shipments in February and March were destined for Asia  Until the sanctions  the United States was Venezuela s largest crude buyer  Given the new set of challenges that landed on PDVSA s lap  we were surprised to see a rebound in exports amid the nationwide power blackouts   said Samir Madani  co founder of TankerTrackers com  a service that tracks oil shipments and storage Exports dipped below 650 000 bpd during the blackouts  TankerTrackers estimates Two massive power outages in March caused Jose port  the country s largest crude terminal  to shut for at least six full days  according to the Eikon data PDVSA was able  however  to offset delays caused by the blackouts by loading larger vessels bound for Asia  Shipping data shows the company plans to do the same again in April Cargoes sent to India  China and Singapore   a hub for storage and re exports   made up 74 percent of total exports in March  compared with almost 70 percent in February Exports to Europe accounted for 17 percent of the total  versus 22 percent the previous month  PDVSA also continued exporting oil to Maduro s ally Cuba  At least seven small cargoes were sent from its ports in March  totaling 65 520 bpd of crude and fuel  according to the data Guaido last month said shipments to Cuba should be halted  But PDVSA  controlled by a military leadership loyal to Maduro  has continued exports to the island The state run company did not respond to a request for comment Venezuela s oil production once surpassed 3 million bpd  but years of what critics say is mismanagement and corruption have caused that output to dwindle  The reduction in oil revenue has led the once prosperous nation into recession and created conditions for hyperinflation  Millions have fled the country and many who remain cannot afford food or basic goods Sanctions have made it difficult for PDVSA to take payment for its exports  said a PDVSA source  who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation  The largest problem is not to load and ship the vessels   the source said  declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter   It is to get paid   INDIA REMAINS TOP DESTINATIONIndia was once again Venezuela s main destination for exports in March  with a third of total cargoes sent to refineries operated by Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy U S  imports of Venezuelan oil have dropped to zero since mid March due to sanctions  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration The largest individual recipient of Venezuelan barrels last month was China National Petroleum Corp  CNPC  and its subsidiaries with some 234 000 bpd  followed by Russia s Rosneft  which received 214 000 bpd  according to the data  New customers including trading firms Sahara Energy and MS International also received access to Venezuelan crude Rosneft has increased its share of Venezuelan oil shipments since the sanctions  mainly for reselling to refiners  Venezuela s oil minister  Manuel Quevedo  last month traveled to Moscow to negotiate larger sales of Venezuelan oil to Russian companies Rosneft has also boosted fuel supplies to Venezuela  according to the data  Venezuela imported 184 500 bpd of fuel last month  with the largest portion provided by the Russian company  followed by cargoes sent by Reliance and Spain s Repsol Following U S  pressure  Reliance turned to selling fuel to Venezuela from India and Europe to circumvent sanctions  Repsol in March swapped gasoline and other fuel for Venezuelan crude as part of an agreement to collect on dividends owed it by PDVSA   Reporting by Marianna Parraga in Mexico City  Editing by David Gaffen  Simon Webb and Rosalba O Brien  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised NATO countries for increasing their financial contributions to the Western alliance  but he hounded them to pay even more  saying America still shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of protecting Europe The president met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg  who was in Washington to mark the 70th anniversary of the organization formed to counter Russian aggression The two leaders had kind words for one another  But in the past  Trump has called NATO  obsolete  and suggested he might pull the U S  out of the alliance if member nations didn t significantly boost their defense spending  We ve worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair share   Trump told reporters   At some point  it s going to have to go higher  Trump took credit for the increased spending  However  spending by the 29 NATO countries  which dropped after the end of the Cold War  has actually been rising since 2014   before Trump took office  Prior to our getting here  NATO s spending was going way  way down   he said   It was just a one way road down  And since I became president     it s been a rocket ship up  and we have to keep it that way  After Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimean Peninsula  member countries agreed to boost defense budgets and  move toward  spending 2  of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024  The U S  spends about 3 4  of its GDP on defense Since Trump took office  European allies and Canada have added  41 billion to their defense budgets  By the end of next year  this will rise to  100 billion  Stoltenberg said  Germany  however  remains the main target of Trump s ire because it now plans to spend 1 5  by 2024  which is lower than the 2  guideline  Germany is not paying their fair share   Trump said   I have a great feeling for Germany  but they re not paying what they should be paying  We re paying for a big proportion of NATO  which is basically protecting Europe  Stoltenberg has said that the 2  guideline was not invented by the United States and was a target the 29 allies set in 2014 before Trump took office  But he thanked Trump for his  strong commitment to NATO  and for his leadership in getting member nations to increase their commitments  The allies are really stepping up   Stoltenberg said in an interview later with The Associated Press  The clear message from President Trump has helped   is having a real impact  And this is about doing what NATO allies have pledged to do  We still have a long way to go   much to do   but we have really seen very strong progress in defense spending from NATO allies  At times  Stoltenberg has served as a buffer between Trump and some European allies that he has angered Trump  who ran on an  America First  platform  slapped tariffs on the European Union  and pulled the U S  out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal  Trump s eagerness to get along with Russian leader Vladimir Putin   in spite of Russia s meddling in the 2016 U S  presidential election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years  has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat  NATO s single greatest challenge is the absence of strong  principled American presidential leadership for the first time in its history   two former U S  envoys to NATO  Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute  wrote in a report on the 70th birthday for the Harvard Kennedy School s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs Lute and Burns said NATO leaders considered not holding a 2019 summit to mark the 70th anniversary at all because they feared Trump would  blow up a meeting in controversy as he has done each time he has met with NATO leaders during the past two years   The alliance plans a scaled down summit of leaders in December that Trump is expected to attend Allies see Trump as NATO s  most urgent  and often most difficult  problem   they wrote in their report  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump  saying their conclusion was  just simply wrong  and adding that the administration has worked hard to make NATO stronger Stoltenberg is slated to address Congress on Wednesday   a first for a NATO secretary general The NATO foreign ministers  first session Thursday will focus on Russia  The ministers are expected to endorse a package of measures to improve NATO s defenses in the Black Sea Other topics will be NATO s mission in Afghanistan and Turkey s announced decision to buy a Russian surface to air missile system  Turkey is a NATO ally  but the Russian system is not compatible with NATO systems and is considered a threat to U S  F 35 aircraft They also will talk about U S  and Russian plans to withdraw this summer from a 1987 landmark arms control treaty  The U S  accuses Russia of violating the treaty  Moscow says the U S  is not in compliance If the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty is scrapped  neither Washington nor Moscow would face legal constraints on deploying land based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between 500 and 5 500 kilometers  310 to 3 410 miles   Defense officials say the Pentagon plans to begin flight tests later this year of two types of missiles that have been banned by the treaty for more than 30 years  Russia is deploying more and more of these weapons and therefore we call on Russia to come back into compliance with this treaty   Stoltenberg said    Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised  18 2 million over the first six weeks of his presidential bid  his campaign announced Tuesday  a display of financial strength that cements his status as one of the top fund raisers in the sprawling Democratic field Mr  Sanders received almost 900 000 contributions from 525 000 individual donors  his campaign manager  Faiz Shakir  said  The average donation was  20  compared with  27 in Mr  Sanders s 2016 presidential campaign  he said Mr  Shakir said that a majority of Mr  Sanders s donors were under the age of 39  and that 20 percent of all donors had not contributed to Mr  Sanders s previous campaigns  He said that 88 percent of the total money raised came from donors giving  200 or less Mr  Sanders s announcement of his fund raising for the first quarter of the year had been highly anticipated  as he was expected to reveal a sizable total  Presidential candidates must report their first quarter fund raising to the Federal Election Commission by April 15  but they can choose to disclose information before that deadline  The announcement on Tuesday offered a chance for Mr  Sanders s team to showcase the breadth of support for his campaign  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  His total for the quarter is the largest announced by a Democratic candidate so far  though most campaigns have not made their numbers public Senator Kamala Harris of California raised  12 million in the first quarter  her campaign said on Monday  Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   said on Monday that he had raised more than  7 million  Both candidates entered the race in January  several weeks before Mr  Sanders announced his candidacy Andrew Yang  a New York businessman who is running on a platform that the United States should provide a universal basic income  said Tuesday that he had raised more than  1 7 million from over 80 000 donors   noteworthy figures for a political newcomer  His average donation was  17 92  he said  an amount even smaller than Mr  Sanders s Former Representative Beto O Rourke of Texas  who entered the race in March and has been a prolific online fund raiser  has yet to announce his haul for the quarter The fund raising totals are important beyond the symbolic value they carry for candidates who can point to large numbers of supporters  The Iowa caucuses are still 10 months away  meaning that Democratic candidates will need to be able to fund their campaigns for a long stretch of time just to make it to the first nominating contest  Who s in  Who s out  Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker   There is zero question now that Bernie will be able to build a very strong and formidable campaign operation   said Mo Elleithee  who was a spokesman for Hillary Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign and is now the executive director of Georgetown University s Institute of Politics and Public Service But Mr  Elleithee said it remained to be seen whether Mr  Sanders s backers would stick with him as time went on   What will be interesting is  Is this sustainable as other candidates get better known   he said Mr  Sanders posted a bigger opening number than he did in the last presidential race  when he raised about  14 million in the quarter that covered April through June of 2015  Mr  Shakir said it took 146 days  or about 21 weeks  for Mr  Sanders to reach 900 000 donations in that campaign But the amount raised by Mr  Sanders this quarter was not off the charts for a Democratic presidential hopeful  Mrs  Clinton raised about  47 million in her first quarter as a candidate in the 2016 campaign  though unlike Mr  Sanders  she relied heavily on big donations Mr  Sanders began the 2020 race with the benefit of an enormous donor base that he developed in his primary campaign against Mrs  Clinton  when he raised well over  200 million  After jumping into the 2020 race on Feb  19  he quickly reminded his rivals of his large following  collecting  5 9 million in the first 24 hours and a total of  10 million within a week   Only Mr  O Rourke disclosed a bigger 24 hour haul  with  6 1 million  The Sanders campaign had set a goal of receiving one million donations by the end of the first quarter  The campaign fell short of that goal  but Mr  Shakir expressed no regret about having aimed for it   It was important to us to set an ambitious goal   he said Mr  Sanders s financial resources go beyond the money he has received since entering the presidential race  Like others running for president who have previously run for federal office  he can make use of funds that he had raised in earlier campaigns  He began the 2020 race with  14 million available for his use  Mr  Shakir said Mr  Shakir said the new fund raising total showed that the movement Mr  Sanders began in his 2016 campaign was still gaining steam  He noted that there had been questions from pundits about whether that would be the case   Is this movement sustaining  Is it still there   The answer is a resounding yes   he said   It is still strong and it is still growing   

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform voted Tuesday to issue a subpoena to the former head of the personnel security division at the White House after a whistle blower accused him of putting national security in jeopardy by mismanaging security clearances The whistle blower  Tricia Newbold  a manager in the White House s Personnel Security Office  told the committee in a private interview last month that senior Trump administration officials granted security clearances to at least 25 individuals whose applications had been denied by career employees for  disqualifying issues   including drug use and criminal conduct  the committee s Democratic staff said in a memo released on Monday Ms  Newbold said the top personnel security official  Carl Kline  reversed a decision to deny a clearance for a senior White House official after a background check turned up multiple concerns  including possible foreign influence  She also said Mr  Kline granted a security clearance to a second White House official despite concerns voiced by a specialist When Ms  Newbold repeatedly pointed out his actions  she said he discriminated against her over her short stature  which is caused by a form of dwarfism  She filed a complaint against him with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission A White House spokesman declined to comment on the subpoena  In a statement  Mr  Kline s lawyer  Robert Driscoll  said the  facts will prove that he acted appropriately at all times   Mr  Driscoll said he received the subpoena from Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the committee  on Tuesday evening The committee also voted on Tuesday to authorize subpoenas related to the Trump administration s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire  an issue that is being taken up by the United States Supreme Court These committee votes authorized some of the first subpoenas for members of the Trump administration after Democrats  who promised to be a check on the White House  gained the House majority in the midterm elections Mr  Cummings said during Tuesday s meeting that despite claims the committee was just trying to  embarrass  the president with its newfound subpoena power  the move to compel testimony from Mr  Kline was meant to protect national security  The vote  22 to 15  was along party lines NBC News reported in January that Mr  Kline  who was Ms  Newbold s boss  had overruled a decision by career security officials concerned about granting a clearance to Jared Kushner  President Trump s son in law and senior adviser Ms  Newbold  a 39 year old employee who has worked in the White House for 18 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations  said she decided to go to the committee after attempts to raise concerns with her superiors and the White House counsel went nowhere  according to the Democratic staff s account  She s begging us to do something   Mr  Cummings said during the meeting   Because she simply wants her government to work the way it s supposed to work  Republicans on the committee argued against the subpoena because Mr  Kline s lawyer indicated that Mr  Kline was willing to appear before the panel voluntarily  In their own memo summarizing Ms  Newbold s comments to the committee  they presented her concerns as overblown and depicted her as a disgruntled federal employee  We re going to subpoena a guy who just sent us a letter saying he s willing to come here voluntarily   said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio  the committee s top Republican   I ve been on this committee 10 years  I ve never seen anything like this  But Mr  Cummings said that Mr  Kline  who now works at the Department of Defense  refused to answer questions from the committee about specific federal officials and clearance decisions during a voluntary appearance  Mr  Cummings said that the White House refused two committee requests to interview Mr  Kline and that Mr  Kline did not respond to two separate requests sent directly to him since January In a letter to Mr  Cummings  dated Tuesday  Mr  Driscoll wrote that his client was willing to appear but that the White House Counsel s Office deemed some of the proposed topics as an infringement upon President Trump s rights as the chief executive  Mr  Driscoll called a subpoena an  extreme and unnecessary step  Mr  Cummings said he planned to seek testimony from other senior White House officials as well Most of the Republican members of the committee also opposed the majority s proposal to subpoena testimony from a top Justice Department official  John Gore  about adding a citizenship question to the census The committee voted mostly along party lines to authorize a subpoena for testimony from Mr  Gore  as well as for documents from the Justice Department and the Commerce Department  some of which were either denied to the committee or heavily redacted One Republican member  Representative Justin Amash of Michigan  joined the Democrats in the vote The White House did not provide official comment on the census related subpoenas  Mr  Jordan accused Democratic members of the committee of trying to interfere in the court proceedings over the citizenship question In January  a federal trial judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding the question  saying the process that led to the decision was deeply flawed  The Supreme Court in February agreed to hear the case  putting it on a fast track ahead of the June deadline for printing the questionnaires  

NEW YORK   News industry leaders are fighting back against the charge by President Donald Trump and his supporters that the administration s summation of special counsel Robert Mueller s report proved that journalists were  so wrong for so long  in their coverage of the Russia investigation The latest to weigh in was Steve Coll  dean of Columbia University s Graduate School of Journalism  who wrote in a New Yorker magazine essay this week that it s wrong to conclude journalism failed because Mueller did not charge Trump with conspiring with Russians to influence the 2016 election  The New York Times and The Washington Post shared a Pulitzer Prize  awarded by Columbia in 2018  for their reporting on the issue  a prize Trump says should be taken away Complicating the issue is the broad definition of the news media circa 2019  encompassing everything from painstakingly sourced investigative stories to overheated tweets to opinionated pundits  It s premature to pronounce this coverage as some kind of epic press failure   said Nancy Gibbs  former Time magazine editor and a Harvard University professor of press  politics and public policy  People angered by the press  role in investigating the president will use Mueller s findings as a lever in any way they can  she said  That doesn t mean that they re right   Gibbs said The phrase  so wrong for so long  was used by White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney during a CNN appearance on Sunday  He said  we need to figure out  what happened with reporting on the story  Sean Davis  co founder of the Federalist online magazine  said the same thing in the lead of a Wall Street Journal editorial earlier in the week that argued  America s blue chip journalists botched the entire story   The president retweeted his story  I m not sure what you re saying the media got wrong   replied CNN s Jake Tapper   The media reported the investigation was ongoing  Other than the people in the media on the left  not on this network  I don t know anybody who got anything wrong  We didn t say there was conspiracy  We said that Mueller was investigating conspiracy  Mulvaney  without offering specifics  said to Tapper that  if that s your recollection of history  that s great  Face it  the media got this wrong   he said   It s OK  people get stuff wrong all the time  Just not at this level  There were obviously disputed individual stories along the way  ABC suspended Brian Ross for a story wrongly alleging that Trump had asked former national security adviser Michael Flynn to discuss foreign policy with the Russians before he was elected  Three CNN journalists resigned over a story falsely linking a Trump aide to a Russian investment fund  The special counsel s office denied a Buzzfeed report that it had evidence Trump had directed lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress over a Moscow office project Yet much of what the public learned over the past two years on the story was the result of relentless digging by reporters In tweets over the past week  Trump repeated his contention that the mainstream media is the enemy of the people  and said the Times  and Post s Pulitzers should be stripped  The Times  in response  tweeted a picture of its Pulitzer winners and noted that every story cited in their prize winning entry has been proven correct Top editors at the Times and Post  Dean Baquet and Marty Baron  and CNN chief Jeff Zucker offered similar statements noting it was their organizations  job to show what people in power are doing  and prosecutors  responsibility to determine what is legal or illegal  A sitting president s own Justice Department investigated his campaign for collusion with a hostile nation   Zucker said   That s not enormous because the media says so  That s enormous because it s unprecedented  Not every top news executive was eager to get involved  representatives for news presidents at ABC  CBS and NBC either turned down or didn t reply to interview requests   We re going to keep doing our job   MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement  The coverage of the investigation did include embarrassments   specious chyrons  tendentious talking heads and retracted scoops  among them   Columbia s Coll wrote   Yet it does not follow that American journalism failed because the best resourced newsrooms in the nation chose to report assiduously on the Mueller investigation and its subjects  only to learn that Mueller did not prove that Trump had conspired with Russia  If there s any media soul searching to be done  it may involve cable news  In the Trump era  Fox News and MSNBC are frequently the most watched cable networks in general  both appealing to different camps Fox News Channel s Sean Hannity has been Trump s biggest advocate on cable news  making him a target for the president s opponents  Yet MSNBC s Rachel Maddow was criticized this week by Slate s Willa Paskin  who said turning on her show  was like discovering a Facebook friend is on the verge of a nervous breakdown   She said that while Maddow s audience was not as malignant as Hannity s   more than one cable news host can disservice their audience at the same time  Harvard s Gibbs recalls watching reporters and pundits sitting side by side on cable panels  with roles confused when pundits were asked what they were hearing and reporters questioned about what they thought Journalists have long believed that readers and viewers understand the difference between reporting and commentary  Coll said  It would be unrealistic to expect them to make such a distinction now   he said  

Almost exactly 10 years ago  President Barack Obama went before the nation to unveil an urgent overhaul of the nation s automobile industry The financial crisis and plummeting economy had swept America s already fragile carmakers into an existential crisis  Unaided  a complete collapse of the sector  including its many suppliers and dealers  was inevitable  At Mr  Obama s instruction  the auto task force  which I led  administered a strong dose of tough medicine  The ensuing turnaround was remarkable  Vehicle sales  which had fallen nearly in half  bounded back  reaching an 18 million pace in late 2017  Massive losses became massive profits  Employment across the sector  which had fallen to 623 000  has grown to a million Americans In acting so muscularly  Mr  Obama defied both conservative critics and public sentiment  A poll in October 2009 showed that 54 percent of Americans opposed government help for the industry That  too  has flipped  By 2012  56 percent of Americans supported the help given to the car companies  And little has been heard from the loud voices that denounced Mr  Obama for reaching forcefully into the private sector While we didn t get everything right  I came away from the job with some pre existing views reinforced and some new lessons learned Lesson One  As successful as our private enterprise system has been  the auto crisis and  for that matter  the entire financial crisis reminded me that government has an important role to play in overseeing business In normal times  capitalism needs supervision to ensure that companies compete fairly  don t take advantage of workers and produce safe products  to name just a few examples  In extraordinary times  such as when markets fail  government can prudently step in with salutary effects  That was the case in 2009  Without help from Washington  the collapse in auto sales would have exhausted General Motors s and Chrysler s cash reserves  forcing them to close their doors  lay off all their workers and liquidate The collateral damage would have been vast  perhaps a million Americans would have lost their jobs  at least in the short run  at a time when unemployment was already nearing 10 percent  Our critics said we should let private capital handle it  But in those terrifying days  not a penny of private money would have been made available to the auto sector RelatedMore on the auto bailout Opinion   Steven RattnerTrump Is Wrong About the General Motors BailoutNov  28  2018Lesson Two  Saving American companies is not necessarily the same thing as saving American jobs  Yes  domestic employment in the auto sector has recovered nicely  But the number of Mexican autoworkers has grown even faster That s because workers in Mexico and elsewhere have become more productive while wages have stayed relatively low  Pressure remains on auto companies  with their persistently low margins  to shift jobs offshore Lesson Three  Our system of government does not make speedy  effective interventions of this sort easy  In providing capital to the auto sector  we were lucky to have access to the  700 billion fund passed by Congress to rescue the financial system  and so was the George W  Bush administration  which wisely provided emergency bridge loans in December 2008  Without that  I am convinced that the failure of at least one major auto company would have had been required to get Congress to act expeditiously  In 1979  when Chrysler previously requested emergency aid  it took five months for Congress to approve  1 5 billion in rescue loans and an additional six months for Chrysler to meet the numerous conditions that Congress imposed before the company could receive its first tranche of funds Lesson Four  Solving an existential crisis is best done without political pressure  Even under truth serum  I would affirm the president s decision to insulate our team from the lobbying of innumerable special interests  some of which had been major supporters during his election campaign just a few months earlier Lesson Five  Management matters  Why did General Motors and Chrysler almost vaporize while Ford  although struggling  never needed help from the auto task force  Largely because Ford had better leadership that had anticipated the downturn and prepared for it In my 35 years working with companies  I have repeatedly been struck by the transformational impact that a single individual can have on a business  even on a massive multinational corporation with hundreds of thousands of employees Happily  governance at General Motors is much improved  and in Mary Barra  the company has a first rate chief executive Lesson Six  Success can be transitory  Today  it is Ford that is struggling  And all automakers are facing profound changes  some of which were not even a glimmer on the horizon in 2009  During my time at the Treasury Department  we heard a bit about electric cars  but to my recollection  the words  autonomous driving  and  ride sharing  were never uttered Far from its ostrichlike behavior in the years before the rescue  the American auto industry appears to have taken this lesson to heart  particularly in prescient moves like General Motors  decision to move early into self driving car technology For the sake of all Americans  let s hope that the lessons of the industry s near death experience a decade ago remain fresh The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email

President Trump said last week that he would cut off aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  the home countries of most of the migrants arriving at the United States  southern border to seek asylum The Trump administration has already taken the first step to act on the president s directive  notifying Congress that it wanted to divert the  450 million allocated to the region  By Monday  though  the administration had not offered details about whether any aid   such as military aid or support to combat drug trafficking   might be exempt from the order If the aid withdrawal does go ahead  aid advocates say  it would probably affect  the region s most vulnerable people  including small farmers struggling to adapt to climate change and teenagers pressured to join gangs in a region that is a major drug transit route  according to State Department estimates  Advocates say that  should these threats to lives and livelihoods grow  many more people will take their chances on the road and leave for the United States The decision to end aid is likely to provoke anger in Congress  where lawmakers in both parties have supported efforts to address the root causes of migration  If the money is ultimately withheld  it would affect a wide range of programs designed to improve citizen security  promote economic development and encourage accountable government Security and justiceMr  Trump has complained that the governments of the three countries have done too little to halt immigration  and portrayed the withdrawal of aid as punishment for their leaders A vast majority of the aid  however  goes to nongovernmental organizations  churches  charities and private contractors that carry out projects for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development  According to the Washington Office on Latin America  a human rights research group  the largest portion of aid has gone to improving security and justice systems  and to preventing violence Aid varies from country to country to address their different needs  In El Salvador  where the United States has helped support a broad antiviolence program  57 percent of the  149 million in aid allocated in 2017 went to projects intended to prevent violence  improve security and community policing  and train judges  prosecutors and public defenders In Honduras  where aid reached almost  182 million in 2017  the highest percentage of funds   some 44 percent   went to support programs that improved justice and security  with an additional 30 percent allocated for antipoverty programs among the country s rural poor The aid also supports anticorruption measures by providing funds for international prosecutors who have been investigating graft in Honduras and Guatemala  and a special anticorruption unit in the Salvadoran attorney general s office  In advance of Guatemala s elections in June  the United States has also helped finance the country s electoral agency The United States also supported border security and efforts to combat drug trafficking  though those funds accounted for a smaller percentage of the overall aid  The Pentagon set aside millions to improve drug interdiction and to supply equipment and training to counter trafficking in Honduras Economic aidIn Guatemala  poverty  rather than violence  is the main driver of migration  More than half of the  178 million in 2017 aid went to programs to alleviate poverty  particularly in the country s western highlands  where many children suffer from chronic malnutrition Economic aid is the next largest block of American support in Central America  after security and related programs  The funds support small businesses in Guatemala  schools in Honduras and job training for at risk youth in El Salvador  among other projects  Some of the programs are broader  such as an effort to bring down high power costs by connecting electrical grids and financing new infrastructure In 2017   18 million was allocated to help farmers in Honduras diversify their crops and improve productivity  to reduce extreme hunger and poverty  and  14 5 million to help small business owners  including funds to help create a sustainable system for cacao production In Guatemala that year  more than  10 million was designated to help communities adapt to climate change s effects   such as increased drought and coffee destroying fungus   and  6 3 million to help the Health Ministry prevent maternal and infant deaths  and prevent H I V  infections Changing prioritiesUntil a large wave of unaccompanied minors from Central America arrived at the Texas border in 2014  American aid to the region focused on economic growth and law enforcement  But the surge of child migrants  which was in part spurred by the high murder rates in the Northern Triangle  prompted the Obama administration to request more money from Congress for a broader approach to the region As a result  aid increased to  750 million in 2016 before beginning to drop under the Trump administration  Over all  Congress allocated almost  2 1 billion to Central America from 2016 to 2018  most of it for the Northern Triangle countries  though agencies have been slow to spend all the money Murder rates have fallen in all three countries but poverty remains as entrenched as ever   and it remains difficult to assess how effective the aid has been  particularly over such a short period  Advocates argue that programs need years to take effect The Trump administration has also redirected its emphasis toward security and away from the focus on ethical governance  That shift has taken pressure off Central American governments to become more accountable  and both the Guatemalan and Honduran governments have recently pushed back against anticorruption efforts  

CHICAGO   Former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot easily won the Chicago mayor s race Tuesday  earning support from every part of the city to defeat a longtime political insider and become the first black woman and openly gay person to lead the nation s third largest city Lightfoot  who had never been elected to public office  delivered a commanding victory over Toni Preckwinkle  who served in the City Council for 19 years before becoming Cook County Board president  Preckwinkle also is chairwoman of the county Democratic Party Lightfoot promised to rid City Hall of corruption and help low income and working class people she said had been  left behind and ignored  by Chicago s political ruling class  It was a message that resonated with voters weary of political scandal and insider deals  and who said the city s leaders for too long have invested in downtown at the expense of neighborhoods  Together we can and will make Chicago a place where your zip code doesn t determine your destiny   Lightfoot told a cheering crowd at her victory party   We can and we will break this city s endless cycle of corruption and never again   never ever   allow politicians to profit from elected positions  She said people are seeing  a city reborn    a place where race and  who you love  don t matter Chicago will become the largest U S  city to have a black woman serve as mayor when Lightfoot is sworn in May 20  She will join seven other black women currently serving as mayors in major U S  cities  including Atlanta and New Orleans  and will be the second woman to lead Chicago Preckwinkle said she called Lightfoot Tuesday night to congratulate her on a  hard fought campaign   While I may be disappointed I m not disheartened  For one thing  this is clearly a historic night   she told a crowd gathered in her South Side neighborhood   Not long ago two African American women vying for this position would have been unthinkable  And while it may be true that we took two very different paths to get here  tonight is about the path forward  Congratulations poured in for Lightfoot  56  who has one daughter with her wife  Amy Eshleman Brian Johnson  CEO of Equality Illinois  said the civil rights organization for lesbian and gay people was  thrilled  with the outcome  This victory is historic  and it is also an undeniably proud moment for the LGBTQ community   Johnson said Pete Buttigieg  the openly gay mayor of South Bend  Indiana  who s running for president in 2020  said on Twitter that Lightfoot  will be a terrific new leader for her city and in the community of American mayors  Lightfoot emerged as the surprising leader in the first round of voting in February when 14 candidates were on the ballot to succeed Mayor Rahm Emanuel  who decided against running for a third term Lightfoot seized on outrage over a white police officer s fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald to launch her reformer campaign  She got in the race even before Emanuel announced he wouldn t seek re election amid criticism for initially resisting calls to release video of the shooting  I m not a person who decided I would climb the ladder of a corrupt political party   Lightfoot said during a debate last month   I don t hold the title of committeeman  central committeeman  boss of the party  Preckwinkle countered that her opponent lacks the necessary experience for the job  This is not an entry level job   Preckwinkle said repeatedly during the campaign Joyce Ross  64  a resident of the city s predominantly black West Side who is a certified nursing assistant  cast her ballot Tuesday for Lightfoot  Ross said she believes Lightfoot will be better able to clean up the police department and curb the city s violence She was also bothered by Preckwinkle s association with longtime Alderman Ed Burke  who was indicted earlier this year on charges he tried to shake down a restaurant owner who wanted to build in his ward  My momma always said birds of a feather flock together   Ross said Truly Gannon  a 39 year old mother of four who works as a dietitian  said she wasn t bothered by stories that portrayed Preckwinkle as an insider aligned with questionable politicians like Burke  She supported Preckwinkle  based on her experience  I m not sure Lightfoot would be able to handle the job like Preckwinkle   she said The campaign between the two women got off to a contentious start  with Preckwinkle s advertising focusing on Lightfoot s work as a partner at Mayer Brown  one of the nation s largest law firms  and tagging her as a  wealthy corporate lawyer  Preckwinkle also tried to cast Lightfoot as an insider for working in police oversight posts under Emanuel and police oversight  procurement and emergency communications posts under Mayor Richard M  Daley But Preckwinkle had to spend much of her campaign answering for her ties to Chicago s political establishment  including Burke Despite the barbs on the campaign trail  the two advanced similar ideas to boost the city s deeply troubled finances  which include an estimated  250 million budget deficit next year and billions in unfunded pension liabilities Both candidates expressed support for a casino in Chicago and changing the state s income tax system to a graduated tax  in which higher earners are taxed at a higher rate   two measures lawmakers have tried for unsuccessfully for years to pass    Associated Press writer Don Babwin contributed to this report  

ANCHORAGE   Working through two winters in the biting arctic cold  roustabouts bored three miles deep into the coastal plain of northeast Alaska in search of oil  In the spring of 1986  they packed up and left  uttering not a word about what they had found and leaving only a short section of steel pipe to mark the spot For more than three decades  the findings from the  40 million exploratory well have been one of the oil industry s most closely guarded secrets  Outside of the oil giants that paid for it  only a handful of people know what was discovered there Now the secret has become much more than a curiosity  The Trump administration  undoing decades of environmental protections  plans to sell drilling leases in the area  which is part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and has long been believed to contain North America s biggest untapped onshore trove of oil Anyone interested in drilling in the area urgently wants to know  Was the well   the only one ever drilled there   a dry hole or a potential gusher No one will say officially  but The New York Times found an answer in clues hidden 4 000 miles from the Arctic tundra  in the archives of a Beaux Arts style courthouse in Cleveland  The discovery well was worthless   said Sidney B  Silverman  a retired lawyer who was involved in a long since forgotten lawsuit filed there in 1987  Read more about how the Trump administration is clearing the way for oil exploration in the Arctic refuge  Mr  Silverman  who is now 86 and divides his time between Long Island and South Florida  reached that conclusion while representing shareholders of Standard Oil of Ohio as it was being acquired by British Petroleum  Both companies had a stake in the Arctic test well and were poised to benefit from further development ImageSidney Silverman  a retired lawyer  learned about the findings in a confidential deposition in the 1980s  but hasn t spoken out until now CreditEve Edelheit for The New York TimesIn merger documents  BP had placed only a  nominal  value on the potential reserves in the refuge  and Mr  Silverman and other lawyers suspected that Standard Oil s shareholders were about to be cheated They quickly learned otherwise BP allowed Mr  Silverman to conduct a confidential deposition about the well with a BP executive  David Jenkins  Reached by The Times  Mr  Jenkins said his memories were vague  but he recalled the deposition   which was sealed by the court   and telling Mr  Silverman that  there was never any evidence at all  at that stage  that there was anything material within the refuge  Mr  Silverman  similarly  remembered being convinced that  either there was no oil and gas there  or the oil couldn t be produced at an economic value  Some of the documents in the case are missing from the court file  perhaps lost over the decades  But in more than 1 000 pages of legal and regulatory filings  The Times discovered other hints that the findings were disappointing  Under oath  a Goldman Sachs banker who worked on the merger testified that BP had led him to believe that the test well results were  not particularly encouraging  John Warden  a lawyer who represented BP  said that he had only dim memories of the case but that the well results  became a nonissue   Told of The Times s reporting  he added   It looks to me like you have gotten it right  Mr  Silverman hinted at the findings in a memoir he self published 10 years ago  but has never before spoken out directly about what was said in the deposition  He said he was breaking his silence because of the Trump administration s decision to open the refuge   protected by Congress for decades   for oil development  This is important for the whole country   he said One dry hole does not necessarily mean there is no oil to be found  especially since some decades old seismic tests indicate that the area may hold as much as 12 billion barrels  worth  And knowledge of the area s subsurface geology is valuable  But confirmation that the results of the only test well were discouraging could embolden opponents of drilling and prompt second thoughts among potential lease bidders  Knowing that information would help you in an extremely competitive bid   said Larry Persily  a former federal gas official responsible for Alaska  who noted there had been billion dollar lease sales in the state  While the well is all but  a pimple on a speck  of the Arctic s massive landscape  he said  it is a prevailing mystery   And we love mysteries  ImageWhen the oil companies were finished with the test well  they hauled everything away   even  according to one account  the rock cuttings CreditTom Cook Papers Anchorage MuseumOil and gas development in the Arctic refuge  or ANWR   an expanse about the size of South Carolina that is home to caribou  polar bears and other wildlife   has been a goal of Republicans in Congress and many Alaskans for a half century But efforts to open the refuge s coastal plain  known as the 1002 Area  foundered for years as opponents argued that exploration would irreparably harm one of the country s largest pristine landscapes Republicans saw an opening with the election of Donald J  Trump  In 2017  the Republican controlled Congress passed a measure to sell oil leases in the refuge  Since then  the Interior Department has moved rapidly to sell leases for the 1002 Area before the 2020 election  when Democrats could regain the White House and block the sales The exploratory well was drilled under an agreement among BP  Standard Oil  Chevron and two Alaska Native corporations created to improve economic conditions among the indigenous population  The deal also allowed the oil companies to pursue further exploration on Native lands within the 1002 Area  if the federal government offered leases for the rest of the coastal plain At a congressional hearing last week  Richard Glenn  an executive with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation  one of the Native partners  played down the data s significance   You can t determine the quality of any single basin by one well   he said The corporation declined to comment for this article  as did BP  Chevron said in a statement that the results of its activities in the area remained confidential Joe Balash  the Interior Department official overseeing the leasing efforts  told reporters in December that the potential oil riches should attract plenty of interest despite the enduring mystery surrounding the well   a site known as a  tight hole   an industry term for wells with confidential findings  In the oil and gas industry  there s secrets and then there s secrets   Mr  Balash said   This is the tightest hole  I think  that has ever been drilled  A Legal CircusA year after the exploratory well was completed  a fleet of lawyers descended upon the Cuyahoga County Courthouse in Cleveland  BP  which already held a minority stake in Standard Oil of Ohio  had offered  7 4 billion to buy the rest of it  and the lawyers were there to lodge claims that Standard Oil s shareholders were being shortchanged The deal and the ensuing litigation led to a legal spectacle  with lawyers  executives and bankers shuttling from London to New York  often on Concorde jetliners  and then on to Cleveland and California  The case generated financial headlines around the world Eager to distinguish himself from the other lawyers  Mr  Silverman seized on the lack of detail in BP s offer about what had been found at the test well  known as KIC 1  In a filing  he and his team suggested that the omission had led to a significant shortfall in the value of the deal Soon after  BP s lawyers let Mr  Silverman question Mr  Jenkins  the oil executive  The proceeding was unusually secretive  No copies were made of the transcript  and the original is said to have been stored in a safe at a law firm representing BP Mr  Jenkins  who is 80  lives near London and still works in the oil industry  said he had found a notation about the meeting in his 1987 appointment book  He did not remember details of the KIC 1 findings  he said  but recalled that  there wasn t anything in that well that was particularly encouraging  Mr  Jenkins holds out the possibility that there is oil in the refuge   But not where the KIC well was drilled   he said Mr  Silverman  who ultimately agreed to a settlement  said he had been satisfied by what he learned during the deposition   I assure you right now that if that property were valuable  if it had any value  I would not have agreed to that merger  Mr  Silverman and the other lawyers agreed to a small increase in the offer price and BP stock warrants for Standard Oil s shareholders  allowing them to potentially share in future profits Just as a settlement seemed imminent  lawyers for a large shareholder  the California Public Employees  Retirement System  known as Calpers  lodged a challenge  also asking whether the price reflected the drilling results To allay those concerns  lawyers for Calpers were allowed to see information about the well findings  Yeoryios Apallas  a former California deputy attorney general who represented Calpers at the hearing  said that after reviewing a document that showed details of the test well  he concluded  there was no reasonable basis on which to question the fairness of the price  The case was over in about three months  Mr  Silverman and the other plaintiffs  lawyers shared  22 million in legal fees as they completed one of the era s largest mergers In the decades since  as the debate flared in Congress over whether to open the refuge to oil exploration  Mr  Silverman and others involved in the case quietly kept the secrets of the test well  To date  there has been no drilling in ANWR   Mr  Silverman wrote in his 2009 memoir   A Happy Life  From Courtroom to Classroom   Environmentalists think their efforts have preserved the wilderness area   he wrote   I know better  but must remain silent  ImageMr  Silverman wrote about the lawsuit in his memoir   A Happy Life  From Courtroom to Classroom  CreditSidney SilvermanKeeping the SecretThe oil companies drilling KIC 1 were so concerned about secrecy that  by one industry account  they even shipped the rock cuttings from the well out of Alaska  In 1988  the companies and one of their Native corporation partners sued Alaska to keep the well data confidential After a four year legal battle  the sides reached a tentative agreement that would allow only a few state officials to see the findings  But the state wanted to be sure the data was significant enough to warrant concealing it   that  as the companies contended  it would help in valuing subsurface mineral rights nearby  So  Mark Myers  a state petroleum geologist at the time  became one of the few people outside of BP or Chevron to see it In a conference room at BP s Anchorage offices  Dr  Myers said  he was allowed to comb through the information  which included geological and geophysical data from the well  He was not allowed to take notes  When he finished  he reported only that the findings were significant Since then  the state s files have remained locked away at the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in Anchorage  To this day  Dr  Myers  who went on to lead the United States Geological Survey and Alaska s Department of Natural Resources  and now works as a consultant  has not said whether the results were positive or negative  even as many news reports have speculated about them Proponents of opening the refuge to exploration have long cautioned that the KIC 1 findings are only one data point  While no other wells have been drilled within the refuge  many have been drilled near it A year after KIC 1 was completed  Tenneco and several partners drilled a well off the coast about seven miles to the northeast  The well was intended not to discover oil  but to learn more about any potential oil bearing rock formations  The results were not encouraging  according to Douglas R  Choromanski  who helped analyze data from the well  called Aurora Other wells have been drilled just west of the refuge  closer to the huge oil field at Prudhoe Bay that spurred Alaska s oil boom in the 1970s  Some have tapped into significant oil reserves  and some have not Dr  Myers said that given new understanding of where oil reserves may be found  much of the focus on the refuge has shifted to the western side  away from the KIC 1 well  A 3 D seismic testing program has been proposed to help pinpoint any oil reserves in the 1002 Area A full airing of the KIC 1 findings  though  could come if the Interior Department moves forward with selling leases  Under state rules  lease sales near the well are likely to set off a public release of the data ImageSteel pipe marks the location of the  40 million KIC 1 exploratory well from 1986 CreditFran Durner Anchorage Daily NewsIn the meantime  the secrecy surrounding the results   and their location   remains a source of gossip  rumor and political intrigue In February  Alaska s new Republican governor  Mike Dunleavy  fired Hollis French  a Democrat on state s oil and gas conservation commission  In a letter the month before  the governor accused Mr  French of several transgressions  including disclosing to a journalist details of where the KIC 1 files were kept and the protocols for gaining access to them  Mr  French was not accused of revealing the actual data At a disciplinary hearing  another commissioner  Dan Seamount  said that after he concluded that Mr  French had divulged the data s location   in the dead of night we moved the information to somewhere more secure   fearing that many people wanted to get to the findings and that  all it would take would be a bulldozer and 15 minutes    My policy is to tell no one where the data reside  not even what country it resides in   Mr  Seamount said   It is arguably the most valuable well information in the world   

This week  hundreds of Times readers shared their reactions to the unfolding accusations against Joseph R  Biden Jr  by women who said he had kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable Many readers defended the former vice president as a product of a different time and questioned if the  MeToo movement had gone too far  Others insisted that making a woman feel uncomfortable has always been wrong Since Lucy Flores  a former Nevada state assemblywoman  made public her accusations against Mr  Biden last Friday  multiple women have come forward  telling The Times  The Washington Post and others that he made them feel uncomfortable  bringing the total to seven as of Thursday afternoon  Mr  Biden  who is expected to announce whether he will enter the race for president in April  released a video on Wednesday vowing to  be more mindful and respectful of people s personal space   though he stopped short of apologizing Here is a selection of our readers  responses  which came from comments across our site and emails to our On Politics newsletter  They have been lightly edited for clarity Many defended Mr  Biden  saying he was from an older generation when social mores around physical contact were different I am 68  a bit younger than Joe Biden  But I am from a big Irish family and we are always kissing and hugging people  It was an expression of welcome and warmth  Now I understand in this MeToo movement that there are those who are uncomfortable with such intimate physical expressions  So now that Joe has been called out on it  it is up to him to show his changed behavior if indeed he runs for president  which I hope he does    Sally Ziegenfuss  PennsylvaniaI m a 70 year old woman who has always thought that male attention that might involve non intimate touching was something to be pleased about  even proud of  This is definitely a generational issue and younger women need to have perspective and understand that what was very acceptable in the past  even a couple of years ago  should not and cannot be judged by today s standards    Ellen Goodman  MassachusettsBack in the  60s this issue didn t exist  It was a different time  When will we stop looking back over our collective shoulders  and move forward    Whitney Devlin  74  New York How do you view Joe Biden s past behavior  Share your thoughts in the comments  But many others said Mr  Biden s age was no excuse for his actions I am in my 60s  Regardless of age or habitat  Joe Biden s touchy feely actions with women  and men  allegedly  are disgusting and inappropriate  I don t believe they arise out of innocent affection  though he may have himself convinced  They arise out of unconscious male privilege and are demeaning and distressing to those on the receiving end    Joan Weis  CaliforniaMen of his generation assumed that the  affection  being given would be welcomed and appreciated  particularly since it was being given by a man in power  The problem has been that nobody bothered to ask the women or girls    Lori Abbott Moreland  Sacramento  Calif This is not a generational misunderstanding  Biden s licentious behavior  let s call it what it is  was never the norm and not what most women wanted or expected    Dwight Dekeyser  63  Cherry Hill  N J Joe Biden is facing a moment of  white man privilege   Just because HE didn t think that gently rubbing shoulders and kissing the back of her head wasn t inappropriate doesn t mean this incident can be dismissed as paternal or innocent  It is the woman s feelings about the kiss touch that matter  He lives in a different era and is no longer relevant to most generations  He needs to step aside    Sandra Mathews  51  Madison  N J  On Politics is an email newsletter making sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics  Sign up here  Some readers said they worried the  MeToo movement risked going off course Is this where we re heading  to ban  jokes  hugs and kisses  from the public sphere  Early on we baby boomers rejected the stiff formalities of an earlier generation for an easy physicality  an appreciative give and take across gender lines that graced daily life with moments of lightness and warmth  Do we really want to push the Joe Bidens and Al Frankens from our lives  Maybe it s generational  but I fear we re losing something I ve long cherished   MeTooMuch    Millie Olson  CaliforniaAs a college student warned constantly about the dangers of life on campus  I worry that the legacy of the  MeToo movement will not be empowerment for women  but a generation of women terrified of interaction with males  who see any physical intimacy as a threat  When men kiss me on the head or squeeze my shoulders  it does make me uncomfortable  But does it make me uncomfortable because it is creepy or because I have been told I should find it creepy  I hope the pendulum will soon swing back to a more reasonable and thoughtful  less knee jerk political and cultural climate    Meg Edwards  OhioThis story personifies exactly what is wrong with the  MeToo movement  It started off as a positive force  bringing to light predatory behavior  and now we ve

Australia passed sweeping legislation Thursday that threatens huge fines for social media companies and jail for their executives if they fail to rapidly remove  abhorrent violent material  from their platforms The law   strongly opposed by the tech industry   puts Australia at the forefront of a global movement to hold companies like Facebook and YouTube accountable for the content they host It comes less than a month after a gunman  believed to be an Australian white nationalist  distributed a hate filled manifesto online before using Facebook to live stream the massacre of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch  New Zealand  These platforms should not be weaponized for these purposes   said Christan Porter  Australia s attorney general  during a debate on the bill Thursday in the House of Representatives  Internet platforms must take the spread of abhorrent violent material online seriously   he added Written quickly and without much input from technology companies or experts  the measure goes as far as any other democracy s attempt to punish multinational tech platforms for the behavior of their users  This is most likely a world first   Mr  Porter said  adding that  there was a near unanimous view among Australians that social media platforms had to take more responsibility for their content  The legislation criminalizes  abhorrent violent material   which it defines as videos that show terrorist attacks  murders  rape or kidnapping  Social media companies that fail to remove such content  expeditiously  could face fines of up to 10 percent of their annual profit  and employees could be sentenced to up to three years in prison  Companies must also inform the police when illegal material is found The bill  even before it was introduced in the House of Representatives on Thursday  intensified an already heated global debate over free speech  violence and technology Australian media companies warned this week that the law could lead to the censorship of legitimate speech A consortium of the global tech superpowers  including Google  Facebook and Amazon  also argued that it would damage Australia s relations with other countries because it would require  proactive  surveillance of all users worldwide  while criminalizing content reposted by users without the companies knowing about it  This law  which was conceived and passed in five days without any meaningful consultation  does nothing to address hate speech  which was the fundamental motivation for the tragic Christchurch terrorist attacks   said Sunita Bose  the managing director of the Digital Industry Group Inc   an advocacy group representing Facebook  Google and other companies  With the vast volumes of content uploaded to the internet every second   Ms  Bose said   this is a highly complex problem that requires discussion with the technology industry  legal experts  the media and civil society to get the solution right   that didn t happen this week  In the Senate Wednesday night  Richard Di Natale  a senator in the Australian Greens party  said the process was being rushed  He blamed both Australia s conservative government and the opposition Labor Party  which he characterized as compliant  We ve got some of the most significant changes to social media online regulation that we have ever seen   he said  And yet  with little or no time for public input  he added   it s going to be rammed through  Experts warned that the law   which is meant to reach beyond traditional social media to sites that have been hotbeds of white supremacy  like 4Chan   could lead to legal challenges  It s not clear whether Australia would be able to take action against companies that do not have offices in the country  nor is it clear if it would have a right to impose profit based penalties on international behemoths like Facebook The vague standard of removing content  expeditiously    which would be decided by a jury  under the law   could also lead to extended battles  full of technical detail  over what should be reasonably expected from tech companies dealing with millions if not billions of users A similar law in Germany requires companies remove  obviously illegal  content  within 24 hours  a more precise time frame that has nonetheless been challenging to meet  Read more about countries considering steps to regulate posts on social media  One problem  according to experts  is that banned posts  photos and videos continue to linger online because the platforms  using both human moderators and technology  have been unable to identify and remove every iteration of illegal content Susan Benesch  founder of the Dangerous Speech Project at Harvard s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society  said that Australia s attempt to keep  abhorrent violent material  off the internet could face similar problems  leading to more dramatic responses from the platforms  It would likely encourage increased censorship and takedowns by companies   she said   The platforms would likely move their offices out of countries that pass such laws  to protect them from prosecution  Some lawmakers suggested that the legislation had been pushed through by Australia s conservative government to avoid a far more difficult conversation about root causes of the Christchurch massacre  Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry  The fundamental evil we are seeking to eradicate is not the sharing of recordings  it is the violence itself   said Mark Dreyfus  a Labor Party lawmaker from the state of Victoria  adding   An attack on any religion is an attack on all religion  If Labor wins national elections expected in May  he said  the new government will revisit the law s provisions with an eye toward the broader issue of hate speech  which is not covered by the legislation  The lack of consultation on this bill has meant that the government has not even considered the practical difficulties   he said Mr  Porter  the attorney general  insisted that the details could be worked out  At a news conference after the law s passage  he boasted that  this is mostly likely a world first   There was an expectation that the government would move urgently   he said   which is precisely what we have done   

BERLIN   Germany s most notorious far right politician  Bjrn Hcke  a man who has called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin  a monument of shame   was furious when he woke up one morning to find a section of the memorial built to scale outside his bedroom window It was November 2017  Mr  Hcke sued the artist who had secretly rented the neighboring property and prepared the stunt over many months  He tried to have him evicted  He even launched criminal proceedings against him  But to no avail  The rental lease is open ended And the replica of the Holocaust memorial remains But where civil and criminal proceedings have failed  a state prosecutor has stepped in  it emerged Wednesday  The prosecutor s office in Mr  Hcke s eastern home state  Thuringia  is investigating the artist  Philipp Ruch  on suspicion of  forming a criminal association   a legal provision known as Paragraph 129  which gives the state far reaching surveillance rights and is normally applied to criminal groups and suspected extremists The investigation  which was revealed in the answer to a routine parliamentary question  is now raising questions about whether the law is being leveraged by far right sympathizers to crack down on their opponents  Mr  Hcke s party  the far right Alternative for Germany  the country s third largest party in Parliament  is particularly strong in the former Communist East of the country  We have to ask the question  Is there a political intention that overlaid the judicial intention   said Steffen Dittes  the lawmaker of the Left Party who made the parliamentary request to see a list of all those who were being investigated under Paragraph 129 In the reply he was sent  there were a dozen investigations listed in two tables  In one table  designated for terrorist suspects  groups like the Islamic State and the Shabab came up repeatedly  the other table included a group of Holocaust deniers  far right and far left extremists   and then   a group of action artists   It sends a devastating political signal   Mr  Dittes said Mr  Dittes noted that the investigation of Mr  Ruch was opened in November 2017  a week after he had unveiled the replica memorial and just a couple of days after Mr  Hcke had publicly accused Mr  Ruch and his artist collective of being  a terrorist association  ImageBjrn Hcke  center  a member of the far right party

on far right offenders  for example letting it slide when a notorious German song about  a subway to Auschwitz  was sung at an Alternative for Germany election rally in 2017  This does not look like a mistake or an exception   Mr  Dittes said Martin Zschchner  the prosecutor in Thuringia in charge of the investigation  denied that it was politically motivated  Speaking in a telephone interview  Mr  Zschchner said he was investigating Mr  Ruch because he was suspected of illegally  spying  on Mr  Hcke  On their internet page they said they wanted to spy on him  so the question is whether that happened or was planned   Mr  Zschchner said  Sixteen months later  he said  the investigation was still continuing Meanwhile  the domestic intelligence service of Thuringia concluded long ago that neither Mr  Ruch nor his artist collective  the Berlin based Center for Political Beauty  was extremist   It s political art  not extremism   said Stephan Kramer  who heads the agency Mr  Ruch aims to offend  He has been sued countless times over his art  but so far he has never lost a case  And never before has anyone raised any suspicions of him being a criminal or involved in extremist activity  he said  That is the scary part   Mr  Ruch said in an interview on Wednesday   They could be observing me  tapping my phone  following me around because they don t like my art and my politics   He plans legal action against Mr  Zschchner The idea of making a replica memorial outside of Mr  Hcke s house came to Mr  Ruch in January 2017  That month  Mr  Hcke spoke at a rally in Dresden and questioned the guiding precept of modern Germany   the country s culpability in World War II and the Holocaust   calling on Germans to make a  180 degree  turn in the way they viewed their history Germans were  the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of their capital   he had said  referring to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin ImageA news conference last year with activists of the Center for Political Beauty  from left  Cesy Leonard  Stefan Pelzer and Philipp Ruch CreditBernd von Jutrczenka Picture Alliance  via Getty ImagesIn addition to building the replica memorial  Mr  Ruch and his colleagues pretended to monitor Mr  Hcke s family home from a fake spy room with old electronic equipment that was also open to visitors Sometimes  the artists would dress up as spies in trench coats and filmed Mr  Hcke s house  Once  they even rifled through his trash to get a DNA sample in order to determine Mr  Hcke s own racial purity   It turned out he has Polish and Portuguese ancestry  Another time  they offered 5 000 euros  or about  5 620  to anyone willing to provide a witness statement that Mr  Hcke has written under a pseudonym for a newsletter associated with a convicted neo Nazi who lives two villages away Mr  Ruch defended these measures as stunts aimed at raising awareness about how extremist Mr  Hcke s views were in his opinion Two years later  Germany s domestic intelligence office has in fact put Mr  Hcke and a number of other prominent members of the Alternative for Germany under observation for suspected extremism  What we did as fiction the state is now doing in reality   Mr  Ruch said Mr  Ruch has known since February that he was the subject of some investigation because a government sponsored organization that had invited him to speak at a conference abruptly disinvited him on Feb  12 In a letter  the organization said it had been informed by the Interior Ministry about a criminal investigation regarding his person Mr  Ruch himself had not been informed that he was under investigation  It was only when Mr  Dittes contacted him last month that he began to make enquiries  But when he requested to see his file  he was denied access  because the investigations are still ongoing   

ISLAMABAD NEW DELHI   Pakistani social media campaigner Hanzala Tayyab leads about 300 ultra nationalist cyber warriors fighting an internet war with arch foe India  in a battle that is increasingly sucking in global tech giants such as Twitter and Facebook  Tayyab  24  spends his days on Facebook and encrypted WhatsApp chatrooms organizing members of his Pakistan Cyber Force group to promote anti India content and make it go viral  including on Twitter where he has more than 50 000 followers That ranges from highlighting alleged Indian human rights abuses to lionizing insurgents battling Indian security forces in Kashmir  a disputed Himalayan region at the heart of historic tensions between Pakistan and India  Tayyab s job became harder on Monday when the Pakistan Cyber Force s Facebook account was taken down  one of 103 Pakistani accounts the social media giant said it had deleted because of  inauthentic behavior  and spamming  Some Indian nationalist accounts have also been suspended in recent weeks Portraying himself as an online combatant defending Pakistan from India s attempts to destabilize his country  Tayyab plans to continue playing his role in the broader information war being fought between the nuclear armed foes  We are countering the Indian narrative through social media  we are countering the enemies of Pakistan   Tayyab told Reuters in the capital Islamabad With a combined population of 1 5 billion  India and Pakistan are hot growth markets for Facebook and Twitter  say analysts But with many rival ultra nationalist and extremist groups in the region using Facebook and Twitter platforms to advance their political agenda  both companies face accusations of bias whenever they suspend accounts Facebook has been buffeted by controversies across the globe in recent years  including for not stopping the use of fake accounts to try to sway public opinion in the 2016 U S  Presidential election and Britain s vote to leave the European Union  and for not acting to stamp out hate speech on its platform that was fuelling ethnic violence in Myanmar Four Facebook and more than 20 Twitter accounts belonging to members of the Pakistan Cyber Force have been shuttered in the past two months  according to Tayyab  who is still angry at Twitter for shutting down his previous personal account in 2016 A Twitter spokeswoman said   We believe in impartiality and do not take any actions based on political viewpoints  A Facebook spokesperson told Reuters the company did not remove the Pakistani accounts because of Indian government pressure  but because people behind them coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves   When we disrupt these networks for coordinated inauthentic behavior  it s because of their deceptive behavior and not because of the content they re sharing  or the ideology or political leanings of the people behind them   Facebook said FLARE UPPakistan and India flirted with war in February  when they carried out aerial bombing missions against each other s territory for the first time since the 1971 war and fought a brief dogfight over the Kashmir skies That flare up was accompanied by a fierce propaganda war on social media This online battle of political and ideological narratives is one that Pakistan s military believes it must win at all costs  analysts say  Military spokesmen often warn unconventional  fifth generation warfare  is being waged against Pakistan Facebook said on Monday the 103 accounts removed were part of a network linked to employees of the Pakistani military s public relations arm Tayyab denies the Pakistan Cyber Force is linked to Pakistan s military  saying the group is made up of volunteers But analysts say such cyber armies work directly either for Pakistan s military or civilian state organizations  acting as de facto proxies or militias in the online battlefields  These groups who are being resourced and organized are actually a kind of a line of defense for this fifth generation warfare   said Shahzad Ahmed  from Pakistani digital rights group Bytes for All Pakistan s military did not respond to a Reuters request for comment  CASE OF TREASON In India  similar nationalist groups are popping up and pushing to purge and punish those who they perceive to be critical of India   or supportive of Pakistan   on social media One such group  Clean the Nation  says its actions have resulted in more than 50 people who had posted what it called anti India comments and remarks critical of India s armed forces being arrested or suspended from work or education  This is our motherland and if someone is abusing people who are protecting our motherland  actually fighting on the ground  I don t believe they should be allowed to work here or allowed to live here   Rahul Kaushik  one of co founders the group  told Reuters   This is a clear case of treason  in our view  Kaushik said Clean the Nation had no formal links with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   though one BJP leader praised the group when it was founded in late February  following an attack by a Pakistan militant group in Indian controlled Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitary police Two of Clean the Nation s founders  Siddharth Kapoor and Ashutosh Vashishtha  are followed on Twitter by India s Prime Minister Narendra Modi  Others including Kaushik have posted pictures on social media of meetings with Modi and other members of his cabinet   Amit Malviya  the BJP s head of social media  did not respond to a request for comment  Clean the Nation said some of its accounts had been banned or suspended by Facebook last month  That action was unconnected with the 549 accounts and 138 pages linked to India s opposition Congress Party that Facebook said on Monday had been taken down    Additional reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal in New Delhi and Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI  Editing by Alex Richardson  

LONDON   With Britain racing toward a chaotic exit from the European Union within days  Prime Minister Theresa May veered away from the cliff edge Tuesday  saying she would seek another Brexit delay and hold talks with the opposition to seek a compromise May made the announcement after the EU s chief negotiator warned that a disruptive and costly Brexit was likely unless Britain broke the impasse that has paralyzed the government and Parliament After failing repeatedly to win Parliament s backing for her Brexit blueprint  May said the country needed  national unity to deliver the national interest  Following the defeat of the government s plan and a range of lawmaker written alternatives  May said Britain would need a further delay to its EU departure  currently scheduled for April 12  She offered to hold talks with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in an attempt to find a compromise solution  This debate  this division  cannot drag on much longer   May said in a televised statement from 10 Downing St  after an all day Cabinet meeting European Council President Donald Tusk gave a cautious welcome to May s change of course  Even if  after today  we don t know what the end result will be  let us be patient   he tweeted   a suggestion the EU would wait for Britain to present a clear plan Earlier  EU negotiator Michel Barnier offered a downbeat assessment of the situation  As things stand now  the no deal option looks likely  I have to tell you the truth   Barnier said in Brussels Barnier said  we can still hope to avoid it  if London produced a breakthrough before an April 10 EU summit The leaders of the EU s 27 remaining countries have given the U K  until April 12 to leave the bloc or to come up with a new plan  after British lawmakers thrice rejected an agreement struck between the bloc and May late last year The House of Commons has also failed to find a majority for any alternative plan in two days of voting on multiple options May s statement came after a seven hour meeting of her fractious Cabinet  which is split between supporters of a  soft Brexit  that keeps close economic ties with the EU  and Brexiteers who believe a no deal exit is better than compromising May s words seemed to indicate that she was veering away from the possibility of a no deal Brexit   but also that she has not given up on her own unloved withdrawal agreement Her plan is to seek approval for the legally binding agreement   which sets out in detail the terms of Britain s departure from the EU   after securing cross party political support for a vision of future ties between the U K  and the bloc If she and Corbyn fail to reach agreement  May said Parliament would get to vote on a range of options   and the government would be bound by the result  It is the first time she has committed to following the instruction of lawmakers May didn t indicate how long an extension she would seek from the EU  though she said she hoped Britain could pass the agreement by May 22  in time to avoid participating in elections for the European Parliament Corbyn said he would be  very happy  to sit down with May  even though  so far she hasn t shown much sign of compromise  Corbyn said Labour would present May with its conditions for Brexit  which include a close economic relationship with the bloc through a customs union  maintaining high environmental standards and protecting workers  rights May s move infuriated pro Brexit politicians  who say Britain must cut ties to the EU in order to forge an independent economic policy  I think people will feel very short changed   said former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson  a prominent pro Brexit voice in Parliament But May s words brought relief for those who fear the effects of a no deal Brexit  which would complicate trade and travel  with new checks on borders and new regulations on dealings between the EU and Britain Businesses have warned that the economic impact in Britain could be devastating Ford of Europe Chairman Steven Armstrong said  a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for the automotive industry in the U K  Edwin Morgan  interim director general of business group the Institute of Directors  said May s statement was  a welcome step towards compromise   though there remained obstacles ahead  We urge the leader of the opposition to work with the prime minister to find a solution   he said   Both sides must play ball  Britain s political paralysis   and May s failure to get Parliament s approval for the withdrawal agreement she negotiated   have exasperated EU leaders French President Emmanuel Macron said that if Britain s politicians could not agree on a way forward   they will de facto have chosen for themselves to leave without a deal   We cannot avoid failure for them   Macron said before a meeting in Paris with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar But Varadkar stressed  there s still time  for May to come to the April 10 summit with  credible  proposals Meanwhile  British lawmakers intent on avoiding a no deal Brexit have drawn up plans to prevent Britain crashing out of the bloc  by accident or design  We are now in a really dangerous situation with a serious and growing risk of no deal   Labour Party legislator Yvette Cooper said Cooper introduced legislation  which Parliament is set to consider  this week  that would compel May to seek to extend the Brexit process beyond April 12 in order to prevent a no deal departure    Raf Casert reported from Brussels  Mike Corder in Halfweg  Netherlands

WASHINGTON   Lawyers for Michael D  Cohen  President Trump s former personal lawyer and fixer  told congressional lawmakers in a letter on Thursday that Mr  Cohen can best help their oversight inquiries if he remains out of prison to sift through millions of his documents   and they asked the help of Democrats in persuading prosecutors to help him do so The lawyers told Democratic members of congressional committees who have either subpoenaed his testimony or have asked him to appear voluntarily over the course of the past year that Mr  Cohen has been essential to their investigations  and they reminded them of the help they have sought from him even after his public hearing in February The lawyers   Lanny J  Davis  Michael D  Monico and Carly Chocron   wrote that Mr  Cohen was recently given access again to his files  which had been seized by federal investigators during a search in April 2018  The files include voice mail messages and recordings  as well as 14 million other documents  they said With Mr  Cohen expected to begin serving a three year prison sentence on May 6  the lawyers asked the committee members to provide documentation of his help  in the hopes of showing that he is still needed to assist them with their investigations   and of postponing his incarceration or even reducing the time he will spend behind bars The lawyers sought the help of the Democrats in convincing federal prosecutors in Manhattan of  the need for Mr  Cohen to be readily available to Congress and to prosecutors conducting these investigations  such that his date to report for incarceration about four weeks from now will be substantially postponed while he is fully cooperating with prosecutors and Congress  The lawyers cited the potential for his cooperation in the investigations to lead to a  reduced term  for Mr  Cohen  There is no doubt that Mr  Cohen s testimony  both public and private  has contributed substantially  with documents and other evidence  to triggering additional areas for investigation by law enforcement authorities and the Congress   the lawyers wrote   He has done so despite intense personal pressures and stresses he faces for himself and his family  However  with 30 days left before he surrenders to prison  time is no longer a luxury he is capable of  The lawyers said they were not writing to Republicans because they were not sure they would be  interested   The lawyers said they would reconsider  but  during his public appearance  virtually every single Republican member during the public and private testimony used all their time to attack Mr  Cohen personally  rather than to ask substantive questions  Mr  Cohen is facing prison time after pleading guilty to financial crimes and to one count of lying to Congress about the length of time that a planned Trump Tower project in Moscow was considered during the 2016 presidential campaign  He also pleaded guilty to his role in a campaign finance scheme in which federal prosecutors in Manhattan have implicated Mr  Trump  That scheme involved hush payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Mr  Trump The lawyers asked that the members of Congress write letters stating that the  substantial trove of new information  that Mr  Cohen can share  requires substantial time with him and ready access to him by congressional committees and staff to complete their investigations and to fulfill their oversight responsibilities required under the Constitution as the Article I independent branch of government  Over nearly a week in February  Mr  Cohen appeared before three congressional committees in the House and Senate investigating either Mr  Trump s campaign or his businesses  Most of that testimony was kept behind closed doors  but the centerpiece was a public hearing before the House Oversight Committee in which Mr  Cohen accused Mr  Trump in vivid detail of a pattern of lies and criminal behavior Much of that testimony revolved around the effort during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels  a pornographic film actress who alleged an affair with Mr  Trump  Mr  Cohen produced copies of checks issued by the president or his trust that Mr  Cohen said were reimbursements for  130 000 in hush payments to Ms  Daniels  He said the president had discussed the payments in the Oval Office With his testimony televised across the country  Mr  Cohen went on to accuse the president of other potentially criminal acts  Among them was his assertion that Mr  Trump  without doing so directly   made clear to me  that  he wanted me to lie  to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project He also accused the president of inflating his net worth to a bank and of having greater knowledge about possible contacts between his associates and Russia than Mr  Trump has publicly maintained House Democrats have continued to investigate many of the issues raised by Mr  Cohen  including the hush money payments and possible financial fraud  in addition to the president s link to Russia Mr  Trump  his lawyers and their Republican allies have denounced Mr  Cohen as a liar and have accused him of manufacturing information to reduce his prison sentence  Two House Republicans referred Mr  Cohen to the Justice Department for potential perjury charges stemming from his public testimony  Federal prosecutors in Manhattan wrote a blistering memo about Mr  Cohen before he was sentenced  but they called his information in relation to certain issues truthful  They have since interviewed him to glean additional information for open investigations  including those related to the Trump Organization and the president s inaugural committee Mr  Cohen  his lawyers wrote   is going to prison for conduct almost all of which was for the benefit of Mr  Trump personally and indeed directed by him   In our opinion   they wrote   there is something unjust here  They also argued that the length of Mr  Cohen s sentence is  disproportionate given the particular facts and circumstances underlying each of the crimes to which Mr  Cohen pled guilty   

President Trump stopped short of announcing a final trade deal with China on Thursday  saying in an Oval Office meeting with the Chinese delegation that it may take another four weeks or more to secure an  epic  trade agreement Negotiators had originally aimed to secure a deal this week during a visit from Liu He  the Chinese vice premier and special trade envoy  and announce a presidential summit meeting between Mr  Trump and Xi Jinping of China  But after more than a year of tit for tat tariffs  on and off negotiations and threats of additional punishment  the United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues  including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed  and when  We re talking intellectual property protection and theft  We re talking about certain tariffs   Mr  Trump said  referring to issues that remain unresolved People familiar with the negotiations had said that the president was poised to announce a summit meeting with China  But those plans spurred a backlash among some of the president s trade advisers  who argued that announcing a meeting before the deal was struck would weaken the United States  hand and give it less leverage to force changes it is seeking In remarks at the White House  Mr  Trump said that the deal was  very complete  and that the two sides had  agreed to far more than we have left to agree to   I think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to   he continued But he said there would be no summit meeting until a final deal was made   If we have a deal then we ll have a summit   the president said The date and location of a summit meeting have also proved controversial  The United States had initially proposed holding one at Mar a Lago  Mr  Trump s Florida resort  but China has been pushing for an official state visit in Washington or a neutral location in a third country  people familiar with the matter said Lawmakers had publicly fretted about announcing a summit meeting before the deal was inked  suggesting that Mr  Trump was surrendering his leverage in his eagerness to sign an agreement Both Republicans and Democrats have urged Mr  Trump to hold out for a tough deal to combat Chinese practices that American businesses have long seen as problematic  including the coerced transfer of foreign technology as a condition of doing business in the country and the ample government subsidies for Chinese firms  Last week  POTUS told us he would not sign a  good  trade deal with  China he would only sign a  great  one   Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  said in a Twitter post on Thursday morning   I believe him  But to be a  great  deal it must allow us to do in China what they can do in US   it must have real enforcement mechanisms  The United States has pressed China to make commitments on purchasing American goods  opening markets to foreign business and increasing protections for foreign intellectual property in a bid to rebalance an economic relationship that Mr  Trump says is unfair for American workers  It remains to be seen how sweeping and significant any agreement will be  and whether it will achieve the lofty promises Mr  Trump has made about resetting the economic relationship with Beijing But the White House is also facing pressure to resolve the trade war  which has begun to hurt American farming  manufacturing and other sectors  and caused wild swings on Wall Street  Industries including automaking  technology manufacturing and farming have anxiously awaited reduced tariffs and details of a new agreement  which will have huge implications for their businesses The president s tariffs have been successful at bringing the Chinese to the negotiating table  and his advisers have insisted they will not squander an opportunity to press China for substantial economic reforms that past administrations were unable to secure  Still  the Chinese have balked at making any reforms that could be viewed as infringing on their sovereignty or undercutting the Communist Party s control of the economy  If you and I are making a deal  and you have to drag me kicking and screaming the whole way  what are the odds the deal is going to hold   asked Derek Scissors  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute   I don t find that the slightest bit convincing  American negotiators have pushed for an enforcement mechanism that would allow tariffs on Chinese goods to snap back if China violated the terms of the deal  and that would forbid China to retaliate  But Chinese negotiators have resisted such an idea  describing it as a potential infringement on their sovereignty Myron Brilliant  the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  said foreign stakeholders would be scrutinizing the deal to see whether it contained a strong enforcement mechanism that would hold the Chinese accountable to their obligations  That is what would separate this agreement from previous agreements   he said The two sides spent the past two months drawing up more than 120 pages of an agreement covering issues including forced technology transfer and cybertheft  intellectual property rights  currency and nontariff barriers to trade  The Trump administration has also pressed China to commit to hundreds of billions in purchases of American products  including agricultural products  energy and airplanes The administration has been eager to front load China s purchases of American products to help bolster farm country and other important constituencies and try to bring down the bilateral trade deficit before the 2020 election  Mr  Trump s advisers would prefer to keep the tariffs in place as long as possible  an arrangement the Chinese oppose In recent weeks  Beijing has introduced a steady drumbeat of other reforms intended to please American constituencies and win Mr  Trump s favor  China has resumed purchases of American soybeans and announced it would reclassify fentanyl  which has fueled the American opioid epidemic  as a controlled substance  Beijing also approved a sweeping rewrite of a foreign investment law that may help foreign companies avoid unequal treatment  And it approved a request by JPMorgan Chase to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country and floated the idea of expanding access for foreign cloud computing companies China experts have cautioned that the long running economic stresses between the countries are unlikely to be entirely put to rest with this round of negotiations  The negotiations  no matter what anybody says  will not end at the end of this phase   said David Lampton  a fellow at Stanford University s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies   We ve got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead   

BERLIN   Keen to use its presidency of the U N  Security Council to demonstrate its commitment to multilateralism  Germany has laid itself bare to criticism from disenchanted allies of double standards on defense spending  energy and arms exports Powerful business interests and the compromises needed to hold together conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel s loveless coalition with the Social Democrats  SPD  have led to go it alone decisions that have angered the United States  France  Britain and other Europeans Merkel won plaudits in Davos in January and a standing ovation at the Munich Security Conference in February for strong appeals to maintain the post World War Two rules based international order Her SPD foreign minister  Heiko Maas  is singing from the same hymn sheet   When faced with a new order in which great power rivalry is back on the agenda  our response shouldn t be  my country first  It should be a close alliance of all those committed to a rules based international order   he said in New York this week  Such rhetoric rings hollow for some An unwavering commitment to the NordStream 2 gas pipeline from Russia has angered the United States  Ukraine and eastern European partners  A freeze on arms exports to Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi led Paris to accuse Berlin of jeopardizing joint tank  combat jet and drone development Germany s long insistence on austerity and refusal to rein in its large current account surplus  which reflects its export prowess  have perpetuated a view among euro zone peers that they must play to Berlin s tune  IN DENIAL  Berlin has also exasperated close allies by pouring cold water on deeper euro zone reform ideas from France  and especially by rowing back on NATO defense spending goals  Not to mention Merkel s unilateral disavowal of EU rules in 2015 which let migrants enter Germany  a move which most commentators say contributed to the rise of the far right Constanze Stelzenmueller  senior Robert Bosch Fellow at the Brookings Institution  said it is an  ultimately misguided and only semi functional attempt  to articulate a foreign policy opposed to U S  President Donald Trump s  America First  stance  No other country has been so deeply in denial about the tension between its high minded normative convictions and its own selective compliance with them   she said  adding that other European countries are looking to Germany for leadership   Germany today is   for all its wealth and power  including soft power   also increasingly lonely  overwhelmed and beset by internal rifts   she said  adding it risked being shaped by events  competitors and adversaries In its one month presidency of the U N  Security Council which started on Monday  the spotlight will be on Germany if any Security Council response is needed to global crises  But with the legacy of the Nazi era and World War Two still weighing on it  Germany is wary of being seen as too assertive on the world stage  As it struggles to find a role to match its economic might  its foreign policy is deeply embedded in international bodies such as the EU  NATO and United Nations  CREDIBILITY AT STAKESo why  ask critics  did SPD Finance Minister Olaf Scholz last month announce plans which mean Germany will fall even shorter of a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense in coming years than it was previously going to  Having previously said it would reach 1 5 percent by 2024  Scholz s plans now see a decrease to 1 25 percent of gross domestic product by 2023  It doesn t serve German credibility if we start questioning the goal of 1 5 percent by 2024 after committing to the 2 percent goal in 2014   said Roderich Kiesewetter  a senior lawmaker in Merkel s conservative party It gives ammunition to Trump  who singles out Germany for  not paying its fair share   U S  Vice President Mike Pence said this week Germany was a top offender  pointing out it had for generations benefited from U S  protection of Europe  Whether Scholz is pandering to his own pacifist wing of his party or its anti Americanism base  or has his sights on the chancellery  Germany s credibility inside NATO is being dented   wrote Judy Dempsey  a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe  The government insists it is committed to the 2024 goal  Maas says Germany has raised defense spending by nearly 40 percent since 2014 and the defense budget will continue to rise    but the debate exposes a classic German dilemma  After World War Two and the Nazi era  it s in our political DNA that military solutions are almost never the answer  rather political solutions   said senior SPD lawmaker Thomas Oppermann Another major driving force is business  Berlin has long sought to protect its powerful car industry from EU attempts to curb emissions and has also dug in its heels in over a pipeline that will secure supplies of Russian gas needed by German industry   and bypass Ukraine Brushing aside opposition from the United States  eastern European and Baltic states who warn that Europe will become over dependent on Russian energy  Merkel has let firms  including Uniper and BASF s Winterhall unit  push ahead with NordStream 2 Even after the EU imposed sanctions on Russia for annexing Crimea in 2014  Merkel insisted it was a commercial project and only last year acknowledged it had a political element and saw the need to reassure Ukraine on transit revenues  Allowing it to trundle along was a mix of business driving it hard and the government taking its hands off  hoping for the best   and that turned out not to be   said Stelzenmueller  One other factor affecting policy is Merkel s reliance on the SPD as a coalition partner  seen in last week s extension of an arms exports ban to Saudi Arabia The original ban last year  which took European partners by surprise  prompted London and Paris to warn that billions of euros of military orders were in danger  While the SPD  seeking to win over traditional voters for regional and European elections later this year  insisted on extending the ban  they bowed to pressure from France and Britain and allowed loopholes for joint projects However  if Merkel is to fulfil her aim of joint European development and export of defense equipment  she may have to convince Germans to change their mindset  It won t work if Germany says we are passionate Europeans but only on our terms  We must get used to the idea that we have to compromise   said Oppermann    Additional reporting by Paul Carrel  Editing

KUROWKO  Poland   The Polish artist Daniel Rycharski sat in his childhood home recently and considered the idea of fitting in In many ways  Poland is a highly polarized country  On one side is the right wing populist government of the Law and Justice party  with its many rural supporters  which purports to stand for  family values  and the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church  on the other is a more liberal opposition  which finds most of its backers in the country s cosmopolitan cities  I m stuck in the middle   Mr  Rycharski said  sounding resigned   I don t have a place  really  Nonetheless  his work is the focus of a major exhibition running through April 22 at the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw  Maybe the biggest and best art institution in Poland is making an exhibition of me right now  but I don t feel part of the art community   he said   And the conservatives  they don t attack me  but   He trailed off Mr  Rycharski  33  makes large sculptural installations filled with religious and rural symbolism  His family and a handful of neighbors in Kurowko  in central Poland  take part in creating them  and most are displayed around the village before they are shown anywhere else   Strachy   for instance  a large scale installation  was made with his grandmother and features dozens of colorful crosses with items of clothing sewn around them  then wrapped in barbed wire The show at the Warsaw museum  which includes  Strachy   has been acclaimed by Polish critics   It s been a long time since such a multifaceted exhibition was shown   Karol Sienkiewicz wrote in Gazeta Wyborcza  a liberal daily  With it  the museum had  hit the bull s eye   he added ImageA mural by Mr  Rycharski in his home village  Kurowko  in Poland CreditDaniel RycharskiBut Mr  Rycharski said that  despite the positive reviews  he felt lonely  His art s focus on religion and the countryside means that he is unfashionable in liberal art circles  The fact that he is gay   and that much of his art is about his sexuality   means he does not sit well with Poland s conservatives either  Sometimes  I think the only place for me is this village   Mr  Rycharski said Poland has a long tradition of  conservative avant garde  artists who take a positive view of the church and of folk life  said Szymon Maliborski  a curator at the Museum of Modern Art  They include performance artists such as Zbigniew Warpechowski  who once stuffed pages of the Bible into condoms to make a statement about society s resistance to church teachings  and Teresa Murak  whose ritual processions in plant covered clothing reflected an interest in the rhythms of nature But Mr  Rycharski s art is different  Mr  Maliborski said  noting that it was not simply praising the church or Poland s countryside   it was trying to change them Mr  Maliborski cited  Strachy  as an example  It was first installed in fields around Kurowko  the crosses meant to keep birds away  like scarecrows  But the artist collected the clothes sewn on the crosses from lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people in Poland  and many of the garments had stories of struggle behind them   Strachy   which means  Scares  or  Fears   could be read as a comment on the church s lack of openness to those groups  Mr  Maliborski said  Daniel s more interesting  and braver  than other artists   he said   It s not so easy to work with such topics in the countryside  Mr  Rycharski does not hide his sexuality  even though he says it is a factor in his feelings of loneliness  For his interview in Kurowko  he wore a tracksuit modified to have rainbow stripes running down the legs Image Gateway   2014  by Mr  Rycharski CreditDaniel RycharskiHe grew up surrounded by art  he said  His mother and uncle both painted and made small sculptures  for themselves  for the family   He painted  too  and eventually left Kurowko to study art in the southern city of Krakow But Mr  Rycharski did not feel at home there   When I was living in Krakow   he said   there was too much of everything  too many artists  too many buildings  too many monuments  When I came back here  there was nothing  so I can build everything in my head  His time in Krakow also made him realize the indifference of Poland s art to the countryside   Everyone thinks people in the village are stupid  dirty  angry and they have no culture   he said   I knew it was wrong  He wanted to make art that would change perceptions but that would also refresh a sense of community in the village  he said One of his most successful pieces was  Monument to a Peasant   a sculpture dedicated to Poland s small scale farmers  It featured a trailer  with farming tools attached to it  painted black to represent the dismal mood of agrarian workers facing a host of financial struggles The mobile artwork has traveled around Poland and struck a chord in many places  particularly in rural areas ImageMr  Rycharski s  Monument to a Peasant   a mobile artwork  has traveled around Poland and struck a chord in many places  particularly in rural areas CreditDaniel RycharskiThe popularity of works like  Monument to a Peasant  gave Mr  Rycharski the confidence to explore his gay identity in art  with crusading works that put the church s rejection of gay Catholics in the spotlight  For one piece  he took a quotation from the catechism that says gay people should be  accepted with respect   and made it into a metal plaque  He asked several liberal churches to display it  When they refused  he stood outside one for 10 hours holding it Mr  Rycharski faces a struggle to change attitudes in Poland  The populist agenda of the governing Law and Justice party has made gay rights a central issue before elections later this year  In March  the party s co founder  Jaroslaw Kaczynski  spoke out harshly against same sex marriage  Homophobic attitudes tend to be widespread in Poland  though the country s first openly gay politician  Robert Biedron  started a new opposition party in February and has gained some traction and attention Wojciech Adamski  an amateur artist and firefighter from Sierpc  the nearest town to Kurowko  who has worked with Mr  Rycharski on several projects  said the focus on gay rights was important   Daniel s activities here can help other people who belong to the L G B T  community  whom we don t know about  find themselves  to feel they are accepted   he said Mr  Rycharski said he had no intention of changing his approach  whatever problems it caused him   If I can change Kurowko  Poland can change   he said After the interview  Mr  Rycharski went for a walk along Kurowko s one main road  As dogs barked  and someone burned garbage in a field  he talked about a future project He wanted to buy a house in the village and make it into a community space for lesbian  gay and transgender Christians  he said  I m not sure it s going to happen   he said   People might not be ready for it yet   

HONG KONG   Singapore introduced draft legislation on Monday that it said would combat false or misleading information on the internet  but critics said the measure could be used as a cudgel against the government s critics The legislation  called the Protection From Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill  would require websites to run corrections alongside  online falsehoods  and would  cut off profits  of sites that spread misinformation  among other measures  according to the Ministry of Law The bill is widely expected to become law in the coming weeks because it has support from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong s People s Action Party  which has a supermajority in Parliament  This bill targets falsehoods  not free speech   the Ministry of Law said in a statement outlining the legislation   It will help ensure online falsehoods do not drown out authentic speech and ideas  and undermine democratic processes and society  But human rights advocates said they feared that the bill  which would give government ministers wide ranging powers to fight misinformation that damaged the public interest  would grant the authorities too much leeway to decide what was true or false The bill defines the public interest broadly  saying that ministers could intervene to prevent  a diminution of public confidence  in the government s performance or the  incitement of feelings of enmity  hatred or ill will between different groups of persons   among other threats Kirsten Han  a Singaporean journalist and activist  described the legislation as  worryingly broad   The bill gives ministers so much power and discretion   any minister can direct individuals or websites to post corrections or take down content  or order access to content to be blocked  and these orders have to be complied with first  even if one is going to appeal the direction in the courts   Ms  Han said in an email The Ministry of Law said the bill did not apply to  opinions  criticisms  satire or parody   only to falsehoods that threatened the public interest  According to a draft of the bill  punishments for some violations could include fines of up to about  44 000 and a prison term of up to six years for individuals  or fines of up to about  738 000 in  any other case  Critics say the bill could put a wide range of online publishers in legal jeopardy in Singapore  including foreign media organizations The  public interest  definitions are so vague  they add  that the legislation could be weaponized to target the government s critics  Similar laws have been used by authoritarian governments around Southeast Asia  You re basically giving the autocrats another weapon to restrict speech  and speech is pretty restricted in the region already   said Phil Robertson  the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch Singapore holds elections  but there has never been a change of power as a result  and the government has long exerted control over the domestic news media through defamation suits The advocacy group Reporters Without Borders ranks Singapore 151st of 180 countries in its Press Freedom Index  three places behind Russia The draft legislation is hardly the first of its kind  Governments including those of Russia and of South Korea have recently put so called false news in their cross hairs  Restrictions on online communication are also under discussion in Australia and New Zealand  as both countries try to address popular outrage over the massacre last month of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch  New Zealand In statements on Monday  press officers for Google and Twitter said the companies were still reviewing the bill  Misinformation is a significant challenge  and one that we are working hard to address   said Chris Brummitt  a Google spokesman   We will study the bill to determine our next steps  and urge the government to allow for a full and transparent public consultation on the proposed legislation  Simon Milner  Facebook s vice president for public policy in the Asia Pacific region  said in a statement that the social network supported regulation that  strikes the right balance between reducing harm while protecting people s rights to meaningful speech   We are  however  concerned with aspects of the law that grant broad powers to the Singapore executive branch to compel us to remove content they deem to be false and proactively push a government notification to users   he added Companies like Facebook  Google and Twitter were once lauded for leading free speech and public discourse into a new age  Now  they are more likely to be blamed for providing an outlet for misinformation As skepticism has risen  the platforms have taken measures to combat bogus or harmful information  with varying degrees of success  They have stepped up efforts to police content and enlisted the help of outside organizations to fact check news articles and videos  They have tried to empower trusted publishers  such as traditional news agencies  to improve the overall quality of the information that users are shown But controversies have continued to erupt  And even for the internet companies  it may now be easier to ask lawmakers to lay down guidelines for content  That way  the companies can deflect the blame if the policies cause dissatisfaction In an op ed over the weekend in The Washington Post  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  made a case for regulating his platform  calling for  a more active role for governments and regulators   We need a more standardized approach   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote   Regulation could set baselines for what s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum  On Monday  Jeff Paine  the managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition   whose members include Amazon  Apple  Facebook  Google  Twitter and other technology firms   said the group supported Singapore s efforts to protect harmony  social cohesion  and the integrity of the country s institutions and political processes But Mr  Paine said the group worried that the bill  gives the Singapore government full discretion over what is considered true or false   As the most far reaching legislation of its kind to date  this level of overreach poses significant risks to freedom of expression and speech  and could have severe ramifications both in Singapore and around the world   he said Mr  Lee  the prime minister  previewed the false news bill in a speech last week at a gala dinner celebrating the 20th anniversary of the founding of Channel NewsAsia  a Singapore based outlet Mr  Lee told guests that the city state was  particularly vulnerable  to false news because it was a multiracial  multiethnic society with  enduring fault lines that can be easily exploited  Channel NewsAsia covered Mr  Lee s remarks  but without mentioning that the government s campaigns against misinformation have generated criticism from free speech advocates  

WASHINGTON   President Trump has long been focused on measuring his brand  obsessively reviewing television ratings  cataloging his magazine covers and fixating on polls But Mr  Trump may not like how his brand is faring in one important metric  his  E Score   a number compiled by E Poll Market Research that is not publicly available  but which marketing executives  network television stations and advertisers rely on to figure out which personalities appeal to audiences   and which do not Like the Q Score  which measures the appeal of celebrities  the E Score calculates awareness and appeal of individuals in the public eye  But it also tracks how individuals score on more than 40 personality and physical attributes In terms of those attributes  Mr  Trump was most often described as  aggressive   48 percent  and  mean   38 percent   according to his scores from December that were obtained by The New York Times  He also scored high for being  insincere    confident  and  creepy   But he scored between 0 and 4 percent for the attributes of  sexy    impartial    handsome  and  physically fit  About 29 percent of people described Mr  Trump as  overexposed   And his overall strong positive appeal is 14 percent  compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 39 percent Among adults over the age of 55  Mr  Trump consistently held more positive appeal than among those who are younger  Mr  Trump also consistently held more positive appeal with men than with women  across all age groups Marketing  advertising and entertainment executives pay E Poll Market Research an annual subscription of  17 000 and up to access its database  allowing them to analyze the views of American consumers and assess the marketing effectiveness of each celebrity rated  The company  which has about 10 000 profiles in its database and surveys about 1 100 online participants every week  started tracking Mr  Trump when he was a television personality on  The Apprentice   according to a spokesman  Randy Parker  We do not approve of the use of E Poll s data in this story and cannot confirm or deny the information you were given   he said In 2010  during the heyday of  The Apprentice   Mr  Trump s Q Score showed he was more popular with African American and Hispanic audiences than he was with white audiences  according to  Devil s Bargain  Steve Bannon  Donald Trump and the Nationalist Uprising   by the journalist Joshua Green Back then  advertisers viewed Mr  Trump as a symbol of multiculturalism  according to Mr  Green s book  But Mr  Trump no longer has an updated Q Score because he left the entertainment industry  the company Marketing Evaluations stopped tracking him in the winter of 2015  He definitely had the profile of a  love to hate  personality going into the election   said Henry Schafer  executive vice president of the company   He had one of the lowest positive Q Scores and one of the highest negative Q Scores  It looks like he just continued doing that up until today  ImageSupporters at Mr  Trump s rally in Grand Rapids  Mr  Trump scores consistently higher with men than with women CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesMr  Schafer said the key to Mr  Trump s success was  extremely high awareness   even if much of it was negative   You always have a portion of the population that enjoys that kind of reality  and that s his base   he said Officials in the Trump White House also receive E Scores  in part because networks often want to know how those officials are perceived Ivanka Trump  the president s elder daughter  has about 70 percent name recognition  compared with 35 percent for her husband  Jared Kushner  37 percent for Kellyanne Conway  a White House counselor  and 37 percent for Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the press secretary  in a reminder of the overwhelming celebrity power of her last name  Mr  Kushner and Ms  Conway s scores were from May  while Ms  Trump s and Ms  Sanders s score were compiled in December In terms of facial recognition  Ms  Trump scored 47 percent  slightly higher than Ms  Conway and Ms  Sanders  the most public facing administration officials  who both scored a 32 percent for facial recognition Ms  Trump s overall strong positive appeal was 12 percent  compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 21 percent  While Ms  Trump was more disliked than liked among every age group by men and women alike  she consistently had a slight edge with men over women Ms  Trump is most popular among adults over the age of 55 and least popular with adults between the ages of 18 and 24 In a list of attributes that celebrities are graded on  Ms  Trump was most often described as  attractive   32 percent    beautiful   28 percent  and  glamorous   25 percent   She ranked lowest on  funny   1 percent    can identify with   2 percent  and  exciting   3 percent  That was higher than the ratings for Mr  Kushner  whose overall strong positive appeal was 6 percent and whose overall strong negative appeal was 36 percent  Mr  Kushner rarely appears on television and has no social media profile  But he is a constant figure in the news  given his broad portfolios and influence in the White House Mr  Kushner scored highest for the attributes of  insincere   29 percent    creepy   27 percent  and  overexposed   22 percent   He was lowest in terms of  exciting    glamorous  and  emotional   rating 1 percent in those categories Ms  Conway  a regular presence on network and cable television touting Mr  Trump s accomplishments and criticizing the way he is covered  had a strong positive appeal of 9 percent and a strong negative appeal of 43 percent Ms  Sanders  who has phased out the regular White House press briefing  which often had contentious back and forths with reporters  and is now more often seen in friendlier venues like the morning show  Fox   Friends   ranked somewhat higher  with a strong positive appeal of 19 percent and a strong negative appeal of 28 percent The scores show the public views Ms  Sanders as more of an honest broker than Ms  Conway  who became infamous in the administration s early days for coining the phrase  alternative facts  Ms  Sanders scored 15 percent for  trustworthy   compared with Ms  Conway s 8 percent ranking in the same category  Ms  Conway was described by 31 percent of respondents as  insincere   compared with 27 percent for Ms  Sanders  

MOSCOW   Behind the perimeter of a defence ministry base in southern Russia stand three barrack buildings where two witnesses say they have seen private fighters being billeted before they are dispatched to fight in Syria for President Bashar al Assad Yet on paper  the barracks have nothing to do with the Russian defence ministry  court documents list them as a children s vacation camp And the construction of the buildings was commissioned by an obscure private company  Megalain  without the publicly available paper trail that is legally required for projects funded by public money Megalain is a firm linked to Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin  who has appeared on a U S  sanctions blacklist for his dealings with the Russian defence ministry Reuters was unable to establish Prigozhin s role  if any  in the construction project and could not determine how Megalain was selected to build the facility or who paid for it But the secrecy surrounding the purpose of the buildings erected on defence ministry land is an example of how companies involved in the covert campaign in Syria  where private fighters support Russia s military  camouflage their activities That military intervention has been decisive in turning the tide of the war in favour of Moscow s ally  Assad A significant part of the fighting is conducted by private military fighters who operate in coordination with the Russian defence ministry  dozens of people familiar with the deployment of Russian fighters to Syria have told Reuters The barracks near the village of Molkino in southern Russia were a staging post for these fighters  according to one person close to them who stayed in the buildings  and a second person who visited the site The person close to the fighters also said that a photograph shown to him by Reuters  which appeared on the website of one of the companies involved in the construction project  was of a building used by the fighters Russian military officials did not respond to a request for comment on the purpose of the facilities in Molkino Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the presidential administration knows nothing about the construction of the barracks and that  it was not our issue  Megalain did not respond to a written request for comment and there was no answer on any of the phone numbers listed for the firm Concord Management and Consulting  Prigozhin s main business  said questions submitted by Reuters  have no relation to reality   We consider the agency itself to be a biased media outlet   it said  GRAPHIC  Location of military base near Molkino  southern Russia   https   tmsnrt rs 2I4cXHN PRIVATE FIGHTERS AND DENIALSReuters has documented over several years how private combatants are fighting and dying in Syria  and that they are using logistical support and infrastructure provided by the Russian defence ministry Russian officials have previously denied that these fighters have any connection to the state  They have said any Russians fighting in Syria on the government side are private citizens who are there as volunteers The buildings  completed in 2015  are on the territory of a Russian military intelligence base  and to gain access to it vehicles have to pass through a checkpoint manned by armed soldiers in defence ministry uniforms  Reuters reporters observed when they visited the site The existence of the buildings is disclosed in court documents seen by Reuters which describe a legal dispute between Megalain and a contractor called Sevzapstroi involved in the construction In its ruling  the court describes one of the buildings as a  pioneer camp     a reference to Soviet era summer vacation camps for children    and the other two buildings as temporary accommodation for the vacationers It cites an agreement between Sevzapstroi and TD Vivahaus  a sub contractor on the project  as the source of the descriptions A manager from Vivahaus  a construction firm which court documents show was hired by Sevzapstroi to carry out some of the work  told Reuters it was required to fake the purpose of the buildings in official paperwork it filed relating to the project  We had an agreement with the client that we d write it would be a beautiful pioneer camp near the Black Sea   said the manager  who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue He did not specify whether he was referring to his direct client Sevzapstroi or the ultimate client Megalain  According to the court documents  Megalain transferred 86 million roubles   1 4 million at the time  to contractor Sevzapstroi to construct the three buildings at Molkino Sevzapstroi has since ceased to exist and no one connected to the firm could be reached for comment At the time of the payment  Megalain was 50 percent owned by a company called Lakhta and 50 percent held by Concord Management and Consulting  according to Spark database  which collates official data on businesses from the tax service and the state statistics agency  Concord Management and Consulting was majority owned by Prigozhin from 2003 2011  according to the database At the time of the transaction with the Molkino facility  Concord was owned by Prigozhin s mother  She is not listed any more  From 2017  Prigozhin himself became the owner again  the database showed The second Megalain co owner  Lakhta  was founded in 2003 by Yevgeny Prigozhin  who at the time was the sole owner  the database showed Lakhta was owned from 2013 to 2018 by Svetlana Sobirova  She was sales manager of the Lakhta Park real estate project  which  according to Spark  is owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin s wife  Lyubov Reached by telephone  Sobirova said she no longer works for Lakhta Park and declined to comment further  An employee of Lakhta Park said he could not comment and the firm did not respond to a written request for comment A manager for Vivahaus said on Thursday the firm could not comment because all the staff working in the company in 2015 had since left Reuters received no response to requests for comment sent to Prigozhin s wife and mother  via Concord PICTURE OF BUILDINGPrigozhin was put on a U S  sanctions blacklist in 2016 for  extensive  business dealings with the Russian defence ministry A U S  federal grand jury last year indicted Prigozhin and 12 other Russians  alleging that he funded a conspiracy to interfere with the 2016 U S  presidential election Prigozhin has in the past told Russian media he was not worried about the U S  measures against him because he has no business interests in the United States and does not plan to travel there The U S  State Department and the U S  Treasury Department  which administers sanctions  did not respond to questions about Prigozhin TD Vivahaus s internet site  in a section showing off its portfolio of work to prospective clients  had a picture of a building exactly matching one of the structures in the court documents The site said only that it was a  residential building  in Molkino  without giving details Reuters showed the photograph to one of the two witnesses  a person close to the group that organises the private combatants and who has stayed at the group s camp in Molkino He told Reuters the building in the photograph was part of the camp used for the fighters The second person visited the camp on two occasions last year when he was looking for information about his son  who left for Syria to fight with private combatants Later the father learned that he had died  The father also had a friend working for military intelligence at the camp adjacent to the barrack buildings The father described to Reuters the exact location of the facilities  and his description matched the location of the buildings paid for by Megalain   Editing by Christian Lowe and Mike Collett White  

STRATFORD UPON AVON  England    What does a black man think has happened since South Africa had democratic elections in 1994  What does a white man think  John Kani  one of South Africa s most celebrated actors  posed the questions rhetorically  with characteristic gravel voiced resonance  while Antony Sher  another celebrated actor born in South Africa  looked on The subject  Mr  Kani s new play   Kunene and the King   which opened at the Royal Shakespeare Company s Swan Theater on April 3 In  Kunene   directed by Janice Honeyman  Mr  Kani  76  and Mr  Sher  69  reincarnate the black white divide under apartheid that dominated their youth Mr  Kani  who grew up in a township outside the city of Port Elizabeth  began to act in 1965 with a group that included Athol Fugard and Winston Ntshona  The three men began working on material together and wrote  Sizwe Banzi Is Dead  and  The Island   a pair of one act plays that helped bring the realities of apartheid to the world  it won Mr  Kani and Mr  Ntshona a joint best actor Tony Award in New York in 1975 When they returned to South Africa  they were arrested and placed in solitary confinement for several weeks  Ten years later Mr  Kani lost an eye  he wears a prosthetic one  after a beating by the police  He continued to write  and played South Africa s first black Othello in a contentious 1987 production In post apartheid years he became the director of Johannesburg s Market Theater and he has recently appeared in  Captain America  and  Black Panther   among other movies ImageMr  Sher  right  portrays an aging actor and Mr  Kani his caretaker in the Royal Shakespeare Company production CreditEllie KurttzMr  Sher grew up in a middle class Jewish family in Cape Town  and left South Africa at 19 to train as an actor in England  By the early 1980s  he was performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company  his breakthrough came in the title role of  Richard III  in 1984  He was awarded a knighthood in 2000  Kunene and the King   produced by the R S C  and the Fugard Theater in Cape Town  is set in the present  25 years after the end of apartheid   which did not  Mr  Kani suggests  mean the end of racism or injustice It tells the story of the relationship between Lunga Kunene  a black nurse taking care of Jack Morris  a famous white actor  who is terminally ill  but nonetheless preparing to play King Lear It s the second time Mr  Kani and Mr  Sher have performed together  in 2008 and 2009 they played Caliban and Prospero in  The Tempest   also directed by Ms  Honeyman Following a preview performance of  Kunene   Mr  Kani and Mr  Sher talked about their relationships to South Africa  and Shakespeare as a unifying force  Here are edited excerpts from the conversation How long have you known each other  Antony Sher In 1995  I was part of a workshop run by the National Theater studio at the Market Theater in Johannesburg  and I remember many conversations and meals  We had known one another a bit before  but that was the real meeting John Kani Tony was well known in South Africa because he was this famous English actor  We were proud of him  Then in 2008 and 2009  we had the chance to work on  The Tempest   During that time  I had an idea about a two hander for us  and we talked about it  Life went on  I didn t think about it  and then last year  the idea suddenly came back to me  I felt  We need to look at South Africa s democracy  We are littered with incidents  issues and geographical segregation that prevent us from becoming a united society  I wanted to write a story about two men who seem to be happy with what s going on  but when you bring them together  the rifts quickly surface Sher  Sorry to embarrass John  but he is one of my heroes  both as an actor and an activist during the bad old days  When he called last year  and said   We once talked about this  would you read it    I was very excited ImageMr  Kani  left  and Winston Ntshona in a 2008 revival of  Sizwe Banzi Is Dead  at the Brooklyn Academy of Music CreditSara Krulwich The New York TimesDo the different experience of the black and white characters in the play have parallels with your own lives Kani A good friend of mine  Barney Simon  once said you can t write a play  about   You must tell a story from personal experience  When that s in front of you  all these things come in  How many times do we pretend to one another with a Colgate smile  I decided to put Lunga in Jack s house  and see what surfaces Sher John and I went in completely different directions  I left South Africa and my South African identity behind  My family was typical of white families at the time  almost ignorant about apartheid  which sounds impossible  but it was true  When I became politicized in England  I couldn t believe that a Jewish family had made no comparisons between what had happened to them  with pogroms in Eastern Europe  and what was happening to black South Africans Life is a dangerous business and if it works out well  you mustn t regret  But I celebrate the way it has come full circle  that John and I can be in this play together  marking a moment in South African history Mr  Kani  what did you want to convey in the play  Is there a specific idea about what is happening as South Africa celebrates 25 years of democracy Kani I was 51 when I voted for the first time in 1994  and I look at South Africa through those spectacles  I see a lot of progress  a lot of good  When I talk to my son  who was born in 1994  he sees so many things that were not fulfilled in the promises that were made  There are still many South Africans who think they had nothing to do with apartheid  But I am trying to talk about collective responsibility here Sher What is clever in John s writing is that making my character an actor lets you assume he will be a liberal man  But he lets seep through a lot of old apartheid views  and he isn t overjoyed at sharing his home with a black man  Yet he depends upon and needs him so completely Kani Shakespeare is the link between them  what brings them together  even if South African history and politics divides them  The kingdoms that Shakespeare writes about have their parallels in the kingdoms of Africa What role can political theater play in South Africa today Kani  I still remember the moment when my teacher  Mr  Budaza  walked into class and said   Today we are going to study  Julius Caesar   one of Shakespeare s most important plays   That moment  and  hearing  Mark Antony s speech in Xhosa  are in this play  Shakespeare examines how democracy is built  In South Africa  now is the time for protest theater once more  

WASHINGTON   The  cooling saucer  of the United States Senate keeps going into the microwave For the third time in six years  the majority party in the Senate detonated the so called nuclear option on Wednesday to unilaterally change years old rules of the chamber with a simple majority vote  This time  to work through a backlog of President Trump s judicial and administration nominations  Republicans cut the time between ending debate and a final confirmation vote on executive branch nominees and district court judges from 30 hours to two The change was a provocative step that reignited a bitter partisan fight over presidential nominations that has raged for a decade and spanned presidencies from both parties  Democrats dwelled at length over the blockade that stopped Judge Merrick B  Garland from ascending to the Supreme Court in the final year of Barack Obama s presidency to angrily question how Republicans could complain about the handling of Mr  Trump s nominees  There s no other word but  hypocrisy    said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader The majority leader  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  justified his actions on the Garland nomination  saying Democrats would have done the same thing to a Republican Supreme Court nominee  And he said Democrats started the process in 2003  when they began routinely filibustering a Republican president s nominees Mr  McConnell s move on Wednesday was intended to break the Democratic blockade over dozens of judicial and sub cabinet nominations sent to the Senate by the Trump administration and to appease Mr  Trump  who has been badgering him to take such a step for months  We had hoped the Democrats would negotiate  but their base will roast them alive if they supported  a compromise deal unblocking Trump nominees  said Senator John Cornyn  Republican of Texas  who is a close ally of Mr  McConnell But the one party rule change   which followed maneuvers by Democrats in 2013 to end the 60 vote threshold for most judges and executive branch nominees  and by Republicans in 2017 to end the 60 vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees   knocked down another pillar of Senate custom that separated it from the majority rule House  And it took the chamber one step closer to ending the defining procedural bulwark of the Senate  the 60 vote requirement for moving ahead with most legislation  The Senate has changed so dramatically under McConnell s influence   said Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the second ranking Democrat in the upper chamber   He is corrupting the Senate into an institution that is more like the House of Lords than what the framers intended  We have walked away from amending  debating and legislating  Mr  Schumer declared it  a very sad day for the Senate  Mr  McConnell answered   This is not a sad day  this is a glad day   We know you don t like Donald Trump  but he won an election and he is entitled  to  set up  his government  he continued Under the new rules  the Senate approved the nomination of Jeffrey Kessler to be assistant secretary of commerce  It was then to approve Roy Kalman Altman to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Wednesday s rule change was not as sweeping as the 2013 move  made when Democrats controlled the chamber  to abolish the 60 vote threshold on most nominees  Nor was it as provocative as 2017  when the Republican majority extended that 51 vote confirmation threshold to the Supreme Court after Mr  McConnell spent most of 2016 blocking Judge Garland s nomination But Wednesday s precedent opens the way for Mr  McConnell to speed up the nominating process for sub cabinet level posts and Federal District Court judges  appointments that represent as many as 80 percent of administration nominees  Democrats say that by limiting the time between cutting off debate on a nominee and voting on final confirmation  the Senate loses time needed to vet nominees Senate Democrats   who have been marginalized by Mr  McConnell s hardball style of leadership   said Wednesday s move represented an attack on institutional norms put in place to ensure full debate For Mr  Trump  the change is long overdue  For more than a year the White House  spurred on by Mr  Trump and officials in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs  has prodded Mr  McConnell to invoke what has been referred to on Capitol Hill as a  mini  nuclear option But Mr  McConnell resisted  in part because of the opposition of two moderate Republicans  Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee Their opposition ebbed in recent weeks after sporadic talks overseen by Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer to unfreeze some of the nominations fell apart  Mr  Trump expressed his frustration over the logjam during his hourlong appearance at the Republicans  weekly lunch in the Capitol last week  This is crazy   he said  according to two people in the room   We have all these people  ambassadors  who have put their whole lives on hold  waiting to be confirmed A day later  Mr  McConnell  speaking at a second strategy lunch with his conference  blasted Mr  Schumer and claimed he was avoiding a compromise out of fear that he would be publicly attacked by liberals in his party He singled out Mr  Schumer s own former spokesman  Brian Fallon  who now leads a progressive coalition that lobbies against the appointment of conservative judges  Chuck won t make a deal because he s afraid of Brian Fallon   Mr  McConnell said  according to a person familiar with his remarks Mr  Fallon did not respond to a request for comment  The only thing stopping a deal is Senator Mitch McConnell  because Senator McConnell wants to change the rules   said Justin Goodman  Mr  Schumer s current spokesman Mr  Schumer has privately expressed frustration with his recent interactions with Mr  McConnell  particularly the majority leader s unwillingness to even consider a separate deal for nonjudicial appointments  In a recent leadership meeting  Mr  Schumer complained that Mr  McConnell was offering him a deal that  chopped off four fingers  as opposed to cutting off his whole hand  Senate Democratic aides said Every Senate Democrat voted against the rule change on Wednesday  Two Republican senators  Mike Lee of Utah and Ms  Collins  also opposed it  The Senate s rules protect the rights of the American people by balancing the competing interests of majorities  minorities and individual senators   Mr  Lee said The actual nominations were less controversial than the rule  and a handful of Democrats crossed the aisle to vote for Mr  Altman Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer  who bear no great affection for each other  engaged in an uncommonly emotional duel on the Senate floor   holding in rapt attention two dozen senators who  in near unison  deposited their iPhones on their desks or laps to watch At one point  Mr  Schumer  speaking from a prepared text  turned to confront Mr  McConnell directly  accusing the leader of abusing  the brute power of the majority  to push the change  I m sorry my Republican colleagues have gone along with Senator McConnell s debasement of the Senate   he said Mr  McConnell sat impassively at his desk a few feet away as Mr  Schumer spoke  He stared down at the carpet and fussed with his shirt cuffs  wearing a wry  mocking grin When he stood to defend himself  his face betrayed the strain  gradually reddening into a crimson blush that spanned from cheekbone to jaw  as he accused Democrats  under the leadership of  a fella named Chuck Schumer   for weaponizing the filibuster over the past 15 years  He started the whole thing   Mr  McConnell said  turning to face Mr  Schumer  

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  In recent days  President Trump has used Twitter to warn Mexico that he may close the border  to suggest that The New York Times and The Washington Post be stripped of their Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the special counsel s Russia investigation and to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates in 2018 And if Mr  Trump had his way  Brandon Neely  among others  would be blocked from seeing any of those tweets Mr  Neely  a police officer in Houston  is one of an untold number of Twitter users who have been blocked by Mr  Trump  These users  if they are logged into their accounts  cannot see the president s tweets and are unable to reply to them or see others  responses The president s actions led Mr  Neely  along with six others blocked by Mr  Trump  to sue him  saying he had violated their First Amendment rights  A federal judge in Manhattan ruled against Mr  Trump last year  finding that the president s Twitter feed was a  public forum  and  that his blockings were unconstitutional Mr  Trump appealed the ruling  and the case went before a three judge panel in Manhattan last week  The judges seemed skeptical of Mr  Trump s contention that he was acting in a personal  not official  capacity when he blocked people Circuit Judge Barrington D  Parker asked Mr  Trump s counsel  a Justice Department lawyer  why blocking  points of view the president doesn t like  isn t  just a quintessential First Amendment violation  How the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rules in the Trump case may have larger implications  as elected officials around the country expand the use of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter  Federal judges are grappling with the question of how the First Amendment may apply to those accounts Blocking on social media is not a partisan phenomenon  In 2017  for instance  ProPublica sent letters asking all 50 governors and 22 federal agencies whether they had blocked people on social media  Five Republican governors  four Democrats and four agencies responded with information about people they had blocked  Many agencies and more than half the governors did not respond In New York  the issue has arisen with Representative Peter King  a blunt and occasionally combative 14 term Republican congressman who represents parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island  Recently  one of his constituents collected the names of about 70 people who said they had been blocked from commenting on Mr  King s Facebook page  He s like this big tough guy  but he doesn t want to hear any criticism whatsoever   said the constituent  Jacqueline Hassett  who has been blocked and has met with lawyers about the possibility of suing Mr  King The seven Twitter users who sued Mr  Trump have been unblocked  following the lower court ruling   Anybody blocked by the president can still  in theory  view Mr  Trump s tweets  In an entry on its F A Q  page  Twitter tells users   If the account you ve blocked isn t logged in or is accessing Twitter content via a third party  they may be able to see your public Tweets   Other judges have issued similar rulings  Earlier this year  the Fourth Circuit  in Richmond  Va   upheld a lower court ruling that the Democratic chairwoman of the Loudoun County board of supervisors had violated the First Amendment rights of a constituent by blocking him on Facebook for about 12 hours Elsewhere  a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that three state assemblymen violated the First Amendment when they blocked a liberal advocacy group on Twitter  Jerry Brown  the former Democratic governor of California  produced records in 2017 showing that he had in the past blocked more than 1 500 people on Facebook and Twitter  and Paul Gosar  a Republican congressman of Arizona who in 2017 wrote a post on Facebook titled   So you re upset I blocked you on Facebook  Here s why I don t care  a three part series   said last year in a court filing that he was no longer blocking anyone Jameel Jaffer  the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University  which filed the Trump case and argued the Loudoun County appeal  said that social media accounts may be seen as public forums if they are used to make announcements related to government duties  engage with constituents about policy or if they use government resources   if  for example  staffers create posts  Public officials all over the country are using social media often as the main means of communicating with their constituents   Mr  Jaffer said   We want to make sure those officials aren t insulated from criticism  make sure participants in those digital spaces aren t deprived of the opportunity of hearing other citizens  divergent views and make sure these spaces retain their vitality and integrity and aren t transformed into echo chambers  In many ways  Mr  King s Facebook page reflects his public persona  It includes pictures of him in a Long Island diner with retired firefighters  a video of him at a St  Patrick s Day parade and a description of a meeting with an Israeli diplomatic official The page also includes announcements that he was backing legislation to fund the Sept  11 Victim Compensation Fund  co sponsoring a tax deduction bill and introducing a resolution calling for the extradition of people in Cuba who have been charged with crimes in the United States Mr  King said during a telephone interview that he has the right to block who he wants on his Facebook page because it does not use government resources  he also contends that it is separate from his congressional work  He said that his campaign committee pays to boost his posts  which are meant to function like re election ads  I wouldn t have to give any opponent an opportunity to comment on my campaign brochure   Mr  King said  adding that he only blocks some of his critics  usually those who make inappropriate remarks or comment frequently Mr  King has interacted with commenters  thanked supporters and sparred with critics  When a constituent from West Sayville  Chris Ann Rogers Pellegrino  asked on Facebook in 2017 for a  special outside investigation into Trump Russia ties   and told Mr  King she hoped he was loyal to  the fabric of our democracy  his reply was   My loyalty is to the Constitution  not the liberal zeitgeist  Ms  Rogers Pellegrino said she was blocked almost immediately after posting her message  Another constituent  Danielle Miller  said she was blocked last year after disagreeing with a post by Mr  King that said kneeling protests by professional football players were  rooted in the false narrative of police bias against black men  Several constituents who had been blocked said they were concerned that limiting criticism would create a misleading impression that Mr  King s positions are more reflective of his district than they actually are Christine DiBiase Martorana  from Seaford  said she was blocked after posting she was disappointed in Mr  King s  continued emphasis on Islamic terrorism  and asking for his thoughts  on non Muslim terrorists   Meg Rowe  from Brightwaters  said she was blocked after stating that she was keeping track of how many people Mr  King was blocking  It s infuriating  honestly   said Ms  Rowe  who in 2017 began a Facebook page called  Blocked by Peter King  to document blockings and the removal of posts   We just want some avenue to talk with him  even if we disagree  because it s his job to listen to us   

TOKYO   The Nidec Corporation likes to say it makes everything that  spins and moves   from the intricate motors that whir in hard drives to the hulking ones used on oil rigs  In recent years  things had been going well for the company  Global demand for precision engineering  especially from China  increased sales for Nidec and other Japanese companies  helping to lift long sluggish Japan out of its economic doldrums  Then sales to China plunged in November and December as the country s economy slowed  Nidec  which counts on China for about 40 percent of its revenue  slashed its profit projections by more than 25 percent   I ve been in management for 46 years   the company s founder and chief executive  Shigenobu Nagamori  told reporters in January   and seeing our monthly orders plummet like this is a first  Japan s economic rebirth is in trouble  and China shares part of the blame  Exports have slumped  and companies that depend on Japan s fast growing neighbor are slashing profit forecasts and considering idling factories  Combined with other problems   including lackluster spending at home and an aging society   China s slowdown presents a major challenge to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his namesake economic program  Abenomics  as he prepares for an important national election this summer  Specifically  it raises questions about how Mr  Abe  who took office in 2012  can fix problems at home without the boost from China s powerful growth engine Japan s economy continues to grow for now  and the fate of Abenomics is far from certain  Still  Mr  Abe s political opponents are sharpening their knives   It s the beginning of the end for Abenomics   Yuichiro Tamaki of the opposition Democratic Party for the People told reporters in mid March The Abe administration points to signs that Japan s economy is still on track   We continue to see an increase in consumer spending and capital investment  which are pillars of demand   Yoshihide Suga  chief cabinet secretary  said at a March news conference   There has been no change in the moderate recovery of the economy  But even the government is wondering how much longer the expansion can continue  Exports plummeted starting in December  Industrial output fell for three months straight before rising slightly in February  The annual salary negotiations between Japan Inc  and unions ended with only modest gains after the government softened a pressure campaign on companies to raise wages In mid March  the government downgraded its economic assessment for the first time in three years  pointing to China s economy as a major factor Mr  Abe s economic proposals were supposed to lift Japan out of a slump that had begun in the early 1990s  They included what he called the  three arrows  of Abenomics  increasing Japan s money supply  raising government spending and proposing fixes to longstanding problems that discouraged companies from hiring and investing Pumping money into Japan s economy provided the quickest fix  Under Mr  Abe s influence  the central bank began printing more yen in 2013  The value of the currency dropped  making Japanese exports more appealing to foreign buyers  ImageA construction site in Jurong  in eastern China  in November  China s economic slowdown has shown how much of Japan s growth in recent years came from Chinese purchases of its exports CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesThe strategy added gas to Japan s export machine  Except for a brief downshift in 2015 when a Chinese slowdown hit global growth  Japanese sales abroad picked up speed  Nidec and many other companies like Renesas  which makes semiconductors  and Fanuc  which makes high end robots  enjoyed steadily rising sales  The easy money policy did little to help other parts of the economy  however  Longstanding problems like deflation  bureaucracy and a shrinking population added friction to the country s growth As deflation pushed down prices  companies struggled to increase profits  Deflation generally discourages consumers from making major purchases as they wait for lower prices and better deals  An entrenched and backward looking corporate culture made it difficult for Japan to keep up with the times  Many companies have resisted government efforts to improve corporate governance and introduce more women into the work force  leading to mixed results for Mr  Abe s initiatives  As a result  corporate oversight remains weak  And although more women are working than ever  the quality of jobs available to them is still low  Increasing government spending has also proved tricky  Japan has the highest level of debt in the industrialized world  so finding money to spend can be difficult  Mr  Abe has long pushed for an increase in the country s consumption tax to 10 percent to help finance public spending  But after a first increase in 2014  to 8 percent from 5 percent  shook the economy  the government has twice delayed the politically unpopular second round Should Japan s economy continue to weaken  a tax increase could do even more damage  Nonetheless  Mr  Abe has committed to the move  Economists say he has few other options   There s no space left for thinking up some additional policies   said Shinichiro Kobayashi  a senior economist at the research arm of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ImageShinzo Abe  Japan s prime minister  delivering a speech to Parliament in January  Questions about the sustainability of Japan s growth streak could undermine one of his signature accomplishments CreditFranck Robichon EPA  via ShutterstockThat means Japan s future growth may heavily depend on China As Japan s population has aged and demand has weakened  Japanese companies have increasingly looked to China to expand revenue  Growth in the Chinese middle class and the increasing sophistication of its manufacturing base have whetted the country s appetite for high end consumer and industrial goods  all underwritten by a cheap yen But in the short term at least  that demand  too  is weakening  In January  Japan s exports to China across a wide range of industries   from consumer electronics to the machines that make them   fell more than 17 percent from a year earlier  after a drop of over 6 percent in December  Although exports to the country rebounded in February  the gains did not make up for lost ground The sudden shift in the Chinese market has forced many Japanese companies to revise their earnings forecasts down  Consumer electronics companies and automakers in particular have expressed pessimism about market conditions  with flagship brands like Nissan  Nikon and Sony moving to temper investors  expectations for sales in the country It isn t clear when Chinese demand may bounce back  Beijing has pledged to focus on job creation  made more money available for its state controlled banks to lend out and promised to make business friendly moves like cutting taxes and red tape  However  the government reduced its growth target for 2019  saying it is seeking an economic expansion that emphasizes quality over quantity The picture has been further complicated by trade frictions between the United States and China  as President Trump s decision to slap tariffs on the country has squeezed Japanese companies with manufacturing there The trade war is  the biggest risk to Japan s economy   Mr  Kobayashi of Mitsubishi UFJ said Nidec is hanging its hopes for a turnaround on China s government  Beijing  understands the current critical situation well  Mr  Nagamori said  addressing questions about the future of his company s business in China   and we re sure they ll use every possible strategy to quickly work out a solution  In the meantime  he said  the company can t dwell on its present difficulties  If it does   we won t be able to respond when demand comes rushing back   Mr  Nagamori said  He added   We ll lose a big opportunity  Hisako Ueno contributed research  

WASHINGTON   The National Rifle Association  the nation s largest gun lobby  has settled on its next target on Capitol Hill  blocking Congress from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act  a 1994 law that assists victims of domestic and sexual violence The House is set to vote on the legislation this week  the law expired in February  But the bill includes a new provision   aimed at curbing sexual violence by expanding law enforcement s ability to strip domestic abusers of their guns   that the N R A  does not like  The measure closes the so called boyfriend loophole by barring those convicted of abusing  assaulting or stalking a dating partner or those subject to a court restraining order from buying or owning firearms Under current federal law  those convicted of domestic abuse can lose their guns if they are   or were formerly   married to their victim  live with their victim  have a child with their victim or are a parent or guardian of their victim  The proposed provision would extend those who can be convicted of domestic abuse to include stalkers and current or former boyfriends or dating partners Jennifer Baker  a spokeswoman for the N R A   said that for  many of those  offenses    and I m using air quotes here   the behavior that would qualify as a stalking offense is often not violent or threatening  it involves no personal contact whatsoever   She argues that the new provision is  too broad and ripe for abuse   Like if you were sending harassing messages to somebody on Facebook  to somebody you never met or somebody you dated five years ago   she said  adding   How it s written right now  you could be convicted for a misdemeanor stalking offense for a tweet that causes someone emotional distress and then you would be prohibited from owning a firearm  Others find the N R A  s argument far fetched   A single tweet or Facebook message  without significant other conduct  would ordinarily not be enough  to result in a conviction for stalking  said David Keck  director of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms  which provides guidance to law enforcement and governments on implementing firearms prohibitions  but takes no position on the new domestic violence act provision And times have changed for the gun lobby  A wave of freshman Democrats in Congress were elected on a promise to enact new gun restrictions  and they proudly campaigned against the N R A  The No  1 way that women are being killed with guns is by their beloveds  their boyfriends  their significant others   said one of those freshman Democrats  Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia   I am not paying attention to the rhetoric of the N R A  because I can t be distracted  What s most important is putting forth good legislation to save as many lives as we can   Ms  McBath s son  Jordan Davis  was shot to death in 2012 Roughly half of all female homicide victims are killed by what experts call  intimate partners    meaning current or former spouses or dating partners   according to a 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  And about half of intimate partner homicides involved dating relationships  according to Mr  Keck The  boyfriend loophole  provision is  a refocus on should we be just looking at domestic partners or should we be looking more broadly at intimate partners   he said Studies also show that domestic abusers with guns inflict a disproportionate amount of violence on their partners  and that the victims are overwhelmingly female  Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a firearm  according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence  a gun safety group  Roughly three quarters of all intimate partner murder victims were also victims of stalking by their partners  according to the National Center for Victims of Crime  The share of homicides committed by dating partners has been increasing for three decades   said Shannon Watts  who founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  a group that supports tighter gun laws  in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012   Women are now as likely to be killed by dating partners as by spouses with guns  The reauthorization bill has one Republican co sponsor  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania  Representative Kevin McCarthy  the House Republican leader  is urging Congress to extend the expired law for the rest of the year to continue funding services to survivors at current levels  Ms  Baker  of the N R A   accused Democrats of  playing politics  with the bill by inserting the so called boyfriend provision as a  poison pill  so that Democrats can portray Republicans who vote against it as anti woman The N R A  has decided to  score  the vote on the Violence Against Women Act  meaning it will keep track and publish how lawmakers vote in an effort to either reward or defeat them in the next election  While the move is not likely to keep the bill from passing the House  it does make it more likely that the  boyfriend loophole  provision will be stripped from the act when the measure arrives in the Senate  Anybody who votes for this should take the outrage of the N R A  and wear it proudly   said Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  who drafted the provision as a separate bill and fought for it to be included in the Violence Against Women Act Ms  Dingell   whose husband  John D  Dingell Jr   who died this year  served on the N R A  s board of directors   has spoken powerfully of her experiences as a child  cowering in the closet in fear of her father  who struggled with mental illness and had a gun  I am not someone who wants to take people s guns away   she said   I have lived with a man that was an N R A  board member and with a man that shouldn t have had a gun  And I want to stand up for both sides  The move to oppose the act comes as the N R A  s power is increasingly being challenged on Capitol Hill and in statehouses around the country by gun control activists  including many students who have taken up the charge after the massacre last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Fla Twenty six states and the District of Columbia passed 67 new gun safety laws in 2018  according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence  On Capitol Hill  the House in February passed legislation expanding background checks to cover nearly all gun purchases   the first significant gun safety measure in 25 years Even in the Republican controlled Senate  Senator Lindsey Graham  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  convened a hearing last week on  red flag laws  or extreme risk protection orders that allow family members and law enforcement officers to obtain court restraining orders to remove firearms from people who have been identified as a risk to themselves or others So far  14 states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing extreme risk protection orders  Mr  Graham said he is working on legislation to create incentives for states to enact such bills  Ms  Baker said the N R A  agrees with the idea in theory but has not supported any of the state laws because of  serious due process concerns  The idea has gained traction in some unlikely places   including the White House  where President Trump embraced it when Vice President Mike Pence raised it during a meeting with lawmakers after the school massacre in Parkland  Or Mike  take the firearms first and then go to court   Mr  Trump told Mr  Pence  adding   because a lot of times  by the time you go to court  it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures  I like taking the guns early   

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today by email  The decision last month not to prosecute the police officers who shot and killed Stephon Clark has added renewed urgency to the debate over police shootings in this state  And the state s lawmakers have plunged in headfirst this year with a pair of dueling bills to help deal with the issue Both aim to reduce the number of police shootings  but they come from opposite perspectives  One  Assembly Bill 392  would make it easier to criminally prosecute officers who use deadly force  and is supported by the A C L U  and the family of a victim  Oscar Grant III The other  Senate Bill 230  would require law enforcement agencies to clearly set use of force policies and boost de escalation training for officers  It s backed by police unions Laurel Rosenhall  a reporter for the nonprofit state news site CALMatters  will be tracking the issue in a new podcast called  Force of Law   I talked to her about what she s learned and what the podcast hopes to accomplish   Our conversation has been edited and condensed  Jill Cowan  Why did you and CALMatters decide to tackle this in a podcast form  Laurel Rosenhall  This is a huge issue in the Legislature because it s become a huge issue in so many communities around California  And the death of Stephon Clark in Sacramento really propelled it onto the front burner for the Legislature in a way that earlier shootings hadn t done It s extremely emotional and perceived as a life or death issue by both sides  And that gets to your question about why we re doing a podcast  You know the emotion of that comes through in a podcast in a way that is different than on the printed page  And we re really conceiving of this as a project that goes from now through October when the governor has to decide on all the bills that reach his desk  Tell me about what it is in California s political climate that s giving rise to this particular debate here Obviously having a huge Democratic majority in the Legislature  which is around 75 percent right now  plus having a new governor who has a track record of taking groundbreaking and risky moves that ended up panning out well for him   I think those are definitely big factors in terms of the political landscape But I also think there are factors outside of politics that have led to this moment It s been a sea change on this issue in the last decade largely because of technological changes and between the rise of social media cellphone videos and police body cameras  And so there s just like a broader societal swell And then the death of Stephon Clark   because it happened in Sacramento about 10 miles away from the state capitol   seems to have made an impact in ways that other police shootings have not One thing that s interesting is that even with basically total Democratic control  the state s approach to this issue is still very divided  Can you talk about that In Sacramento  that s where the most drama happens  when the Democrats are not on the same page about any given policy and policing issues has been an area where they re just not all aligned You can listen to the

WASHINGTON   During his presidential campaign  Donald J  Trump often complained about how President Barack Obama drew red lines that he never enforced  and how a diminished America let Russia walk into Syria unchallenged  something he said would not happen if the Russian leader respected the United States president Now  in Venezuela  President Trump is facing his own red line moment   again  with Vladimir V  Putin of Russia For the past week  the Trump administration has  escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country  claiming that Moscow is helping to prop up President Nicols Maduro of Venezuela and undermining the hopes of American officials that the Venezuelan military will oust him  The United States has been trying to rally the world behind Juan Guaid  the opposition leader  as Venezuela s legal interim president On Monday morning  speaking at the Army War College in Carlisle  Pa   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said flatly   Russia s got to leave Venezuela  That followed a statement on Friday by John R  Bolton  Mr  Trump s national security adviser  who said that the arrival of roughly 100 Russian military  advisers  in the country  along with new arms  posed  a direct threat to international peace and security in the region   Mr  Bolton also warned that no country should enter the Western Hemisphere  with the intent of establishing or expanding military operations  Such declarations seem to set up a test  Would Venezuela be the place where Mr  Trump  who has often seemed willing to tolerate Mr  Putin s most audacious provocations  finally draws his own red line  And  if so  does he have a plan to enforce it It is notable that Mr  Bolton  not Mr  Trump himself  made the Friday announcement  with its echoes of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine  the first time the United States issued similar warnings telling foreign powers not to intervene in the Western Hemisphere  In offering the unvarnished declaration on Monday   and while Mr  Trump focuses on the southern border   Mr  Pompeo said he was merely repeating the president s sentiments on Venezuela Yet Mr  Maduro is digging in   despite the economic sanctions against his government and the recognition of Mr  Guaid as interim president by the United States and more than 50 other nations  And Mr  Putin may well see an opportunity to replay Syria in Venezuela  propping up another leader that many American officials said had to go   Mr  Maduro instead of President Bashar al Assad of Syria  this time   and frustrating Washington s regional goals The administration so far has been quite cautious when it comes to threatening military action in Venezuela  While there have been ritual reminders that  all options are on the table   there is no indication that any military intervention   which has a long and unhappy history in Latin America   is being seriously contemplated Instead  the administration is beginning to talk about an extended battle of attrition  After the Maduro government declared last week that Mr  Guaid could not hold public office for 15 years  Elliott Abrams  the State Department s special representative for Venezuela and a veteran of many Cold War battles in Latin America  told reporters   I don t imagine that Juan Guaid is deeply worried because the Maduro regime  while it might be around in 15 days  is not going to be around in 15 years   Why is Russia helping Venezuela  He then talked about tightening sanctions on oil sales  dismissed Russian accusations that the United States was trying to mount a coup against Mr  Maduro and warned that it  would be a mistake for the Russians to think they have a free hand here   they don t   But he carefully avoided explaining why Mr  Putin might feel under constraint ImageA Russian military plane recently arrived in Venezuela  The Trump administration has escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country CreditYuri Cortez Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Putin has plenty of reasons for keeping Mr  Maduro in power  Russia is also focused on recovering billions of dollars in debt that Mr  Maduro owes it  some of which is being paid back in oil  Full repayment may never happen For Mr  Trump  this is the newest iteration of his many Russia problems   and the latest example of his reticence to talk publicly about Moscow s malign influence around the world  His silence is jarring  since Mr  Bolton  Mr  Pompeo and Gen  Joseph F  Dunford Jr   the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  talk about it almost every week They have all embraced the administration s year old national security strategy  which recognizes that a resumption of great power competition  not terrorism  is the primary challenge facing the United States today  Mr  Trump s former aides say  however  that he never read the full national security strategy  and they note that when he does talk about it  he almost never discusses Russia s behavior Perhaps that is a reaction to the enormous  bipartisan criticism he received after his seemingly deferential approach to Mr  Putin in Helsinki  Finland  last summer  when Mr  Trump once again appeared to be convinced by the Russian leader s denials that he had interfered with the 2016 United States presidential election Or perhaps it is rooted  as one of Mr  Trump s aides suggested recently  in a desire not to create the kind of public sound bites that Mr  Obama did   and that he came to regret It was Mr  Obama who declared in August 2011 that  for the sake of the Syrian people  the time has come for President Assad to step aside   And it was Mr  Obama who warned that  the use of chemical weapons is a game changer   then elected  once the chemical weapons were employed  to pull back from military action  Just a year ago  Mr  Trump was still citing that decision  declaring in a tweet that  if President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line in The Sand  the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago  The president is not alone in his critique of how the Obama administration handled Syria  One of the most thoughtful analyses of what went wrong came from William J  Burns  Mr  Obama s deputy secretary of state  in his new book on American diplomacy   The Back Channel   It is rife with warnings that could also apply to Venezuela Mr  Burns agreed with what he called Mr  Obama s  long game  calculus   which included  having the discipline to avoid getting sucked into another military entanglement in the Middle East  which would likely only underscore the limits of our influence in a world of predators for whom Syria s battles were existential  But he admitted that the Obama  short game  was lacking because  we misaligned ends and means  promising too much  on the one hand   declaring  Assad must go  and setting  red lines    and applying tactical tools too grudgingly and incrementally  on the other  Reached in London over the weekend  Mr  Burns praised the Trump administration for avoiding military entanglements that are bound to raise cries of American imperialism  even among Mr  Maduro s greatest opponents  But he said it was at risk of repeating some of the Obama administration s mistakes  The focus on building political and economic pressure is sensible   he said  And he noted that the geographic distance between Russia and Venezuela limited Mr  Putin s ability to affect events   Proximity matters   he said   They don t have a way to project their power in ways they demonstrably did in Syria  As a result  much hinges on Mr  Trump s ability to build a hemispheric coalition  a move that is being undermined  Mr  Burns argued  by the tension with Mexico  especially with Mr  Trump s recent threats to close the border and to end assistance to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras Mr  Maduro  too  may be learning some lessons from Mr  Assad  he said   As long as you control the guys with the guns  even the most unpopular and deeply repressive regimes have the capacity to hang on a lot longer than we might assume

Donald Trump s lie filled rage tweets about Puerto Rico this week over disaster aid continue a Trump pattern that mirrors a method that white supremacists have used throughout American history  Particularly present since Reconstruction  this method involves proclaiming that minorities lack the character and capacity to create effective government  and therefore minority led jurisdictions are a hopeless drain on resources He tweeted that Puerto Rico s government  can t do anything right  and that the island s politicians are  incompetent or corrupt  and only  complain and ask for more money   which they spend  foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA   He specifically called the mayor of San Juan  crazed and incompetent  Point of fact  Puerto Rico is part of the United States  It is a territory  Its citizens are U S  citizens  The structure of Trump s comments leaves open the possibility that he doesn t know that  or conversely  knows it but doesn t fully accept it or care about it If this were a one off spat with politicians opposed to his conduct  one might reasonably write Trump s comments off as politics as usual  Instead  this questioning of the competence of black and brown leaders is not anomaly but motif Trump has spent nearly a decade now trying to paint Barack Obama as not only an illegitimate president  but also as an inept  lazy  embarrassing one  He has called him a  sick    weak    incompetent leader  with a  horrible attitude  who  looks and sounds so ridiculous    has disastrous judgment   is  a total failure  and was  perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States  Worse than the white supremacist Andrew Johnson  who did his best to obstruct Reconstruction  opposed the 14th Amendment and was impeached  Worse than Trump s slave owning hero Andrew Jackson  whose Indian Removal Act led to the Trail of Tears  Worse than slave owning John Tyler  who during his time in Congress argued against the Missouri Compromise  which would restrain the spread of the  peculiar institution   Worse than Millard Fillmore  who backed the protection of Southern slavery in the Compromise of 1850  which delayed Southern secession  Worse than Richard Nixon  who was forced from office  Worse than George W  Bush  who lied this country into the war in Iraq  Worse than Trump himself Let s submit that Trump has in some ways been an equal opportunity offender and gone after all his political opponents to some degree   he incessantly called Hillary Clinton  crooked  and Bernie Sanders  crazy  Still  that doesn t fully account for the particular consistency with which he attacks minority leaders and minority led entities as inadequate  ineffective and incompetent According to Trump  former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was  totally unqualified  and would  destroy  the state of Georgia  Abrams is a star  and the way that state s election was handled will do more to destroy it than Abrams ever could According to Trump  former Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum was  a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee  said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country   There is no evidence of theft by Gillum  and Tallahassee isn t the most corrupt city According to Trump  legendary Congressman John Lewis s district  is in horrible shape and falling apart   It is not  PolitiFact rated Trump s claim  mostly false  Even majority black and majority brown countries around the globe have been condemned and dismissed by Trump in this way  Haiti  El Salvador and African countries are  shithole countries   Mexico has a  totally corrupt gov t   and it is sending  animals  and  rapists  across the border Yet he has lobbed praise at strongmen   mostly in Europe and Asia   for being great leaders  Think Russia and North Korea  Western nations have also piqued his anger when they have not been sufficiently ruthless with their minority populations  He said that Britain was  trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem   and Germany  is going through massive attacks to its people by the migrants allowed to enter the country   But Trump still maintains  a great feeling for Germany   That feeling is apparently so great that he keeps lying that his father  Fred Trump  was born there  like he did again this week  Fred Trump was born in New York  To me  this marking of minorities as incapable of good governance harkens back to the Reconstruction period  when white supremacists promoted racist caricatures of newly elected black legislators acting uncouth as a way to fuel an angry backlash  This shows up in newspaper illustrations and in the film  The Birth of a Nation   in which black legislators   eating  drinking and some without shoes   are shown in a state of chaos These white supremacists  many wealthy and powerful  used the threat of  black domination  to scare poorer whites into allegiance  warning them of race mixing  miscegenation and the rape of white women and girls  They also warned about the crude attempt of black people to be civilized and judicious This is very similar to what Trump tweeted this week  trying to pit suffering farmers in the Midwest against suffering Puerto Rican hurricane survivors Trump tweeted that  Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane  more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before  That  of course  was just another lie  As The New York Times reported In fact  FEMA and other agencies have so far distributed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion in aid has been allocated  while  91 billion is the budget office s estimate of how much the island could receive over the next two decades The farmers are mostly old  white men  As Modern Farmer pointed out in 2014 More than 92 percent of the country s 2 1 million farmers are non Hispanic whites  and more than 86 percent of those farm operators are men  The average age of farmers  which has been rising for decades  continued to inch up  In 2012  the average farmer was 58 3 years old  up from 57 1 years in 2007 Puerto Rico is 99 percent Hispanic Trump made his point clear  The mismanagement and incompetence of these brown people amount to stealing resources from these white people  As he tweeted   Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments  and so little appreciation  The brown people were supposed to be thankful that white daddy in  the States  was helping them at all  As Trump tweeted   The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J  Trump  This is the kind of paternalistic white supremacy that doesn t even require open hostility  although plenty often accompanies it  The logic goes this way  Everyone is better off  even minorities  when white people are in charge and calling the shots This is part of what drew so many white voters to Trump  whether they admit it or not  He promised to destroy  erase or replace everything President Obama had done  thereby fixing the glitch in the narrative that the only true and good leaders of America were white leaders  In the white supremacist imagination  even this horrendous white leader is better than the most educated  articulate and erudite black man That logic also says to people like the Puerto Ricans that even in their suffering  minorities are better off being part of this country This reminds me of a letter Robert E  Lee wrote to his wife in 1856 in which he said  The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa  morally  socially   physically  The painful discipline they are undergoing  is necessary for their instruction as a race  and I hope will prepare and lead them to better things  How long their subjugation may be necessary is known and ordered by a wise Merciful Providence  For all minorities in America  the subjugation continues  particularly now that Trump wants to dictate who is worthy of assistance and who should be allowed to suffer Trump Lashes Out Again at Puerto Rico  Bewildering the IslandApril 2  2019The Times is committed to publishing a

SAN JOSE  Costa Rica   Back in Nicaragua  she owned her own home and made enough as an elementary substitute teacher and lawyers  assistant to eke out a stable  if not luxurious  life Now she spends her days on the streets in and around Costa Rica s capital begging for spare change and clutching a can decorated with Nicaragua s blue and white flag  an unmistakable reminder to pedestrians of the political turbulence that has claimed hundreds of lives in her native country  I never did this before   said the 53 year old woman  who asked to be identified only by her nickname   the teacher   for fear of retaliation against loved ones back home   We were modest   she said   but life  there  is cheaper  The fate of the estimated 50 000 Nicaraguans who ve fled violence and persecution for exile in Costa Rica over the last year is a central point in fledgling peace talks between Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega s government and the opposition  which is demanding guarantees for their safe return But while negotiators in Managua haggle over that and other thorny issues with little progress  many exiles are struggling  Some formerly middle class citizens are having trouble putting food on the table and keeping a roof over their heads  while others from the working class are reduced to living in near indigence The most vulnerable among them have become  the forgotten among the forgotten   said Esteban Beltran of Amnesty International Spain  who recently visited Costa Rica to document their plight Like many others  the teacher fled during the so called Operation Cleanup launched by Ortega last July  which the United Nations has termed a  witch hunt  aimed at suppressing dissent  In her hometown of Diriamba  paramilitary forces aligned with Ortega s government left a trail of dead and wounded  she said Her offense was feeding and supporting student protesters  One day as she brought them breakfast  gunshots rang out   I don t know how I m alive   she said   They were grabbing everybody  The only thing to do was run Like many exiles she ended up in La Carpio  a shantytown on the outskirts of the Costa Rican capital  San Jose  where the number of Nicaraguans has swelled since the protests began last April  though nobody s sure by how much It s a neighborhood of cement and sheet metal homes where sleeping quarters and a latrine often occupy a single space  Water is scarce  trash piles up in the streets and sewage flows in open channels  Even before the latest influx of Nicaraguan refugees  half of the estimated 18 000 people in the neighborhood lived in inadequate homes and 70 percent of households subsisted on less than  330 per month  according to a government study last year The  3 that the teacher is able to beg on a bad day isn t nearly enough and like others she relies heavily on aid from churches and help from neighbors who are in equally precarious situations  Still lacking a work permit after eight months  she s sleeping on the floor of a rented  300 square foot  30 square meter  house along with her two adult children  two grandchildren and six others from another family  On a recent day the only things in the pantry were a packet of pasta  a Nicaraguan flag and a Bible While asylum seekers are guaranteed the right to work  the sheer number of Nicaraguans has overwhelmed Costa Rica s system for processing such requests  Authorities are able to handle only about 600 asylum applications per week  and securing work permits involves yet another bureaucratic hurdle  So far only 8 000 have secured work permits compared with the nearly 29 000 who have received credentials as asylum seekers  More than 20 000 are awaiting appointments Last week Amnesty urged the Costa Rican government to put an aid plan in place for Nicaraguan refugees with help from the international community  including identifying the most vulnerable and fast tracking access to basic services they have a right to and may not be aware of  Costa Rica s government said the plan is ready and simply awaiting presidential sign off Ortega s government did not respond to a request for comment  Ortega officials have had little to say about exiles  though in a recent speech the president compared all opposition supporters to Cain  the biblical figure who killed his brother Abel out of envy Peace talks between Ortega s government and the opposition Civic Alliance began Feb  27  but progress has come in fits and starts  The government has freed more than 160 jailed government opponents to house arrest  but hundreds more remain behind bars under a slow release plan that s supposed to take place over 90 days On Friday the government and the opposition reached two accords  one of which supposedly restored the right to demonstrate freely   only for police to forcefully break up a protest the following day during which an apparent government sympathizer shot at demonstrators who sought refuge in a mall Recently the government also emphatically rejected calls for early elections scheduled for 2021  another central opposition demand So there s plenty of skepticism among exiles that Ortega officials will abide by another deal struck Friday  that Nicaraguans who fled can return  with full guarantees of personal and family security   In Nicaragua we say about Ortega   You may sign  but you ll never follow through    said Cesar Gutierrez  63 Gutierrez is a regular at gatherings where he and fellow exiles plan demonstrations  coordinate with government opponents back in Nicaragua  share news of home gleaned from the internet and gossip about the latest from the talks He said he ll believe Ortega is acting in good faith only when all prisoners are released and freedoms of speech and assembly are restored   two other core Civic Alliance demands  along with the annulment of trials  convictions and arrest warrants for government opponents  The disarming of the paramilitaries  is a must  Gutierrez added   because otherwise they are going to bully us  Then it will be the moment to think about how we return  Gutierrez  a former fighter in the revolution that first brought Ortega to power in 1979  later soured on the president  joined the protests and fled after receiving threats against his life and home  He  too  is living in La Carpio  taken in by a family friend who is letting him sleep in the living room of her modest home where seven others also live He scrapes by selling homemade cheese to fellow exiles after leaving his family back home and his businesses  a bakery and some billiard halls At least 168 Nicaraguan exiles are wanted due to their political activities  opposition leaders say Among them is Sadie Rivas  who slipped across the border in August after being accused of a laundry list of crimes more associated with a narco kingpin than a 19 year old college student  torture  terrorism  money laundering  drug trafficking  weapons possession  destruction of public property  disturbing the peace  Such accusations are typical in cases against protesters  and both they and international observers call them groundless Rivas  father and brother remain in hiding in Nicaragua  moving from safe house to safe house  Her mother joined her in San Jose after being targeted for arrest for sheltering and feeding her daughter    covering for terrorists   as the government charges An artist who made artisanal soaps and jewelry back home  Rivas and her mother now clean houses and wait tables  Like Gutierrez they re fortunate enough not to be living in slum conditions  but it s not the life they re used to  Rivas plans to return but thinks opposition negotiators at the talks need to be more aggressive  They have to be more demanding   she said   We exiles are an important element     Verza reported from Mexico City  Associated Press writers Carlos Gonzalez and Javier Cordoba in San Jose  Costa Rica  and Gabriela Selser in Managua  Nicaragua

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  Two years ago  the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio decided to buy 17 buildings  which it planned to use for affordable housing  from a pair of notorious landlords with an extensive record of violations City officials first estimated the total value of the buildings at about  50 million  A private appraiser later hired by the city determined the value was  143 million  The city has kept the appraisal secret  no other appraisal was commissioned The city closed a deal on Thursday to pay the landlords  173 million for the buildings  City officials said the purchase price for the buildings rose during the normal course of negotiations At the center of the deal was Frank Carone  the lawyer for the landlords  and an influential figure in the Brooklyn Democratic Party and a longtime ally of Mr  de Blasio s As negotiations were continuing with the city over the buildings  sale last fall  Mr  Carone donated the maximum  5 000 to the mayor s federal political action committee  Fairness PAC  which Mr  de Blasio is using to explore a run for president Then  as the parties prepared to close on the deal  Mr  Carone turned to others to boost the mayor s PAC Mr  Carone acknowledged through a representative that he had helped Mr  de Blasio solicit donors for Fairness PAC  which the mayor has used to pay for his travel this year to early primary states like Iowa  South Carolina and New Hampshire  he plans to visit Boston on Thursday and Nevada this weekend In his first term  Mr  de Blasio repeatedly came under scrutiny for blurring the line between city business and political fund raising  Several state and federal investigations examined his ties to donors  two of whom pleaded guilty to corruption related charges The investigations were closed without Mr  de Blasio facing charges  but federal prosecutors released a statement citing  circumstances in which Mayor de Blasio and others acting on his behalf solicited donations from individuals who sought official favors from the city  Both Mr  de Blasio and Mr  Carone said that they had not discussed the real estate deal that calls for the city to pay the landlords  Stuart and Jay Podolsky   173 million for the buildings in Brooklyn and the Bronx The city comptroller  Scott M  Stringer  wrote to the mayor s office on March 25 to express concern over the purchase price  and asked to see the appraisals of the properties  which have been used by the city to house the homeless But Steven Banks  the commissioner of the Department of Social Services  replied three days later  saying that the city s policy was not to release appraisals because they might contain information that could affect the city s negotiating position in future transactions  Mr  Banks said the city was paying an average of  237 000 per apartment  a price he said was in the range of the median price for rent stabilized units in Brooklyn and the Bronx A spokeswoman for the comptroller  who oversees city spending  said that his office did not have the authority to block the deal Eric F  Phillips  Mr  de Blasio s press secretary  said that Mr  Carone s association with the mayor did not influence the real estate transaction  This deal is about improving and securing affordable homes for 2 000 people   Mr  Phillips said in a written statement   The personal political activity of one of the many lawyers involved never entered into the equation  Referring to the mayor and Mr  Carone  he added   They ve never spoken about any details of the deal  Mr  Carone  a lawyer at Abrams Fensterman and counsel to the Brooklyn Democratic Party  said that it made sense for him to represent the Podolskys because he had known the  family for more than 30 years  ImageFrank Carone  a lawyer and influential figure in the Brooklyn Democratic Party  It was only natural for myself and my team to represent the family in its eminent domain negotiations with the city   Mr  Carone said in a statement provided by a representative  George Arzt   Ultimately  all parties came to an agreement on what an amicable settlement would look like  For years  hundreds of the apartments in the Podolskys  buildings have been used by the city to house homeless families  as part of what is known as the cluster site program  Under the deal  the city will pay for the buildings but nonprofit groups will convert them to permanent affordable housing  own and operate them The deal had already attracted questions because of the Podolskys  history  Along with their father  Zenek Podolsky  the brothers were indicted in the 1980s by the Manhattan district attorney s office for allegedly using a  terror  campaign to drive tenants out of three Upper West Side buildings  which they filled with drug dealers and prostitutes  The Podolskys pleaded guilty but were spared a prison term by agreeing to turn the buildings over to a nonprofit that worked with homeless families More recently  the buildings they are selling  like others in the cluster site program  have been plagued by violations and subpar conditions  City officials  however  refused to identify the buildings involved in the sale  citing privacy concerns of the homeless families living there The Podolskys also operate single room occupancy hotels used by the city to house homeless people  The city said it began contracting with the Podolsky companies for the cluster sites in 2001  from July 2013 through June 2018  the Department of Homeless Services paid companies controlled by the Podolskys a total of  189 million for use of the cluster site apartments and the single room occupancy locations The city announced in December that it was in the process of buying 17 cluster site buildings  It was later revealed by The Daily News that the buildings were owned by the Podolsky brothers  Mr  de Blasio said then that the negotiations would be delayed while the deal was reviewed  the city later determined that it could proceed The city at first said it might use eminent domain to seize the properties but ultimately worked out a deal for their purchase A review in 2017 by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development first set the total value of the 17 buildings at about  50 million  But Mr  Banks said that review was not suitable for an eminent domain proceeding  which is intended to capture the value of the properties  highest  and best use potential  and a professional appraisal by Metropolitan Valuation Services later estimated the value at  143 million City officials said that a  reputable independent appraiser  had prepared an  evaluation for potential condemnation that was consistent with the correct legal standard  so there was no need for another appraisal  But Jonathan Miller  the president and chief executive of Miller Samuel  a real estate appraisal company not involved in the transaction  said that it was typical in comparable situations to get more than one appraisal  We do a lot of litigation  arbitration  mediation  and there s almost always multiple appraisals   Mr  Miller said  adding that if two appraisals are far apart then a third would typically be called for  to ensure that  no money was left on the table  or that a party ended up paying much more than what something is worth  He said that the large gap between the Housing Preservation Department estimate and the professional appraisal was a cause for concern  and  with that kind of disparity I would think that would necessitate more than one alternative valuation  Mr  Banks said the  173 million purchase price was justified because if the city were to take the buildings through eminent domain  the process could have dragged on for years and could have ended up costing the city even more money Mr  Banks said that Mr  Carone s ties to the mayor did not influence the outcome  He said that the buildings have a total of 729 apartments  of which 468 were used as cluster housing All of the families in the cluster units  which include about 1 200 people  will now get affordable leases to their apartments  About 2 000 people live in the buildings  when noncluster apartments are included  There s 1 200 human beings here  children and adults  that are getting permanent housing at one fell swoop   Mr  Banks said Mr  de Blasio has vowed to end the cluster site program because it is costly and because it is often difficult to provide services to families placed in the apartments  Mr  Banks said that negotiations were continuing with the owners of other cluster site buildings  and similar deals could be announced soon  He said that Mr  Carone was not involved in those negotiations Mr  Carone said there was nothing untoward in his financial support of the mayor   He and his wife  Diana  each made the maximum donation of  4 950 to the mayor s 2017 re election campaign   I am a Brooklynite and an attorney representing the Kings County Democratic Organization  and I am proud to say I regularly support people from Brooklyn   Mr  Carone said in a statement   So it should be of no astonishment why I am supporting our Brooklyn mayor as he explores a run for president   

For President Trump s first two years in office  an unexpected rebound in manufacturing jobs helped bolster his claims that he was restoring the United States  battered industrial sector  Now  that surge may be nearing its end   in part because of his own trade policies American manufacturers have added nearly half a million jobs since Mr  Trump took office  including for the last 19 months in a row  That streak  the longest since the mid 1990s  could hit 20 when the government releases March hiring data on Friday But concerns are mounting about how long that strength can continue  Employment growth for the sector in February  at 4 000 jobs  was the weakest in more than a year  and data from the payroll processing firm ADP on Wednesday showed the number of factory workers falling in March  Major automobile manufacturers have been cutting jobs  General Motors drew Mr  Trump s ire last month when it idled a factory in Lordstown  Ohio  and eliminated 14 000 positions American manufacturers are being battered from all sides  by tariffs that are driving up their costs  by cooling growth in China and Europe that is hurting demand for their exports  and by the waning effects of the tax cuts and government spending increases that pumped up growth last year  Data from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed that orders for capital goods  a key measure of business investment  fell in February and have trended down since last summer  We should expect to see manufacturing growth slow quite significantly   said Andrew Hunter  an economist at Capital Economics  a research firm  Trump owns the economy now  for better or worse American factories aren t grinding to a halt  A closely watched survey from the Institute of Supply Management hit a three year low in February but rebounded somewhat in March  Recent data from China suggests that the government s efforts to stimulate the economy there are beginning to have an effect  And financial markets rallied Wednesday  and continued to rise Thursday  on hopes that the United States and China could be nearing a trade deal  Strong economic underpinnings   low unemployment  rising wages  high levels of consumer confidence   make an outright collapse in manufacturing unlikely Still  businesses are becoming more cautious  which could spell trouble for the broader economy At Gradall Industries  an Ohio manufacturer of excavators and other heavy equipment for the manufacturing industry  orders have been strong this year  according to Michael A  Haberman  the company s president  But business in China is down sharply  tariffs are driving up costs  and Mr  Haberman has given up on the infrastructure spending package he hoped would spur demand for Gradall s equipment  Obviously  Europe s not doing that well  and China is clearly in a slowdown  so there has to be a concern   he said Faced with that uncertainty  Mr  Haberman wavered before making a long needed investment in a new robot welder this year  He eventually went ahead with that purchase  but he has postponed other investments   lasers for steel cutting  new machining equipment  additional robot welders  You need certainty if you re going to spend that kind of money   he said   And I don t think anybody feels very comfortable  Any slowdown poses a political risk for Mr  Trump  who ran for office on promises to bring jobs back from China and Mexico and who has repeatedly promoted the sector s growth as evidence that his policies are working   I guess I found the MAGIC WAND   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter in January Most economists say credit for the recent rebound in manufacturing lies less with Mr  Trump than with global forces beyond his control  Manufacturing underwent what amounted to a mini recession in 2015 and early 2016  caused by low energy and commodity prices that hurt the energy and agriculture sectors  By mid 2016  those trends were starting to reverse  just as major economies around the world were beginning to expand in sync for the first time in a decade Business confidence did rise after Mr  Trump s election  And the Republican tax cuts passed in late 2017 were intended to give companies an incentive to invest  although there has been little evidence of that so far  The tax cuts  along with increases in government spending  also provided a short term lift to the economy that benefited manufacturers along with other companies But those forces are fading  Economic growth cooled in late 2018 and is likely to slow further this year  in part because American exporters are likely to see less demand from customers overseas  China s economy has lost momentum in recent months  and Britain s protracted negotiations on leaving the European Union are taking a toll in Europe  Recent data from Germany  Europe s largest economy  suggests the country is flirting with recession Mr  Trump s trade policies are contributing to the sector s woes  Tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed last year led to increased employment at American steel plants  but raised costs for companies that use the metals  Mr  Trump s slow moving trade war with China has raised costs  disrupted supply chains and created uncertainty for American importers and exporters alike Winnebago Industries  the Iowa based maker of motor homes  gets most of its steel and aluminum from American suppliers  But that has not spared the company from the effects of tariffs  which have driven up prices for domestic and imported metals alike  Tariffs on Chinese goods have led to higher prices for electrical components  lighting fixtures  tires and other parts the company imports So far  Winnebago has largely been able to pass those costs on to customers  said Michael Happe  Winnebago s chief executive  But he isn t sure how long that will last  Higher interest rates are already making financing more expensive  and stock market volatility could give customers pause ImageFaced with that uncertainty  Gradall Industries has postponed some investments CreditRoss Mantle for The New York TimesWinnebago announced in February that it would close a plant in Junction City  Ore   and move production to an existing factory in Iowa  Mr  Happe said the decision  which will eliminate more than 200 jobs in Oregon  was not entirely due to economic forces  But he said evidence that growth was slowing was a significant factor  Certainly as the headwinds stack up and get a little bit stiffer  we pay more attention to that and we re probably even more careful  more disciplined  more methodical about determining when and how much to spend on our future   he said So far  there is little evidence of a renewed wave of factory layoffs  If anything  companies are complaining they cannot find enough workers to fill the jobs they have available United Grinding  a Swiss maker of machine tools for the aerospace and other industries  has seen slowing growth in Europe and Asia  But the United States has so far escaped a similar fate  said Steve Jacobson  who runs the company s Ohio based American subsidiary  North America is still the shining star   he said   Even though we hear a lot about the slowdown  we don t see the slowdown yet across any part of our business  Still  the company is stepping up its marketing efforts to guard against any falloff in demand  United Grinding s business depends on other manufacturers having the confidence to keep investing   and confidence can turn quickly  If one company decides to delay a big purchase  that can have a ripple effect  Then 10 more people wait  and then 20 more people wait  and then  lo and behold  we have a slowdown   Mr  Jacobson said   I look at it as more of a self fulfilling prophecy  It isn t clear whether blue collar voters will hold Mr  Trump responsible for a slowdown  Leo Gerard  the president of the United Steelworkers Union  said his members appreciated the president s decision to impose tariffs on foreign steel  And even in industries hurt by the tariffs  many workers say they support Mr  Trump s get tough approach to trade talks with China But Mr  Gerard said workers had been rattled by the closing of G M  s Lordstown plant  And despite two years of job growth  he said  the bigger picture for American manufacturing has not changed  The trade deficit is growing  companies are still shifting jobs to Mexico  and even Carrier   the Indiana furnace maker   has not added the jobs that Mr  Trump promised with great fanfare in 2016  We don t see any growth or expansion at Carrier   Mr  Gerard said   The president is the president  and he didn t stop what G M  is doing   

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Tuesday lashed out at Puerto Rico s local lawmakers as  grossly incompetent  and singled out one of his favorite targets  Carmen Yuln Cruz  the mayor of San Juan  as  crazed and incompetent  Mr  Trump s latest invective toward the local leaders of an island devastated by a hurricane in September 2017 came in a torrent of tweets  which began on Monday night and spilled into Tuesday morning  Mr  Trump was reacting after the Senate on Monday blocked billions of dollars in disaster aid for Midwestern states  in part because Democrats said a proposed  600 million in nutritional assistance to Puerto Rico fell short of its needs  Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter  He also stated  incorrectly  that Puerto Rico had received  91 billion in aid from the federal government In fact  FEMA and other agencies have so far distributed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion in aid has been allocated  while  91 billion is the budget office s estimate of how much the island could receive over the next two decades Gov  Ricardo A  Rossell of Puerto Rico  a Democrat  responded to Mr  Trump in a tweet of his own on Tuesday   Mr  President  once again  we are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Mr  Rossell wrote Mr  Trump has long been sensitive when it comes to the subject of Puerto Rico  where the federal government s response to Hurricane Maria was widely criticized as too slow  Aides and allies said Mr  Trump had vented privately that Puerto Ricans had complained too much  and he had also noted privately that Hurricane Maria  which killed 2 975 people as a result of the storm and its effects  was not as bad as Hurricane Katrina  in which fewer people   1 833   were killed Mr  Trump has long hit back at Ms  Cruz  who during the disaster became the most outspoken critic of the federal response On Tuesday  Mr  Trump seemed to imply in his tweets that Puerto Rico was not part of the United States  noting that local elected officials  only take from USA   Hogan Gidley  a White House spokesman  seemed to underscore the view in the White House that Puerto Ricans were not Americans when he twice referred to the island as  that country  during an appearance on MSNBC Mr  Trump s apparent disdain for the island s leadership has led to a breakdown of communication between local officials and the White House For weeks  Mr  Rossell has asked the White House for a private meeting with Mr  Trump to lay out the island s case for why it desperately needs federal funds for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria  But Mr  Rossell s request has gone unanswered  and he has tried instead to communicate with the president publicly  saying in cable news interviews  in official appearances and on Twitter that he fears Mr  Trump has been misled about Puerto Rico s needs Mr  Rossell s fight may be an uphill battle with a president who has made it clear that he views more federal aid to Puerto Rico as throwing money away  Mr  Trump s advisers also view the pleas from local officials as part of a campaign to shift the blame for what they view as severe mismanagement of the supplies and money sent after the storm People familiar with Mr  Trump s thinking said he was skeptical that additional aid would not be used to pay down Puerto Rico s debt  The acting White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  who has made it clear that he believes Puerto Rico will need to find its own way out of the debt crisis  is believed to be encouraging the president s negative view of the island In Puerto Rico  however  Mr  Trump s stance is being viewed through the lens of race  In an interview on Tuesday  Mr  Rossell mentioned  unprompted  that Puerto Rico s population was almost entirely Latino and said that historically  there have been  ethnic undertones  to the treatment of Puerto Ricans by Washington   We don t want special treatment   he said   We just want equal treatment  The governor also has bigger issues to deal with at home  The resignations of two power players in his cabinet became public late on Monday  Julia Keleher  the education secretary  and Hctor M  Pesquera  the public safety secretary  had been among the least popular members of Mr  Rossell s government  Their departures dominated the headlines in the local news media  which made little reference to what is widely seen here as yet another episode of presidential bluster That is not to say Puerto Ricans necessarily disagree with Mr  Trump s criticism of the commonwealth s leaders  even if many locals dislike the president himself  or the disdainful way he sometimes refers to the island  We have a political caste that is opportunistic and extremely corrupt   said Eduardo Lalo  a well known local novelist  humanities professor and opinion columnist who supports Puerto Rican independence   What the president says  of course it s clumsy and tremendously vulgar  and he says it for reasons of his own that are not substantive  But it s also objective  Image We are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Gov  Ricardo A  Rossell of Puerto Rico said in a tweet to President Trump CreditThais Llorca EPA  via ShutterstockThe truth is  he said   Puerto Rico is a colony of the United States  and therefore its hands are completely tied  At a bakery in the comfortable San Juan neighborhood of Ocean Park on Tuesday  the morning crowd was hardly abuzz about Mr  Trump s comments  though people had noticed them One patron  Miguel Rodrguez  54  pulled out his cellphone to show how  moments earlier  a friend had posted on Facebook that she agreed with the president for the first time in praising Puerto Ricans but labeling their leaders  corrupt  Mr  Rodrguez  the owner of a company that installs security systems  scrolled down to the comment he left under his friend s post   We do not lack resources  we have too many thieves   The government wants to keep demanding money from the government of the United States   Mr  Rodrguez said   But much of that help doesn t reach the people  Politically  Mr  Rossell is in an unenviable position experienced by all of his predecessors  Puerto Rico cannot get funding even for its food stamp program without approval from Congress  but it has no congressional representation to make its case in Washington   Representative Jenniffer Gonzlez Coln  a Republican  has no vote in the House   None of the previous governors  however  had to deal with the dire consequences of a devastating hurricane in the middle of a government bankruptcy  Neither Trump nor any president of the United States nor any official in the United States has assumed the responsibility it has with Puerto Rico   Professor Lalo said   The great tragedy of the Puerto Rican people is that for 120 years  it calls Washington and no one picks up the phone  Mr  Rossell  who is up for re election next year  has faced intense criticism on the island for trying to work cooperatively with Mr  Trump even as the president was repeatedly deriding Puerto Rican leaders Last week  the governor amped up his language against Mr  Trump  appearing to refer to him as a  bully  in an interview with CNN  If the bully gets close  I ll punch the bully in the mouth   he said   It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage  He later characterized his comments as a metaphor Mr  Trump has refrained from going after Mr  Rossell by name  preferring to focus his attention Ms  Cruz  his political nemesis since her outspoken comments criticizing the Trump administration s failure to provide swift and meaningful help in the weeks after Hurricane Maria After Mr  Trump called Ms  Cruz  crazed and incompetent  on Twitter on Monday  she fired back  calling him  unhinged   He can huff   puff all he wants but he cannot escape the death of 3 000 on his watch   she wrote   SHAME ON YOU  Ms  Cruz recently declared her candidacy for governor  She and several other candidates are hoping to unseat Mr  Rossell in 2020  He is a supporter of Puerto Rican statehood  she is not  When he doesn t get his way  he tries to pit people against each other   Ms  Cruz said of Mr  Trump in an interview on Tuesday   Three thousand people died under his watch and he has never acknowledged it  He s now trying to weaponize help   and  in his desperation  he s lying about it  Calling Puerto Rican leaders  corrupt  reflects poorly on Mr  Trump s own administration  she added  If he thinks that the money that has come to Puerto Rico is money that we shouldn t have received  then he doesn t trust FEMA   she said   He shows his inability to lead and that he is incapable of understanding how his own government works   

WASHINGTON   Joseph R  Biden Jr  came up in politics as an old school backslapper whose greatest strength was his ability to connect  He doled out handshakes and hugs to friends and strangers alike  and his tendency to lavish his affections on women and girls was so central to his persona that it became fodder for late night television jokes But the political ground has shifted under Mr  Biden  and his tactile style of retail politicking is no longer a laughing matter in the era of  MeToo  Now  as he considers a run for president  Mr  Biden is struggling to prevent a strength from turning into a crippling liability  on Tuesday alone  two more women told The New York Times that the former vice president s touches made them uncomfortable For Mr  Biden  76  the risks are obvious  the accusations feed into a narrative that he is a relic of the past  unsuited to represent his party in the modern era  against an incumbent president whose treatment of women should be a central line of attack  Mr  Biden has denied acting inappropriately but has said he will  listen respectfully  So far  no prominent Democrat has suggested he not run  and the women complaining about him have not claimed sexual harassment or assault  Other women have stepped forward to say Mr  Biden s touches were welcome  But the accusations lodged against Mr  Biden have raised questions about when a  tactile politician  crosses the line into inappropriateness  I don t think it s disqualifying   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an interview with Politico Playbook  But she added   He has to understand in the world that we re in now that people s space is important to them  and what s important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it  Gloria Steinem  the feminist icon  said politicians needed to set parameters   The way out is simple  Our bodies and voices belong to us   that should be the first step in democracy  Just ask before hugging  With a vibrant  youthful and multicultural field of candidates on the Democratic stage   and after a midterm election that swept dozens of women into Congress   Mr  Biden is already facing questions about whether this is the time for an older white man to carry his party s banner into 2020  His handling of the 1991 confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas  who was accused of sexual harassment by the law professor Anita Hill  has also been the subject of scrutiny Now some analysts are envisioning President Trump   who admitted on videotape to grabbing women without their consent   tagging the former vice president with a nickname that has emerged on the internet  Creepy Uncle Joe   A pro Trump group  the Great America PAC  said Tuesday it would release a  Creepy Joe  Biden ad  As if on cue  the president went after Mr  Biden at a fund raiser in Washington on Tuesday night  Cracking a joke about asking for a kiss  Mr  Trump said   I felt like Joe Biden  VideoIn an interview published by Politico Playbook  Speaker Nancy Pelosi discussed the accusations against Joseph R  Biden Jr  by women who said the former vice president s touches made them uncomfortable  Ms  Pelosi s remarks were delivered against the backdrop of Mr  Biden s impending decision to run for president in 2020 CreditCreditErin Schaff The New York TimesFor Democrats  that is problematic  It opens the door for a discussion about whether Joe Biden can actually credibly take on Donald Trump on a series of issues that the Democratic Party is seen as quite strong on   said Jennifer L  Lawless  an expert on women in politics at the University of Virginia The list of women coming forward is growing  Caitlyn Caruso  a former college student and sexual assault survivor  said Mr  Biden rested his hand on her thigh   even as she squirmed in her seat to show her discomfort   and hugged her  just a little bit too long  at an event on sexual assault at the University of Nevada  Las Vegas  She was 19 Ms  Caruso  now 22  said she chalked up the encounter at the time to how men act  and did not say anything publicly  But she said it was particularly uncomfortable because she had just shared her own story of sexual assault and had expected Mr  Biden   an architect of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act   to understand the importance of physical boundaries  It doesn t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that   she said   These are supposed to be people you can trust  D  J  Hill  59  a writer who recalled meeting Mr  Biden in 2012 at a fund raising event in Minneapolis  said that when she and her husband  Robert  stepped up to take their photograph with the vice president  he put his hand on her shoulder and then started dropping it down her back  which made her  very uncomfortable  Her husband  seeing the movement  put his hand on Mr  Biden s shoulder and interrupted with a joke  Ms  Hill did not say anything at the time and acknowledged that she does not know what Mr  Biden s intention was or whether he was aware of her discomfit  Only he knows his intent   she said  But norms are changing now  she said  and  if something makes you feel uncomfortable  you have to feel able to say it  Even as these women come forward  a counternarrative has begun to emerge  from women like Stephanie Carter  the wife of the former defense secretary Ashton B  Carter  who has complained that a photograph of Mr  Biden with his hands on her shoulders has been widely misinterpreted  She pushed back in a post on Medium titled  The  MeToo Story That Wasn t Me   writing that she saw the gesture as  means of offering his support  Erin Bilbray  a former Democratic congressional candidate from Nevada  also came to Mr  Biden s defense  During a meet and greet in a private room with her family before an event in 2014  she said  Mr  Biden  hugged me  and  kissed me on the head   It was a very nurturing  supportive action   said Ms  Bilbray  now 49  who also posted about her encounter with Mr  Biden on Facebook on Sunday   It was not anything other than that  Mr  Biden has been touchy feely with men  too  and he is hardly the first politician to make waves for such displays  Former President George W  Bush was captured giving Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany a quick shoulder massage at a Group of 8 summit meeting in Russia   prompting a headline in The Guardian that read  Bush Rubs Merkel Up The Wrong Way  ImageCaitlyn Caruso said that Mr  Biden placed his hand on her thigh and hugged her  just a little bit too long  at a campus event on sexual assault several years ago CreditEthan Miller Getty ImagesBut perhaps none have employed the use of touch as liberally as the former vice president  People who know Mr  Biden are virtually unanimous in their assessment of him as an inveterate hugger who has no ill intent    a very affectionate individual who is a natural toucher   said Senator Susan Collins  Republican of Maine In a Twitter thread on Tuesday  Jean Carnahan  the former senator from Missouri  described how caring Mr  Biden was after she arrived in the Senate  taking the seat of her husband  who had died weeks earlier in a plane crash  Mr  Biden had also suffered the loss of a spouse  shortly before he joined the Senate in 1973  It was his empathy and encouragement more than that of any of my colleagues  that gave me strength to meet each day   Ms  Carnahan wrote   And  yes  I sometimes  got a shoulder pat or even a head kiss  Joe has a deep desire to share in the lives of others   their grief  pain  and joy  He reaches out through the human touch to connect and express those feelings  Meghan McCain expressed similar sentiments  writing on Twitter   Joe Biden is one of the truly decent and compassionate men in all of American politics  He has helped me through my fathers diagnosis  treatment and ultimate passing more than anyone of my fathers friends combined  I wish there was more empathy from our politicians not less  But touching someone you know is one thing  touching complete strangers  as Mr  Biden often does  is another  Even so  former Biden aides said it never came up as an issue  and no one dissuaded him from the behavior  And it was hardly a secret  This is stuff mostly that he s done in front of everybody   said David Axelrod  who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama while Mr  Biden was vice president   I m sure his intent was benign  but through the lens of today  it looks like something different  There may also be a generational component to that lens  The controversy around Mr  Biden erupted over the weekend when Lucy Flores  a former candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada  described how Mr  Biden placed his hands on her shoulders  leaned in to smell her hair and  proceeded to plant a big  slow kiss on the back of my head  before she went onstage at a campaign rally Ms  Flores was 35 at the time   It was completely inappropriate   she said Sunday on CNN But Diane Denish  70  who served as lieutenant governor of New Mexico from 2003 through 2010  said she had  exactly the same experience  with Mr  Biden and  had a completely different reaction to it  As they were getting ready to go onstage at a campaign event  Ms  Denish said  Mr  Biden  just put his hands on my shoulders and leaned back and said   Go get  em   a little peck on the head  I paid so little attention to it  but I m of a different generation than Lucy Flores  On Tuesday  the Biden camp sent reporters quotations from about two dozen women   including former aides  current and former members of Congress  and news media personalities including Mika Brzezinski   vouching for the former vice president  But Ms  Lawless  the political scientist  said that if Mr  Biden was to survive this episode  he would have to persuade his fellow Democrats that he could and would change  He can rein in his exuberance  but he is who he is   Mr  Axelrod said   He can discipline himself to some degree  but you re not going to put this guy in a straitjacket   

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to nominate Herman Cain  who abandoned his 2012 presidential bid in the face of escalating accusations of sexual misconduct  for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board Mr  Trump  speaking from the Oval Office  called Mr  Cain  the former chief executive of Godfather s Pizza   a truly outstanding individual  and said   I ve told my folks that s the man  The decision to consider Mr  Cain is the second time in weeks that the president has floated candidates with deeply held political views and past ethical issues to fill a seat on the Fed  signaling his intent to put allies on a traditionally independent body  It comes as Mr  Trump has continued to attack the Fed and his handpicked chairman  Jerome H  Powell  for raising interest rates in 2018  saying those moves slowed economic growth Last month  Mr  Trump said he planned to nominate Stephen Moore  a conservative economist who advised his presidential campaign and has become a vocal critic of the central bank s recent rate increases  as a Fed governor Mr  Trump has staked his presidency on a booming economy and his re election could hinge on whether it continues to surge or falter  The Fed  which has the ability to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates and using other tools at its disposal  will play a crucial role in the economy s trajectory While presidents have long stocked regulatory agencies with partisan appointees in pursuit of ideological goals  the Fed s seven member board of governors has largely been an exception given the role it plays in the United States economy  The Fed s primary job is to guide the economy  typically by adjusting interest rates  It aims for sustainable growth  maximum employment and stable prices  It also regulates banks and oversees the plumbing of the financial system Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short term growth at the expense of inflation and instability  Some modern presidents have opined openly about what the Fed should do  including President George Bush  who declared in a State of the Union address that the central bank should keep rates low But in recent decades  the volume of public commentary greatly diminished as politicians concluded that pressuring the Fed was counterproductive The president has largely abandoned that tradition  Last year  as interest rates rose and the stock market declined  Mr  Trump repeatedly attacked Fed policy as  crazy    wild  and  loco   He asked aides whether he could replace the chairman and lamented privately that Mr  Powell s appointment was one of his biggest regrets The Fed  which raised rates for five consecutive quarters amid a roaring economy with the lowest unemployment rate in nearly two decades  has since paused its campaign  Mr  Powell has repeatedly rebuffed any suggestion that the central bank is being influenced by Mr  Trump s broadsides  saying it is adopting a more  patient  approach to interest rates given signs of economic weakness in the United States and abroad With two open seats on the seven member Fed  Mr  Trump has the ability to drastically shape the central bank for the foreseeable future  The president has already appointed four of the Fed s current governors  who carry 14 year terms  One governor  Lael Brainard  is a holdover from the Obama administration The appointment and confirmation of Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain could put the Fed in uncharted territory  While the institution has strongly rooted values around technical competence and apolitical debate  Mr  Trump s latest choices have been political actors rather than in the weeds experts in any of the main areas in which the Fed makes policy Two governors alone cannot entirely shape Fed policy  but they can have an effect on decisions  The Federal Open Market Committee  which sets interest rates  consists of 12 voting members  including the seven governors  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents  who serve one year terms on a rotating basis  Changes to interest rates must be approved by a majority of the voting members Both Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain are undergoing background checks  and if nominated  must be confirmed by the Senate The choice of such candidates to fill two of the most powerful jobs in economic policy is raising fears among some Fed veterans that the president is installing political allies at the central bank to do his bidding  It s one thing to put cronies into the executive branch  but I think the central bank is another kind of institution that it s so critical in that it holds the reins solely to monetary policy   said Sarah Bloom Raskin  who served on the Fed s board of governors from 2010 to 2014   It has the potential to undermine the credibility of monetary policy  Mr  Cain s nomination is being supported by Larry Kudlow  who heads the National Economic Council and also recommended Mr  Moore for a Fed seat  according to a person familiar with the discussions While he heaped praise on his  friend  Mr  Cain  Mr  Trump earlier in the day continued his assault on the  destructive actions  taken by the Fed and said on Twitter that the economy was very strong despite the central bank s efforts The selection of Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain appeared to be a counterweight to Mr  Powell  But while Mr  Moore has been publicly critical of the Fed and called for Mr  Powell to resign  Mr  Cain s views are less clear As a presidential candidate  Mr  Cain rode a brief surge in popularity to the top of the polls on the back of his  9 9 9  economic plan  The proposal called for scrapping the existing tax code and replacing it with a flat 9 percent income tax  a 9 percent business tax and a 9 percent national retail sales tax  The concept was hailed by some for its simplicity  but it ultimately fizzled with his campaign On monetary policy  his views are equally unorthodox  In a 2012 op ed in The Wall Street Journal  Mr  Cain accused the central bank of manipulating the value of the dollar by raising and lowering interest rates by whim and called for a return to the gold standard  which was abandoned in 1971  For the last 40 years in Washington  regulate has meant manipulate  with the Federal Reserve raising and lowering interest rates and buying and selling assets at its own discretion   Mr  Cain wrote  arguing that a complex society needs fixed standards   A dollar should be defined   as it was prior to 1971 under the postwar Bretton Woods system   as a fixed quantity of gold  Mr  Cain is also a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  a role that is often given to local business leaders  In a 2011 interview with The Atlantic  Drue Jennings  who served with Mr  Cain on the board  said that Mr  Cain was an  inflation hawk  when it came to monetary policy  a moniker attributed to those who view rising prices as a threat to economic growth and favor higher interest rates to keep inflation in check Mr  Trump has made clear he has no interest in a Fed governor who wants to raise rates but  more recently  Mr  Cain has shown that he has evolved on the subject  If I were offered the job  I would try to encourage the Fed not to make inflation a fear factor because deflation  as Stephen Moore had pointed out in a great article that he wrote along with another economist  deflation is more of a fear factor than inflation   Mr  Cain said in a February interview with the Fox Business Network Perhaps most important to Mr  Trump  Mr  Cain has shown that he is loyal to the president  In September  Mr  Cain formed the America Fighting Back PAC  which has a mission of publicly rebutting what he believes is misinformation about Mr  Trump  We re offering a compelling  solid refutation to what you hear from the media and the rest of the left about President Trump and conservative ideas   Mr  Cain said at the time It is unclear whether Mr  Cain will clear the background check  His presidential campaign came to a screeching halt after several women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment or improper behavior The selection of Mr  Cain drew backlash on Thursday from some of those women Ginger White  who publicly said in 2011 that she and Mr  Cain had had an affair  said that he should not be rewarded for such actions  Ms  White said that the affair was on and off for 13 years and that Mr  Cain denied it because he was seeking the Republican nomination for president  We need honesty and integrity in those who are appointed to public office   Ms  White said in a statement released by her lawyer  Gloria Allred   Herman Cain should not be rewarded for his bad behavior  In my opinion  he lacks what should be required for appointment to the Federal Reserve or any public office  Sharon Bialek  who is also represented by Ms  Allred  came forward in 2011 and accused Mr  Cain of grabbing her in a sexually aggressive way when she sought his help after losing her job at the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s  Ms  Bialek said in a statement on Thursday evening that Mr  Cain sexually harassed her and that he was not fit for public service  I did not think that he was a man of character then  and I do not think he is now   Ms  Bialek said   Anyone who uses their position of power to take advantage of a woman does not possess the character  integrity or values required to serve on the Federal Reserve Board  In some ways  Mr  Cain  who preferred news interviews to intensive retail campaigning  presaged Mr  Trump s own outsider campaign four years later  But unlike the president s presidential bid  Mr  Cain s was fatally wounded when he faced charges of sexual misconduct In October 2011  Politico reported that Mr  Cain  as head of the National Restaurant Association  had been accused of sexually harassing two women  who left the trade group after receiving financial payouts and signing nondisclosure agreements  One of the women  who was from Chicago  said that Mr  Cain made an unwanted and rough physical advance Confronted with the claims  Mr  Cain initially did not deny them  He later proclaimed his innocence and sought to cast blame on political rivals and the news media for what he called a smear campaign Other women emerged soon after to say that they  too  had been sexually harassed by Mr  Cain  By that December  he dropped out of the presidential race  

BERLIN   Swastikas daubed on a Jewish cemetery in France  An anti Semitic political campaign by Hungary s far right government  Labour lawmakers in Britain quitting their party and citing ingrained anti Semitism  A Belgian carnival float caricaturing Orthodox Jews sitting on bags of money And that was just the past few months The accumulated incidents in Europe and the United States have highlighted how an ancient prejudice is surging in the 21st century in both familiar and mutant ways  fusing ideologies that otherwise would have little overlap The spike is taking place in a context of rising global economic uncertainty  an emphasis on race and national identity  and a deepening polarization between the political left and right in Europe and the United States over the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians  There s an ideological pattern that is common   said Gnther Jikeli  an expert on European anti Semitism at Indiana University   The world is seen as in a bad shape  and what hinders it becoming a better place are the Jews  Anti Semitism has become a section of today s political Venn diagram where the far right can intersect with parts of the far left  Europe s radical Islamist fringe  and even politicians from America s two main parties That confluence is new  experts say  as is the emergence of an Israeli government that has sidled up to far right allies who praise Israel even as they peddle anti Semitic prejudice at home  It creates a landscape that is very confusing and where things are more blurry than in the past   said Samuel Ghiles Meilhac  an expert on Jewish history at the Institut d Histoire du Temps Prsent  a government funded research group in France Polling suggests that anti Semitic attitudes may be no more widespread than in the past  particularly in Western Europe  where Holocaust remembrance has become a ritual for most governments Despite this  bigots have seemingly become more brazen  creating a climate that has made anti Semitism far more permissible and dangerous In recent decades  Western anti Semitism has tended to trace the contours of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  spiking and ebbing in correlation with spasms of violence between the two sides  But since the 2014 war in Gaza  researchers say  anti Semitic incidents have remained at high levels  And that s kind of worrying because it means it has become normal to act in anti Semitic ways   Mr  Jikeli said ImageHungary s far right government regularly invokes George Soros  the billionaire philanthropist with Hungarian Jewish roots  as a threat  as it did in this campaign poster in Budapest last year CreditAkos Stiller for The New York TimesThose include acts of violence  In 2018  France reported a 74 percent spike over the previous year in anti Semitic incidents  with more than 500 incidents  including the murder of a Holocaust survivor in her own home  President Emmanuel Macron called it the worst level of anti Semitism since World War II In Germany over the same period  violent anti Semitic attacks   62 of them   rose by 60 percent  while all anti Semitic crimes rose almost 10 percent to 1 646  according to government statistics Around Europe  where the popularity of the far right has been boosted by economic uncertainty and fears over migration  almost 90 percent of Jews believe that anti Semitism has increased in their country in the last five years  according to surveys by the European Union For decades after World War II and the Holocaust  anti Semitism was mostly consigned to the political fringes  which is no longer the case  It is now more widely harnessed for political ends  experts say  Today  mainstream European and North American politicians  even presidents  premiers and prime ministers  don t hesitate to flirt with or embrace overtly anti Semitic messages and memes   said David Nirenberg  dean of the Divinity School at the University of Chicago and an expert on Jewish history  This electoral utility of anti Semitism feels new to me  newly flexible  and therefore newly dangerous   Mr  Nirenberg added Far right parties often portray Jews as a cosmopolitan threat to national identity  especially in regions where the stereotype has been used historically  In Hungary  Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been able to present the Jewish billionaire George Soros as a secret instigator of Muslim immigration In Poland last month  a far right newspaper sold inside the Parliament ran a front page headline saying  How to spot a Jew   alongside a condemnation of a historian who researches Polish complicity in the Holocaust On the far left  some politicians have associated Jews with the failings of capitalism and conspiracies about supposed control over the global economy  Those complaints are now heard on the fringes of the Yellow Vest movement in France President Trump himself embodies the contradictions of the moment  Mr  Trump has openly courted white nationalists  saying they include  some very fine people   even as they marched in the style of the Ku Klux Klan  gave stiff armed Nazi salutes and chanted slogans like  Jews will not replace us  During his campaign  he attacked Hillary Clinton with a Twitter post that included her image  a Jewish star  and a pile of money ImageMembers of the Alt Right led a torch march in Charlottesville  Va   in 2017 CreditEdu Bayer for The New York TimesAt the same time  the president has boasted close relations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and offered full throated support to Israel  including moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem  even absent progress toward a settlement with the Palestinians That more strident support has now been greeted with more strident opposition  most obviously from Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota  one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress She has been widely condemned for what critics called her peddling of anti Semitic stereotypes   for which she publicly apologized  Ms  Omar also was criticized for what was widely interpreted as questioning American Jews  allegiance to the United States  and for remarks that some construed as referring to the undue influence of Jewish lobbies  interpretations she denies The use of similar tropes by members of the Labour Party in Britain has prompted several Labour lawmakers to resign in protest  They are also common talking points in extremist Islamist circles  When French Muslims attack Jews in Paris or Marseille   said Mr  Nirenberg  of the University of Chicago   it is because Islamist discourse has taught them to understand not only the situation of Palestinians  but also the global status of Islam and even their own poverty and marginalization in France  as in some way caused by Zionists and Jews  But data  particularly from Germany  suggests that most contemporary anti Semitism is nevertheless primarily still perpetrated by the white  far right  who are often also virulently anti Muslim  It cheapens the very right struggle against anti Semitism for Islamophobic bigots to weaponize it in their campaigns   said H A  Hellyer  a nonresident expert on Islam and the Middle East at the Atlantic Council  a research group  One needn t agree with Congresswoman Ilhan Omar to recognize that she is being targeted primarily as a black  Muslim  hijab wearing woman  and by many people whose records on combating bigotry and discrimination  or calling it out in their own ranks  are abysmal   Dr  Hellyer added It is unsurprising to find a resurgence of anti Semitism at a time of prolonged political and economic instability  historians and analysts say  when citizens from many different political and cultural traditions are grasping for easy explanations for sudden and complex injustices Just as Jews were a ready made scapegoat during previous eras of anxiety about the pace of social change or global economic trauma  so are they again today  said Stefanie Schler Springorum  the head of the Center for anti Semitism Research in Berlin ImageA demonstration organized by the Campaign Against Anti Semitism outside the head office of the British opposition Labour Party in London last year CreditTolga Akmen Agence France Presse   Getty Images Globalization and especially the crisis of 2008 have strengthened a feeling of being at the mercy of mechanisms that we do not understand  let alone control   Ms  Schler Springorum said   From there it is only a small step to classical conspiracy theories  which have always formed the core of anti Semitism  That step is even smaller in the social media age  Rumor and conspiracy theories have always played a role in stoking anti Semitism  Today  the speed at which lies can spread  because of the internet  is without precedent The increasingly hard right Israeli government led by Mr  Netanyahu is a point of divergence for the different strands of contemporary anti Semitism Far right political figures like Mr  Orban have drawn close to Israel  while leftist anti Semites revile it  But both do so for the same reason  They perceive Israel as a country that has done its best to preserve its ethnic and religious character at the expense of a Muslim minority The main difference is that Mr  Orban  the prime minister of another small country fighting to preserve its ethnic identity  sees this as a virtue  whereas leftist critics of Israel  such as the supporters of the British Labour leader  Jeremy Corbyn  largely do not Both left and right  have the same image of Israel   said David Hirsh  a sociologist at Goldsmiths College  University of London  and a critic of Mr  Corbyn who campaigns against the academic boycott of Israel  Corbyn says that Israel is a uniquely belligerent human rights abusing state that defends its purity at all costs against Muslims   he said   And I suspect that people on the far right have exactly the same picture of Israel   that it is a belligerent country that defends itself against Muslims  For critics of Mr  Netanyahu  this also explains why the leader of the world s only Jewish state might find common cause with a far right leader like Mr  Orban  despite the latter s anti Semitic leanings ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  shown with the Hungarian leader  Viktor Orban  has sidled up to far right governments who support Israel even as they peddle anti Semitic prejudice at home CreditBalazs Mohai EPA  via ShutterstockMr  Netanyahu and Mr  Orban share an approach to domestic politics  an antipathy for liberal voices  a discomfort with Muslim minorities and a willingness to work with the far right Like Mr  Orban in Hungary  Mr  Netanyahu has introduced legislation that targets civil society organizations that receive significant funding from overseas  His government has forbidden non Jews to exercise the right to self determination  and removed Arabic as an official Israeli language Recently  Mr  Netanyahu engineered an electoral pact with a racist party from the far right fringe who could help him retain power in a general election later this year  I don t believe that Netanyahu really wants a State of Israel with no Arabs  but I believe he does want a State of Israel where the position of Jews is so dominant and secure that it would never have to consider having to be a Western style liberal democracy without an ethno religious character   said Derek Penslar  a professor of Jewish history at Harvard University  There is an aspiration for ethnocracy   added Mr  Penslar   It doesn t mean there are no other ethnic groups   but only one group truly rules  And though the relationship between Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Orban may trouble some in the Jewish diaspora  it may not be so troubling for Israelis themselves  said Yossi Shain  a professor of political science at Tel Aviv University Mr  Orban supports Israel s right to exist  whereas his critics are perceived by some Israelis  to demean Israel s nationalism and right to exist   said Mr  Shain  the author of a forthcoming book addressing the subject  And for Israelis  that is the core of anti Semitism in the modern era

nudge ever closer to striking an agreement  Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT explain how one of its key tenets could undercut Washington s vision    Any agreement seems certain to involve China s promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods  For Mr  Trump  this is an essential element that will help reduce the United States  record trade deficit with China     But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state  and most will be carried out by state controlled Chinese businesses  further cementing Beijing s role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese   Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by next week  to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He  the Chinese special envoy charged with negotiating the deal   Ms  Swanson and Mr  Bradsher write  The goal is reportedly  to have an agreement by the end of that meeting  with a signing ceremony between Mr  Trump and

WASHINGTON   When Kamala Harris made her much heralded arrival in Washington as California s first black U S  senator  she made a curious early decision Within months of her swearing in  she sponsored a bill urging states to eliminate cash bail  denouncing the system as a scourge on the poor and communities of color That position would become a key part of her criminal justice reform platform  But her choice surprised some bail reform advocates back in California  In her seven years as a district attorney  and then six as attorney general  Harris was absent on the issue  they say  In fact  less than a year earlier  her office defended the cash bail system in a pair of federal court cases  shifting course only weeks before she entered the Senate  For her entire career she used some of the highest money bail amounts in the country to keep people in jail cells and saddle poor families with financial debt   said Alec Karakatsanis  an attorney who has brought several legal challenges to California s bail system   and as soon as she had no influence on that issue practically  she announces she has a different view on it  Now a presidential candidate   Harris is casting herself as a progressive who consistently leveraged her power in the justice system to further civil rights causes and advocate for the disadvantaged  She has pledged a wholesale overhaul of the country s fractured criminal justice system  arguing for marijuana legalization  bail reform and a moratorium on the death penalty But when she had a chance to take a bold stand on these issues as a top law enforcement officer  Harris often opted for a careful approach or defended the status quo  Observers of her career note some of her key positions  like her opposition to cash bail  came at politically opportune moments  after public views had shifted on race  inequality and bias in the justice system  I never had a sense she was forward thinking or reforming   said John Raphling  a bail reform advocate and senior researcher at Human Rights Watch who faced off against Harris s state Justice Department as a criminal defense attorney   Bail reform is a trendy issue  and a lot of politicians are jumping on it and saying this is unfair  I don t have any evidence that Harris was seeing that unfairness back when she was attorney general   but to her credit  we evolve  we learn  we see things  Harris  supporters say as a prosecutor she was tasked with upholding the law and  as attorney general  defending the state  not making policy  She had limited ability to effect change within the rigid structure of the courts  they argue  Everyone who has experienced the criminal justice system knows it s broken   said Lateefah Simon  a civil rights activist who worked for Harris in San Francisco   She would say   we re confined by the rules of the law  and in the areas where we have discretion  we are going to work to try to move justice    I deeply know her convictions about what could be possible and what we needed to do  but also what the boundaries and limitations were   she said Simon said Harris worked to hire more people of color as prosecutors  In her first year as San Francisco district attorney  she launched a re entry program designed to keep low level drug offenders from returning to prison  That same year she refused to seek the death penalty for a man who killed a police officer  infuriating the Bay Area political establishment and creating friction with the law enforcement community But in many cases throughout her career Harris embraced the traditional role of prosecutor Her office defended wrongful convictions  fighting to keep behind bars those who judges determined should go free  She refused to take a position on a pair of sentencing reform ballot measures  arguing she must remain neutral because her office was responsible for preparing ballot text  She defended the death penalty in court  setting aside her personal opposition to capital punishment In response to critics who ve pushed her to use her power in the courts to usher in change  she told The New York Times in 2016   I have a client  I don t get to choose my client  Harris says she would call for a federal moratorium on the death penalty if elected president Harris  law enforcement approach has at times put her out of step with California s activist community  When she pushed a controversial policy that criminalized truancy  threatening to jail parents of children who missed too much school  even Harris  staff  winced at the plan   she wrote in her first book released just in time for her campaign for attorney general in 2010 The program has since become a source of tension with criminal justice advocates  who see it as sign of Harris  outdated approach to dealing with problems that stem from poverty In a recent NPR interview  Harris said her truancy initiative was not designed to punish vulnerable families  but  put a spotlight  on the problem and direct resources to needy families  Her campaign hails the effort as a success  and supporters have lauded Harris for prioritizing a child s education  As a result of our initiative  which never resulted in any parent going to jail   never   because that was never the goal   Harris said But Harris s legacy remains on the state s books  She authored a state wide truancy law modeled after her San Francisco program  It has resulted in hundreds of parents in often less affluent and less politically liberal California counties being prosecuted Harris  approach at the time was considered smart politics for a politician seeking to run statewide  Throughout her career  Harris worked to win over powerful police unions  She refused to support a bill requiring her office to investigate shootings involving law enforcement officers  In 2015  she declined to back statewide standards for body cameras  arguing that individual departments should decide how to use the technology  If you offend all the police chiefs and sheriffs of California  you re probably not going to get re elected as the attorney general of California  and if you re not elected  how do you engage in any of the reforms you want to do   said Jim Bueermann  a former California police chief who worked on Harris  transition to the attorney general s office As Harris transitioned from law enforcement to legislating  the politics of criminal justice issues were changing fast The deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015 prompted outcry and spawned the Black Lives Matter movement  Democrats began rethinking their tough on crime strategies  focusing more on inequality and abuse in the system  Prosecutors and police came under increasing scrutiny for their roles Harris  views appear to have been changing  too In 2014  she was opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana  and when she ran against a Republican challenger for re election as attorney general she took the more conservative view  He wanted to legalize  Harris laughed at the idea in a local television interview But Harris s public tone changed as speculation grew about her running for president in 2020  Last year  Harris endorsed Democratic Sen  Cory Booker s bill for federal legalization of marijuana  She argued on Twitter that  making marijuana legal at the federal level is the smart thing to do and it s the right thing to do   She released a video declaring that  marijuana laws are not applied and enforced in the same way for all people  Last month  she went as far as acknowledging to a pair of morning radio hosts that she s used recreational marijuana   I have  and I did inhale  that was a long time ago  For Ron Gold  the Republican who ran against her in 2014 and who supported recreational legalization when she did not  Harris  stance on marijuana is indicative of her tendency to take a position  that s popular  but not necessarily held strongly by the candidate  it s a position that curries favor with a segment of the population   he said Some see a similar pattern when it comes to the call for bail reform Shortly after announcing her presidential bid in January  Harris declared on Twitter   It s long past time to address bail reform across the country   This is a serious injustice   she wrote Three years earlier  Harris s office was defending cash bail in a federal case  Neither the bail law nor the bail schedule discriminate on the basis of wealth  poverty  or economic status of any kind   she wrote  In response to the notion that money bail schemes unfairly punish low income defendants  Harris wrote   the state is not constitutionally required to remove obstacles not of its own creation  Harris appears to have shifted her stance 10 months later  In December of 2016  Harris filed a motion in a case challenging the application of California s money bail laws saying the system is deserving  of intense scrutiny   She pledged not to defend any bail scheme that fails to take into account a defendant s ability to pay  Three weeks later she was sworn in to the Senate Still  she asked the judge to toss the case  arguing that the laws were constitutional even if the way some counties implemented those laws was not  The bail system at issue here does not categorically deny bail to any group of individuals   she wrote The move perplexed bail reform advocates who say she could have used her position of power to do more as the top law enforcement official in the state  overseeing thousands of prosecutors who each day requested cash bail for those they charged with crimes  I m glad she s come to the right position now  but it s too late for tens of thousands of Californians  real human beings who have been detained in jail every day in California throughout the whole state  that the attorney general could have stopped   said Phil Telfeyan  one of the plaintiff s attorneys in the bail cases Harris  campaign declined to answer questions about when and why Harris  views on marijuana and bail reform shifted Campaign spokesman Ian Sams noted the political arena  not the courtroom  is the appropriate place to address policy problems  As senator   he said   she has aggressively confronted the policy question by proposing a bipartisan federal law to end cash bail  Simon  the civil rights advocate who worked with Harris  said she often say Harris spoke  privately  in frustration about cash bail and other elements of the criminal justice system while she was a prosecutor  But still  Harris had to work within its confines  Simon said  Prosecutors and lawmakers are different   she said   as a lawmaker  you actually get to make laws  As a prosecutor  you must follow them  Advocates say they re cautiously optimistic about Harris  legislative efforts  and are glad to see the issue in the political spotlight  But they note her bill  which she co wrote with Republican Sen  Rand Paul  endorsed the use of controversial risk assessment tools to determine who should be released from jail and who should remain behind bars Raphling said Harris  office has been receptive to feedback  Still  he said she never indicated a progressive stance on the issue before and her commitment remains to be seen  I give her credit for wanting to tackle bail reform  and people are listening   Raphling said   The question is  and this is an open question  what kind of reform is she going to push     The article has been corrected to fix the title of Cory Booker  to Sen  Cory Booker  

Good Wednesday   Want this by email  Sign up here  How the Murdochs built the world s most influential media empireA lengthy investigation by the NYT Magazine reveals how much power the Murdoch media empire wields around the world   and the fissures that have grown within the family that controls it The Murdochs hold sway over right wing politicians worldwide  President Trump is famously an avid consumer of Fox News  And The Sun  a British tabloid  was one of the most influential voices in favor of Britain s withdrawal from the E U Their power is strongest in Australia  Murdoch properties in the country have both pushed to repeal a carbon tax and helped topple a series of prime ministers Seeing Fox News as an arm of Mr  Trump s White House misses a larger picture   It may be more accurate to say that the White House   just like the prime ministers  offices in Britain and Australia   is just one tool among many that this family use to exert influence over world events  The  clan is fracturing  Lachlan Murdoch  who is now C E O  of the Fox Corporation  which controls the family s remaining holdings  fought the effort to sell most of the company to Disney  He suspected his brother  James  of putting himself above the family  The two now barely speak to each other Several siblings wanted to get out altogether  James and two sisters  Elisabeth and Prudence  offered to sell their holdings in Fox to Lachlan  Rupert Murdoch is said to have encouraged the move  but Lachlan ultimately backed off   raising questions about his commitment to the company Goldman Sachs warms to Saudi

and stocks would be higher and the U S  budget deficit would be rising less    On a March 8 phone call  an unnamed source said  Mr  Trump told Mr  Powell himself   I guess I m stuck with you    Mr

missteps could prove costly for the global economy  Officials have resolved most of the issues standing in the way of a deal to end their long running trade dispute   according to the FT  Later today  Liu He  China s vice premier  is to meet Robert Lighthizer  the U S  trade representative  and Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  to continue discussions Crucial details need to be hashed out   The two sides remain apart on two key issues   the fate of existing U S  levies on Chinese goods  which Beijing wants to see removed  and the terms of an enforcement mechanism demanded by Washington to ensure that China abides by the deal   the FT adds Striking an effective agreement is important  according to Christine Lagarde of the I M F   Nobody wins a trade war   she said in Washington yesterday   That is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system   And the W T O  said that a slowdown in global trade would continue through this year   It is increasingly urgent that we resolve tensions   said Roberto Azevdo  the body s director general If there is a breakthrough  President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could sign a deal as soon as this month  Otherwise  the two countries could extend the negotiations until the G 20 meeting in Japan in late June  the FT says Theresa May will work with the opposition on BrexitPrime

she would ask European leaders for an extension Canceling Brexit is not an option   Closer economic ties with the bloc through a customs union or membership in its single market are up for discussion and even a referendum confirming any deal has not been excluded  Mrs  May s aides said   Mr  Castle and Ms  Barry write But the Labour Party s cooperation   and E U  approval for another delay   are

Imagine that you re sitting in a theater  that you ve been sitting there for 19 hours  with five more to go  Well  not only sitting  At times  you ve been asked by the show s maestro and star  the drag queen and performance artist Taylor Mac  to dash across the room to re enact the Oklahoma Land Rush  or in a ritualized recompense for white flight  to  move to the suburbs  by surrendering your coveted orchestra seat to someone who was stuck in the back  You ve grown used to the surprises of this piece  a 24 hour long concert in which Mac works his way through 246 songs that were popular in America from 1776 to the present  interspersed with a radical narrative of American history  You came expecting that you would be challenged  provoked  entertained   why else sign up for a full day  participatory history lesson administered by a queen who is currently wearing a macram owl with a yellow brick tail  a homage to Judy Garland and the Stonewall riots   a sequined miniskirt  a camouflage cape with cutout psychedelic peace signs and an iridescent Afro space helmet    but you aren t prepared for what comes next The band strikes up a tender ballad  The lights are lowered  and a disco ball drops  You re back at your middle school prom  The song Mac is about to sing  the 1975  Snakeskin Cowboys   by the hard rocker and N R A  board member Ted Nugent  is sinisterly homophobic  warning guys with too fancy shoes to get off the dance floor  But Mac s version   he and his music director  Matt Ray  preserved the lyrics and transformed the music   is romantic and wistful  Mac tells everyone to find a partner of the same sex for a slow dance A Pavlovian self consciousness kicks in  You are 13 again  ungainly and unsure if you have bad breath  Add to that the awkwardness of having to touch a stranger  Add to that the discomfort of dancing with another woman  something you ve never done before  Or if you have done it before   if  in fact  it was your middle school dream to do so openly and without shame   there s the question of whether your partner ever has  and whether she s comfortable with it All over the room  people arrange themselves into pairs  holding one another at a respectful distance  giggling so much that it creates a din  The laughter is cut by Mac s voice  commanding everyone to pull their partner into a real embrace  You feel strange about it  but you do as he asks  because you ve spent a whole day and night in his presence and you trust he s taking you somewhere  You ve even come to trust the people around you  who have undergone this wondrous ordeal of a show with you  The feeling in the room changes again   it s hushed  heating up  Mac s voice  strong and assured  sings   Oh  snakeskin cowboys Who the hell you think you are You re dancing around with your high heeled boots Don t think that should get you far   Same sex couples are locked in hundreds of embraces  People are crying The multilayered drama that Mac creates   of awkwardness yielding to grace  of exhaustion yielding to focus  of strangers yielding to intimacy   is typical of his masterwork   A 24 Decade History of Popular Music   which he made with Ray  along with the costume designer Machine Dazzle  the director Niegel Smith  the dramaturge Jocelyn Clarke and the producers Linda Brumbach and Alisa Regas from Pomegranate Arts  Mac has performed the show in more than 60 cities around the country and will continue to do so   it will have its European debut in Berlin this fall  and he plans to bring it back to New York in 2020 Sometimes Mac performs the piece over two days  sometimes over four  other times over weeks  Only one time has he done it all at once  in 24 hours straight   at St  Ann s Warehouse in Brooklyn in October 2016  just a month before Donald Trump s election   which he vows never to do again  not only because it s so difficult but because knowing that it would happen only once made it sacred  Wesley Morris  The New York Times s critic at large  called the marathon performance  one of the great experiences of my life   Couples have met at the show and made their lives together  The work was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize  and Mac was awarded a MacArthur  genius  grant in 2017 ImageTaylor Mac performing his  A 24 Decade History of Popular Music   From left  1796 1806  Songs Popular in the Pubs   Temperance

intricate  a triumph that insists on   because of its duration  because of the degree to which it involves the audience   moments of failure  You could describe it in 20 different ways without capturing all of its dimensions  It s a retelling of American history through a queer perspective  focused on various communities that have been torn apart by discrimination  land theft  disease  war  migration  and then rebuilt themselves  It s a catalog of popular song  a soundtrack of America s dancing and mourning since the 18th century  It s a confrontation with unsettling artifacts that we ve  forgotten  dismissed or buried   as Mac puts it  like  Massa s in de Cold Ground   a Stephen Foster song from 1852 that imagines slaves weeping at their master s grave  it s also a showcase for songs of protest  like Patti Smith s  People Have the Power   or just plain sexiness  like Prince s  Purple Rain   It s an act of impossible  mind bending virtuosity and endurance  as Mac  backed by a 23 piece band  sings all 246 songs over 24 hours  each hour covering a decade  embodying in his voice the wild variety of American music  brassy  bluesy  comedic  flutelike  operatic  A band member departs each hour  ultimately leaving Mac alone with just his ukulele for the final portion of the show   a metaphor for the AIDS crisis  It s a drag show with costumes so ornate that they become

It s a participatory performance piece that puts pressure on its audience members  breaking them down and building them back up by essentially asking them to co create the show Mac s own description of his ambition is deceptively simple   All I m trying to do is to get the audience to consider things   perpetually    Consideration  is one of Mac s favorite words  He s asking  through the sheer force and ingenuity and joy of his performances  that the audience stop on the threshold of judgment and dwell with him in the realm of uncertainty  His hope is that someone might be still mulling the ideas from his shows years  or even decades  later  Every single audience I ve gotten to do it   except one   he said  describing the queer prom   The earnest dream is that they will consider what it means to slow dance with someone of their same gender  But more importantly  it s that they consider whether or not they were able to   The moment is  in part  Mac s gift to the queer people in the room  It might be a salve for their memories of isolated longing  it might be  as Mac put it  the first time  many of them have seen straight people stretch toward queerness  where it wasn t mocking or some kind of ridicule  So it can be very  very  very moving   But that s not the goal  Moving is never the goal  Mac is after something more radical than cozy catharsis  He won t allow the audience to settle ImageMac in  A 24 Decade History   Clockwise from top left  1926 1936  Songs Popular During the Depression  from the New York Live Arts performance  1946 1956  Songs Popular With White

maybe you re not going to be safe   Mac told me recently  This month  he ll be bringing that sense of danger to Broadway  with his new play   Gary  A Sequel to Titus Andronicus   Mac is not performing in it   Nathan Lane stars as the play s title character  a clown in the waning days of the Roman Empire who aspires to be a fool  and George C  Wolfe directs   but it bears all the marks of a Taylor Mac production  high spectacle  profound emotion juxtaposed with outr humor  verbal acrobatics and a searching ethical drive Over ginger tea  in the compact  elegant apartment he shares with his husband in Manhattan  Mac explained to me the series of bizarre events that led to the creation of  Gary   Onstage  Mac  who is 45  has an almost shamanistic grandeur and a skewering wit  But folded into a chair  in jeans and a simple sweater  he was gentle and attentive  He has sharp blue eyes and a serene  unfazed smile   simultaneously unsurprisable yet open to surprise Two weeks after his marathon performance of  A 24 Decade History  in Brooklyn  he returned to California  where he grew up  to care for his mother  who was dying of breast cancer  She was a Christian Scientist  and she believed  as Mac put it  that humans are a perfect reflection of God    so we can t get sick  because God can t get sick   Mac and his sister flew home to do hospice work  everything from arranging pillows to holding her through her pain  without being able to acknowledge to her that she was dying  It was a bewildering yet familiar experience of repression  growing up in her household  it was only permissible to feel  certain things  but not the whole range   Shortly before she died  Trump was elected president A few months later  Mac was in Mexico  where he and his husband like to spend time  trying to process all that had happened  They were warned to stay out of the water because a tourist had been pulled out to sea by the strong current and disappeared  Mac went running on the beach early one morning when he came upon the washed up body  The consecutive horrors that he experienced   his mother s denial of reality  even in death  and then this corpse appearing out of the ocean   converged with his despair over the election  his sense that  we are living in a revenge tragedy that s trying to be a comedy that isn t succeeding   He was thinking about sequels  the ways in which American history repeats its cycles of progress and retrenchment  Mac set himself a challenge  Could he take everything that was ugly  grotesque  dispiriting in the world  put it onstage and transform it The result is  Gary   Mac s 14th play  many of his earlier works have been performed in New York and internationally  including  The Be a st of Taylor Mac    The Lily s Revenge  and  Hir     Gary  is a ribald comedy set in the aftermath of the massacre that ends Shakespeare s notoriously violent  Titus Andronicus   Mac has taken three minor characters from the original   a clown  a maid and a midwife   and placed them center stage  The curtain opens on a gigantic mound of corpses in the deposed emperor s banquet hall  which is being used as a makeshift morgue  Bodies are piled chaotically around the space   half clothed  exposed  somehow both gruesome and hilarious  Gary  a street clown who comes from generations of clowns  has just narrowly escaped execution by volunteering to help clean up the mess left by all the killing  He enters the stage brimming with excitement at his promotion to maid  his secret aspiration to become a person of consequence suddenly unleashed  In the banquet hall  he meets Janice  an old acquaintance  who has spent her life as a maid at court and is running the improvised morgue  She s a no nonsense  stalwart sort of woman who has managed to hold on to her job through coups and rapes and usurpations of all sorts  The two immediately clash As Janice demonstrates the gruesome work  they must process each body by pressing out all the flatulence and suctioning out blood and feces through a primitive tubing system   Gary muses about all the reasons they shouldn t do it  Why must they be cogs in the conflicts of the powerful  Isn t there some other way  A raucous argument ensues  about revolution versus incrementalism  the power of satire versus the power of straight talk  the question of whether they should simply get the job done or abandon it altogether  Gary confesses that his lifelong dream is to become a fool   the sort of comedian who uses his wits to tell powerful men the truth about themselves  It has suddenly dawned on him that he is an artist  and much to Janice s disgust  he occasionally breaks into dreamy rhyming couplets  He suggests that they use the bodies as the basis for a performance  or what he proudly calls  a fooling   He challenges Janice to unlock whatever passions lie buried inside her to join him in an act of subversive creation Wolfe  the director  says what he loves about the play is  how fragile emotions and ridiculous situations and a slightly absurdist truth can all share the same space  That  at any given moment  is American madness    Gary  is very funny  but it s also sincere  a play about people who are trying to devise a new way to clean up violence and destruction that is not of their making A few weeks before the previews of  Gary   I sat with Mac in the balcony of the Booth Theater  observing the organized chaos onstage  The corpses  grayish  sandbag like forms  were piled on a 14 foot wooden structure with a staircase traversing it  Bodies were draped  flung  stacked on top of it  some with their legs splayed  revealing their genitals  About a dozen people stood around looking at the pile  A stagehand was constructing a butt and attaching it to one of the bodies near the front  Wolfe lounged in the lap of a corpse and gesticulated expressively as he talked with the set designer  Santo Loquasto  A few moments later  Loquasto removed a part of a leg from one of the bodies and handed it to an assistant who had materialized from behind a side curtain and then promptly disappeared It was funny  but also poignant  to see a group of people pondering the logistics of this huge pile of bodies and delicately ministering to it  It was also a real life enactment of the question that the characters in the play endlessly debate  What do we do with a situation that is grotesque and unworkable and make of it something wondrous  To answer it  Mac arms them with pretty much every tool human beings have at their disposal  slapstick humor  collaboration  revolutionary zeal and poetry Mac s aesthetic is proudly maximalist  it s not just a style but a system of ethics   I make a lot of work that has heterogeneity in it   genre  forms  style all squished together   he said  He finds the trend of stripped down minimalism that has taken hold   whether in design  in fashion  in tech and especially in theater   suspect   Subtlety is a privilege   he said  When I asked him what he meant  he explained   The trend of subtlety in the theater is one of people who didn t have to shout in the streets and do direct action protest in order to stay alive because the government was refusing to acknowledge the AIDS epidemic  Like  Larry Kramer is not subtle  right  So that s what I mean  Subtlety is a privilege  And so when I go to the theater and I see people being subtle  I m like  Oh  great  what do you  expletive  want  What are the stakes  What are you risking  His tone  which was usually even  became agitated  But then he started to complicate the idea   I like maximalism because minimalism is in it  This play    he meant  Gary     seems like so much and crazy  crazy  crazy  but there are moments of total stillness in this play  But when you go and see a play where it s all subtle  subtle  subtle  there s no moment of praise  In the play  Gary gives a beautiful speech about noticing the sky for the first time in his life   he wonders not so much at the sky but at his own capacity for wonder  Its simplicity is arresting amid all the gore  like a breeze blowing through the morgue  When you don t see maximalism   Mac continued   I just always feel like you re not really giving it all to me  You re hiding  You re hiding from me  Because I know there s craze in your life  It drives me crazy in the theater because     Mac was animated again   You go to the theater to see a part of yourself you haven t seen before  Mac was reticent when I asked him about his early life  hesitant to put forward the story of a queer kid who overcomes obstacles  because  we ve heard that five million times   It is what happened to him  but he was much more interested in talking about ideas  his work  how he  found my way to love   He was brought up by his mother  an art teacher  his father died when he was 4   She was complex and contradictory   encouraging his creativity and squashing it  He described her as loving  but  she didn t always understand what that meant  She had a sentimental concept of love   She found his gayness terrifying  They lived in Stockton  a conservative  conformist place  and Mac stood out for being theatrical and effeminate  It was the  80s  a time when  queerness was a national conversation because of AIDS  but a negative national conversation  So it was really present in the consciousness of a lot of people  but not in a nice way  When he was 9  Mac got involved in the local children s theater run by a man who had attended Juilliard and was a dynamo and a sophisticate  There he met his three best friends   Marcy  Kat and John  all of whom were queer but not yet out   and they became his chosen family  If his home life was repressive  the world he created with them was openhearted  intellectually curious and supportive  They are still close In 1987  when he was 14  he and Marcy went to San Francisco to attend the AIDS Walk  It was only an hour and a half s drive from Stockton but felt like a world apart  Seeing thousands of gay people marching in the street was thrilling   I d never seen an out homosexual before   Mac told me   I hadn t seen them on TV  I hadn t seen them in movies  I never met one   He was overjoyed  but the scene was also devastating  Amid the displays of celebration and pride were hundreds of people dying of AIDS  their partners and friends pushing them in wheelchairs   It was ironically more beautiful than anything I d ever encountered   Mac said   because I knew that my family wasn t going to rally around me if I was ever dying of AIDS  I mean  my sister would  but my extended family wasn t going to be pushing me in a wheelchair  fighting for my rights  They just would have been ashamed   It was his first experience of what he called  real love  not the pretend love that family often claims   It also introduced Mac to an idea that would become a fulcrum of his work  using your brokenness to build All through high school  he and Marcy would drive to San Francisco  sometimes just to walk around for a few hours  They weren t able to articulate it at the time  but they longed to be among other gay people  to see a possible future for themselves He eventually made it out of Stockton  to San Francisco  and a few years later to New York City  where he enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts  Students were given free tickets to the theater  and Mac went to shows at least four nights a week  seeing everything from lavish Broadway productions to obscure basement experiments  But there was one show he returned to more than 40 times  Bill Irwin and David Shiner s  Fool Moon   a series of clowning vignettes  Mac was particularly fixated on one bit when Shiner called up several audience members to participate in the making of a silent film  Two people would play a pair of lovers  another a murderous  jilted husband  and Shiner would direct them in a scene  Seeing this night after night  Mac noticed that Shiner had developed  a Rolodex of possibilities    dozens of strategies for handling the people he invited onstage  depending on their reactions  It was improvisation guided by mastery   And what I noticed about the audience was that even the smell in the room would get different   Mac said   When he would call the people up onstage  everyone would lean forward  and people would start to get nervous in the room for the people on the stage  And I thought  That s super fascinating  Mac wanted to scale this kind of interaction  How could he take that frisson of excitement  nervousness and collaboration that was happening to those few people onstage and make it happen to an entire room  How could he treat the audience like living sculpture  At a baseball game  everyone stands up  cheers  sings  directs their energy toward the ritual of rooting for a team  Couldn t that same infectious sense of community be coaxed out of an audience in a theater Mac s ideas about how to provoke and mold an audience developed over years of performing in drag clubs all over the city  a scene he was drawn to out of  two parts desperation  two parts joy  two parts circumstance   He wanted to be an actor but was rarely cast   and often he couldn t even get as far as the audition room  He had all kinds of  survival jobs   including  like Gary and Janice  cleaning  The clubs would take anyone  so he started performing there  He was drawn to what he called  monster drag    not female impersonation but grotesque costumes   people pulling Nutella out of diapers and stuff like that    and absurd storytelling  His costumes were handmade  fanciful and bizarre   he d wrap himself in wire and electrical tape  paint himself green and smear his makeup so that he looked deranged  but then out of his mouth would come expert cabaret singing  He liked embodying the contrast between mess and perfection In the clubs  anything could happen  Like Irwin and Shiner  Mac developed a Rolodex for dealing with audience members of all stripes   hecklers  homophobes  hams  Sometimes a couple would be having sex in one corner of the club while he was performing  distracting the audience  Mac would descend the stage and waltz over to sing right near them  stealing the thunder back for himself  When he returned to the stage  all eyes were on him again  He called this strategy  incorporating the calamity    Gary s scheme to make a spectacle out of the corpses in the new play is a variation of this same idea   One night  Mac was competing in a drag competition against a run of the mill female impersonator who was lip syncing  badly  At the end of her number  she pulled out a set of false teeth  to reveal that she had only two teeth of her own underneath  The audience  including Mac  went wild  electrified by her authentic display   She was like   I m not afraid of you  I m not afraid of being vulnerable  I m not afraid of what I really look like  I came in here showing you something that you think is beautiful  let me show you what real beauty is  being brave     He saw that if he wanted to gain the trust of an audience  he would have to sacrifice something authentic of his own  to lay himself bare Dressing in drag is Mac s way of doing this  When I once made the mistake of calling his drag a  persona   or a character he plays  he promptly corrected me   I m just exposing what I look like on the inside   Wearing jeans and a T shirt is his way of hiding  drag is the opposite   it s revealing  with tremendous confidence and panache  who he really is  and making room for the audience to be as odd and authoritative and mischievous and exposed as he is Together with the artist Machine Dazzle  whom he met around 2000 in the clubs and who designs all his costumes  Mac has created his own subgenre of drag  more poetry than clothing  bristling with juxtapositions and winks and historical and artistic allusions  Their sensibility is so intertwined that Mac often doesn t see Dazzle s designs until the moment before going onstage  Dazzle explained the origins of his own maximalism  the costumes are a place to put all the ideas that he has been storing since childhood  when  like Mac  he had to suppress many of his interests and desires   I just had ways of putting things away for a later date   Dazzle told me  There s a bottomless well of creative power that comes from having been told not to be yourself ImageMac on the  Gary  set CreditMickalene Thomas for The New York TimesMost days Mac listens to Nina Simone  One icy afternoon in December  he put on a favorite song of hers   Wild Is the Wind   a cabaret standard about an abandoned lover  He was perched on the edge of his sofa  and when the song began  he folded his arms and legs  making himself small  and began to listen raptly  Simone s version is slower than most  and she sings the first line  Love me love me love me  say you do  in an agony of longing  extending the notes and allowing them to go flat   See   Mac said   She s under pitch  She s heartbroken   She could do anything  he explained  but she chooses not to sometimes  As she continues to sing    Let me fly away with you  for my love is like the wind  and wild is the wind    her voice quakes and quavers  even as she keeps extending the notes  singing slowly as if she s tasting her own pain Mac loves Nina Simone s voice   finds endless new expressive possibilities in it   precisely because of the way she veers off key  One day  years ago  he asked himself why he is so drawn to that quality  He realized that she s  telling stories that aren t always on pitch  you know  Nina s singing about inequality  And heartbreak   Simone is one of the artists Mac draws inspiration from in his lifelong project  taking devastation and making something new Toward the end of  Gary   the argument between Janice and Gary culminates in a line that Gary spits out  risking alienating Janice by insulting her livelihood   Cleaning is immoral   he cries  This is not just the raving of a clown who doesn t want to do dirty work  what he s discovered is just how dehumanizing their job really is  They are maintenance workers being asked to maintain the status quo   to clean up the mess left by murderous rulers before anyone has time to think about what it s doing there in the first place  Cleaning obscures  It creates closure where there should be questioning In  Gary   the metaphor of cleaning is made literal  but it s a leitmotif in all of Mac s work  a preference for flat notes  jagged edges and what he calls  authentic failure   He objects to tidiness in all its forms   his costumes  grand as they are  are often built to fray and shed  glitter littering the stage  he accepts that his big voice  over 24 hours of  A 24 Decade History   will thin into a plaintive growl  his telling of American history preserves songs of cruelty and subjugation alongside anthems of love  Failure  for Mac  can be a kind of offering  What do we make out of what is given Mac is not a crier  but listening to Simone  his eyes filled with tears  Underneath her elongated vocal notes is her jittery  chaotic piano playing that makes you feel the instability of her condition  But then the song changes for a moment   You re spring to me  all things to me   she sings  and then lets out a sigh  or maybe even a grunt  that is rueful and a little acerbic  Mac shook his head admiringly   Just when you think you know who she is   you re like  Oh  she s this vulnerable creature   she s tough   And then  almost immediately  the ache returns in the next lines Her brokenness is her wit and her strength  It has pointed Mac toward a workable path in the world   That s inspiring to me   he said quietly   that you would use your vulnerability and your imperfection as a way to get to the truth   

Gail Collins  Happy April  Bret  Since we re past Fools  Day  I will avoid any wisecracks about Donald Trump Where are you on the Mueller report  Ready to consign it to the dustbin of history  Demanding to see the full document  I have to admit I m sort of ready to give up and move on  Although you could definitely talk me back into the fold Bret Stephens  Four thoughts  Gail First  Thank God the president of the United States  whatever else we may think of him  did not collude with Russia to get himself elected  I d rather have a scoundrel in the White House than a traitor Gail  You re setting the bar pretty low there  but you re still right Bret  Second  Thank God we have a report at all   which  considering the vindication it brings Trump  and the vindictiveness it brings out of him    would not have happened if the Trumpists had gotten their way and Mueller had been fired  All of those conservatives who impugned Mueller s integrity and his team s impartiality owe them a giant apology Gail  Not holding my breath waiting  Go on Bret  Third  Thank God for Mueller himself  He didn t pontificate on the Sunday talk shows the way Jim Comey or Adam Schiff did  He didn t pull any punches when it came to prosecuting the likes of Paul Manafort  He ran a tight ship  He demonstrated that even in Washington there is no substitute for character  professionalism and reputation  That s why I suspect that when the full document is released  we ll be able to treat it as the last word on the subject Finally  The news media  especially cable news  needs to do some major soul searching  Too many reporters and pundits got way out ahead of their skis  creating a collusion narrative out of a series of unconnected dots  When historians examine why public confidence in journalism fell to such lows in our era  episodes like Russiagate will be a major part of the story Gail  You didn t have to believe Trump was actively engaged in a conspiracy to point out a whole lot of unnerving stuff going on  For instance  there s still a terrible potential for Russian sabotage via internet that this administration isn t taking seriously Bret  For sure  There was a lot of smoke  There were plenty of dots  The investigation was warranted  The president repeatedly behaved in ways that suggested guilt  from lying about his business ties to Russia to seizing his translator s notes after a conversation with Vladimir Putin to his cavalier attitude about Russia s intentions The media was right to report all this and raise questions  But there was also a lack of skepticism about some of the evidence  and a tone of certitude about where that evidence was bound to lead Gail  I ll give you the whole impeachment thing  That was perhaps over the top  But we re still waiting to hear the results of investigations into Trump   mainly his business practices   that are still going on here in New York Bret  I agree in the sense that I think his behavior as  Individual No  1  in the payoffs to former paramours are felony violations of campaign finance laws  But I m also becoming increasingly convinced that the endless investigations into Trump s past business practices are going to wind up doing more harm to Trump s opponents than they do to him  It makes him look like the victim of an endless inquest into his pre presidential behavior  And it distracts Democrats from talking about the things that Americans actually want from politicians  like better schools and a growing economy Gail  Glad you brought that up  I m way more interested in the attack on Obamacare than his unappetizing history in real estate What s your opinion on where to go with health care  I will start by acknowledging Obamacare is sort of a mess  It began as a mess because certain senators  cough  mutter  Joe Lieberman  were too deeply in the thrall of the insurance companies to let a sane restructuring occur Bret  Music to my ears  Gail  Obamacare is a mess  even if most Americans have learned to live with it  as we do with other messes   If it weren t a mess  Democrats wouldn t keep talking about  Medicare for all  as the next evolution in health care policy I think that s a huge mistake  both as a matter of policy and politics  It requires another major reorganization of a huge part of the U S  economy  Take Bernie Sanders s plan  for example  It s going to cost a bundle   an estimated  32 6 trillion over 10 years   and the taxes to fund it will have to come from middle class Americans  It will mean a declining quality of health care  And it will lead to a two tier system in which wealthy Americans go  off grid  to get high quality medical attention while the rest of the country is stuck in a system that will resemble the V A Trump will also be merciless about this  politically  claiming that this is just the sort of socialism he warned about in his State of the Union speech  And it will frighten a great many voters  including those all important suburban women  who might despise the president for all kinds of reasons but fear the Democrats are veering toward the Bernie Sanders left Gail  All the Democratic presidential candidates are not talking about Medicare for all  Some of the ones who did are trying to backpedal  not really having thought about what it meant before they went there  Three fifths of the adult population from 19 to 64 get their health insurance from employers  and a lot of them like it  They re going to get very nervous if they think they might have to give it up But we need sweeping change  Our current health care system is wildly expensive because it s structured in a crazy way that creates piles and piles of stupendously expensive paperwork  We could create a government run public policy option that would give people the security of Obamacare without the crazy structure  And gradually  if the option was attractive enough  employers might want to get in on it  too Bret  I definitely agree about the paperwork problem  My own views about health care are pretty libertarian  We need radical price transparency so that people are aware of the huge disparities in price between say  a blood test from Clinic A versus Clinic B  We need tort reform so that doctors don t live in mortal fear of being sued by patients  We need more than just gold  silver and bronze insurance options  Healthy young people should also be able to buy cut rate plans that cover only catastrophes  As for Medicare  the long term goal should be to get rid of it  That s obviously distinct from Medicaid  Even crazy right wingers like me believe that government has a moral duty to ensure that poor people have good access to quality medical care from womb to tomb Gail  Doctors do have to pay heavy insurance premiums to protect themselves from lawsuits  But patients also have to be protected from careless or inept physicians  It s tough to find a perfect solution   people have been trying for years  But fine by me if you want to work on it  Bret  I ll be cheering from the galleries Bret  The deeper problem with all of these health care debates is that we re discussing something that inevitably generates bad outcomes even under the best of circumstances  But can we switch subjects from tragedy to farce  I m curious to know your take on the Jussie Smollett story  which is what everyone I know was talking about last week  when they weren t talking about Mueller  Gail  You do have to thank the guy for taking Donald Trump off our minds  Not every day do you have a TV star making up a story of being attacked by MAGA hat wearing racist thugs  Everybody was stunned when the prosecutor dropped all the charges  She basically said  well  this is what we always do with first offenders who don t pose a threat to the community Not sure that would be true of first offenders whose self promoting lies and evasions cost the city six figures in overtime  But it s a good reminder that we have different criminal justice systems for the poor and the nonpoor Bret  I would not have minded if Smollett had gotten off relatively lightly   provided  that is  that he had admitted the charges  shown contrition and begged forgiveness  It s the arrogance and gall that bothers me  Kim Foxx  the Chicago prosecutor  says her office would have had a hard time securing a conviction  Was Smollett s check to the perpetrators and their confession of the crime not enough  The whole thing reeks of a corrupt bargain  and I hope the Department of Justice gets involved  Even Chicago can t afford Chicago style politics By the way  I don t want us to wrap up the conversation without complimenting you on your marvelous column about statues  specifically their scandalous dearth when it comes to honoring women  I m thrilled Billie Holiday will be getting one soon  in Queens  There are many more worthy would be honorees that I can think of  Gerty Cori was the first American woman to win a Nobel in science  Zora Neale Hurston ought to have one  too  if she doesn t already  And Dorothy Parker  provided the statue itself had a ribald sense of humor Who else should we be honoring Gail  Thanks  Bret  Right now  only five of the 150 public statues in New York are of women   we ve got dozens of ethically compromised politicians and run of the mill generals but we re only now working on Susan B  Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton Once we ve gotten the public figures taken care of  it d be nice to celebrate some low profile heroines  I was just reading about Esther Lewis  a widow who had a farm in Pennsylvania in the pre Civil War era  She ran a stop on the Underground Railroad that sheltered runaway slaves  discovered iron ore on her property and created a serious mining operation  educated her four daughters and churned nearly 300 pounds of butter a year  There s somebody I d like to see standing in a town square The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor
