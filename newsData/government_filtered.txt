ownership far flung network closely held businesses fanned suspicions something hide might lawmakers find obtain Trump tax filings For starters recent returns illuminate sources income tax avoidance strategies may used fully decode family personal business finances Leaked pages president old tax returns financial documents already shed light finances They indicate Trump likely avoided paying income taxes number years periods The New York Times found participated fraudulent tax schemes minimize tax bill His federal ethics filings show hundreds millions dollars outstanding loans business network owned web corporate entities The House Ways Means Committee last week requested six years Trump personal tax returns along returns filed one trusts seven subsidiaries controls They asked records audits The returns partly reveal sources president income whether businesses profitable They show much anything Trump paying taxes might show whether aggressive reducing tax bills They show whether Trump personally donated charity The returns requested committee however fully answer longstanding questions identities Trump business partners ultimate sources income whether entangled entities interests administration Even Representative Richard Neal Democrat Massachusetts leads committee successful mean tax returns become public law supposed remain solely hands committee

Organization golf properties paid Russian money Eric Trump denied making statement While Trump federal filings reported outstanding loans investments income business include debts partial interest older loans paid theory existence older loans lenders behind disclosed historical tax returns certain types interest debts tax deductible reality much information unlikely contained limited number returns requested Congress The panel seeking returns small number Trump companies But controls hundreds separate contain individual businesses varied particular building rights license name overseas Each one businesses may file tax return separate ones requested committee How exactly Trump make money Trump owns operates businesses United States overseas earns revenue golf club memberships leasing

disclosures show business actually lost million year Trump returns provide detail profitability businesses More broadly tax returns compared ethics disclosures check accuracy filings Trump personal tax returns itemize stock bond market transactions people institutions receiving income domestic foreign This include income received banks Trump cheating taxes Democrats get Trump taxes looking aggressive illegal maneuvers fraudulent tactics used past Sophisticated tax filers use returns paint picture finances government see usually takes lot digging find going behind numbers For example The New York Times reported last year Trump siblings set sham corporation early 1990s disguise millions dollars gifts parents case The Times access far tax returns relied confidential business filings public records information sources document fraud time article published lawyer president Charles Harder allegations fraud tax evasion 100 percent false highly defamatory What immediately apparent

quite bit She questions legality She questions practicality public going respond And lot reservations moving forward But ultimately agreed policy introduced formal way April archived recording 1Quit separating kids They separating children President kids Don kids President archived recording believe This America This country This archived recording kirstjen nielsen This administration create policy separating families border archived recordingShame everybody separates children allows stay side border fearing death allow secretary come lie archived recording kirstjen nielsen Calling liar fighting words liar never policy family separation And let clear American commit crime anywhere United States jail separated family This controversial idea caitlin dickersonInternally resisting certainly questioning slowing lot policies And externally public defend really look face ends something actually job michael barbaroAnd remind ends happening family separation policy caitlin dickersonSo President Trump stopped practice signing executive order archived recording donald trump consider important executive order keeping families together caitlin dickersonBut matter days later federal judge intervened deemed practice unconstitutional stop archived recordingFamilies separated result Trump administration zero tolerance policy reunited within days The order says kids must back parents within days caitlin dickersonSo sort resounding disavowal policy michael barbaroBy legal system caitlin dickersonExactly And even though pushed back Secretary Nielsen ends taking blame michael barbaroSo another example something expresses internal qualms goes defends publicly caitlin dickersonSo one next policies introduced idea limit asylum pretty significantly people apply showed legal port entry whereas beforehand people often show anywhere along border present border agency ask protection ushered legal process The idea say anymore You show specific office course pretty tall order somebody coming Central America maybe cell phone maybe whole lot resources They always know exactly offices exist archived recording kirstjen nielsen You need break law country entering illegally claim asylum seeking asylum port entry caitlin dickersonBut Nielsen pointed president hard justify immigration law explicitly says request asylum regardless enter michael barbaroSo Nielsen saying inside White House hey might legal reservations But nevertheless gets implemented And decider signs caitlin dickersonExactly And important point Nielsen pushed back President Trump reflection liberal immigration sympathetic view toward asylum seekers She happened face entire agency full people work immigration enforcement still made clear going legal logistical roadblocks putting ideas place michael barbaroAnd happens port entry policy limit number locations people apply asylum caitlin dickersonVery quickly blocked federal courts remains way archived recordingA district court ruled ban conflicts immigration law caitlin dickersonSo executive branch trying clearly contradict laws approved legislative branch archived recordingAnd Supreme Court refused step unblock ban michael barbaroSo legal reservations well founded words advice president correct even ignored caitlin dickersonThat right Her analysis sound time pushed back right And ideas blocked michael barbaroDo policies describing family separation limiting locations people seek asylum succeed curbing flow migrants even short period time place legally challenged caitlin dickersonThey archived recordingNew numbers show 400 percent 400 percent increase last year caitlin dickersonLast October saw record number families seek asylum United States This family separation introduced And every month since numbers gotten even higher archived recordingC officials say Border Patrol agents pace apprehensions encounters 100 000 migrants March michael barbaroSo policies blocked court short bit time ever place job limiting flow migrants caitlin dickersonThey The numbers keep going And people argue maybe policies left place long enough show concrete outcome know sure But know policies Nielsen pushing back saying going work work And numbers continued rise michael barbaroAnd president relationship Nielsen She sense vindicated problem solve getting worse caitlin dickersonShe simultaneously sort vindicated look legal standpoint relationship standpoint face President Trump eyes failures archived recording 1Kirstjen Nielsen appears shaky ground That according New York Times report Nielsen told colleagues close resigning Wednesday berated president front entire cabinet archived recording 2Nothing sets immigration told meeting Wednesday cabinet room heated incredibly heated She spoke back tried defend caitlin dickersonSo context policies introduced blocked courts number people crossing border rising Trump relationship Secretary Nielsen falling apart comes aggressive idea yet archived recordingAnother day another threat President Trump today threatening shut southern border caitlin dickersonWhere wants completely seal border 100 percent Not let anybody come archived recording donald trump And stop closing border close keep closed long time playing games michael barbaroAnd exactly work caitlin dickersonWell assume president particular policy mind tweeted wanted seal border assume though talking example cargo moving back forth people actual visas permission come United States really talking shutting asylum shutting ability people previously permission come United States And policy know come closest achieving goal one kicking around Washington months get rid asylum know longer allow anyone apply asylum United States And instead people needed status wanted status stay home country similar way Syrian refugees apply come United States apply home wait many months lots vetting background checks approved allowed come michael barbaroAnd guess extreme version limiting asylum literally telling people come country apply asylum caitlin dickersonI think extreme version think idea means eliminating asylum goes away michael barbaroAnd best understand Secretary Nielsen response idea caitlin dickersonFrom know similar way reacted family separation idea significantly limit asylum ports entry going challenged courts immediately going huge lift get policy introduced work logistics naught enjoined courts And oppositional resistant stance walks White House meeting president unclear threw hands first second whether know president leave option least decided going work You And end night And means homeland security secretary oversaw controversial aggressive immigration policies country ever seen even aggressive enough President Trump And gone looking replacement even michael barbaroWe right back Caitlin president turning replace Nielsen looks somebody willing caitlin dickersonHe turning Kevin McAleenan currently head United States Customs Border Protection That agency oversees customs officers meet airport gone vacation abroad Border Patrol Those police boots ground along border And McAleenan known sort policy wonk really smart reasonable guy willing work Democrats somebody served President Obama well got years experience agency People know reasonable guy But dig little bit deeper McAleenan inspired get homeland security work right And especially recently overseeing agency really became known sort policy engine center coming ways turn President Trump ideas actual policies carried agency run Washington overseeing work McAleenan staff members actually physically taking children away parents physically turning asylum seekers away border telling elsewhere wait line moving role got even power think expect continue take President Trump ideas sort extreme necessarily encumbered immigration laws norms history try translate something practical introduced ground michael barbaroSo even though might seem moderate first glance actually someone president trusts put restrictive maybe even extreme policies practice And involved already Now elevated even higher level caitlin dickersonExactly michael barbaroAnd guess makes sense Nielsen seen reluctant put policies practice president turn somebody willing caitlin dickersonThat right willing try But remember McAleenan going run exact legal framework logistical challenges anybody else role going michael barbaroRight policies going run legal trouble courts regardless leading agency matter end leader Department Homeland Security gung President policies reluctantly saying yes Nielsen caitlin dickersonI think look question couple different ways one hand right going make huge difference sitting office head Homeland Security Department matter introduce violates immigration law going wind court But another way looking family separation existed official sort policy days zero tolerance Not long period time end But still think many people going argue family separation small thing something affect many people mean think huge impact think hawk running Homeland Security Department even sort encumbered existing legal framework make pretty big changes even ultimately changes wind court think Kevin McAleenan two things going President Trump eyes The first knows policies knows situation ground back hand And second thing shown willingness follow President Trump lead may person best positioned come legal ways achieve President Trump goals And even policies comes remain place long term might least exist long enough give President Trump something point show supporters ask campaign promises Where idea sealing border significantly decreasing number immigrants coming United States michael barbaroSo even policies ultimately blocked courts feels important president someone Department Homeland Security willing try may enough caitlin dickersonI think President Trump heart hearts right hope find somebody willing try somebody going succeed wants aggressive policies instituted long term But think better mind nothing somebody willing try And know politically better nothing president point policies tried introduce courts blocked Congress blocked michael barbaroRight intention Somebody else fault working caitlin dickersonExactly least attempt meet campaign promises point voters ask made significant change think aggressive leader place willing introduce policies get stuck courts allows Trump blame courts rather administration getting way say look tried judges blocking whereas judges blocking Secretary Nielsen michael barbaroIf Congress going change law think assumption going anytime soon comes basic immigration law president right suggest current system broken way fix test new ideas even push boundaries law caitlin dickersonI say yes first part question Most people agree system broken But comes fixing problem trying fix president mind problem vast number people coming seek asylum His idea fix decrease number But people see problem people coming seek asylum ways dealing space place people physically custody enter judges hear cases years years see problem michael barbaroHe really addressing caitlin dickersonHe addressing problems think lot people agree president concerned come better systems processing asylum seekers make organized efficient cases comfortable encourage people come And numbers see problem making system better makes worse michael barbaroCaitlin tell President Trump plans immigration caitlin dickersonI think shows President Trump going continue full steam ahead achieve immigration goals people even informed career officials stand way going pushed committed goal limiting number people come border regardless many legal challenges already faced sure come public reaction things notwithstanding seeing signs slowing think week actually indicator
