Senate Democrats  including several of the party s presidential candidates  have savaged President Trump for proposing to reduce Medicare spending by several hundred billion dollars over the next decade  Senator Kamala Harris of California said the proposed changes in Medicare  would hurt our seniors   Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tweeted   The Trump administration wants to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the  Medicare budget  all while giving billionaires and giant corporations huge tax breaks   The Hawaii senator Brian Schatz  the rare Democrat who is not running for president  offered the following summary   One party wants to expand Medicare and Medicaid  and the other wants to cut them  But some cuts to Medicare make sense  Several sought by Mr  Trump closely resemble cuts that had been proposed by President Barack Obama  And the indiscriminate attacks by Senate Democrats are a reminder of how hard it has become for Congress to perform even the most basic kinds of prudent housekeeping in the public interest When Americans with Medicare visit a doctor s office  the federal government pays a higher fee if that office happens to be owned by a hospital  This bonus payment serves no obvious purpose  A federal advisory board created to monitor Medicare spending has called for its elimination  And this month  the Trump administration proposed the change in its 2020 budget  along with several other measures recommended by nonpartisan experts to reduce payments to service providers without directly affecting the cost or availability of care  In total  Mr  Trump s budget would cut proposed Medicare spending by  845 billion over the next decade  About a third of that money would come from moving funding for certain programs to other parts of the federal budget  and pruning  so the actual reduction in spending would be in the neighborhood of  600 billion  The largest chunk of those cuts would come at the expense of hospitals that are paid more than independent doctors  offices to treat patients  The two rate system has its roots in the real differences between a hospital and a doctor s office  Hospitals tend to treat less healthy patients  they provide a safety net of related services if something goes wrong  and they must comply with more stringent rules  But that line was warped as hospitals acquired physicians  offices  taking advantage of their eligibility to collect larger payments from Medicare  Also  advances in medical technology have increased the range of services that can be provided outside a traditional hospital In 2015  Congress sought to stem the trend by barring higher payments to any new offices acquired or established by hospitals   but existing practices were grandfathered in The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  a federal panel created in 1997 to provide advice on Medicare spending  has recommended the end of that exemption  The White House budget estimates the change would save  28 7 billion between 2020 and 2029  A pair of more complex but related changes intended to equalize billing for procedures including medical imaging and drug management would save  240 billion more over the same period Hospitals understandably dislike these proposals  and there may well be a better dividing line  It s also possible that in some cases  the federal government should pay higher fees to private practices rather than pay lower fees to hospital affiliates  The administration s budget contains only a thumbnail sketch of its own ideas  and the details clearly matter But Democrats are not debating the details  Instead  a proposal to improve the efficiency of health care spending is being treated as an attack on the availability of health care This is not a new phenomenon  of course  The Affordable Care Act included substantial reductions in Medicare spending  Those cuts  like Mr  Trump s proposals  came mostly at the expense of providers rather than patients  But Republicans chose to attack the changes in language strikingly similar to the language Democrats have used in recent weeks Both parties have fallen into the unfortunate habit of characterizing every proposal to reduce Medicare spending as an attack on the program s beneficiaries  In fact  careful stewardship of spending is necessary to ensure the program can help as many people as possible Mr  Trump is guilty of contradicting his campaign promise that he would not seek to cut Medicare spending  But it is the promise that was irresponsible  not the budget proposal Some items on Mr  Trump s list of proposed savings have obvious downsides  For example  he has proposed to cut federal spending by increasing the annual amount that several hundred thousand Medicare beneficiaries are required to pay for needed medications  The budget also proposes large cuts in Medicaid that would reduce the availability of health care for many lower income and disabled Americans But a president s budget is just a list of ideas  It s up to Congress to pick the good ones Support for past cuts in Medicare spending was driven in part by concerns about the growth of the federal debt  Both parties lately have taken a more relaxed view of the government s borrowing capacity  in part because apocalyptic predictions about the current level of federal debt look rather silly in retrospect  But the government s ability to borrow money is not a justification for the wasteful spending of tax dollars Maintaining tight control of Medicare spending is good government in its own right  Congress ought to feel a sufficient urgency about eliminating unnecessary spending even if the federal government were running an annual budget surplus Ms  Harris  Ms  Warren and other Democratic presidential candidates   including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York  Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont   have become vocal proponents of expanding Medicare eligibility The case for such an expansion would be strengthened if proponents showed greater concern not just for broadening the availability of health care  but also for managing the cost of care The Times is

 You have a president who  in my opinion  beyond a shadow of a doubt  sought to  however ham handedly  collude with the Russian government  a foreign power  to undermine and influence our elections     Beto O Rourke  presidential candidate I think there s plenty of evidence of collusion and conspiracy in plain sight     Adam Schiff  chairman of House Intelligence Committee I called  Trump s  behavior treasonous  which is to betray one s trust and aid and abet the enemy  and I stand very much by that claim     John Brennan  former C I A  director The biggest scandal in U S  history is coming into focus  On Friday Rachel Maddow made it clear  Donald Trump conspired with the enemy     Rob Reiner  film directorMaybe it s time to declare a national sabbath  Maybe it s time to step back from the scandalmongering and assess who we are right now Democrats might approach this moment with an attitude of humility and honest self examination  It s clear that many Democrats made grievous accusations against the president that are not supported by the evidence  It s clear that people like Beto O Rourke and John Brennan owe Donald Trump a public apology  If you call someone a traitor and it turns out you lacked the evidence for that charge  then the only decent thing to do is apologize Republicans and the Sean Hannity style Trumpians might also approach this moment with an attitude of humility and honest self examination  For two years they ve been calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt  For two years they ve been spreading the libel that there are no honest brokers in Washington  It s all a deep state conspiracy  a swamp  They should apologize for peddling the sort of deep cynicism that undermines our country s institutions And what about the rest of us  What about all the hours we spent speculating about the Mueller report  fantasizing about the Trump ruin or watching and reading speculation about these things  What about the superstructure of scandal politics we have built and live in today The sad fact is that Watergate introduced a poison into the American body politic  Richard Nixon s downfall was just and important  but it opened up the mouthwatering possibility that you don t need to do the hard work of persuading people to join your side  Instead  you can destroy your foes all at once through scandal Politics since Watergate has been defined by a long string of scandals and pseudo scandals   Iran contra  Whitewater  Valerie Plame  Benghazi  Solyndra  swift boating  Politico last year compiled a list of 46 scandals that were at one time or another deemed  worse than Watergate  The nation s underlying divides are still ideological  but we rarely fight them honestly as philosophical differences  We just accuse the other side of corruption  Politics is no longer a debate  it s an attempt to destroy lives through accusation The political media  especially on TV  now has a template it can apply whenever a scandal looms into view  to hook viewers into the speculative story line  According to the Tyndall Report  the three main broadcast networks made the Russia collusion investigation the second most covered news event of 2018  trailing only the Kavanaugh hearings  another scandal All the players slip into their assigned roles  Straight reporters are doing good  hard work  But the flow of information is not fast enough to keep up with 24 7 programming  so you get this toxic deluge of raw speculation The accused s political opponents assume maximum guilt  Imaginative pundits take a few dots of information and connect them to vast if speculative constellations of guilt   I hear the indictments are coming down next week   they whisper to one another Members of the accused s party attack the investigators themselves  They get to enjoy their own sense of spiritual superiority when it turns out the scandal is much smaller than it appeared  which is almost always the case It s all a wonderful game  You don t have to know anything about a boring policy subject like economics  poverty or foreign affairs  You can have a long career in politics and media by simply treating public life as an arena of life or death gossip Since Watergate launched this Age of Investigation  government has become much more transparent  As a result  public trust in institutions has plummeted  The scandal culture hasn t ultimately helped one party over the other  It s just spread a corrosive cynicism that has disabled government altogether The ray of hope is that out on the campaign trail voters rarely ask about the scandals du jour  which obsess the cognoscenti  Most of the Democratic presidential candidates spent the last few months trying not to talk about Russian collusion  They have found a vein of voters who would rather focus on the substance of our historical moment  What motivated so many Americans to vote for a presidential candidate they knew was untrustworthy  How do you provide affordable health security  Is China a mortal foe The Democrats won the 2018 midterms by focusing on the issues  not collusion  For most voters  politics is about their lives  not a self righteous TV show The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our

WASHINGTON   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared President Trump to Cyrus the Great  Lord Balfour and Harry S  Truman   historic giants who helped secure the future of the Israeli people  Mr  Trump called Mr  Netanyahu a  very special man  If the expressions of praise seemed unequal  they accurately conveyed the political dynamic between Mr  Trump and Mr  Netanyahu during the Israeli leader s visit to the White House on Monday Mr  Netanyahu was thanking Mr  Trump for signing a proclamation recognizing Israel s authority over the long disputed Golan Heights   a valuable political gift to the prime minister two weeks before he faces voters in a hard fought election back home  Read why the Golan Heights is no longer an Arab rallying cry  Mr  Trump  fresh off news that an investigation of his possible ties to Russia did not find evidence of a conspiracy  was happy to show support to an ally who still faces indictment in Israel on charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  Mr  President   the prime minister said   over the years  Israel has been blessed to have many friends who sat in the Oval Office  but Israel has never had a better friend than you  Certainly  Mr  Netanyahu has never had a friendlier president during his 13 years in office  In addition to his decision on the Golan Heights  Mr  Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal  which Mr  Netanyahu had long reviled  and moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  which the prime minister had long advocated  Today I am taking historic action to promote Israel s ability to defend itself   Mr  Trump said as he signed the proclamation and handed the pen to Mr  Netanyahu Mr  Trump s decision  first announced last week  reverses decades of American policy and is at odds with United Nations resolutions rejecting the seizure of land by force  But the president said it was necessary because otherwise  Iran and its proxies in southern Syria would use the Golan Heights as a launching ground for attacks on Israel Mr  Trump cited a rocket attack from Gaza  which struck a house near Tel Aviv early Monday morning  injuring seven  as an example of  the significant security challenges that Israel faces every single day  The attack prompted Mr  Netanyahu to announce he was cutting short his trip to return home after his meeting to oversee Israel s military response  He had been scheduled to have dinner with Mr  Trump on Tuesday and to address a pro Israeli lobbying group  the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  or Aipac  Mr  Netanyahu stayed in Washington until Monday evening  as Israeli forces began striking Hamas targets in Gaza  Israel is responding forcefully to this wanton aggression   he said   We will do whatever we must do to defend our people and defend our state  Mr  Netanyahu spoke of the vital role that the Golan Heights had played in Israel s defense  He recalled that his brother was among the soldiers who scaled its rocky slopes during the Arab Israeli war of 1967  Later on  Mr  Netanyahu himself  as a young officer  led a covert unit from Syria into the Golan Heights in the midst of a snowstorm  We hold the high ground  and we shall never give it up   he said Though Israel effectively annexed the Golan Heights in 1981  Mr  Netanyahu said it had to wait half a century for Mr  Trump  to translate our military victory into a diplomatic victory  Mr  Trump s decision continued to ripple throughout the region  Al Marsad  which defends the rights of native Syrians in the Golan Heights  said the decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty could provoke violence in a territory that has been remarkably tranquil  The decision sets a dangerous standard that glorifies systematic human rights abuses  legitimizes illegal aggression and occupation  and endangers peace in the Middle East   the group said in a statement Saudi Arabia also warned  in a statement released by its official press agency on Tuesday  that Mr  Trump s decision would have  significant negative effects  on security and the peace process in the Middle East The statement described the Golan Heights as an  occupied Syrian Arab land in accordance with the relevant international resolutions   Attempts to impose fait accompli do not change the facts   it said Mr  Netanyahu s truncated visit came at a critical moment in Israeli politics  when his legal woes are multiplying and he faces a fierce challenge from Benny Gantz  a retired military chief  Analysts said the show of support could tilt the balance in his favor  Trump s embrace and Hamas rockets may well make the difference in helping Netanyahu form the next Israeli government   said Aaron David Miller  a former peace negotiator now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars The prime minister was hit by two new accusations shortly before he left for Washington  that he improperly authorized the sale of German made submarines to Egypt  and that he engaged in self dealing  through an undisclosed stake in a company that supplied the German builder of both the Egyptian subs and several new Israeli warships Mr  Trump  on the other hand  was still exulting in the letter to Congress sent by Attorney General William P  Barr  in which Mr  Barr reported that the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  had not found collusion between Mr  Trump s presidential campaign and Russia The president did not mention the Russia investigation during the signing ceremony  though in a later session with Mr  Netanyahu in the Oval Office  he told reporters that his opponents were  treasonous  Mr  Netanyahu made light of the legal issues facing both of them  He told Mr  Trump that he had brought him a case of wine from the Golan Heights  Noting that the president was not a wine drinker  he asked if he could give the bottles to the White House staff After Mr  Trump agreed  Mr  Netanyahu joked   I hope they don t open an investigation on it  For his part  Mr  Trump listed all the steps he had taken to benefit Israel  including moving the embassy  After thanking the American ambassador to Israel  David M  Friedman  Mr  Trump asked him whether he was enjoying the relocated embassy  Yes   said Mr  Friedman  who was standing behind the leaders  And you love Israel   Mr  Trump asked Nodding  Mr  Friedman added   And America   And America   Mr  Trump repeated with a grin   I was waiting for him to say that  Even in its abbreviated form  Mr  Netanyahu s meeting with Mr  Trump overshadowed a major speech to Aipac by Mr  Gantz at the same time as the Oval Office session Mr  Gantz told his audience that the prime minister had  done well  by deciding to return home  and said he intended to return as well   and if needed to fight in defense of our people  But in what amounted to a campaign speech  Mr  Gantz  a former chief of the Israeli Army s general staff  also took shots at Mr  Netanyahu  while portraying himself as a soldier who would be tough on defense while running a cleaner and more inclusive government  There will be no racists leading our state institutions and there will be no corruption   Mr  Gantz declared in a not so subtle reference to Mr  Netanyahu s embrace of a far right party  Otzma Yehudit  and to his indictment on corruption charges At a time when Israel policy in the United States has become divisive  with many progressives and young Jews taking a highly critical view of the Netanyahu government  Mr  Gantz also sought to cast himself as a leader who would build bridges between Jews in the two countries  As an abba  as a father  I m doing it for my kids   he said   But I m doing it for your kids as well   

College presidents don t want President Trump stepping into campus affairs and making threatening orders about speech   or so they say  After the president previewed an executive order on campus speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference this month  Robert Zimmer  president of the University of Chicago  warned that it would make the government   with all its power and authority  a party to defining the very nature of discussion on campus   and lead to the  inevitable establishment of a bureaucracy to enforce any governmental position  The order itself  which the president signed on Thursday  has softer language  stating that federal officials shall  ensure institutions that receive federal research or education grants promote free inquiry  including through compliance with all applicable federal laws  regulations and policies   President Trump s remarks at the signing ceremony  however  were harsher  He called universities  anti First Amendment institutions   he denounced  ideological intolerance   and he stated that the  35 billion per year that schools receive in research funding  is now at stake   The case would seem a perfect occasion for school leaders to rebuke a politician whom they despise  and do so on principled apolitical grounds  Even a conservative should object to this federal intrusion into academic affairs But consider the actual pressures and burdens on the president of a research university that takes in grants by the millions every year  The college presidents won t say so  but in light of their daily duties  this  speech  aspect of the executive order may look to them like a godsend The order originates in specific incidents  a student harassed by school officials for her anti abortion messaging  the creation of illiberal speech codes  and the shout downs that conservative speakers like Heather Mac Donald and Charles Murray have endured during their campus visits  College leaders aren t happy with this  They prefer that a student manning a table for the group Turning Point USA be left alone  and that Ben Shapiro have his say on Wednesday and leave on Thursday  They favor free speech even as they openly disagree with the conservative s opinions But that s not enough for some students  who object to the very presence of an outspoken conservative on campus  They have forced administrators to draw a line on impermissible speech that the administrators don t wish to draw  Administrators want open inquiry and lively debate  but the students often have a historically disadvantaged identity that the college leaders feel they must respect   African Americans against racism  women against rape culture This is a dilemma that outsiders don t appreciate  They see 19 year olds chanting  No more racism   while everyone else in the lecture hall  including the conservative speaker and the security guards  stand in silence  and they wonder why nobody makes them stop  Conservative critics put it up to liberal bias  but that s not really the problem  It has to do with the relationship the administration has formed with undergraduates from the beginning  especially with those from underrepresented populations Selective schools are in a fierce competition to attract applicants and build a properly diverse and elite freshman class  They have recruited these students with glowing promises and triumphant predictions   You will prosper here   this is the very best place you can be   the brochures tell them  Recruiters phone and text underserved groups with exciting accounts of graduates  success  Students arrive full of hope and happiness  The last thing deans want is for these youths to become upset and angry  It brings bad publicity and makes the campus look like a place of turmoil  not joy  These students intimidate the highest officials in a university more than outsiders can imagine  A student at Yale yelling at the professor who tried to reason with her did tremendous damage to Yale s brand  but the administration couldn t come down on her without compromising its pledges of inclusivity and anti discrimination and sensitivity This is why  even if they won t say it publicly  many university administrators most likely welcome the federal government s heavy hand  President Trump has taken the burden of free speech off their shoulders  Administrators now must stop the illiberalism of the activists as a matter of federal policy  That means canceling speech codes and punishing disrupters  Schools can t lose federal funding  they need it to function  Now  they have an answer to the students crowding their offices and storming the lecture hall   Yes  you must be quiet or you will be disciplined  I have no choice   it s the law  RelatedTrump Signs Executive

BANGKOK   A military linked party took an unexpected lead in elections in Thailand on Sunday  most likely cementing the army s status as the country s dominant political force With more than 90 percent of the ballots counted  Palang Pracharat  the military s proxy party  had 7 5 million votes  according to a preliminary count by the Election Commission Thailand s military has orchestrated more than a dozen successful coups  the latest in 2014  and has ruled the country through a junta since then Pheu Thai  the populist party that had been expected to finish first according to most polls  was in second place with seven million votes  the Election Commission reported Pheu Thai is the latest incarnation of a populist force that was toppled in the last two coups  The party is a political vehicle of Thaksin Shinawatra  a polarizing former prime minister whose aligned parties have won every election since 2001 Sunday s vote count  however  which was for the lower house of Parliament  appeared to end Mr  Thaksin s winning streak But even if Pheu Thai had won the most votes of any party  it would have faced significant obstacles to forming a new government ImagePeople at polling precincts on Sunday in Bangkok  Turnout  at about 66 percent  was lower than expected CreditLauren Decicca Getty ImagesA Constitution drafted by the junta ensures that the military appoints all 250 members of the Senate  meaning that army linked forces were positioned to control a majority of Parliament  unless the opposition won the lower house by a landslide Late on Sunday night  the Election Commission announced that it would release further results on Monday morning  leaving the counting unfinished  Another announcement delayed the time to the early afternoon Voter turnout  at nearly 66 percent  was lower than the expected 80 percent  Nearly 6 percent of ballots were invalidated  the Election Commission reported  raising concerns about the integrity of the vote  This election is irregular   said Phumtham Wechayachai  Pheu Thai s secretary general Nuttaa Mahattana  a democracy activist who is facing four sedition charges  said that the reports of ballot irregularities paled in comparison to the overall imbalance built into the Thai political system by the military backed Constitution  Cheating in the election started when they drafted the Constitution   Ms  Nuttaa said The military s proxy party had campaigned on stability and on defending Thailand s monarchy  It nominated Prime Minister Prayuth Chan ocha  the leader of the junta that orchestrated the 2014 coup  to continue in his post  The military  especially since General Prayuth came to power  has penetrated every corner of Thai society and politics   said Surat Horachaikul  a political science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok   It will not easily recede from politics  Openly dismissive of democratic traditions  Mr  Prayuth has repeatedly delayed elections and overseen a diminution of political freedoms  Activists have been jailed or sent to so called attitude adjustment camps  Cybercrime and sedition prosecutions have increased  Students who dared make

including Pheu Thai  as well as Future Forward  a youth inspired party that was contesting its first elections and surged to third place in the partial counting Thailand s complicated system of apportioning seats from votes means that Pheu Thai could still win around the same number of seats in the 500 seat lower house as Palang Pracharat  but with the Senate firmly in the military s hand  its power as an opposition party will be diminished Uttama Savanayana  the leader of Palang Pracharat  said in a news conference that Mr  Prayuth had already called to commend him on the party s performance The official election results will be released by early May  With the unexpectedly strong performance by the military  it appears that the tense status quo will continue in Thailand  with the military backed government in control and voters seeking change frustrated On social media on Sunday night  the hashtag  prayforthailand was trending high Ever since Mr  Thaksin  a former telecommunications billionaire from northern Thailand  swept to power in 2001  buoyed by support from the country s rice growing heartland  the nation has been split between an establishment elite and a populist groundswell  By some accounts  Thailand is the most unequal society on earth  and its wealth gap has only widened during five years of junta rule  Pheu Thai Party is always on the people s side   said Nongnuch Waree  who voted for the Thaksin associated party on Sunday   Their policies touch the people of all classes  especially the lower class  In election after election  the largest bloc of voters has chosen parties aligned with Mr  Thaksin  appreciative of his parties  health care and rice subsidies  Just as predictably  the military has launched coups  one against him and one

polling stations opened  the palace released an unscheduled statement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun  who has stressed that the monarchy is  above politics   The palace statement urged voters to  support good people to rule the country and prevent bad people from gaining power and causing trouble and disorder   His Majesty is concerned about the stability of the nation  the feelings and happiness of the people   the communiqué added Last month  King Vajiranlongkorn quashed the hopes of his elder sister  Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Varnavadi  who had been nominated by another Thaksin aligned party to serve as its candidate for prime minister  Hours after her candidacy was announced by the Thai Raksa Chart Party  the king issued a royal command saying it was  inappropriate   and her political foray ended The Constitutional Court ruled this month that Ms  Ubolratana s candidacy was a  hostile action   and Thai Raksa Chart was dissolved On Friday  Ms

showing came as support withered for the Democrat Party  Thailand s oldest party and an establishment mainstay in Bangkok  During campaigning  the party had hinted that it could lead a coalition  In Sunday s partial counting  however  the Democrats were in fourth place Abhisit Vejjajiva  the party leader  resigned on Sunday night  acknowledging that his party had been torn by internal infighting and had lost votes to newer political parties For some in Thailand  the elections  however flawed  appeared to be a tool for restoring respectability to a country that considers itself one of Asia s oldest democracies  This election is important not only for our country but for our relationship with the U S  and China   said Natapong Kasemsant  a bank executive in Bangkok  who was voting at a

BANGKOK   A pro military party in Thailand on Monday celebrated its lead in the vote count in this weekend s elections  hinting that the army s grip since seizing power in a 2014 coup would likely endure The early result  which may not be finalized for days  signaled how Thailand  one of the most stable American allies in Southeast Asia  allows the military to dominate governance  even as other countries in the region have kept soldiers away from politics The Sunday vote also showed how the Thai military  which has orchestrated a dozen coups over the past nine decades  is using a fresh tactic  elections to entrench its power While voting may nurture democracy elsewhere  Thailand s political system is strangled by complicated rules designed to perpetuate the military s authority  Neither the popular vote nor the number of contested seats in this parliamentary election will have much of a democratizing effect A full unofficial count of the vote was not expected until late this week  The official results might not be released until early May A partial count showed that a populist party  Pheu Thai  which lagged in the popular vote  had nonetheless so far collected the largest number of parliamentary seats   137 in the 500 seat Lower House  The party represents the interests of Thaksin Shinawatra  a polarizing former prime minister as beloved by the rural poor as he is disdained by the establishment elite Still  forces loyal to Prayuth Chan ocha  the leader of the junta that orchestrated the 2014 coup  said he appeared poised to continue as prime minister  The pro military party that nominated him  Palang Pracharat  had so far collected just 97 seats in the Lower House but had more of the popular vote than its populist rival ImageSupporters of the Pheu Thai party watching election results in Bangkok on Sunday CreditYe Aung Thu Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBecause the country s military drafted Constitution ensures that the 250 member Senate is entirely appointed by the military  Mr  Prayuth may be able to count on enough votes from both sides of Parliament to keep the top job In an unusual twist in a parliamentary democracy  a candidate for prime minister in Thailand need not be an elected member of Parliament Purawich Watanasukh  a research fellow at King Prajadhipok s Institute in Thailand  said he was  quite surprised  with the military party s strong performance in the popular vote  Mr  Purawich was among many analysts who had predicted that Mr  Prayuth s perceived lack of popularity might hurt him Regardless  support for the junta was stacked even before voting began  And the vote was filled with reports of irregularities and concerns about repeated delays in announcing the results Uttama Savanayana  Palang Pracharat

spokesman for Palang Pracharat  said that  the votes from the people are the voice from heaven   before acknowledging that the work of coalition making still loomed On Friday  Mr  Prayuth  a former army chief with an ambivalent attitude toward democracy  spoke of his commitment to his homeland  I love Thailand  and I would die for this country   he said at a political rally On Monday afternoon  the Election Commission  which was appointed by the junta  delayed for the third time releasing its unofficial count for unexplained reasons  Such postponements had never occurred  Thai election

of irregularities increasing  the delays made election monitors nervous  My understanding is that the Election Commission has an obligation to continue counting the ballots through the night  so this is potentially problematic or illegal   said Pandit Chanrochanakit  the deputy dean of the political science department at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok Before the elections  diplomats in Bangkok warned that any delay in announcing the results might raise concerns  especially since relatively few independent election observers had been deployed Mr  Pandit said hundreds of students

ORYOL  Russia   After 19 months in a Russian jail awaiting trial for  extremism   Dennis O  Christensen  a Jehovah s Witness from Denmark detained for his faith  received an unexpected lift from President Vladimir V  Putin at the end of last year The president  speaking in the Kremlin in December  declared that prosecuting people for their religious affiliations was  a total nonsense  and had to stop But instead of curbing a campaign across Russia against Jehovah s Witnesses  Mr  Putin s remark has been followed by more arrests  a conviction and six year prison sentence for Mr  Christensen  and  in a new low  reports late last month of the torture of believers detained in Siberia The gulf between what Mr  Putin says and what happens in Russia raises a fundamental question about the nature of his rule after more than 18 years at the pinnacle of an authoritarian system  Is Mr  Putin really the omnipotent leader whom his critics attack and his own propagandists promote  Or does he sit atop a state that is  in fact  shockingly ramshackle  a system driven more by the capricious and often venal calculations of competing bureaucracies and interest groups than by Kremlin diktats The belief  widespread among critics of President Trump  that Russia propelled him to the White House by colluding with his campaign is premised in part on the first view of Mr  Putin s capacities and reach  The Mueller report  if ever released to the public  may help Americans better understand how Russia does or doesn t work in reality But to some of Mr  Putin s fellow citizens  the Russian president s grip already looks less firm than often imagined Ekaterina Schulmann is a political scientist in Moscow and a member of Mr  Putin s Council for Civil Society and Human Rights who challenged the president over the persecution of Jehovah s Witnesses at the December meeting in the Kremlin  She said Mr  Putin s grip on the country had been vastly exaggerated by both supporters and opponents ImageDennis Christensen being escorted into a courthouse following the verdict announcement in the town of Oryol in February CreditMladen Antonov Agence France Presse   Getty Images This is not a personally run empire but a huge and difficult to manage bureaucratic machine with its own internal rules and principles   she said   It happens time and again that the president says something  and then nothing or the opposite happens  A plethora of bureaucratic and political forces both reinforce and sap the president s power  the security services  the Russian Orthodox Church  billionaire oligarchs  local officials and others  each with its own sometimes competing and sometimes overlapping interests  Mr  Putin has to manage them as best he can  but he doesn t control everything they each do One analyst is even more blunt about Mr  Putin and the state he presides over   The system is dysfunctional   said Andrew Wood  a former British ambassador to Moscow and now an associate fellow at Chatham House  a research organization in London   No one man could possibly control everything  ImageIrina Christensen  wife of Dennis Christensen a Danish member of Jehovah s Witnesses  who was convicted on extremism leaves the court hall after a court session in Orel  Russia  in February CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesTo most Westerners  accustomed to seeing Mr  Putin strutting in front of TV cameras and projecting an aura of effortless command  such statements can sound incredible  It is true that in high prestige matters of state  like hosting the Olympic Games or the World Cup soccer tournament  or building a bridge to Crimea  Mr  Putin has made the system act on his commands  The same is true for matters that ensure his grip on power  like cracking down on disobedient oligarchs and political opponents And after he came to power at the end of 1999  he effectively curbed the conspicuous disorder and noisy infighting that under his frequently drunk predecessor  Boris Yeltsin  left Russia with a state that barely functioned But many projects he has backed  like a critical bridge over the Amur River between Russia and China  and a high profile undertaking to build a highway between Moscow and St  Petersburg  have stalled There are limits to just how much time and political capital Mr  Putin can invest in prodding corrupt or incompetent officials and contractors to do as they are told The construction of a new rocket launch center in the Russian Far East  pushed by Mr  Putin as  one of modern Russia s biggest and most ambitious projects   is taking years longer than planned  slowed by corruption  strikes by unpaid workers and other setbacks  The prosecutor general s office in Moscow says that more than  150 million has been stolen from the project  which it said had been marred by 17 000 legal violations by more than 1 000 people This stark mismatch between Mr  Putin s words and the system s actions was on display again last month when the police in Moscow arrested Michael Calvey  the American founder of one of the oldest and biggest Russia focused investment funds  on fraud charges after a dispute with a rival over control of a Russian bank Mr  Calvey s arrest  on charges that could result in up to 10 years in prison  was at odds with repeated statements by Mr  Putin that Russia must attract foreign investors and keep law enforcement agencies from meddling in business disputes Dmitri Peskov  the Kremlin spokesman  insisted that Mr  Putin had no prior knowledge of Mr  Calvey s detention  but no one outside the president s innermost circle can be sure Aleksei Kudrin  a liberal minded old friend of Mr  Putin s from St  Petersburg and his former finance minister  complained that the arrest  fully disregards the directives of the president  and had created an  emergency for the economy  Mr  Kudrin s observation drew widespread scorn  Critics of Mr  Putin accused the former minister of deluding himself with the idea that the president was not responsible for Mr  Calvey s troubles and countless other examples of Russian law enforcement run amok Some recalled how at the height of murderous purges in the 1930s  many of Stalin s acolytes refused to believe that the Soviet dictator knew what was going on   which he clearly did  since he signed off on lists of people to be executed   and blamed out of control underlings But Russia today  Ms  Schulmann said  resembles not so much the rigidly regimented country ruled by Stalin as the dilapidated autocracy of Russia in the early 19th century  The ruler at the time  Czar Nicholas I  presided over corrupt civilian and military bureaucracies that expanded Russian territory  led the country into a disastrous war in Crimea and drove the economy into a stagnant dead end Nicholas knew the limits of his power   It is not I who rule Russia   he complained   It is the 30 000 clerks   The only real difference now  Ms  Schulmann said  is that  clerks   or bureaucrats  now number over a million and a half  It is a great illusion that you just need to reach the leader and make him listen and everything will change   she added   This is not how it happens   The illusion  however  is largely a result of the Kremlin s own propaganda about the man at the top of what it calls the  power vertical  An annual call in show broadcast on state television features Mr  Putin taking hours of questions and complaints from the public  The ritual is invariably followed by reports in state media about how crumbling schools  broken heating systems  giant potholes and other problems raised by callers have been fixed on Mr  Putin s orders Mr  Christensen  the Dane who has been jailed since May 2017  said he still held out hope that Mr  Putin might  in similar fashion  command compliance with his December statement that  we can and even must be more liberal  toward Jehovah s Witnesses  a Christian denomination  I was very encouraged by this statement   Mr  Christensen  47  said last month  interviewed from behind bars while on a video link to a courtroom in Oryol  a city 230 miles south of Moscow   I hope that the Russian president was telling the truth and was speaking honestly  Mr  Putin  he said  had sent a clear signal that  this should not be happening in the 21st century  We don t live in the Middle Ages anymore  For taking part in Bible readings and prayer sessions in Oryol  Mr  Christensen  a former carpenter  was found guilty in early February of committing  a grave  premeditated crime directed at the foundations of the constitutional order and the security of the state  His wife  Irina  who is Russian  attended the court hearing where a lawyer made a request that her husband be released to house arrest pending an appeal of his conviction  She said she did not know whether Mr  Putin had made his Kremlin comments only as a public relations ploy or had bowed to other forces in the system that favored harsh crackdowns The Orthodox Church has campaigned for years against Jehovah s Witnesses  a rival it views as a heretical sect  This hostility has meshed neatly with the interests of the security services  which since Soviet times have viewed the denomination as subversive because its global headquarters are in the United States and its members steadfastly refuse to inform on one another To buttress Mr  Christensen s plea to be let out of jail  his lawyer  Irina Krasnikova  noted in court that judges previously involved in the case  have apparently not read the president s statement   The judge  unimpressed  ordered that the Dane be kept behind bars  The cult of Putin at the top of an all powerful  power vertical  is a myth  It does not exist   said Mark Galeotti  a British Russia expert and the author of the new book  We Need to Talk About Putin  How the West Gets Him Wrong   Instead  Mr  Galeotti said  Mr  Putin is a  gray blur that allows us all to create our own Putin   either all powerful and Machiavellian or struggling just to hold an essentially decrepit system together This at times chaotic setup has proved particularly advantageous to Russia s security apparatus  notably the Federal Security Service  or F S B   the domestic arm of the Soviet era K G B  Mr  Putin  himself a former K G B  officer  has largely given the F S B  free rein  even when its actions directly contradict his stated goals Mr  Putin has frequently spoken  for example  of Russia s need to develop small and medium size businesses but has left the F S B   which operates mafia style protection rackets  to ride roughshod over many enterprises In his annual state of the nation address last month  he again stressed the need to let business people work freely  Noting that he had made the same demand in a previous address  Mr  Putin acknowledged that  unfortunately  the situation has not improved much  Mr  Christensen blamed the F S B   with an assist from the Orthodox Church  for his own legal troubles  Mr  Putin may think it s  total nonsense  for people like Mr  Christensen to be sitting in jail  But for now  that is where he waits  He was recently joined there by a second believer from Oryol  Sergey Skrynnikov  whom prosecutors want jailed for three years for  extremism   A properly run dictatorship looks very different from this   Mr  Galeotti said

At the heart of the  Medicare for all  proposals championed by Senator Bernie Sanders and many Democrats is a revolutionary idea  Abolish private health insurance  Proponents want to sweep away our complex  confusing  profit driven mess of a health care system and start fresh with a single government run insurer that would cover everyone But doing away with an entire industry would also be profoundly disruptive  The private health insurance business employs at least a half a million people  covers about 250 million Americans  and generates roughly a trillion dollars in revenues  Its companies  stocks are a staple of the mutual funds that make up millions of Americans  retirement savings  Such a change would shake the entire health care system  which makes up a fifth of the United States economy  as hospitals  doctors  nursing homes and pharmaceutical companies would have to adapt to a new set of rules  Most Americans would have a new insurer   the federal government   and many would find the health insurance stocks in their retirement portfolios much less valuable  We re talking about changing flows of money on just a huge scale   said Paul Starr  a sociology professor at Princeton University and author of  The Social Transformation of American Medicine  The Rise of a Sovereign Profession and the Making of a Vast Industry    There s no precedent in American history that compares to this   he said  Economists have begun wrestling with basic questions about what this sort of change would mean and disagreeing over whether it would cost more or less than the country s current health care system  No one has examined the full economic impact of such plans on jobs  wages  investors  doctors and hospitals   or the health insurance companies themselves  Such an undertaking would be difficult  given the vagueness of key parts of the proposals being discussed and the wide ranging possible effects There are few international analogues to the Medicare for all proposals  but Canada  which provides similar doctor and hospital benefits for its residents  probably comes closest  Even there  people buy private insurance for benefits that are not covered by the government program  like prescription drugs and dental care  Most other countries with single payer systems allow a more expansive  competing role for private coverage  In Britain  for example  everyone is covered by a public system  but people can pay extra for insurance that gives them access to private doctors  Most countries in Europe don t have single payer systems  but instead allow private insurance companies to compete under extremely tight regulations ImageSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was joined by Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York to announce a Medicare for All bill in September 2017 CreditAndrew Harnik Associated PressLegislators writing the bills acknowledge that people in the health insurance industry would lose their jobs  Proposals in the House and Senate would set aside large funds to help cushion the blow to displaced workers  offering them training  benefits  and income supports  The health insurance industry is now composed of a mix of for profit and nonprofit companies of various sizes  About 155 million Americans get private health coverage through an employer  but the reach of the industry extends into publicly funded insurance programs  A third of Americans enrolled in Medicare  which insures older and disabled people  and four fifths of those in Medicaid  which covers the poor and disabled  now get their benefits from a private insurer  Simply talk of Medicare for all makes investors jittery  Shares of the large publicly held insurance companies  including Cigna  Humana and UnitedHealth  fell when Representative Pramila Jayapal  Democrat of Washington  introduced her bill in late February  but have largely rebounded  The effective takeover of the health insurance industry in the United States would mean a huge hit to the companies  stocks  although the companies  which have additional lines of business  would most likely survive  While the bills would give relief to insurance industry workers  they would provide no such compensation for investors  Not surprisingly  the insurance industry and many other health care industries vociferously oppose these plans and plan to spend heavily in fighting them Many supporters of this approach see elimination of private insurance as a key feature  not a bug  meant to improve the program s efficiency and equity by streamlining the health care system and weakening profit motives  With a single insurer covering every patient  hospitals and doctors could spend less time and money complying with differing policies  negotiating contracts  and filing forms to get paid   It s worth it   said Adam Gaffney  the president of Physicians for a National Health Program  which supports single payer health care and helped design  Ms  Jayapal s bill   Because we are not going to get to true universal health care without the greater efficiency of a single payer system  This idea   once at the edge of Democratic politics   has moved to the mainstream of the debate among the party s numerous presidential contenders  Mr  Sanders  independent of Vermont  ran on the idea in his 2016 campaign  and now five 2020 Democratic aspirants have co sponsored one of the two Medicare for all bills  Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey  Kirsten Gillibrand of New York  Kamala Harris of California  and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts co sponsored Mr  Sanders s bill in the last Congress  Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a co sponsor on this year s House Medicare for All Act The concept  in broad strokes  appeals to many Democratic voters  But overall support diminishes by a third or more when people are told that the plan would involve eliminating private insurance  raising taxes  or requiring waits to obtain medical care  according to surveys from the Kaiser Family Foundation And the approach is a big departure from the Democrats  strategy in 2010  when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act  That law expanded coverage  but did so largely using private insurance carriers  It set up marketplaces for Americans who didn t have coverage through work to buy insurance  usually with federal subsidies  and broadened access to the Medicaid program for the poor  Obamacare was designed to build on the current system  patching its holes while minimizing disruption and avoiding the fierce opposition from industry that helped sink earlier attempts to change the health care system  But 107 Democratic House members are now co sponsoring a Medicare for all bill written by Ms  Jayapal  Mr  Sanders  whose update of his bill is expected in the next few weeks  argues that only a single payer approach would resolve problems he sees as inherent in private insurance  Both proposals are clear that a single  government run insurer would replace the private sector  but they are less detailed about exactly how the government program would pay for medical care Their plans would include nearly every doctor and hospital in the United States and provide generous benefits  including dental care and hearing aids  and would not require patients to pay any out of pocket cost to see a doctor  The federal government  of course  would have to cover those benefits  and would need to raise taxes to pay for them Gerald Friedman  a labor economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  who was close to Mr  Sanders s 2016 campaign  estimated then that it could reduce the nation s health care spending by  6 trillion over a decade  while the left leaning Urban Institute said it might increase the overall bill by nearly  7 trillion  Both Mr  Sanders and Ms  Jayapal said the switch to a government insurer would mean no loss in access to health care that private insurance provides   There is a reason why the United States is the only major country on earth that allows private insurance companies to profit off of health care   Mr  Sanders said in an interview   The function of private health insurance is not to provide quality care to all  it is to make as much money as possible for the private insurance companies  working with the drug companies  There are sharp disagreements among Democrats in Congress over whether Medicare for all or a more incremental approach is best   and presidential candidates co sponsoring Mr  Sanders s bill also support other  less sweeping measures  ImageThe Medicare for All bill written by Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington currently has 108 Democratic co sponsors CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesMs  Harris  asked directly about getting rid of private health insurance during a CNN forum in January  answered   Let s eliminate all that  Let s move on   But after her comments were characterized as extreme  her campaign quickly clarified that  while she continued to endorse the Sanders plan  she would also support more incremental expansions of health coverage  During her CNN forum last week  Ms  Warren said she was open to various ways to get to universal coverage   When we talk about Medicare for all  there are a lot of different pathways   she said   What we re all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure that everybody gets covered  Dr  David Blumenthal  a former Obama administration official who is now chief executive of the Commonwealth Fund  a nonprofit that funds health care research  voiced concern about the prospects for the most transformative approach   I do think it s an uphill battle to take things away from people in the name of giving them something better   he said Believers in markets argue that consumer choice and competition among private health plans improve the quality of care  Others laud private industry s relative nimbleness compared with Medicare  which can be bureaucratic and prone to political influence  Private plans have been able to evolve and test new models more quickly   said Caroline Pearson  a senior vice president at NORC  a research organization at the University of Chicago   The political process slows things down   In a Medicare for all world  private insurers might evolve into contractors for the big government system  They already perform various functions for Medicare  including helping the program manage paying its bills  The industry could retain that role  or take on new responsibilities   The government would have to build out infrastructure if they were to shut down all the private insurance companies   said Mark Bertolini  the former chief executive of Aetna  now

The Mueller investigation is over  and the only people close to Donald Trump who have been criminally charged are his former campaign chairman  former deputy campaign chairman  former personal lawyer  former national security adviser  former campaign foreign policy adviser and Roger Stone  the president s longtime friend and strategist  The report written by the special counsel Robert Mueller  according to a quotation in a brief summary issued by Attorney General William Barr  says that  while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him   Naturally  the president and his allies are claiming  as one of Trump s tweets said   Complete and Total EXONERATION  I won t pretend that the weekend s news was not very good for Trump and dispiriting for those of us who despise him  Whatever else is in the Mueller report  it says  according to Barr  that the investigation  did not establish  that anyone from the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its 2016 election interference  The overtures we all know about   the Trump Tower meeting  Trump s public call for Russia to obtain Hillary Clinton s emails  which Russian hackers tried to do that very day   were not part of a crime  or at least not part of a crime that the special counsel could prove  There will be no deus ex Mueller bringing this wretched presidency to an early end  On the contrary  Trump is emboldened  and his foes momentarily defensive Until the Mueller report is publicly released  however  it s impossible to tell how much of Trump s victory is substantive and how much is spin  The report  evidently  leaves open the question of whether Trump obstructed justice  In his letter to Congress about the report  Barr said that he and his deputy  Rod Rosenstein  made the determination that no obstruction of justice occurred  Of course  last year Barr wrote a memo calling Mueller s obstruction investigation  grossly irresponsible  and  fatally misconceived   which is surely why Trump appointed him in the first place  There is no reason for anyone to take his finding seriously  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Even some of the underlying questions about Trump s relationship with Russia remain open  Here  those of us who d hoped for more from Mueller should be mindful of the temptation to grasp at straws  On Friday  when the news broke that Mueller wasn t recommending any more indictments  many of us immediately asked whether there were sealed indictments  There weren t  As we parse Barr s letter  we should be aware of the human tendency toward motivated reasoning But we should be equally aware of the media tendency to capitulate in the face of Trumpian triumphalism   Recall the pressure to give Trump credit after his first meeting with Kim Jong un  despite the emptiness of the resulting agreement   So we shouldn t overlook the fact that when it comes to Trump s relationship with Russia  Barr s letter speaks only to very narrow questions about Trump campaign involvement in Russian information warfare operations in 2016 Barr wrote that no Trump associate conspired or  knowingly  coordinated with the Internet Research Agency  the Russian troll farm that spread pro Trump and anti Clinton propaganda  Did any do so unknowingly  Barr also wrote that the special counsel didn t find that Trump associates  conspired or coordinated with the Russian government  in hacking into the Democratic National Committee s computers  but few thought the campaign had a role in the actual digital break in Still  assuming Barr s summary is accurate  it means that while Trump was installed with Russia s help  neither he nor his campaign assisted Russia in committing the crimes that aided his ascent   If he cheated his way to victory  it was through more pedestrian alleged violations of campaign finance law   We re still in the dark  however  about all the steps Trump took to thwart the investigation and about the extent of his vulnerability to compromise On Saturday  the left wing writer Matt Taibbi published a widely shared essay calling Russiagate  this generation s W M D    a national security hoax  abetted by a credulous media  akin to the one that justified the Iraq War   The

ousted the last extremist fighters from the eastern Syrian village of Baghuz on Saturday  the Islamic State had shifted gears  The organization that once staked out a self proclaimed caliphate across

businesses  including fish farming  car dealing and cannabis growing  according to Colin P  Clarke  a senior fellow at the Soufan Center  a research organization President Trump and his top advisers have vowed to continue the fight against the Islamic State and its offshoots  but American commanders will likely have far fewer troops on the ground to wage that battle  Instead  military and spy agencies are tracking Islamic State fighters who have escaped and returned to North Africa  Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East  Analysts said roughly 1 200 of the extremists have returned to Europe alone A classified American military program in Jordan  called Operation Gallant Phoenix  is scooping up data collected in commando raids in Syria and Iraq and funneling it to law enforcement agencies in Europe and Southeast Asia to help stop future attacks  Still  officials believe the loss of the Islamic State s physical territory will not prevent it from striking again  The group s leadership and foot soldiers see this as a setback  not a defeat   Nathan Sales  the State Department s counterterrorism coordinator  said in a speech this month about the Islamic State s territorial defeat   They re actively working to continue the fight from ISIS s worldwide branches and networks  Here is a look at what the United States military is doing to stop the Islamic State from resurging AfghanistanImage What we are seeing now is not the surrender of ISIS as an organization   Gen  Joseph L  Votel  the head of the military s Central Command  said about the exodus from Baghuz  Syria CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThe Islamic State s offshoot in Afghanistan  known as Islamic State in Khorasan  is estimated to have more than 2 500 fighters spread between Nangarhar  Kunar  Nuristan and Laghman Provinces in the country s east  according to a recent United Nations report Speaking to lawmakers this month  General Votel provided a carefully worded answer when asked if the group is an international terrorist organization and not just a regional actor   I think ISIS Khorasan does have ideations focused on external operations toward our homeland   he said But one United States official said some American military units had shifted away from attacking the Islamic State as the terrorist group ramped up attacks against the Taliban American officials believe these increased strikes helped push the Taliban into negotiating a peace deal with the United States  A final agreement could require all 14 000 American forces currently in Afghanistan to leave within three years   and half of them in coming months The Taliban have violently rejected the Islamic State affiliate and  in some parts of Afghanistan  have worked in parallel with the government in Kabul to combat the group  Last July  Taliban fighters killed more than 200 Khorasan members  most of those who surrendered were turned over to the Afghan government Some Pentagon officials have voiced concerns about Taliban fighters joining the Islamic State if a peace settlement is reached  Another American official said some had already done so  albeit in small numbers  ISIS could scoop up any potential fighters alienated by the peace process   Jennifer Cafarella  the research director at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington  said in an interview Until the final United States withdrawal from Afghanistan  thousands of American forces are expected to continue strikes against the Islamic State and vestiges of Al Qaeda that are still in the country  including on partnered raids with Afghan commandos AfricaImageSoldiers during a training exercise in Burkina Faso in February  American Green Berets advise their partners in West African countries but rarely join them on

European and African partners to carry out most missions against the Islamic State  including in the areas between West Africa and Somalia About 6 000 United States troops and 1 000 Defense Department civilians or contractors work on a variety of missions throughout Africa  mainly training and conducting exercises with local armies  American Green Berets from the Third Special Forces Group advise local troops in several West African countries such as Niger and Burkina Faso  but rarely join them on missions In West Africa  the American military is scaling back its commandos by about 25 percent as part of a larger Pentagon strategy to confront threats by Russia  China and other state powers  The shift comes as insurgents are attacking northern Burkina Faso and pushing south along the border with Niger toward areas previously untouched by extremist violence  including the Ivory Coast  Benin  Togo and Ghana  where the Pentagon has a logistics hub With its large areas of ungoverned territory   and limited visibility by the United States   Libya also continues to be a haven for the Islamic State  Over the last two years  the United States has launched 13 drone strikes against Islamic State and Qaeda militants in Libya  according to the military s Africa Command  Our efforts in strikes   Gen  Thomas D  Waldhauser  the head of the Africa Command  told Congress this month

American forces have for years helped train and advise Filipino troops  they were part of an offensive against the Islamic State s affiliate in the southern city of Marawi in 2017  United States reconnaissance aircraft also were involved in that five month operation  which killed at least 900 extremists  including Isnilon Hapilon  who was considered the leader of the Islamic State in Southeast Asia Mr  Hapilon had been on the F B I  s list of most wanted terrorists  with a  5 million bounty offered for his capture Militants who have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State have since

once had and has suffered tens of thousands of casualties in both countries But it is far from a spent force Iraqi counterterrorism and intelligence officials have estimated that about 5 000 to 6 000 Islamic State fighters are spread between Iraq and Syria  That number  however  does not account for sleeper cells and their supporters  who are believed to be involved in reconnaissance and are otherwise helping the Islamic State carry out attacks Separate estimates  including one by the United Nations in February  put the group s strength even higher  James F  Jeffrey  the American special envoy for Syria  said this month that there are 15 000 to 20 000 armed Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria   although many are in sleeper cells  American officials said that the Pentagon was concerned about Islamic State fighters returning from the front lines to stoke violence in their hometowns across Iraq and Syria  The United States will continue its bombing campaign against the extremist group and to assist local forces in both countries who are the first line of defense against Islamic State fighters  ISIS s post caliphate insurgency in Iraq is accelerating faster than efforts to prevent it by the U S    concluded an analysis this month by the Institute for the Study of War The United States now has 5 200 troops in Iraq  mostly spread between two main bases  including Al Asad in western Anbar Province  which Mr  Trump visited in December  In Syria  Mr  Trump has ordered all but a residual American force of 400 troops to withdraw  Armed drones and warplanes will continue to provide air support Legislation pending in Iraq s Parliament could limit United States military operations in the country by reducing the number of American troops there  restricting their movements or even demanding a full withdrawal by a certain  if yet unspecified  date Mr  Jeffrey made clear that the liberation of the declared caliphate   an area that nearly five years ago stretched to the size of Britain   did not eradicate the Islamic State s potency  There is a great concern   he said  

BEIJING   Top Chinese economic policymakers promised this weekend that Beijing was ready to open up the country s economy to more market based competition and international trade  in the latest sign of strong Chinese interest in ending a multibillion dollar trade war with the United States Senior American officials are scheduled to come to Beijing in the coming days for trade talks  with Chinese officials then headed to Washington the following week in an attempt to wrap up a deal But Chinese officials have an extra incentive in pledging to loosen their hold over the world s No  2 economy  and not just to the Trump administration  In addition to a trade war that is hitting the country s exporters  China s economy has also been hurt by private sector business leaders who have become increasingly cautious in recent months about making new investments The economy has slowed  creating a self reinforcing cycle of skepticism that further private investments will be profitable  State owned enterprises have claimed a growing share of the loans available in the economy  a sign that the government may be crowding out the private businesses that could drive future growth  Xi Jinping  the country s leader  has insisted that the Communist Party play an ever greater role in corporate decision making and daily life The promises of economic opening may sound familiar  Chinese officials have said for years that they were ready to allow foreign competitors to enter their market on a more equal footing  with slow progress  The promises made over the weekend in many cases repeated pledges that have been made before  such as to open the country s financial sector more widely to foreign investment The tone of remarks at this weekend s session of the China Development Forum  the country s premier annual economic policy conference  was nonetheless striking  It appeared to represent a coordinated effort to present an international image of China as a country moving in the direction of greater economic openness Han Zheng  one of the seven men who run the country as members of the Communist Party s Politburo Standing Committee  said that China wanted to keep increasing imports   We do not strive for a trade surplus   he said Yi Gang  the governor of the central bank  said that China wanted more foreign investment  He said the government was looking for ways to let foreign investors trade derivatives and other financial instruments so as to limit their exposure to risk  Such a move could mean loosening Beijing s controls over the value of its currency   a politically sensitive subject  and one in which Beijing has a mixed record   and Mr  Yi offered no details Mr  Han  Mr  Yi and other senior officials took turns extolling a new foreign investment law approved by China s legislature on March 15  describing it as a carefully thought out framework for making the country a more appealing place to invest  China never pays lip service   said Han Wenxiu  the executive deputy director of the powerful  policy setting General Office of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission   We will honor our words and act on them  Foreign lawyers have described the law as vague  noting that a third of the provisions are no longer than one sentence each and that domestic companies are still covered by separate legislation ImageYi Gang  China s central bank governor  in Beijing on Sunday CreditThomas Peter ReutersChinese officials also emphasized their willingness to allow foreign banks  securities firms  insurers and asset management companies to buy larger stakes in their Chinese competitors  We can open it up more   Fang Xinghai  a vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission  said at the forum   You can compete  China has made similar offers ever since President Trump visited Beijing in November 2017  as part of an effort by Beijing to woo support from Wall Street during the trade war President Trump s remark on Friday that the United States would keep its 25 percent tariff imposed last summer on  50 billion a year of Chinese goods drew irritation at the forum  For the United States to insist on keeping tariffs could  ruin the whole base of this negotiation   said Zhu Min  an influential adviser on economic policy issues in Beijing and a former senior central banker in Beijing and former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington The Trump administration had consistently taken a hard line for many months on retaining the tariffs on the  50 billion a year in goods  The administration has been much more willing to discuss removing a 10 percent tariff imposed last autumn on another  200 billion a year in goods But corporate lobbyists in Washington have mounted a strenuous campaign for the repeal of all tariffs  including on the  50 billion in goods  Chinese officials have been hoping that campaign would be successful An extensive interagency effort by civil servants and political appointees produced the  50 billion list of products  They came up with product categories in which they did not want the United States to become more dependent on China  Some products were included for reasons of national security  like components for nuclear reactors and aircraft  Other products were on the list because they were deemed important for economic security  including cars using gasoline  diesel or electricity China needs to ramp up car exports because its home market  by far the world s largest  has slowed sharply since last summer  That has left dozens of factories operating at half of capacity or less  Xi Guohua  the president of China s FAW Group  a giant automaker  said at the forum that automakers and their suppliers directly or indirectly employed 12 percent of the country s work force  Other estimates have been lower At a separate gathering on Friday afternoon that was organized by the Center for China and Globalization  a Beijing research group  former senior American and Chinese officials also expressed worry about whether the broader relationship between China and the United States could be quickly fixed even if a trade deal were reached soon Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H  Summers warned that worries about China had become bipartisan  There is a better than even chance that the Democratic candidate in 2020  in speaking about foreign policy  will criticize Trump for being too conciliatory toward China   he said He Yafei  a former Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs  said that a visit to the United States last September had persuaded him that the climate in Washington had been altered  My view of the future is probably the one that will neither be benign or tragic  but up and down   he said  

CHARLESTON  S C    Democratic presidential candidates wasted no time Friday evening demanding the immediate public release of the long awaited report from Robert S  Mueller III  with several saying that Americans deserved to know any findings about President Trump  Russia and the 2016 election in order to form judgments about Mr  Trump and the 2020 race Former Representative Beto O Rourke  campaigning in South Carolina on Friday night  told reporters that  those facts  that truth  needs to be laid out for all Americans to be able to make informed decisions going forward  whether at the ballot box  or in their discussions with their senators and representatives Mr  O Rourke  asked if he supported impeaching Mr  Trump  said he believed the president and his 2016 campaign  at least sought to collude with the Russian government to undermine our democracy  and that Mr  Trump  sought to obstruct justice  once in office  I think those are grounds enough for members of the House to bring up the issue of impeachment   he said   But whether they do or not  this will ultimately be decided by the American public at the ballot box in South Carolina and in every state of the union  No voters brought up the Mueller report to Mr  O Rourke as he spoke to them Friday  Indeed  in the hours after the announcement of the report  Democratic candidates reacted over Twitter or in remarks at events rather than in back and forth conversations with voters Several candidates  in calling for the swift release of the report  also sought to gather new supporters and their email addresses by putting out  petitions  calling for complete transparency from the Justice Department  The Trump Administration shouldn t get to lock up Robert Mueller s report and throw away the key   Senator Cory Booker argued on Twitter  asking people to sign a petition and provide their names and emails  Such information is often used for future fund raising solicitations Within hours of Mr  Mueller s completing his investigation  Senator Elizabeth Warren and the campaign arm of House Democrats were already placing ads on Facebook demanding the full report s release  with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee seeking 100 000 signatures for its online petition With no detailed information available about the report  Ms  Warren and Mr  Booker   as well as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris   sought to focus attention and pressure on how quickly Attorney General William P  Barr would release the full report  Attorney General Barr   release the Mueller report to the American public  Now   Ms  Warren wrote on Twitter  Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker  Ms  Gillibrand made similar demands and also retweeted the news of the report along with three words   See you Sunday   That is when Ms  Gillibrand plans to formally kick off her 2020 campaign in front of Trump International Tower in New York Ms  Harris  in addition to calling for the report to be released  immediately   called on Mr  Barr to  publicly testify under oath about the investigation and its findings  Ms  Harris  Ms  Warren and Ms  Gillibrand also joined Mr  Booker and Senator Bernie Sanders in asking supporters to sign their petitions calling for the report s immediate release Four other candidates   Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  Gov  Jay Inslee of Washington  former Representative John Delaney  and Julián Castro   also called for the release of the full report  As Donald Trump said   Let it come out    Mr  Sanders wrote on Twitter   I call on the Trump administration to make Special Counsel Mueller s full report public as soon as possible  No one  including the president  is above the law   

JERUSALEM   Amos Yadlin  the former head of military intelligence in Israel  likes to say that Israel as a Jewish majority democracy faces two existential threats   a nuclear armed Iran and turning itself into a bi national state by permanently occupying the West Bank with its 2 5 million Palestinians  And while Israel has a strategy for addressing the first threat  it has no strategy for addressing the second  One reason it doesn t   in my view   is because of a third existential threat to Israel  And that threat is from America   particularly from President Trump  but also from pro Israel lawmakers in Congress and from Aipac  the main Israel lobbying organization It s the threat that America will love Israel to death By indulging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his quest for permanent Israeli control over the West Bank  Trump  the Congress and the Israel lobby are going to create a situation whereby the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank will eventually collapse  The Palestinians there will then say to Israel  as some already have  that they want Israeli citizenship  Israel will then find itself ruling over 2 5 million Palestinians with the choice of either sharing power with them on the basis of equality or systematically denying it to them When that happens the debate over what Israel should do will rip apart every synagogue  Jewish Federation and Jewish institution in America   including Aipac  As long as there was a credible two state solution on the table  that debate was muted  But once that option is gone  all hell will break loose in the Jewish world and between progressives and Israel s supporters on every U S  college campus  It s already started Up until Trump  both Democratic and Republican presidents have played the role of  reality enforcer  for both Israeli and Arab leaders  In both Israel and most Arab ruling circles  you have a mix of hard liners  moderates and sheer crazies  The job of the U S  president has always been to draw red lines so Israeli prime ministers or Arab leaders could say to their extremists   Hey  I d love to do that crazy thing you want me to do  My heart is with you  But the American president would break my arm if I did  So we re not going to do that crazy thing you suggest  even though my heart is with you  Trump has abandoned that U S  role  Instead  he s pursuing a policy of steadily weakening the Palestinian Authority that governs the West Bank   while steadily lifting any restraints on Israel s creeping annexation of the West Bank As The Jerusalem Post noted on March 14  The change began with the U S  State Department s annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices two years ago   when the State Department replaced the country designation of  Israel and the occupied territories  with  Israel  Golan Heights  West Bank and Gaza   Within the 2017 report itself  however  the State Department last year still used the word  occupation  but much more sparingly   This year  the 2018 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices made no mention of the word  occupation  at all  Trump s  anything goes   approach for Israel  and America s Arab allies   that s how Jamal Khashoggi got assassinated by the Saudis  is presented as a strategic shift  In fact  no strategic thought has gone into it  It s actually driven by Trump s quest to get more campaign donations from far right Jewish mega donor Sheldon Adelson and to get Jews to leave the Democratic Party and vote Republican   by getting Bibi s blessings for Trump  and  in return  giving Bibi anything he wants  including a tacit presidential endorsement for his re election Many Aipac officials know that all this could end in disaster for Israel  but they are too afraid to speak out So now we have a situation whereby the U S  keeps weakening and threatening the Palestinian Authority and its president  Mahmoud Abbas  for  incitement   against Israelis  while turning a blind eye to Abbas s very real and vital  quiet security cooperation with Israel   and while saying nothing when Netanyahu provokes Israeli Arabs  telling them they are not real citizens of Israel  only Jews are Netanyahu s incitements against Israeli Arabs aim to make it impossible for his opponents to form a governing coalition with them that could oust him from power  At the same time  Bibi has forged a partnership with the far right Jewish Power party  a party so racist and anti Arab that Israel s Supreme Court last week banned its leader from running for Parliament It s disgusting  but the Trump administration has not uttered a word of condemnation for Bibi s alliance with anti Arab racists  nor have Democrats in Congress  who were   rightly   quick to denounce Congresswoman Ilhan Omar s anti Semitic tropes about the Israel lobby This double standard has strategic consequences  I carry no brief for the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank  It is corrupt and mismanaged and does at times incite violence  but Abbas is the last best hope for a two state deal between Israelis and Palestinians  The P A  also provides a basic infrastructure for Palestinian life and  as any Israeli intelligence official will tell you  it provides vital  daily cooperation with Israeli security services that have kept the West Bank largely quiet for years   and relieved Israel of the costs and headache of administering it directly The reckless Hamas rocket attack on a home in central Israel  injuring seven Israelis  underscores that Israel has real enemies from which it needs to defend itself  But Hamas is not an existential threat to Israel  If the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank  which  as I said  tacitly cooperates with Israel on security  collapses while Israel has to fight Hamas   or if West Bank Palestinian youth decide  in mass  to join Hamas in clashing with Israel   the strategic challenge for Israel would be enormous But the arms race between Trump and the Democrats over who can be more unblinkingly pro Israel has led to a series of punitive U S  actions   the March 2018  Taylor Force Act  the October 2018 Anti Terrorism Clarification Act  and the ending of all U S  contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency  Unrwa  which funds Palestinian schools and social services   that have brought the Palestinian Authority close to collapse This only hastens the day when Palestinians will say to Bibi and Trump   O K   you guys won  We lost  The two state solution is gone  so let us become Israeli citizens and give us the vote  Ah  but such a disaster will be avoided  you say  because President Trump has his son in law  Jared Kushner  working on a peace plan for the West Bank and Jerusalem and after the Israeli election he ll unveil it  Not so fast  Here s the quandary Trump and Kushner may find themselves tangled in The Israeli attorney general   whom Bibi appointed   has leveled multiple corruption charges against Netanyahu  Bibi is in real legal peril  The only way for him to save himself from the consequences of the indictment is to fight the charges while remaining as prime minister and perhaps trying to bargain for dismissal of the charges in return for stepping down  But the only way he can stay in power while facing indictment is to form a right wing religious coalition that will stand by him  Every other party will either refuse to join his coalition or desert him at the time of indictment   But such a right wing government will not accept any meaningful concessions to the Palestinians   a former U S  ambassador to Israel  Martin Indyk  pointed out to me  To the contrary   The right wing members of such a coalition will insist on annexing parts or all of the West Bank  now that Trump has green lighted that by recognizing Israel s annexation of the Golan  So the irony is that by helping Bibi get re elected  which Trump is obviously trying to do  he is ensuring the creation of a right wing government that will reject his peace plan and any prospect for peace with the Palestinians  In sum  There is no U S  strategy here   not from Trump or Congress  There is only a competition over who can love Israel to death the most   for their own reasons So Trump will get his campaign contributions from Adelson  Bibi will try to win re election with Trump s help  to avoid jail by partnering with a racist Israeli party  the Palestinians will get blamed for everything  only some of which they ll deserve  Aipac will have a banner year raising money  Israel will keep moving toward formally or informally annexing the West Bank  and the question of whether or not to still support Israel   when it s no longer a Jewish democracy   will tear apart every synagogue and Jewish organization across the world And the Aipac convention of 2022 will feature a panel it s never had before   Who lost Israel   The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this

WASHINGTON   The investigation led by Robert S  Mueller III found no evidence that President Trump or any of his aides coordinated with the Russian government s 2016 election interference  according to a summary of the special counsel s key findings made public on Sunday by Attorney General William P  Barr Mr  Mueller  who spent nearly two years investigating Moscow s determined effort to sabotage the last presidential election  found no conspiracy  despite multiple offers from Russian affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign   Mr  Barr wrote in a letter to lawmakers Mr  Mueller s team drew no conclusions about whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed justice  Mr  Barr said  so he made his own decision  The attorney general and his deputy  Rod J  Rosenstein  determined that the special counsel s investigators had insufficient evidence to establish that the president committed that offense He cautioned  however  that Mr  Mueller s report states that  while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  on the obstruction of justice issue Still  the release of the findings was a significant political victory for Mr  Trump and lifted a cloud that has hung over his presidency since before he took the oath of office  It is also likely to alter discussion in Congress about the fate of the Trump presidency  some Democrats had pledged to wait until the special counsel finished his work before deciding whether to initiate impeachment proceedings Read Attorney General William Barr s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter  by Attorney General William P  Barr  details the main findings of the special counsel s two year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election  Read the key Mueller findings  The president trumpeted the news almost immediately  even as he mischaracterized the special counsel s findings   It was a complete and total exoneration   Mr  Trump told reporters in Florida before boarding Air Force One   It s a shame that our country had to go through this  To be honest  it s a shame that your president has had to go through this  He added   This was an illegal takedown that failed  Mr  Barr s letter was the culmination of a tense two days since Mr  Mueller delivered his report to the Justice Department  Mr  Barr spent the weekend poring over the special counsel s work  as Mr  Trump strategized with lawyers and political aides at his Mar a Lago estate in Florida Mr  Mueller  who has been a spectral presence in the capital for nearly two years   so often discussed  but so rarely seen   was photographed leaving a church on Sunday morning just across Lafayette Square from the White House ImageListen to  The Daily   Coordination  Not

hear me michael schmidtYeah  hold on  hold on  hold on  Wearing two headphones right now maggie habermanMm  Sounds about right michael schmidtCan you hear me  Oh  that s better maggie habermanWe gotcha  We re just waiting on the star michael barbaroHi maggie habermanIt s Michael Barbaro  host of  The Daily  michael schmidtDoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today   Attorney General William Barr has sent a letter to Congress summarizing the findings of the special counsel investigation  No coordination with Russia  More complicated on obstruction of justice  My colleagues Maggie Haberman and Mike Schmidt explain  It s Monday  March 25  O K  Maggie  like  it is 6 00 p m  on Sunday evening  Two hours ago  the attorney general  Bill Barr  sent a letter to congressional leaders outlining the major conclusions of the special counsel s report michael schmidtThe report is broken into two parts  The first one is on the biggest  most central question that has surrounded the president since he was elected  What are the ties between his campaign and Russia  And on that issue  Barr is unequivocal michael barbaroWhat does he say michael schmidtHe says there are no ties between what Russia did in the election and Trump s campaign  That despite how aggressively the Russians tried to interfere in our election  and even outreach that they made to the campaign  they were able to find no evidence that they actually worked together michael barbaroBut Mike  help me understand this  In the lead up to the report  the Mueller investigation issued a number of subpoenas and charges that felt like they revealed forms of collusion  I m thinking about Papadopoulos  Manafort  a meeting inside Trump Tower that involved the president s son and his son in law  Those all felt like forms of collusion michael schmidtI think that what went on was that the Trump campaign was sort of collusion curious in the sense that they were open to sort of talking to anyone about anything  And the Russians were reaching out right  And that meant that there were a lot of odd contacts that occurred  What I think Mueller and Barr are saying is that even though a lot of that stuff looks funky  we have no evidence that they linked hands and tried to work together to hurt Clinton michael barbaroSo collusion curious does not equal coordination maggie habermanNo  Being interested in getting information is something that you have heard either the president say or people around the president say  You know  of course  we took these meetings  Of course when people reached out to us  we listened to them  Who wouldn t  Their argument has been that they were just doing what anyone would do  And the other argument they ve made repeatedly is that they were too discombobulated and too green and too new at this to even know how to collude  And as someone who covered that campaign  I can tell you there is some logic to that argument michael barbaroAs somebody who s slightly more removed from the day to day of this investigation than either of you  it s starting to feel from this summary from Bill Barr of the Mueller report that what the investigation found was what we all kind of knew the investigation found as it was finding  That there was nothing all that big being held back  And that helps us understand this conclusion maggie habermanWhat we saw in indictments either of Paul Manafort  or of his deputy Rick Gates  who pleaded guilty  or of Mike Flynn or George Papadopoulos  this might have been  it seems  all there was  This was all the information that they were able to prove existed michael barbaroMike  what do you think of that michael schmidtLet s go back and look at the indictments and guilty pleas  George Papadopoulos  a campaign official who had contacts with individuals who said the Russians were going to be releasing information about Hillary Clinton s emails before it came out  When George Papadopoulos pleads guilty  he does not plead guilty to conspiring with the Russians  He pleads guilty to making false statements to investigators about that contact  The president s former national security adviser  Michael Flynn  has these odd phone calls with the Russian ambassador during the transition in which they discuss lifting sanctions that have just been imposed by the Obama administration for election meddling  When Mike Flynn goes into court to plead guilty  he doesn t plead guilty to conspiring with the Russians  He pleads guilty to making false statements to the F B I  about it  So as we went along in the investigation over the past 22 months  we never saw charges that said that the campaign conspired with Russia  There was some question   was Mueller holding out something like that until the end  Was he going to wait and then make a move on it  Well  today  we know that they never found anything michael barbaroRight  He wasn t making those kinds of indictments because he didn t have any evidence of it maggie habermanOr at least he didn t have enough to bring an indictment  I mean  he might have found strains of information  he might have found pieces along the way  but it clearly was not enough to bring a charge michael barbaroSo in the end  this was a bunch of people around the president lying  perhaps to avoid what might look like coordination if they were going to tell the truth  but not actually coordinating  according to the legal definition michael schmidtCorrect michael barbaroAnd what about the second question in this letter  the question of obstruction of justice  What does Barr s summary of the Mueller report say about that michael schmidtSo the obstruction part is not nearly as clean cut as the collusion section  On obstruction  Barr essentially says that Mueller did not come to his own determination on whether the president obstructed justice  That Mueller could not indict or exonerate the president for that charge  But that left the door open for Barr to say  look  Mueller has not made a determination on this  I  as the attorney general  along with the deputy attorney general  Rod Rosenstein  will make that call  And we do not believe there is a case to be made the president obstructed justice michael barbaroI don t quite understand what s going on here  Why do we think  Mike  that Mueller declined to weigh in on this question of obstruction of justice  Why leave it kind of up in the air maggie habermanThere s not really a full explanation for that  And I m not sure  For the past 22 months  Democrats and a lot of folks in the media have built Mueller up as sort of this paragon of justice  and someone who was willing and able to go out and make determinations and calls on really tough issues in non partisan  follow the facts ways  And here  we have Mueller essentially saying  I don t really have a determination on it  For each of the relevant actions  the letter says  that were investigated  the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the special counsel views as  quote   difficult issues of law and fact concerning whether the president s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction   The special counsel states that  quote   while this report does not conclude the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  michael barbaroLet s pick apart what I think we can all agree is the most salient example of this  where maybe disentangling motive and law and obstruction of justice is really tangled up  And that would be the firing of James Comey  The president at first says it s not about Russia  then goes on television  says  it really is about Russia  And yet we all know that the president can pretty much fire anyone at that level if he wants to  Is that what Bill Barr  in summarizing Mueller  is saying  That this stuff is just really difficult  and so we re not making a call maggie habermanMueller is saying this is really difficult  and it s hard to get in the president s head and know what his intent was and his frame of mind was  And he decides that he is not going to be the one to make that call  Bill Barr  not wanting  I think  to leave this as an open ended thing puts a pin in it and says  this is done michael barbaroAnd says  I will make that call maggie habermanI will make that call  And we do not believe that this is sufficient to say that the president obstructed justice  And remember  obstruction of justice was key to Richard Nixon  This was a piece that the president s folks were worried about  They had felt really confident the whole time that there would not be an evidence based case of conspiracy related to Russia  But they were concerned about what it would find on the obstruction piece michael schmidtInterestingly   and I still don t think this issue has gotten enough attention   the central question here was the president s intent when he took actions like firing Comey  But at the end of the day  the president of the United States never sat for an interview with investigators to answer those questions  So here you have the attorney general saying  this thing is done  but we ve never heard from Donald Trump on it  And the reason we never heard from Donald Trump on it was that his lawyers were so afraid that if he sat down to answer questions  he would make a factually inaccurate statement and would increase his criminal exposure michael barbaroAnd it s within the president s rights not to sit down for such an interview michael schmidtThat s not true  The Justice Department could have subpoenaed him for an interview michael barbaroBut why didn t they michael schmidtOne of the unanswered questions in this  But in an investigation where the central question was what was the president s intent  Bob Mueller was never able to ask him that question michael barbaroBut he wasn t able to ask him the question because he never issued a subpoena  He never pursued all legal avenues maggie habermanWe don t know whether he pursued a legal avenue and was told that there wasn t sufficient anything to go get a subpoena  or whether he just didn t seek one  And that is  to me right now as we sit here  an open question  I don t know whether Bob Mueller actually sought to go after this subpoena  which a lot of people thought that he would do  We re not going to know for some time michael schmidtBut what we did learn on Friday when Barr first announced the end of the Mueller investigation was there was no instance in the investigation where Mueller wanted to take a major step  like indict someone  or subpoena them  or get a search warrant  in which he was told by his superiors at the Justice Department that he could not do that  So that would sort of bolster the argument that Mueller was not stopped by the Justice Department from seeking a subpoena to interview the president  He s saying there were no instances in which Mueller was stopped from moving forward with something he wanted to do michael barbaroNo matter what  in this moment where so much of this second question of obstruction of justice comes down to the president s motivation  which is essentially a matter of getting into someone s head  never hearing from President Trump feels very significant maggie habermanIt s a huge deal  Barr lays it out in this letter to Congress about what Mueller s thinking was  where he describes that the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question  And I think what you have there is the president s lawyers have repeatedly offered up explanations for why the president could have been doing something that were not necessarily nefarious or that were not undermining  And the main thing that they have said over and over is  this isn t obstruction because it s all playing out in public  It s not hidden  He has a right to express his views as a citizen of the country  And I anticipate that should we ever see what is in this report  that is going to show up a lot michael schmidtWhen Maggie and I would talk to Rudy Giuliani during the investigation  michael barbaroThe president s lawyer michael schmidtHe would say things like  obstruction of justice and trying to interfere in an investigation is going into a dark alley and threatening to break someone s leg if they cooperate with investigators  It s bribing someone to not testify  But what Giuliani said is that all this stuff is happening out in the open  He s not trying to twist anyone s arm  He s just blowing off steam about the investigation  And what conspiracy is there in that michael barbaroWere either of you surprised by either of these actions outlined in this letter when it comes to obstruction of justice   by Mueller declining to make a call  or by Barr being so quick to make a call maggie habermanI was not surprised that Mueller didn t make a call  I was surprised that Barr moved so quickly  I did not think that the collusion aspect of this letter was going to be revelatory  but I did think that the obstruction one possibly would be  And it shuts it down definitively  There is a piece of the letter that we haven t talked about  which is that Bill Barr  the attorney general  tells Congress that Robert Mueller  the special counsel  recognized that  quote   the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference  And that while not determinative  the absence of such evidence bears upon the president s intent with respect to obstruction   So a big piece of the thinking for Barr seems to have been that since there is not an underlying crime that was found related to the president  that obstruction is harder to prove michael barbaroIn other words  there is a connection between these two questions  Between coordination and obstruction of justice  That if there was no coordination  if there is no original sin  then it s hard to establish that there was obstruction of justice maggie habermanRight  If there is no crime that was committed  it is hard to suggest that the president was trying to obstruct justice in the course of pursuing evidence about that crime  And that is an argument that Mike and I also heard the president s lawyers say repeatedly  which was that there couldn t be obstruction of justice because there s nothing to obstruct michael barbaroDoes that seem like universally sound legal logic  That you can t commit a crime in obstructing investigations into something that wasn t a crime  Because it certainly feels like if someone s investigating me  and I decide to stop the investigation in violation of the law  that that could be itself a violation of a law  separate and apart from whether or not what I was being investigated for in the first place was a crime  I mean  are those two things necessarily connected michael schmidtI think there s two reasons why the Justice Department would not want to bring a case like this  The first is that if there s not an underlying crime  then do you really want to bring an obstruction case  Do you really want to go to court to try and convince a jury that someone took actions where there was nothing to cover up  I think that s a tough case to make  The second thing is that while the president huffed and puffed a lot about this investigation  I m not sure how much real damage it did to it  Bob Mueller was able to pursue his inquiry  He was not fired  They finished what they had  They weren t impeded by the Justice Department  So what was the real damage  If the president was obstructing  how did he really hurt the investigation  Give me the damage report  And I don t think at the end of the day there was that much that actually hurt Mueller s team s ability to do their job  It may have been loud  it may have been annoying  it may have been dispiriting  But I think they were able to pursue what they needed to maggie habermanI think  also  there s a third point  which is that I think that Bob Mueller was very mindful that he was dealing with the presidency and the damage that an ongoing case like this  if it was iffy  and not locked solid  not completely nailed down  could cause not just the office of the presidency  but the kind of trauma that brings to a country michael barbaroI m very struck as we re talking  Maggie and Mike  that  at least according to this letter  this is exactly what we have had in front of us all along maggie habermanUnless the report has a lot of information that we re not seeing  what we saw play out publicly is what was there  The attorney general made clear that this investigation was ending without a recommendation of more indictments  That includes sealed indictments  This is what we re getting  It will now move to Capitol Hill  and Democrats will seek to get as much material as they can  But in terms of the part the president was really concerned about in terms of Mueller  that is over michael barbaroSo let s talk about what Congress is going to do now  Congressional leaders have just received this letter  Mike  you have told us in the past that Democrats were going to be very cautious in how they proceeded under any circumstances  And that if Mueller didn t find the sort of thing that would force even Republicans in Congress to acknowledge that the president had violated the law  impeachment proceedings would be very unlikely  And it seems like this letter is not at all what Democrats would have needed to move forward in that sort of way michael schmidtI think it takes a lot of wind out of their sails  They basically have full blown investigations into obstruction and collusion going on  And here  you have Mueller  someone who has far better tools than they will ever have to investigate  coming out and clearing the president on the Russia issue and giving a mixed message on obstruction that allows Barr to clear him there  It gives the Republicans a very good argument to say  why are you guys continuing to look at these issues  Why are you continuing to rummage around in the president s life when we ve received clarity on this from the Justice Department  So I think it hurts them maggie habermanI think that you re going to see Nancy Pelosi  the Democratic House speaker  proceed carefully  As of late evening Sunday  she still had not said anything about how she was going to handle this  And I think that you are going to see a lot of Republicans reminding Democrats that they were holding Robert Mueller up as this avatar of credibility when the investigation was going on  so that it is hard to now say  we need to know more  because we need to make a determination that he couldn t  That will almost inevitably look very political michael schmidtSo the Democrats are going to ask for everything that Mueller had in the report  And it s clear from the letter that a lot of obstruction of justice issues were looked at and detailed and analyzed  And the question is that if the Democrats get their hands on that  how damaging is the obstruction stuff  And is it strong enough to give Democrats more of an oomph on their obstruction investigation michael barbaroIs it both of your understandings that Congress will get a full copy of the Mueller report that they can then examine for these answers maggie habermanI don t think that s been resolved yet michael schmidtThat s the big question michael barbaroMaggie  after months of the president calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt or worse  would it be better now for him to lean into that description or turn around and say  you know  this investigation is the gold star of investigations  and it says I m in the clear maggie habermanThere are a lot of people in the White House who are encouraging the president to turn and say  this was a highly respected prosecutor who just said there was no collusion  And I hope we can all accept this and move on  and try to strike a healing note  It is the president s political instinct to burrow into his base and say  this was a witch hunt  this was a hoax  And that is what I have heard a number of his advisers say publicly in the last few hours  It s what his son said in a statement that he gave me  I think they are going to go full on by telling people this was a waste of two years  This was an effort to undo an electoral result in 2016  and don t let this happen again michael barbaroAnd I wonder if you can explain for listeners why it wasn t what you just said the president might call it   a waste of two years  A waste of everyone s time and an effort to politically undermine him maggie habermanIt might have had the effect of undermining him  That might have been one of the impacts  But we do know  based on numerous assessments from the intelligence community  that Russians did seek to interfere in the 2016 election  We do know that there were many contacts between Russians and people involved in the Trump campaign  So trying to find out what was at the heart of that  one would think  was not a waste of time  And now there is an answer  There is a world in which the president could say  this gave me a clean bill of health  and now you can trust me going forward michael barbaroMike  I want to ask you the same question  What is your explanation for why this investigation was not a waste of time michael schmidtWell  there were legitimate issues and questions that had to be answered  And along the way  the president took action after action that only made the perception that he did something wrong worse  He fired the F B I  director  He asked the F B I  director to end an investigation into whether his former national security adviser was talking improperly to the Russian ambassador  He said things publicly about the investigation time and time again to demonize the investigators  He criticized his own attorney general  who recused himself from the Russia investigation  He called Mueller s team a bunch of angry Democrats  He made the perception worse  And there were things that he did that walked up to the line of obstruction and had to be looked at  that had to be sorted through  Whether it was to clear the president and say  hey  look  he did nothing wrong  for his sake  or to give the public some confidence that the president of the United States was not a Russian agent michael barbaroSo among the questions that had to be answered in an investigation into Russian interference in our election  regardless of the answer  was what was the president s role in this  And it happens to be that the answer was seemingly nothing illegal  But that answer had to be unearthed michael schmidtA significant portion of the country thought that the president of the United States either wittingly or unwittingly had worked with a foreign adversary to influence the election  That was something that had to be looked into michael barbaroAnd because he didn t do that  Bill Barr also believes he did not obstruct this investigation michael schmidtThere was nothing to obstruct maggie habermanAt least that s what they found michael barbaroNo one asked me  but  maggie habermanMichael  what do you think michael barbaroI think that Russia could never have fathomed just how cosmically disruptive their efforts to influence the election would be maggie habermanI think they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams  yes michael schmidtLook at how distracted we ve been as a country because of this for the past two years  Think about all the other issues that we could have been talking about or looking at  This was an enormous  enormous distraction for the country maggie habermanAnd for Donald Trump michael barbaroMaggie  Mike  thank you very much maggie habermanThank you michael schmidtThanks for having us archived recording  donald trump So after a long look  after a long investigation  after so many people have been so badly hurt  after not looking at the other side  where a lot of bad things happened  a lot of horrible things happened  a lot of very bad things happened for our country  it was just announced there was no collusion with Russia  The most ridiculous thing I ve ever heard  michael barbaroOn Sunday afternoon  on his way back to Washington from his home in Florida  President Trump addressed the major findings of the Mueller report archived recording  donald trump There was no obstruction  and none whatsoever  And it was a complete and total exoneration  It s a shame that our country had to go through this  To be honest  it s a shame that your president has had to go through this for   before I even got elected  it began  And it began illegally  And hopefully  somebody is going to look at the other side  This was an illegal takedown that failed  And hopefully  somebody is going to be looking at the other side  So it s complete  michael barbaroNot long after  the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  Representative Jerry Nadler of New York  disputed the president s characterization of the Mueller report during a news conference in New York archived recording  jerry nadler Earlier today  I received a four page letter from Attorney General Barr outlining his summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report while making a few questionable legal arguments of his own  I take from this letter three points  First  President Trump is wrong  This report does not amount to a so called  total exoneration  michael barbaroNadler seemed to accept Mueller s conclusion that the president did not coordinate with Russia  but seized on less definitive statements made by Mueller and Barr about whether the president obstructed justice archived recording  jerry nadler The attorney general s comments make it clear that Congress must step in to get the truth and provide full transparency to the American people  The president has not been exonerated by the special counsel  Yet the attorney general has decided not to go further or  apparently  to share those findings with the public  We cannot simply rely on what may be a hasty partisan interpretation of the facts michael barbaroThat s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow Hours later  Mr  Barr delivered his letter describing the special counsel s findings to Congress  But congressional Democrats have demanded more  and the letter could be just the beginning of a lengthy constitutional battle between Congress and the Justice Department about whether Mr  Mueller s full report will be made public  Democrats have also called for the attorney general to turn over all of the special counsel s investigative files Mr  Barr s letter said that his  goal and intent  was to release as much of the Mueller report as possible  but warned that some of the report was based on grand jury material that  by law cannot be made public   Mr  Barr planned at a later date to send lawmakers the detailed summary of Mr  Mueller s full report that the attorney general is required under law to deliver to Capitol Hill Video It was just announced there was no collusion with Russia   President Trump said Sunday after the attorney general s summary was released  Mr  Trump added   It s a shame that our country had to go through this  CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesLawmakers on Sunday also criticized Mr  Barr s conclusion that the president had not obstructed justice   which requires making a determination about whether Mr  Trump had  corrupt intent  when he took steps to impede the investigation at different turns   when the special counsel s team never questioned the president in person  After months of debate over a potential interview  Mr  Mueller s investigators agreed to accept written answers from the president Mr  Barr s letter said that the Mueller report identified no actions that  in his and Mr  Rosenstein s minds   constitute obstructive conduct  had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding  and were done with corrupt intent   Mr  Barr did not consult Mr  Mueller in writing his letter to leaders of the congressional judiciary committees  a Justice Department official said on Sunday Shortly after the release of the Mueller findings  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  said on Twitter that he planned to call Mr  Barr to testify about what he said were  very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department  The Russia investigation has buffeted the White House from the earliest days of the Trump administration  with many current and former aides to Mr  Trump brought for questioning to the special counsel s warren of offices in a plain office building in downtown Washington  F B I  agents fanned out across the nation and traveled to numerous foreign countries  Members of Mr  Mueller s team questioned some witnesses at airports after they landed in the United States Ultimately  a half dozen former Trump aides were indicted or convicted of crimes  most for conspiracy or lying to investigators  Twenty five Russian intelligence operatives and experts in social media manipulation were charged last year in two extraordinarily detailed indictments released by the special counsel  The inquiry concluded without charging any Americans for conspiring with the Russian campaign Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation The findings could bring closure for some who have obsessed over the myriad threads of a byzantine investigation  A cottage industry of Mueller watchers has spent months on social media and cable news debating thorny constitutional issues  spinning conspiracy theories and amassing encyclopedic details about once obscure figures   Carter Page  Konstantin V  Kilimnik  George Papadopoulos and others How many minds it changes is another matter  Opinions have hardened over time  with many Americans already convinced they knew the answers before Mr  Mueller submitted his conclusions  Some believe that the special counsel s previous indictments  twinned with voluminous news reporting  have already shown a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin  Some believe that the investigation is  as Mr  Trump has long described it  a  witch hunt  To prove a conspiracy  former prosecutors said  Mr  Mueller s team would have had to show that Mr  Trump or one or more of his associates agreed that Russia should interfere in the election through computer espionage  illegal use of social media or other criminal means Campaign officials at times were eager to accept benefits from Russia s covert operation   I love it   Donald Trump Jr   the president s eldest son  responded when an intermediary said a Russian emissary wanted to give the campaign damaging information on Hillary Clinton at a Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 Mr  Trump himself urged Russia to try to unearth deleted emails from a private server Mrs  Clinton had used when she was secretary of state ImageWilliam P  Barr  the attorney general  leaving his home on Sunday morning in McLean  Va CreditAlex Wong Getty ImagesAnd Roger J  Stone  Jr   the president s longtime friend  tried to enlist intermediaries to connect with WikiLeaks  Russia s chosen depository for Democratic emails stolen by Russian hackers But absent an agreement with the Russian government to break the law  former Justice Department officials said  none of that made Mr  Trump or his associates into co conspirators with the Kremlin  There is a big difference between saying   Gosh  I think WikiLeaks has the ability to hack into the Democratic National Committee computers  and saying  We would like them to dump those out in the public  so let s call them up and ask them to do that    said Mary McCord  a former top ranking national security official at the Justice Department The release of Mr  Mueller s findings could force a decision by Democrats on a simmering issue they have said would wait until the investigation s end  whether to begin impeachment proceedings against the president  Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has said it would not be  worth it  to try to impeach Mr  Trump  but suggested she could change her mind if an overwhelming bipartisan consensus emerged For months  the president and his lawyers have waged as much of a public relations campaign as a legal one   trying to discredit the Mueller investigation to keep public opinion from swaying lawmakers to move against Mr  Trump Glimpses of the Mystery That Is the Mueller InvestigationHere are some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle  The full picture is missing Mr  Mueller s work has proceeded in the face of blistering attacks by Mr  Trump and his allies  who painted the investigation as part of a relentless campaign by the  deep state  to reverse the results of the 2016 election He was given a wide mandate   to investigate not only Russian election interference but also  any matters that may arise directly from that investigation   Mr  Mueller has farmed out multiple aspects of his inquiry to several United States attorneys  offices  and those investigations continue Mr  Barr s letter said that the special counsel s office employed 19 lawyers and was assisted by about 40 F B I  agents  intelligence analysts  forensic accountants and other staff  About 500 witnesses were interviewed  and 13 foreign governments were asked to turn over evidence Over all  the special counsel s office issued more than 2 800 subpoenas  executed nearly 500 search warrants and obtained more than 230 orders for communications records The Justice Department regulations governing the Mueller inquiry only required the special counsel to give a succinct  confidential report to the attorney general explaining his decisions to either seek   or decline to seek   further criminal charges  Mr  Mueller operated under tighter restrictions than similar past inquiries  notably the investigation of President Bill Clinton by Ken Starr  who ended up delivering a 445 page report in 1998 that contained lascivious details about an affair the president had with a White House intern Mr  Mueller will not recommend new indictments  ending speculation that he might charge some of Mr  Trump s aides in the future  The Justice Department s general practice is not to identify the targets of its investigations if prosecutors decide not to bring charges  so as not to tarnish their reputations  Mr  Rosenstein emphasized this point in a speech last month  It s important   Mr  Rosenstein said   for government officials to refrain from making allegations of wrongdoing when they re not backed by charges that we are prepared to prove in court   

Four years ago  a sympathizer of the Islamic State told me that the group s caliphate was hardier than believed and would survive near total loss of territorial control   So long as there is one street in one village where the caliph carries out Islamic law   he told me   the dawla will be legitimate     Dawla  means state in Arabic   All Muslims would remain obliged to travel there  he said   It would be one very crowded street   No rival caliph could challenge Abu Bakr al Baghdadi  the Islamic State s leader  as long as he ruled this alley and did it according to Islam Last week  the caliphate finally dwindled down to that one alley  and on Saturday it vanished entirely  The Syrian Democratic Forces sacked the Islamic State s last minuscule barrio in the town of Baghuz  in eastern Syria  after a weekslong siege   One street in one village  may overstate the size of that last patch  In a recent video attributed to the Islamic State  apparently from just days ago  the area looked like a small junkyard defended by vagrants  Several years back  the Islamic State circulated videos of its fighters living among swimming pools and well stocked shops  In the junkyard videos  it looked as if no one had bathed for weeks  Many of the inhabitants hobbled around on crutches  and some of the few working vehicles were wheelchairs To see the Islamic State reduced to these indignities is a pleasure worth savoring  Now that we ve savored it  though  it is time to confront the threat that remains   which is not merely  as President Trump claimed this weekend   losers  who will  resurface   on occasion   It is a systemic threat More than 40 000 foreigners are thought to have traveled to territory controlled by the Islamic State  and most are missing  David Malet  a political scientist at American University who studies foreign fighters  told me recently that when such combatants have traveled to war zones in the past  they have died at a rate of about one third  Even if we assume that  say  half of the Islamic State s foreigner fighters are dead   after all  many joined the group to die   that leaves about 20 000 alive We have little idea where they are and seriously undercounted them in Baghuz  In recent weeks  Islamic State fighters and civilians have emerged from the town as if from a clown car  disgorged in ever more unbelievable numbers  The most astonishing sight over the past week may have been a video showing fighters who had surrendered  preferring captivity to martyrdom  in a line stretching more than 250 men long  Yet many more fighters may be hiding in the countryside than have turned themselves over or died in Baghuz The Islamic State has had years to prepare for this moment and for some time had signaled that it was resigned to eventually losing some or all of its territory  By May 2016  its spokesman  Abu Muhammad al Adnani  was telling followers abroad not to bother traveling to Syria   If one of you wishes and strives to reach the lands of the Islamic State  then each of us wishes to be in your place to make examples of the crusaders  day and night  scaring them and terrorizing them  until every neighbor fears his neighbor   he said in an audio message  Since then  some sympathizers had stayed in the shrinking caliphate  while others stayed abroad or slunk out of the doomed territory to perpetuate the group s ideals and re spawn it elsewhere To see how slinking is done right  they needed only look to their forefathers  The founders of the Islamic State consisted of Qaeda veterans who escaped destruction by the American military and Sunni tribes in Iraq  Tactical retreat served them well  and the Islamic State has not lost the institutional wisdom that allowed those men to survive and then recapture territory  first slowly  then in 2014 all at once  They succeeded by positioning themselves as guardians of Sunnis who did not trust the Shiite led government in Baghdad or the Alawite led one in Damascus  Neither Iraq nor Syria has restored Sunnis  trust Of the more than 40 000 foreigners who joined the Islamic State  several thousand have returned to their home countries   not always to face prosecution  Some pessimists worry that these returnees constitute a fifth column  outwardly rehabilitated but secretly ready to attack on command  History suggests that our concerns should not be so narrow  The danger comes not just from plotters but also from their ideas  The spread of Islamic State ideology long predated the declaration of a caliphate  and it happened quietly  through the efforts of remarkably few individuals  Returnees from jihad do not always fight again  but their passion can infect others  Arab veterans of the Afghan war in the 1980s influenced the generation that fought in Iraq  The number of returnees from the Islamic State now may dwarf them In a few years  even some of those convicted of terrorist offenses will be free again   Remember  Europeans tend not to lock up people for as long as Americans do   Consider John Walker Lindh  the American who fought for Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison in 2002  He is scheduled for release in May and appears to have remained a devout extremist  Such ideas do not reliably dissolve with time  They sometimes become more concentrated  Prepare for a new wave of true believers  recruited by the old The Islamic State is like herpes  It can be managed but never cured  Syria is scabbing over  and it might begin to heal  Elsewhere  though  the condition is dormant at best  It will break out again Graeme Wood  a staff writer at The Atlantic  is the author of  The Way of the Strangers  Encounters With the Islamic State   The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of

WASHINGTON   President Trump went on the offensive on Monday a day after the special counsel investigation reported no conspiracy with Russia  suggesting that critics who pursued such suspicions were  treasonous   guilty of  evil things  and should be investigated themselves Grim faced and simmering with anger  Mr  Trump repeated his assertion that a collection of partisan foes had effectively conspired to try to disrupt or even end his presidency with false allegations about his campaign s ties with Moscow in 2016  There are a lot of people out there that have done some very  very evil things  some bad things  I would say some treasonous things against our country   he told reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel   And hopefully people that have done such harm to our country   we ve gone through a period of really bad things happening   those people will certainly be looked at  I ve been looking at them for a long time   he added   and I m saying why haven t they been looked at  They lied to Congress  many of them  you know who they are  They ve done so many evil things  The president s comments expanded on the theme he expressed on Sunday after the Justice Department reported that the special counsel investigation by Robert S  Mueller III had wrapped up without finding a criminal scheme to influence the presidential election in tandem with Russia s government  With the Mueller inquiry behind him  Mr  Trump seems intent on turning the tables on his foes Mr  Trump took a softer line toward Mr  Mueller himself  Asked at an earlier appearance with Mr  Netanyahu on Monday whether Mr  Mueller had acted honorably  Mr  Trump said   Yes  he did  Yes  he did  Mr  Trump indicated that he would support releasing the full report by Mr  Mueller  as demanded by congressional Democrats   Up to the attorney general   he said   Wouldn t bother me at all  But he brushed off a question about whether he was considering pardons of any of the associates who were convicted or pleaded guilty during Mr  Mueller s inquiry   Haven t thought about it   he said  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is moving ahead with its proposal to require drug companies to disclose the often sky high prices of their products in television commercials  despite strenuous objections and the threat of legal challenges by drug makers and TV broadcasters The White House is reviewing the text of a final rule to impose the requirement  contending that the disclosures  will provide manufacturers with an incentive to reduce their list prices by exposing overly costly drugs to public scrutiny  President Trump has rolled back dozens of Obama era regulations affecting financial services  energy and the environment  But he has been willing to impose new rules to rein in what he describes as outrageously high drug prices  and administration officials say these efforts will be politically popular In a poll last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation  nearly nine in 10 Americans said they supported requiring drug companies to include list prices in their advertisements  Democrats and Republicans were equally likely to favor it Mr  Trump vowed in the Rose Garden of the White House last May that he would  bring soaring drug prices back down to earth   He said this past week that  prescription drug prices have come down  for the first time in 51 years  crediting Alex M  Azar II  the secretary of health and human services  for the development The administration wants drug makers to disclose the list prices of drugs in television advertisements  and in many ads  the sticker shock could be considerable  Two dosing pens of Humira  AbbVie s heavily advertised rheumatoid arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis medication  have an average retail price of  5 684  according to the website GoodRx  which tracks drug prices  Xeljanz  a Pfizer arthritis medication in heavy television rotation  costs about  80 a pill  Cosentyx  a Novartis medication for psoriasis  has a list price that amounts to  67 325 a year  the company said Drug companies say such information would be misleading in an advertisement because most consumers pay less than the list price  and they are lobbying the White House in an effort to kill or delay the rule  Officials could not say how long the White House review would take or when the final rule would be in place  Requiring list price disclosures could result in increased consumer confusion and may potentially deter patients from seeking care   Robert W  Jones  a senior vice president for United States government relations at Pfizer  said in a recent letter to Seema Verma  the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Eli Lilly  the pharmaceutical company where Mr  Azar was once a top executive  said   Many patients may incorrectly surmise that they are required to pay the full list price  rather than a co pay or coinsurance  Drug makers spent nearly  4 5 billion on television advertising of prescription drugs last year  according to Kantar Media  an ad tracking company Even some people who desperately want lower drug prices question how effective the disclosure requirement would be David Mitchell  the founder of Patients for Affordable Drugs  a nonprofit advocacy group  said that the disclosure of list prices in TV ads could be helpful to patients  but he added   We have not seen any evidence that it will lower drug prices  We do not believe drug companies will be shamed by public displays of prices   Mr  Mitchell has a blood cancer called multiple myeloma Carl E  Schmid II  the deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute  a public policy and advocacy organization  said   The list price is an inflated price and does not represent what the patient pays  nor for that matter  what the pharmaceutical company receives  In and of itself  it is not a useful figure for patients  What they need to know is how much a drug will actually cost them at the time of sale  When the Trump administration proposed the price disclosure requirement last fall  Mr  Azar called it a  historic action  to reduce drug prices by providing consumers with more information But in the fine print of the proposed rule  the Department of Health and Human Services made some notable concessions  It acknowledged that  Congress has not explicitly provided H H S  with authority to compel the disclosure of list prices to the public  In addition  while extolling the benefits of  price transparency   the department said that  consumers  intimidated and confused by high list prices  may be deterred from contacting their physicians about drugs or medical conditions   This  in turn   could discourage patients from using beneficial medications  and  potentially increase  the total cost of care  the department said in a preamble to its proposed rule Two powerful lobbies  the National Association of Broadcasters and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  contend that the disclosure requirement would be a form of  compelled speech  in violation of the First Amendment  Their comments on the proposed rule provide a road map for possible lawsuits challenging the mandate The required disclosure of list prices has no rational connection to the government s stated goal of reducing drug prices paid by Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries  said Rick Kaplan  an executive vice president of the broadcasters association James C  Stansel  the top lawyer at the drug makers lobby known as PhRMA  said there were  other  much less intrusive ways to make cost information available to patients   For example  he said  Congress could authorize the Medicare agency to disclose list price data itself  along with cost sharing information for beneficiaries  on a government sponsored website When the White House issued a  blueprint to lower drug prices  with several dozen ideas last year  it directed the Food and Drug Administration to consider requiring drug makers to include list prices in advertising  The agency has clear legal authority to regulate drug ads  but it is not issuing the new rule  Rather  it was drafted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services The Trump administration says this is justified because the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid is  the single largest drug payer in the nation  But its authority is sure to be challenged  Federal law  delegates regulatory power over prescription drug advertising to F D A   not C M S    Mr  Stansel said  Both agencies are part of the Health and Human Services Department The drug industry is poised to roll out an alternative to Mr  Trump s plan  PhRMA companies say they will voluntarily include information in TV ads directing viewers to company websites that provide data on list prices  typical out of pocket costs and sources of financial assistance for patients who need it  With many drugs now costing more than  50 000 a year  many people do need assistance Johnson   Johnson is going further  It plans to disclose the list prices of its prescription drugs  as well as potential out of pocket costs  in television ads  It will start in the next couple of weeks with its most widely prescribed medicine  Xarelto  a blood thinner  which has a list price of  448 a month The administration plan to require disclosure of drug prices is supported by the American Medical Association  the American Hospital Association  America s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  as well as by Senator Charles E  Grassley  the Iowa Republican who is the chairman of the Finance Committee  and Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the No  2 Senate Democrat  

To the Editor Re  Mueller Finds No Trump Russia Conspiracy but Stops Short of Exonerating President on Obstruction of Justice   nytimes com  March 24  Let s be perfectly clear  While the Mueller report may not have found that President Trump colluded with the Russians to meddle in the 2016 election  it did not specifically clear him of all wrongdoing  Mr  Trump s conduct did not meet the rigorous legal standard of participating in a criminal conspiracy  but it was far from being blameless  There is incontrovertible proof that Russia interfered in our electoral process on behalf of Donald Trump  few disagree with this  It is also clear that President Trump s rhetoric and actions have been highly aligned with the interests of the Russian government  So President Trump and his fellow Republicans may gloat that the Mueller report has fundamentally exonerated the president  but it has not alleviated valid concerns about his past and continuing behavior toward Russia One of the terrible unintended consequences of the Mueller report is that it will not force the president to publicly acknowledge and reject Russia s election meddling  Nor will it force him to allocate the resources necessary to actively thwart President Vladimir V  Putin from doing so again in 2020  Mr  Trump  you may regard yourself as a winner who has been vindicated  but the American people and our free democratic electoral process are the losers  In 1974  after President Richard M  Nixon resigned  the new president  Gerald R  Ford  said   Our long national nightmare is over   My hope is in January 2021  our newly inaugurated president will be able to say the same thing about the Trump era  Sadly that is not yet the case Ken DerowSwarthmore  Pa To the Editor As an American and a Democrat  I am relieved to learn that the special counsel s investigation has not found that the president worked with Russia to further his campaign  I believe that my fellow Democrats  and all Americans  should share such relief That does not mean  however  that the president is fit to remain in office  and we should keep in mind how extraordinary it is that there could be serious questions about the relationship between him and those close to him and a hostile foreign power  Moreover  many of the pertinent questions about that relationship remain unanswered Jonathan J  MargolisBrookline  Mass To the Editor After Attorney General William Barr s letter to Congress summarizing and sparingly quoting the Mueller report  President Trump and his family must be relieved  Regardless of the substantive details in the report  which will emerge  be analyzed and should be taken seriously  a critical question is how this will play out politically  As a scholar of communication  I believe that the president is in a rhetorically advantageous position to spin the Mueller report  The Democrats must be careful not to get lost in the weeds  Admittedly  the report concluded that the investigation did not  exonerate  Mr  Trump  and it must be noted that it was the attorney general who inferred that there was insufficient evidence legally to prove obstruction of justice  Nevertheless  these may be overly nuanced points for Democrats to hang their hats on  But from a persuasion perspective  it will be incumbent on them to make clear that any remaining issues they wish to pursue are of importance to all Americans and not motivated by partisanship Richard CherwitzAustin  Tex  The writer is a professor at the Moody College of Communication  University of Texas To the Editor  I am no fan of President Trump  but I do not share the enthusiasm of politicians and pundits to examine the findings of the Mueller inquiry  Put simply  my mind is made up about President Trump  and I dare say that the great majority of plain folks like me will greet this event with a big yawn  Sad to say  Donald Trump will win the 2020 election if he decides to run  no matter what the full report has to say  Matthew MenkenPrinceton  N J  

We are at risk of missing the most important lesson taught by the Mueller investigation  The rampant criminality it revealed suggests the desperate need to thoroughly investigate financial  political and electoral criminality in the United States  With the so called war on drugs in remission  Mr  Mueller s work should inspire federal and state officials to make the crimes of swampland and related white collar and cyber criminality the next priority for the nation s most talented prosecutors  For what Mr  Mueller really found  above all  was abundant evidence of crimes against democracy itself Consider that in just 22 months  Mr  Mueller s small team of lawyers and investigators indicted 34 people  and that s not counting the referrals    many of them serious criminals who were largely off the radar otherwise  Without the Mueller investigation  Paul Manafort might well still be buying carpets instead of sitting in solitary confinement  Michael Cohen might still be shaking down corporations for cash  Richard Pinedo still selling stolen identities to online buyers  and Rick Gates and Sam Patten still selling access to hostile foreign powers This group of criminals were caught by happenstance  They had the misfortune of having some association with Donald Trump and the further coincidence of a special counsel appointment  That prompts a question  Just how many other Manaforts  Cohens and Gateses are still operating out there Do we really imagine that Mr  Manafort and Mr  Gates are the only well connected people in Washington who have had the idea of taking millions from foreign governments in exchange for promises of influence while seeking to conceal these payments  Does it seem likely that the Russians are the only ones who will ever try to hack an election by trolling  phishing and the intentional dissemination of defamatory propaganda  And what are the odds that Mr  Cohen is the only man in New York guilty of major tax evasion and making major in kind contributions to a candidate without reporting them  The real bottom line of the Mueller report is that the future of law enforcement will not be found on street corners  It will be along the K Street corridor  the offices of unsavory real estate developers and the darkest alleys of the information superhighway While the Manafort Gates indictments suggest diving into the underside of lobbying  the electoral tampering charges directed at the Russian troll farms and hackers suggest newer and even more pressing priorities  Mr  Mueller s indictments were limited to Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election  But the United States has plenty of domestic trolls and malicious hackers  too  Some of them threaten journalists  others have already used millions of stolen identities to attack federal agencies with fake opinions  To say this is an area of national vulnerability is a gross understatement There is far more to the agenda suggested by the Mueller probe than just putting some bad guys in jail  What the indicted targets threatened were key pillars of democracy itself  including an uncorrupted electoral process  a government free from secret foreign influence and the credibility of the main channels of speech  It is the constitutional duty of law enforcement to protect the basic institutions of democracy  but other priorities have taken precedence Such as the so called war on drugs  Since the 1970s  when President Richard Nixon announced it  federal and state law enforcement has been asked to put much of their time and resources into fighting drug crimes  at the expense of other offenses  The result is well known to anyone who has worked in the court system or law enforcement itself  Violations of election law are rarely detected and even more rarely prosecuted  For the rich and immoral  it seems foolish not to try tax avoidance  The hard truth is that crimes committed by people like Mr  Manafort have become crimes that pay  for the chances of being caught are low  and if you are caught  the sentences are relatively light  In fact  federal corruption and white collar prosecutions are at a 20 year low and down 40 percent since 1998  according to tracking by Syracuse University There is a grave danger that the swirling politics of the Mueller report will lead us to forget what it revealed  a toxic cloud of routine criminality surrounding the American political system  It echoed previous efforts  like the F B I  s Abscam sting in the late 1970s  which yielded the corruption convictions of one senator and six congressmen  not to mention the more recent corruption trials in New York  Illinois and California This is why we need political leaders who will free up investigators and prosecutors who have been fighting the war on drugs and put them to work investigating Manafort style foreign corruption  Cohen style financial crimes and Russian style election propagandizing  The Mueller inquiry may be over  but it should inspire the work of a new generation of prosecutors who want to fight one of the great evils of our time Tim Wu   superwuster  is a law professor at Columbia  a contributing opinion

It s no secret that Donald Trump has appointed a lot of partisan  unqualified hacks to key policy positions  A few months ago my colleague Gail Collins asked readers to help her select Trump s worst cabinet member  It was a hard choice  because there were so many qualified applicants The winner  by the way  was Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  That looks like an even better call now  Ross s department has reportedly prepared a report declaring that imports of European cars threaten U S  national security  This is both ludicrous and dangerous  It gives Trump the right to start a new phase in his trade war that would inflict severe economic damage while alienating our allies   and  as a result  undermine national security Until recently  however  one agency had seemed immune to the continuing hack invasion  the Federal Reserve  the single institution most crucial to economic policymaking  Trump s Fed nominees  have  by and large  been sensible  respected economists  But that all changed last week  when Trump said he planned to nominate Stephen Moore for the Fed s Board of Governors Moore is manifestly  flamboyantly unqualified for the position  But there s a story here that goes deeper than Moore  or even Trump  it s about the whole G O P  s preference for hucksters over experts  even partisan experts About Moore  It goes almost without saying that he has been wrong about everything  I don t mean the occasional bad call  which all of us make  I mean a track record that includes predicting that George W  Bush s policies would produce a magnificent boom  Barack Obama s policies would lead to runaway inflation  tax cuts in Kansas would produce a  near immediate  boost to the state s economy  and much more  And  of course  never an acknowledgment of error or reflection on why he got it wrong  For an even deeper look at what s on Paul Krugman s mind  sign up for his weekly newsletter  Beyond that  Moore has a problem with facts  After printing a Moore op ed in which all the key numbers were wrong  one editor vowed never to publish the man s work again  And a blizzard of factual errors is standard practice in his writing and speaking  It s actually hard to find cases where Moore got a fact right Yet Moore isn t some random guy who caught Trump s eye  He has long been a prominent figure in the conservative movement  a writer for the Wall Street Journal editorial page  chief economist of the Heritage Foundation  a fixture on the right wing lecture circuit  Why You might say that the G O P  values partisan loyalty above professional competence  But that s only a partial explanation  because there are plenty of conservative economists with solid professional credentials   and some of them are pretty naked in their partisanship  too  Thus  a who s who of well known conservative economists rushed to endorse the Trump administration s outlandish claims about the benefits from its tax cut  claims they knew full well were unreasonable Nor has their partisanship been restrained and polite  Many of us are still mourning the death of Alan Krueger  the Princeton economist best known for research   since vindicated by many other studies   showing that increases in the minimum wage don t usually seem to reduce employment  Well  the Nobel winning conservative economist James Buchanan denounced those pursuing that line of research as  a bevy of camp following whores  So conservatives could  if they wanted  turn for advice to highly partisan economists with at least some idea of what they re doing  Yet these economists  despite what often seem like pathetic attempts to curry favor with politicians  are routinely passed over for key positions  which go to almost surreally unqualified figures like Moore or Larry Kudlow  the Trump administration s chief economist Many people have described the Trump administration as a kakistocracy   rule by the worst   which it is  But it s also a hackistocracy   rule by the ignorant and incompetent  And in this Trump is just following standard G O P  practice Why do hacks rule on the right  It may simply be that a party of apparatchiks feels uncomfortable with people who have any real expertise or independent reputation  no matter how loyal they may seem  After all  you never know when they might take a stand on principle In any case  there will eventually be a price to pay  True  there is  wrote Adam Smith   a great deal of ruin in a nation   America isn t just an immensely powerful  wealthy  technologically advanced  peaceful country  We re also a nation with a long tradition of dedicated public service Even now   as I can attest from personal interactions   a great majority of those working for the Treasury Department  the State Department and so on are competent  hard working people trying to do the best they can for their country But as top jobs systematically go to hacks  there is an inevitable process of corrosion  We re already seeing a degradation of the way our government responds to things like natural disasters  Well  there will be more and bigger disasters ahead  And the people in charge of dealing with those disasters will be the worst of the worst The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our

Many Democratic presidential candidates on Sunday called for the release of the special counsel s entire report and said they were dissatisfied with relying on Attorney General William P  Barr s four page summary of the two year investigation Mr  Barr s letter said the investigation  led by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  concluded that neither the president nor his aides conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its interference in the 2016 presidential election  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  Julian Castro  one of the 15 Democrats to have announced their candidacy for president in 2020  said Congress should be allowed to see the report in its entirety  He said Mr  Barr was too close to the Trump administration for his summary to be the only peek into Mr  Mueller s work  A politically appointed Attorney General shouldn t decide how much of the Special Counsel report Congress can read   Mr  Castro tweeted minutes after the letter was released   The full report should be released and Robert Mueller should testify to its findings  Most of the other candidates made the same point  Because Mr  Barr was appointed by President Trump  the letter could not be considered an objective source of information  The American public deserves the full report and findings from the Mueller investigation immediately   not just the in house summary from a Trump Administration official   Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said on Twitter Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York  who officially kicked off her campaign on Sunday  tweeted that the full report should be released and  not just a letter from someone appointed by Trump to protect himself   all of it   Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker  Other candidates said releasing Mr  Mueller s complete report would bring transparency to the process Senator Kamala Harris of California  who was campaigning in Atlanta on Sunday  spoke to her supporters about Mr  Barr s letter  The American public deserves transparency and accountability   she said  adding that Mr  Barr  must be required to come and testify before Congress instead of just submitting a four page memo of what happened  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota posted a video on her Twitter account standing in front of the Robert F  Kennedy Department of Justice Building  saying that the only way to have justice was if the entire report were made public John Hickenlooper  the former governor of Colorado  called for a full release of the results of the investigation  but he stopped short of making further judgments   There are many questions that are still out there because what Mueller was looking at wasn t as far ranging as some people wanted   he said after a stump speech in Newmarket  N H  I think the report   the American people want to see what s in there   he added Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts noted on Twitter that the House voted 420 0 to demand that the Justice Department release the full report   Not a  summary  from his handpicked Attorney General  AG Barr  make the full report public  Immediately   she wrote Senator Bernie Sanders  independent of Vermont  did not mince words  I don t want a summary of the Mueller report   he tweeted   I want the whole damn report   

Representative José E  Serrano  who is currently the nation s longest tenured Hispanic congressman  said on Monday that he would not run for re election  citing the effects of Parkinson s disease Mr  Serrano  who has served in Congress since 1990 and represents the southern Bronx  one of the poorest districts in the country  has repeatedly won re election with more than 90 percent of the vote  But with the Democratic Party seeking a younger brand of progressives  there was talk that he might have faced a serious primary challenge next year Two powerful members of the Bronx political establishment praised Mr  Serrano while predicting a wide open race for his seat  Ritchie Torres  a Bronx councilman often described as a rising star  said last month that he was exploring a primary challenge to Mr  Serrano  I m sure there will be a lot of people who are now going to want to run for Congress   said Carl E  Heastie  the Bronx assemblyman who serves as speaker of the State Assembly   And I will not be one of them  Assemblyman Marcos A  Crespo  the borough s party chairman who  like Mr  Serrano  was born in Puerto Rico  called the congressman  a legendary figure in Latino politics  Puerto Rican politics  Bronx politics  Mr  Serrano said in a written statement that he had initially planned to stay in Congress despite the disease  but that he recently changed his mind   I ve come to the realization that Parkinson s will eventually take a toll and that I cannot predict its rate of advancement   the statement said  He said that he would serve out his current term  which runs through the end of next year Mr  Serrano sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee and is the chairman of the Commerce  Justice  Science Subcommittee  He is also known for advocating for Puerto Rico  including a recent push to have the Trump administration improve relief efforts for the island after Hurricane Maria  I always tried to speak for those who are marginalized in our society  to give them a voice and a vote here in Washington   he said  citing his efforts to bring federal funding to the Bronx  increase educational funding for minority students  clean up the polluted Bronx River and end the use of Vieques Island as a military bombing range Mr  Serrano  who had previously been a state assemblyman  was first elected to Congress in 1990 in a special election to fill the seat of Representative Robert Garcia  who was convicted of extorting money from Wedtech  a Bronx military contractor  Mr  Garcia s conviction was later overturned   Another Bronx congressman  Mario Biaggi  was also convicted in the Wedtech scandal  his granddaughter  Alessandra Biaggi  was elected last year to the New York State Senate  Mr  Serrano was born in Mayagüez  Puerto Rico  and moved with his family to the South Bronx when he was seven years old  He said that  as a child in Puerto Rico  he learned English by singing along to Frank Sinatra records  Mr  Serrano lived in public housing in the Bronx and did not receive a college degree  He is an icon  not only to the Bronx but to Latinos throughout the country   said Mr  Torres   As a young Latino who ran for public office when I was 24 years old  I would not be where I am today were it not for trailblazers like José Serrano who paved the way  Mr  Torres  31  declined to say definitively whether he would run for Mr  Serrano s seat   I d rather keep the focus on his legacy   he said   He secured the federal funding that led to the cleanup of the Bronx River  which is an enormous legacy to leave on  Mr  Serrano s son  José M  Serrano  a Democratic state senator  said he would not seek his father s seat because he did not want to be away from his wife and two children The younger Mr  Serrano praised his father s faith in their borough   When I was a child growing up in the 1970s  the Bronx was burning   he said   Now it s thriving   

To the Editor I grew up in South Africa during the apartheid years  Democracy  the rule of law  freedom of the press and treating fellow human beings with dignity and respect were foreign concepts  Those were horrible times  So it is hard to understand why a modern country would allow its leader to ignore foreign interference in its democracy  why it would permit its leader to attack  on a daily basis  its own legal system and freedom of the press  why it would tolerate a leader who seems to take pleasure in treating others with contempt Even in the third world  this type of behavior would be unacceptable  For it to happen in the first world is astonishing Indeed  why would America  a country that regards itself as the greatest on earth  allow a pathological liar to be its leader Perhaps the people of America have yet to understand what most in the third world know well  The problem with a pathological liar is not so much the lies and deception  the problem is that a pathological liar has no conscience And power without conscience is a very scary thing Barry van der BergBellville  South Africa 

Debates about the Electoral College  like the one that Democrats have lately instigated  often get bogged down in disputes about the intentions of the founding generation   whether they were trying to check mob rule  prop up Southern power  preserve the power of small states  or simply come to a necessarily arbitrary constitutional compromise These disputes are historically interesting but somewhat practically irrelevant  because everyone agrees that the college doesn t work the way the founders expected  It doesn t allow wise electors to veto demagogic candidates  it doesn t throw most presidential elections to the House of Representatives   and as my colleague Nate Cohn pointed out last week  it doesn t always give extra influence to the smallest states   Donald Trump won because he overperformed in big swing states  not because he cobbled together a coalition of small ones   Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Instead the Electoral College really just does one big thing that a popular vote system wouldn t do  It makes it possible for close elections to yield a president supported by a minority of voters  especially in circumstances where that minority is regionally concentrated rather than diffuse Is there a case for a system that sometimes produces undemocratic outcomes  I think so  on two grounds  First  it creates incentives for political parties and candidates to seek supermajorities rather than just playing for 50 1 percent  because the latter play is a losing one more often than in a popular vote presidential system Second  it creates incentives for political parties to try to break regional blocs controlled by the opposition  rather than just maximizing turnout in their own areas  because you win the presidency consistently only as a party of multiple regions and you can crack a rival party s narrow majority by flipping a few states According to this   admittedly contrarian   theory  the fact that the Electoral College produces chaotic or undemocratic outcomes in moments of ideological or regional polarization is actually a helpful thing  insofar as it drives politicians and political hacks  by nature not the most creative types  to think bigger than regional blocs and 51 percent majorities Thus the electoral popular split of 1888 pointed the way to William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt s national Republican majorities  and the near splits of 1968 and 1976 pushed us toward Reagan s nationwide landslides and Bill Clinton s successful center left campaigns  Time and again a close election leads to hand wringing about the need for Electoral College reform  time and again  politicians and parties respond to the college s incentives  and more capacious and unifying majorities are born Does this theory fit our current situation  In a sense  yes  Donald Trump could win the presidency without a popular vote majority only because both parties have been locked into base turnout strategies that are partially responsible for our government s ineffectiveness and gridlock  And to the extent that Hillary Clinton s campaign leaned into this polarization  writing off many constituencies that her husband competed for   she deserved her electoral college loss Trump could also only win the presidency without a popular vote majority because a large region of the country  the greater Rust Belt and Appalachia  had been neglected by both parties  policies over the preceding decades  leading to a slow building social crisis that the national press only really noticed because of Trump s political success  In this sense  Clinton s weird post election boast that her half of the country was way more economically dynamic indicated the advantages of a system where a declining region can punch above its popular vote weight   because it makes it harder for a party associated with economic winners to simply write the losers off However  This defense of occasional countermajoritarian presidencies assumes that the political system will  over the medium term  be responsive to the Electoral College s incentives   that parties will be capable of overcoming polarization and addressing specific regional grievances  that politicians will be capable of working toward Rooseveltian or Reaganesque majorities  that presidents who win with a popular vote minority will either adapt and gain a majority the next time  as George W  Bush did  or lose like Benjamin Harrison and John Quincy Adams And neither political party has responded to 2016 the way my defense of the Electoral College predicts they should  A countermajoritarian outcome has not produced supermajoritarian ambitions  Instead of trying to expand its base  the Trump era G O P  seems to be relying on the Electoral College to actively avoid any sustained outreach  while Trump s likely Democratic rivals seem to be taking Clinton s popular vote margin as a license to march leftward This points to a reality that the college s defenders need to recognize  If neither party can escape 50 50 politics  if polarization makes electoral popular splits recur cycle after cycle  then the Electoral College s arguable virtues will no longer apply  and it will just be one more delegimitizer in a system shadowed by partisan disillusionment  one more potential catalyst for a true constitutional crackup RelatedOpinion   Jamelle BouieGetting Rid of the Electoral College Isn t Just About TrumpMarch 21  2019Elizabeth Warren Calls for Ending Electoral CollegeMarch 18  2019The Times

Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  Does the Mueller report matter O K   I m being slightly provocative here  Of course it matters   for American democracy  for the Trump administration  and definitely for the 34 people Robert S  Mueller III indicted along the way The fact that the president did not collude with Russians to pervert our democratic process is an outcome every American should cheer  And the White House is certainly right to be overjoyed  This is a victory for President Trump  lifting the fog of a special counsel investigation that had blanketed his presidency But I would like to humbly submit that early reports of its influence on Mr  Trump s re election strength   or weakness   have been vastly overstated I spent Saturday on the New Hampshire seacoast talking to Democrats about the Mueller investigation   a topic that did not come up at campaign events over the weekend  amid questions about health care  school shootings and climate change  When I asked voters why  the answer was almost always the same  Regardless of what the report said  they were sure Mr  Trump had done something wrong Here s how Jim Sullivan  a 72 year old retiree  put it  after listening to Senator Amy Klobuchar at a town hall meeting   I d like to ask if she would support jail time for him  Most Americans have already made up their minds about the president  it s hard to see this report ushering a massive shift in public opinion  A recent Washington Post ABC News poll found that only 5 percent of registered voters said they had no opinion about the president  A whopping 77 percent expressed strong opinions  on either side In our hyperpartisan political world  the idea that the outcome of the special counsel investigation would dramatically reset dynamic of the 2020 race never felt particularly realistic Are some Democrats deflated by the findings  Sure  But as Speaker Nancy Pelosi made clear a few weeks ago  impeachment under a Republican controlled Senate was always a liberal pipe dream  Voters seem to recognize that  Polling by CNN last week showed that Democratic support for impeachment proceedings has fallen since the midterms  This report won t significantly deflate their enthusiasm for defeating Mr  Trump Are conservative Republicans bolstered by the findings  Of course  They see it as a vindication of an argument they ve been making for months  Mr  Trump is the victim of a  witch hunt   Attorney General William P  Barr s positive interpretation of Mr  Mueller s report will energize Mr  Trump s base   but we are still 20 months from Election Day  A lot can  and likely will  happen with these findings in the next 588 days The most significant political consequence of the Mueller report may be whether it sways those moderate Republicans turned off by Mr  Trump s inflammatory style  particularly women in those suburban districts that sided with Democrats in 2018 We don t know the answer to that question yet  But it s fair to say that a lot of it will depend on how Mr  Trump handles the fallout from this investigation   and the myriad inquiries still being pursued by congressional Democrats and New York prosecutors Can t stop reading about this weekend s bombshell  Peter Baker and Jonathan Martin

CollegeImageThis is The Soapbox  a forum for you to share your thoughts with us and your fellow On Politics readers  In today s edition  readers sound off the movement to end the Electoral College A large majority of responses were in support of ending the Electoral College  including this one from Gary Allen of Maryland The presidential election should be based on the national popular vote  The House is gerrymandered  the Senate represents states regardless of population  the Supreme Court is appointed  At least one element of government ought to be based on  one citizen one vote  A few readers wrote in to defend the Electoral College  Here s a note we got from Edna Lampke Only several states would decide the elections otherwise  Then the majority of America would stop voting altogether  Very unfair Margaret Dickerson of Texas said a popular vote would make her feel like her vote actually counted I support abolishing the Electoral College  I am a liberal Democrat and I live deep in the heart of Texas  Therefore my presidential vote literally doesn t count  All votes should count Sara Bhakti of Washington State wondered whether there was a third option In a high school civics class  we were taught that the Electoral College protected the influence of states with smaller populations from the  tyranny of the majority   That reasoning is compelling to

WASHINGTON   Democrats hoped to put their wrenching intraparty debate over anti Semitism to rest when they passed a catchall antibigotry resolution in the House this month  but Senate Republicans  eager to court American Jews outraged by the rise of anti Semitism  have other plans Mitch McConnell  the Republican leader in the Senate  is backing two new bills timed to be trumpeted at this week s annual meeting in Washington of the largest pro Israel advocacy group  the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  Mr  McConnell has already passed a measure this year giving local and state governments the authority to break ties with companies that boycott or divest from Israel The actions are part of a larger political strategy aimed  in part  at showing that Republicans are more willing to directly tackle anti Semitic hate speech and anti Israel language than divided Democrats in the lower chamber  Republican aides and operatives said  But hate speech has hardly been a longtime cause célèbre for the Republican Party  whose members have opposed efforts to expand similar protections to victims of discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation One measure  a  sense of the Senate  resolution  is intended as a direct rebuke of comments made by Representative Ilhan Omar  Democrat of Minnesota  who suggested that some American Jews had dual loyalties to both Israel and the United States  The bill  sponsored by Senator Ted Cruz  Republican of Texas  could reach the floor as early as this week  leadership aides said  and is likely to be passed unanimously or with only minimal opposition The centerpiece of the resolution is the declaration that  anti Semitism has for hundreds of years included attacks on the loyalty of Jews  A draft circulated in the Senate also links the dual loyalty charge to the  circulation of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion by the secret police of Russia   a reference to a fabricated early 20th century document intended to whip up anti Semitism by purporting to show a Jewish plot for global domination Senate Republicans have not always been so enthusiastic about toughening anti discrimination enforcement  Efforts by Democrats during the Obama administration to pass the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr  Hate Crimes Prevention Act  which added gender  sexual orientation and disability to the list of federally recognized hate crimes  were initially blocked by Republicans  led by Jeff Sessions  then a senator and later Mr  Trump s first attorney general The measure eventually passed in 2009  but only five Senate Republicans voted yes  Mr  McConnell and many members of his current leadership team opposed it The sense of the Senate measure is intended as a challenge to Ms  Omar  although her name was intentionally omitted from the text to attract Democrats who might otherwise object  according to an aide involved in the drafting process  It s absolutely critical for the United States Senate to stand up  speak with one voice and condemn  anti Semitism  said Billy Gribbin  a spokesman for Mr  Cruz A second  less drastic bill   a bipartisan effort to target anti Semitism on college campuses through the Education Department s civil rights enforcement division   poses a far more substantial political threat to Democrats trying to move quickly past the dust up over Ms  Omar ImageOne of the measures is intended as a rebuke of Representative Ilhan Omar  Democrat of Minnesota  whose remarks some critics have deemed anti Semitic CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesThe Anti Semitism Awareness Act  which is working its way through committee  is likely to pass the Senate this year  and could force Speaker Nancy Pelosi into the uncomfortable position of brokering another deal between progressives and Jewish Democrats at a time when she wants the chamber to focus on presenting unified opposition to President Trump The measure  co sponsored by Senator Tim Scott  Republican of South Carolina  and Senator Bob Casey  Democrat of Pennsylvania  passed the Senate in 2016 with bipartisan support  But it quickly stalled in the House  which was then controlled by Republicans  and attracted the opposition of many civil liberties groups that believe it threatens free speech on campuses The bill broadly defines anti Semitism as  harassment on the basis of actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics with a religious group  and also targets  discriminatory anti Israel conduct that crosses the line into anti Semitism  Under the measure  the Education Department would be required to investigate and possibly penalize universities that receive federal aid if they failed to crack down on incidents  using the same process laid out under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  which has historically been used to deal with discrimination based on race Ms  Pelosi has not said whether she would support the bill if it passed the Senate  and a spokeswoman declined to comment  A House leadership aide  speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized publicly  said the bill was likely to draw extended scrutiny in House committees before   or if   it was ever considered on the floor It is not clear how Ms  Omar and other progressives would vote on the measure  although similar efforts have attracted opposition on the basis of objections by the American Civil Liberties Union and progressive Jewish groups  This legislation appears designed less to combat anti Semitism than to have a chilling effect and to crack down on campus critics of Israel   Jeremy Ben Ami  the president of J Street  a liberal advocacy group that has been sharply critical of Israel s government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  said in a text message  It s misguided to legislatively declare a broad range of nonviolent campus criticism of Israel as anti Semitism  especially at a time when the prime driver of anti Semitism is the xenophobic  white nationalist far right   he said   This bill is part of a cynical effort by some of its right wing proponents to turn the issue of anti Semitism into a partisan political weapon  But in the past  the bill has had widespread support among lawmakers in both parties  and it has the backing of Aipac and the Anti Defamation League  It also has the support of a powerful outside advocate  David Krone  the hard driving former chief of staff to Harry Reid  the former Senate Democratic leader  who has used his contacts in the party to push the measure for several years in response to a wave of anti Semitism on college campuses  I find great irony in what Congresswoman Omar said about the issue of Jews and dual loyalty   Mr  Krone said in an interview   I am certain that she found the whole birther movement disgusting  vile and flat out racist  I agree  It was abhorrent to question the loyalty of President Obama  But how  on one hand  can she say it is wrong about people questioning President Obama s loyalties  but on the other hand  question mine as a Jew  What she said and what some stupid birther said are equally idiotic  Ms  Omar s spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment Top Democrats are hardly ready to cede support of Israel to Republicans  Representative Steny H  Hoyer  the Democratic leader  gave a rousing defense of the American Israeli relationship at the Aipac conference Sunday evening  promising to push for a resolution that opposes the boycott Israel movement  Without naming her  he took several jabs at Ms  Omar  Ladies and gentlemen  when someone accuses American supporters of dual loyalty  I say  Accuse me   Mr  Hoyer declared And he also took a shot at two other freshman Democrats who are critical of Israel  Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York   By the way  there are 62 freshman Democrats  You hear me  Sixty two  not three   

BEIJING   In 2006  three Chinese Christians traveled to Washington to ask President George W  Bush for his support in their fight for religious freedom  One of them had converted to the faith only a few months earlier  Wang Yi  a 33 year old lawyer from the southwestern city of Chengdu But Mr  Wang had already become such a prominent Christian that organizers made sure he went to the White House  A nationally known essayist and civil rights lawyer  he would soon found a 500 member church that was independent of government control  along with a seminary  an elementary school and even a group to aid the families of political prisoners   all illegal but which he accomplished by sheer force of will Today  Mr  Wang  now 45  is back in the spotlight  this time at the center of an intense crackdown on Christianity  His Early Rain Covenant Church and others like it are popular among China s growing middle class and have resisted government control  testing the ruling Communist Party s resolve to bring China s churches to heel  He saw an inevitable fight with the government because of it trying to control the churches   said Enoch Wang  a pastor based in the United States who has met Wang Yi many times   He knows that sooner or later they ll come for you and so there s no point in trying to hide  That was one reason Wang Yi has in recent years become a vocal critic of President Xi Jinping s moves toward authoritarianism Last December  he and 100 church members were detained  Although most have been released  Mr  Wang  his wife and 11 others are still being held incommunicado without access to a lawyer The charges against Mr  Wang and his wife   inciting to subvert state power   typically result in lengthy prison sentences  The same charge was used to sentence Liu Xiaobo  a dissident  to 11 years in prison in 2009  He was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and died in custody in 2017 According to church members who were detained and subsequently released  the police are also investigating Mr  Wang and two junior pastors for economic crimes such as whether they broke Chinese law by publishing books and DVDs without government approval Many congregants who have been released have lost their jobs and housing over their church membership  Others have been sent back to their hometowns or had their bank accounts frozen  Mr  Wang s 11 year old son now lives with his 74 year old grandmother The crackdown is part of a broader effort to subdue China s fast growing religious groups  This includes detaining a million minority Muslims in internment camps in China s far west  a drive that has drawn international condemnation But while Islam is practiced by about 20 million non Chinese minorities in largely far off provinces  Protestant Christianity is followed by about 60 million ethnic Chinese in China s economic heartland  About half worship in churches that raise their own money and run their own affairs In the past  many of these were called underground churches  but over the past decade  some have become public megachurches  Run by well educated white collar professionals in China s biggest cities  the churches own property and have nationwide alliances   something anathema to the party  which tightly restricts nongovernmental organizations Also targeted in the crackdown were the 1 500 member Zion Church in Beijing  which was closed in September  and  the Rongguili Church in Guangzhou  which attracted thousands of worshipers each week Unlike the old underground churches  these independent churches wanted to be public  They want to be the city on the hill   said Fredrik Fallman  a professor at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who studies contemporary Chinese Christianity   But this is the basic fear of the Communist Party   people organized independent of the party in a structured way  ImagePastor Wang  second from right  met President George W  Bush at the White House in 2006 with other prominent Christian activists CreditEric Draper The White House  via ReutersSince Mr  Xi took power in 2012  the party has ramped up efforts to promote ideas such as the glory of traditional China and respect for authority Christians like Mr  Wang have challenged this top down ideology  Many are interested in socially engaged models of Christianity  especially the Protestant denomination of Calvinism  Traditionally  Christians in China were mainly concerned with saving people s souls   said Yu Jie  an exiled essayist who helped convert Mr  Wang in 2005   But Wang Yi and others like us  we don t think the world is hopelessly corrupt  We want to improve it  and so there s an emphasis on issues like public service and justice  Born in 1973  Mr  Wang grew up in the rural Chinese county of Santai  He met his wife in elementary school   and wrote in an essay that he was immediately infatuated with her He was 16 when the government crushed pro democracy protesters near Tiananmen Square in Beijing  That event shaped his life  pushing him to a career in law and an interest in justice All of this meant his church was unusually active in sensitive areas It set up a group that helped the families of political prisoners by regularly visiting them and paying their children s college tuition  The church also helped fund a homeless shelter and protested the ubiquitous use of abortion in Chinese family planning Mr  Wang  a pastor  also held prayer services for the victims of the June 4  1989  massacre of the Tiananmen protesters  In one widely circulated photo  he is wearing his pastor s collar and holding a sign that says   June 4  Pray for the Country  He also became a sharp critic of Mr  Xi  especially after presidential term limits were lifted last year  allowing him to serve a third term and to potentially rule for life In response  Mr  Wang circulated a message calling Mr  Xi a  usurper  who was  not amending the Constitution but destroying it  Some in his congregation objected to his overtly political message  Two years ago  another pastor left Early Rain to start his own church  criticizing some of Mr  Wang s statements as stunts  But others in the church thought they were necessary Mr  Wang s bluntness made him one of the most polarizing figures in Chinese Christianity  When the government began reducing the public face of Christianity in one province by tearing crosses off the steeples of even government run churches  Mr  Wang expressed no sympathy for the churches affected  Instead  he said their pastors were wrong for serving in churches controlled by the government Mr  Yu  the writer  said he wondered if his old friend was wise in confronting the government so openly  As a pastor  you do have a responsibility to protect your members   Mr  Yu said   Given the conditions in China  it s something one can consider  But Mr  Wang had long anticipated his detention over the question of state control In a 2017 sermon  he asked his congregation what he should do if the government demanded even limited control over their church  Should he agree and avoid persecution  or resist He joked that some people might ask him if he couldn t make a few compromises  We ve got an 80 year old grandma at home and we just had a child   he said  anticipating the argument But then Mr  Wang argued against this sort of accommodation  In this world  in this crooked  depraved and perverse world  how do we demonstrate that we are a group of people who trust in Jesus   he said   It is through bodily submission  through bodily suffering  that we demonstrate the freedom of our souls   

A four year military operation to flush the Islamic State from its territory in Iraq and Syria ended on Saturday as the last village held by the terrorist group was retaken  erasing a militant theocracy that once spanned two countries Cornered in Baghuz  Syria  the last 1 5 square mile remnant of the group s territory in the region  the remaining militants waged a surprisingly fierce defense and kept the American backed coalition at bay for months  The war on terror has cost the U S  billions and has been fought for nearly 20 years  Who are we fighting  They detonated car bombs and hurled explosives from drones  Suicide bombers ran across the front line under cover of darkness to attack the sleeping quarters of the coalition In the last weeks  the militants  families fled for their lives  their black clad wives streaming into the desert by the tens of thousands  Some of them defiantly chanted Islamic State slogans and lobbed fistfuls of dirt at reporters But after a grueling campaign  the last speck of land was finally wrested from the Islamic State ISIS Lost Its Last Territory in Syria  But the Attacks Continue The Islamic State remains a serious  violent threat  This is a big moment not just for us  but for all of the world   said Kino Gabriel  a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces  which led the operation   But we cannot say that ISIS is finished  It is true that they are finished on the ground as a standing army  But the ISIS threat remains around the globe  President Trump vowed that the United States would remain vigilant and work with its allies in global counterterrorism efforts against ISIS until it is defeated wherever it operates  To all of the young people on the internet believing in ISIS s propaganda  you will be dead if you join  Think instead about having a great life   the president said   While on occasion these cowards will resurface  they have lost all prestige and power  They are losers and will always be losers  At its zenith four years ago  the Islamic State ruled a chunk of territory the size of Britain and controlled the lives of up to 12 million people It captured major population centers including Mosul  the second largest city in Iraq  Its dominion extended east into the plains of Nineveh in Iraq  an area mentioned in the Bible  where the extremist fighters used the walls of ancient churches for target practice  It reached south to the Syrian ruins of Palmyra  whose majestic pillars became a backdrop for gruesome beheading videos In between  it seized land that accounted for 75 percent of Syria s cotton crop  40 percent of Iraq s wheat production and over 50 percent of its barley fields  as well as hydroelectric dams  phosphate mines and oil fields ImageA coalition vehicle drives on

be questioned by coalition forces in Deir al Zour Province CreditIvor Prickett for The New York TimesWhile the Islamic State lives on as a diffuse insurgency that commands thousands of followers from Afghanistan to the Philippines  the loss of the biggest territory it controlled is a blow  The group lost the most visible prototype of what it envisioned as a global caliphate or religious empire  a gleaming beacon that helped recruit tens of thousands of fighters from around the world and an ominous nightmare that frightened the rest Its vast territory allowed it to do something no other terrorist group had done  By taxing the millions under the group s rule and exploiting the area s natural resources  the Islamic State raked in billions of dollars  becoming the world s richest terrorist organization It used that wealth to finance its global ambitions  The militants built a war machine  including industrial scale mortar production and a drone program that modified off the shelf technology to carry explosives It invested in its nascent state  providing services like vaccination drives and trash collection that  at times  rivaled those of the governments they had usurped  This was one of the selling points it used to lure new recruits The cities and towns it held allowed the group to embed prisons  training camps and administrative offices in civilian population centers  protecting them from airstrikes under international norms of warfare The state it built  ostensibly modeled on the one established by the Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century  was both brutal and bureaucratically efficient  Women flogged for showing so much as their eyes were issued receipts by the morality police Teenage boys imprisoned for the crime of  making fun during prayer  were served with arrest warrants  Thousands of women belonging to the Yazidi faith  which the Islamic State considers heretical  were sold into sexual servitude  their rapes endorsed by an Islamic court with a stamped contract ImageWomen and children fleeing the last area controlled by ISIS jam into a bus to reach camps controlled by Kurdish Syrian militias CreditIvor Prickett for The New York TimesImageA convoy of trucks carrying people away from the last territory held by ISIS in eastern Syria CreditIvor Prickett for The New York TimesBy nearly every metric  the Islamic State is now a diminished force compared to its zenith four years ago  It has far fewer fighters and far less land  and the number of attacks it carries out worldwide has nose dived And by all accounts  life in Baghuz as it was besieged these last few weeks was bleak  Ask me  when is the last time I had an egg  One year ago   said Amy  a 34 year old Canadian woman who fled the village recently and gave only her first name  She had left her job as a graphic designer in Alberta with her two toddlers to join her husband in Syria  I just want to go home and have the biggest Tim Hortons coffee   she said  referring to the Canadian coffee shop chain But those who have tracked the group since it took root in Iraq in the early 2000s say that even after losing its land  the group is far stronger today than it was the last time it was considered defeated   in 2011  the year American troops pulled out of Iraq The militants were down to their last 700 fighters then  Now  American and Iraqi officials estimate that the group still has thousands of fighters and tens of thousands of adherents dispersed across Iraq and Syria Signs of the group s resurgence are already visible In the first 10 months after Iraq s prime minister at the time  Haider al Abadi  declared victory over the militants in his country  the group carried out 1 271 attacks there  according to Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy ImageAbdulrahman Salam aids his injured father  Salam Abid  at a screening point for those fleeing the last village controlled by ISIS  They said 20 members of their family had been killed by a coalition airstrike CreditIvor Prickett for The New York TimesImageAn injured woman waiting for a bus to a holding camp in territory controlled by Syrian Kurds CreditIvor Prickett for The New York TimesIn the weeks since President Trump claimed victory over the Islamic State in December  the militants have claimed at least 182 attacks in Syria  according to Charlie Winter  a senior research fellow of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King s College London  There is a tendency to rush into declarations of victory too fast and too early with jihadist groups   Mr  Winter said   It may be weaker in the immediate term  but there is not a chance in hell that it has been defeated  Even the commanders who helped free Baghuz caution that this is simply the end of one phase of the conflict and the start of another Liberating the cities and towns held by the Islamic State was the easy part  said Adnan Afrin  a commander with the Syrian Democratic Forces  When we go to the front lines  we face them   he said   We shoot them  they shoot back  We know who is in front of us   he added   But behind us are sleeper cells   he said   The fight against the enemy you cannot see is much harder  While many may describe the fall of Baghuz as the end of the caliphate  the group s project was always global  with nearly half of its  provinces  overseas  Even as the territory it holds in Iraq and Syria has dwindled to zero  the group s franchises abroad are growing  experts say In January  back to back detonations claimed by the Islamic State s local affiliate killed at least 20 people in the Philippines  In Afghanistan  the group continues to mount deadly attacks despite the United States dropping in 2017 what it called the  mother of all bombs  on a cave complex used by the militants ImageFighters with the Syrian Democratic Forces monitoring ISIS positions in preparation for the battle to retake the village of Baghuz CreditIvor Prickett for The New York TimesImageAn artillery strike by coalition forces hit an ISIS position in the village of Baghuz on February 10 CreditIvor Prickett for The New York TimesThe military operation to dislodge the Islamic State came at a heavy price  The western half of the city of Mosul  most of the Syrian city of Raqqa and numerous others wrested from the militants along the way are in ruins The 19 mile stretch of road from the Syrian town of Hajin  where the operation to remove ISIS from its last remnant of Syrian territory began last September  to Baghuz  is a scene of catastrophic destruction  Nearly every building is crushed or scarred  Craters  some large enough to swallow a tanker truck  mark the spots where 500 pound bombs made landfall  Why did they have to destroy all of Hajin   asked Faisal Wuhaib Awad  42  who owned a bakery there   This was our livelihood  We went and looked and didn t find a single ISIS body there  No weapons  Not even a single bullet  So how can they say that this was an ISIS hide out  Syria remains mired in a civil war in which the battle against the Islamic State is only one conflict among many  The future of the land the group once held there  about a third of the country  is uncertain with the United States promising to withdraw its troops On both sides of the border  the victors are wrestling with justice for the losers Thousands of fighters are locked in prisons while tens of thousands of women and children are held in detention camps  Most of the foreigners who flocked to the caliphate risk becoming stateless  unwanted by the countries they fled and considered enemy combatants by the countries they are in The number of detainees has surged in recent weeks with up to 37 000 people arriving from Baghuz since February  according to the International Rescue Committee  A majority of them are women and children  and officials say nearly all are the families of ISIS members ImageCoalition forces

insisting that such losses were only temporary  It s getting smaller   said Dure Ahmed  28  from Toronto   Much smaller  But a lot of people still have hope that one day it will flourish back  It was a sentiment echoed by Salam Abid  who spent four and a half years in Islamic State territory  fleeing only after 20 members of his family were killed in an airstrike  Maybe the group will be defeated in Syria  but not elsewhere   he said  speaking through the bandages covering his burned face   Sure  in Syria  they are down to nothing  but in the deserts of Anbar  they live on  And in Asia and in Africa  they are still fighting   

WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal from an unidentified foreign corporation fighting a sealed grand jury subpoena issued by Robert S  Mueller III  the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election The court s action means that the corporation must provide information to the special counsel or pay mounting financial penalties  It was not immediately clear whether the recently announced conclusion of Mr  Mueller s investigation will affect the corporation s obligations and liability  As is their custom  the justices gave no reason for turning away the appeal The case  In re Grand Jury Subpoena  No  18 948  has been cloaked in secrecy  But redacted court rulings and Supreme Court briefs have provided a few hints  including that an unnamed foreign government  referred to in court papers as Country A  owns the corporation The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the corporation s argument that it could not be forced to comply with the subpoena  The corporation had argued that federal courts have no jurisdiction over criminal cases involving foreign governments Were the corporation s position correct  a three judge panel of the appeals court wrote in an unsigned opinion  foreign owned companies would be free to break American laws   As the corporation admits   the panel wrote   under its reading a foreign sovereign owned  purely commercial enterprise operating within the United States could flagrantly violate criminal laws and the U S  government would be powerless to respond save through diplomatic pressure  A federal law provides immunity from lawsuits to foreign governments in some circumstances  Even if that law applied to cases concerning grand jury subpoenas  the panel wrote  the law makes an exception for foreign governments  commercial activities The appeals court also rejected the corporation s argument that the subpoena was  unreasonable and oppressive  because complying with it would require the corporation to violate one of its home country s laws  The text of the foreign law provision the corporation relies on does not support its position   the panel wrote  adding that explanations from the corporation s lawyers and  a regulator from Country A  were unpersuasive  Consequently   the panel wrote   we are unconvinced that Country A s law truly prohibits the corporation from complying with the subpoena  Judges David S  Tatel and Thomas B  Griffith joined the appeals court s unsigned majority opinion  and Judge Stephen F  Williams agreed with the outcome but not all of the majority s reasoning The appeals court s opinion affirmed a ruling by Chief Judge Beryl A  Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington that had held the corporation in contempt and imposed a fine of  50 000 per day until it complied with the subpoena In January  the Supreme Court refused to suspend the fine while the case moved forward In a petition seeking Supreme Court review  the corporation s lawyers wrote that the appeals court had broken new ground  becoming  the first appellate court in American history to exercise criminal jurisdiction over a foreign state  There was no reason do so  the corporation s brief said   Since America s founding   the brief said   foreign states have been immune from American criminal jurisdiction  and yet the United States is not overrun with criminal syndicates backed by foreign states  The corporation s lawyers wrote that Congress and the executive branch had  many nonjudicial tools at their disposal to address foreign sovereigns that commit crimes in the United States   notably economic sanctions Solicitor General Noel J  Francisco responded that such pressure would not always be effective  The corporation s position  he wrote   overlooks not only the legal and practical limits on sanctions  but also the threshold need to acquire evidence through grand jury subpoenas in order to determine whether a crime has been committed   including by U S  citizens   

LONDON   Britain s Parliament grabbed control Monday of the government s efforts to leave the European Union  challenging the country s political traditions and inflicting on Prime Minister Theresa May a rebuke not suffered by any recent predecessor By stepping into the process known as Brexit and trying to define an alternative path  lawmakers could create a constitutional showdown in Britain  where the government normally controls the agenda in Parliament  especially on its most pressing issues Parliament passed an amendment giving itself the power to vote on alternatives to the government s Brexit plan  Its attempt to take control of the process came as Mrs  May prepared for a last ditch effort to persuade lawmakers to support her withdrawal plan  which has already been rejected twice by huge margins On Monday she admitted that there was  not sufficient support  to make another quick attempt to push it through  though she might try again on Thursday Mrs  May s grip on power is ebbing  with members of her cabinet openly discussing contradictory Brexit policies  rumors swirling of a plot to replace her and several of her Conservative Party lawmakers calling on her to name a date for her departure from power  She has already said she will not lead the party into the next general election scheduled for 2022 What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union The latest maneuvers come at the start of a week that was supposed to see Britain leaving the European Union  something that Mrs  May had promised more than 100 times would happen on March 29  Instead  Britain will remain at least until April 12  though what happens thereafter is anyone s guess at the moment Nonetheless  this week is shaping up to be critical  both for Mrs  May and for those who oppose her withdrawal plan from the bloc  which would provide for a status quo transition period but would eventually aim to take Britain out of Europe s main economic structures Last week  European Union leaders granted an extension on the March 29 deadline for departure but not on the terms Mrs  May sought  They agreed to a short delay to May 22  if she can get a deal through Parliament this week  If that fails  then Britain will either have to request a longer extension and take part in elections to the European Parliament   something Mrs  May has rejected   or quit without any agreement on April 12 Parliament s attempt to take control was led by Oliver Letwin  a veteran Conservative lawmaker  and is driven largely by fear of leaving without an agreement  a rupture that could leave ports jammed and cause huge economic dislocation  A  no deal  Brexit remains the default option if the deadlock in Britain continues  and the risks of it happening by accident are increasing Richard Harrington  who had warned of the risks of leaving the European Union without an agreement  resigned his post as business minister in Mrs  May s cabinet in order to support the amendment In a hard hitting resignation letter  Mr  Harrington said that  the government s approach to Brexit is playing Russian roulette with the lives and livelihoods of the vast majority of people in this country  ImageBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said Monday she would not necessarily follow the advice of Parliament on Brexit Creditvia ReutersUnder the amendment brought forth by Mr  Letwin  which passed by a vote of 329 to 302  Parliament will hold a series of votes on Wednesday on alternatives to Mrs  May s plan These could include a so called  soft Brexit  that would keep Britain tied into European economic structures  a second referendum  revoking Brexit completely  or leaving without any deal Speaking before lawmakers passed the amendment  Mrs  May said she could not commit to honoring the outcome of any of these nonbinding parliamentary votes  particularly if they contradicted the pro Brexit stance in the Conservative Party s manifesto for the 2017 general election After the vote  the government responded with a statement that said that the amendment  upends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous  unpredictable precedent for the future  Mrs  May is still hoping that no alternative will command more support than her blueprint  giving her a realistic shot at pushing her plan through by presenting it as the only alternative to a no deal Brexit or a long extension Critics think that Mrs  May is favoring the interests of her Conservative Party by being willing to contemplate a no deal Brexit   something hard line pro Brexit Tory lawmakers back   over a cross party effort to produce a softer Brexit that might win approval from Parliament but would split the Tories and possibly precipitate a second election ImageLawmakers passed an amendment offered by a Conservative  Oliver Letwin  to hold a series of votes on alternatives to Mrs  May s Brexit plan CreditHenry Nicholls ReutersOn the other hand  moderate voices in the party complain that allowing a no deal Brexit against much opposition would be a risky move that could haunt the party for years to come The leader of the opposition Labour Party  Jeremy Corbyn  said that he would support the push for a series of so called indicative votes on other options for Brexit  telling lawmakers that it was  time for Parliament to take control  On Saturday a demonstration in favor of a second Brexit referendum brought hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets of London  while more than five million people have signed an online petition to end Brexit  something the government could do unilaterally Despite all her problems  Mrs  May still seems safe from an immediate leadership challenge But some of her pro Brexit critics say they might vote for her deal if she promises to stand aside soon and let someone else take over for the next phase of Brexit talks that will determine Britain s trade ties  That could put pressure on her to announce a departure date Demonstrably  discipline has almost completely broken down inside the government and there is a feeling among many at Westminster that something has to give soon On Sunday  the chancellor of the Exchequer  Philip Hammond  described a second referendum  something Mrs  May has refused to entertain  as a  coherent proposition  that deserved consideration  His colleague  the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay  said that if Parliament voted for a soft Brexit plan  it could precipitate a general election

BEIJING   A long distance coach bus taking tourists to Mao Zedong s hometown in southern China erupted in flames  killing more than two dozen people onboard  according to official statements and news reports on Saturday The diesel powered bus was going from Henan Province in central China to Hunan Province in the south  and the fire broke out near Changde  a city in Hunan  on Friday night  officials said in an account released through state run news media  The flames swiftly consumed the bus  and at least 26 of the 56 people aboard died  apparently trapped by the flames Twenty eight other people were injured and treated at three hospitals  including five who were said to be in serious condition Other details of the accident were unclear  and investigators were trying to determine the fire s cause  One Chinese news website  Shangyou News  cited a survivor who said that the bus had been taking tourists to Shaoshan  the small city where Mao Zedong was born  and that the fire broke out at the back of the bus  quickly overcoming passengers who did not have time to jump out Two drivers survived and were detained while the police and safety officials investigated  the Changde government said The accident was another jarring reminder of China s shaky safety record  coming soon after a blast at a chemical plant in eastern China on Thursday that killed at least 64 people Deaths on Chinese roads have risen with the rapid expansion of expressways and car ownership  The government has responded with tighter enforcement of speed limits  bans on drunken driving and stricter vehicle inspections Even so  nearly 64 000 people died in transportation accidents in China in 2017  mostly on roads  according to government statistics  The real toll could be much higher  Past studies by safety experts have found that Chinese police statistics seriously underestimated road deaths  and the World Health Organization said in 2016 that about 260 000 people died on Chinese roads every year Last year  there were five road accidents in China in which 10 or more people died  a decline from 2017  the Ministry of Public Security said in January  

WASHINGTON   Democrats won control of the House in large part on the strength of their argument that Congress needs to protect people with pre existing medical conditions and to lower the cost of health care On Tuesday  Democratic leaders  including Speaker Nancy Pelosi  will put aside  at least for now  the liberal quest for a government run  Medicare for all  single payer system and unveil a more incremental approach toward fulfilling those campaign promises  Building on the Affordable Care Act  they would offer more generous subsidies for the purchase of private health insurance offered through the health law s insurance exchanges while financing new efforts to increase enrollment They would also reverse actions by the Trump administration that allow insurance companies to circumvent protections in the Affordable Care Act for people with pre existing conditions  Insurers could no longer sell short term health plans with skimpy benefits or higher premiums for people with chronic illnesses Ms  Pelosi said the legislation would  strengthen protections for pre existing conditions  reverse the G O P  s health care sabotage and lower Americans  health costs  The legislative package  put together by Ms  Pelosi and several House committee chairmen  builds on the health law that the speaker was instrumental in passing   and that was signed by President Barack Obama almost exactly nine years ago  And it seems to answer a question facing Democrats since they took control of the House  How would they balance the expansive demands of their most liberal members with the needs of more pragmatic Democrats elected in seats that were held by Republicans Ms  Pelosi  the committee chairmen and many other House Democrats see the new legislative package as a more efficient way of achieving universal coverage  a goal shared by champions of  Medicare for all   led by Representatives Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Debbie Dingell of Michigan Democrats said they would probably try to pass the legislative package piece by piece  with the first votes on the House floor expected in May  Some elements could win support from Republican House members and from the Republican controlled Senate With their new proposal  House Democratic leaders hope to finesse the disagreements within their caucus and to focus public attention instead on the gulf that separates Democrats of all stripes from President Trump on health care In his latest budget request  Mr  Trump urged Congress again to repeal the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act  which has provided coverage to at least 12 million people newly eligible for the program  Mr  Trump attacked Senator John McCain last week  seven months after his death  for casting a decisive vote against repeal of the 2010 health law And in the economic report of the president  the White House boasted last week about how Mr  Trump had allowed small businesses and individual consumers to buy insurance plans that skirt many requirements of the Affordable Care Act  offering lower costs but fewer benefits Under a rule issued in August  Mr  Trump greatly expanded the market for sales of short term insurance plans that do not have to cover prescription drugs  maternity care  drug abuse treatment or pre existing conditions The House Democrats  bill would turn back the president s action by stipulating that short term plans are included in the definition of  individual health insurance coverage  under the Affordable Care Act and therefore must comply with coverage requirements of the health law  These junk plans discriminate against people with pre existing conditions   said Representative Frank Pallone Jr   Democrat of New Jersey and an architect of the new legislation   They deny access to basic benefits  They set arbitrary dollar limits for health care services  leading to huge surprise bills for consumers   We passed the Affordable Care Act to rein in exactly these types of abuses   said Mr  Pallone  who is investigating the short term plan as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee The Affordable Care Act provides two main types of financial assistance to people of modest means buying private insurance  tax credits to help them pay premiums  and cost sharing reductions to lower their deductibles  co payments and other out of pocket costs The House Democrats  bill would revise the law to provide more of both types of assistance In addition  the bill would make subsidies available to some working families who are now ineligible  The law  as interpreted by the Internal Revenue Service  bars subsidies to workers who have access to affordable employer sponsored coverage for themselves   even if the cost of coverage for the entire family is unaffordable  The House Democrats  bill would eliminate this quirk in the law  sometimes called the family glitch The bill would also provide money to publicize the insurance options and subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act and to help people enroll  Mr  Trump has cut the budget for such efforts by more than 80 percent  saying the funds were no longer needed because people were now well aware of the law House Democrats would also block guidance issued by the Trump administration under which states can get waivers allowing them to use federal funds to subsidize insurance that does not comply with coverage requirements in the Affordable Care Act The Democrats  package includes several measures proposed by freshmen  One  by Representative Angie Craig  Democrat of Minnesota  seeks to lower premiums by setting up reinsurance programs  using a combination of federal and state funds to help pay the largest claims  Minnesota and several other states have established such programs and are pleased with the results The package will also include a bipartisan bill offered by Representative Andy Kim  a freshman Democrat from New Jersey  that would provide federal money to states that want to set up their own insurance marketplaces but have yet to do so  With skyrocketing premiums in the federal marketplace  state based exchanges have proven to be more effective at increasing the rate of coverage and lowering costs   said Representative Brian Fitzpatrick  Republican of Pennsylvania  who helped write this proposal with Mr  Kim  

PARIS   French security forces fanned out across Paris and other cities on Saturday as the country faced a 19th weekend of  Yellow Vest  demonstrations  following a surge of violence last week that caught the authorities by surprise after months of dwindling numbers and calmer protests Though sporadic clashes erupted late in the day  violence dropped on Saturday as protesters marched peacefully in the French capital and elsewhere Nearly 6 000 police officers were out on the streets of Paris  especially around the Champs Élysées and the Arc de Triomphe  which have become the focus of protests and where the authorities this past week banned demonstrations ImageProtesters gathering in Paris  After months of ritual gatherings every Saturday  their number is a fraction of the more than 250 000 who demonstrated across the country in the movement s early days CreditMichel Euler Associated PressChristophe Castaner  France s Interior minister  said Saturday evening that 5 000 people had demonstrated in the capital and 40 500 nationwide  He said that 65 000 police officers and gendarmes had been deployed across France  making 233 arrests  Our instructions of firmness were followed and made it possible to maintain order and avoid outbursts   he said Protests were also banned in parts of other cities like Bordeaux  Toulouse and Nice  where President Xi Jinping of China  who is on a tour of Europe  is expected to stay on Sunday after a dinner with President Emmanuel Macron Didier Lallement  the new chief of the Paris police   his predecessor was fired after last weekend s violence   told reporters on Saturday that the police took more  proactive  steps in order to  immediately put a stop to violence or destruction  ImageFrench police officers on the Champs Élysées on Saturday  It is one of the sites where the authorities have banned demonstrations CreditFrancois Guillot Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesIn Paris  the police stationed dozens of vans  water cannons and armored vehicles on the Champs Élysées  and few protesters challenged them  Instead  most of the Yellow Vests marched on a preapproved route from southern Paris up to the Sacré Coeur cathedral The Yellow Vest demonstrations   set off last November by an increase in fuel taxes  are named after the high visibility safety vests that all French drivers must have in their cars Anger about the fuel tax increase   which was suspended   snowballed into an expression of much broader discontent against Mr  Macron  his pro business economic policies  his sweeping reform agenda and what critics call his abrasive style of governing  Demands include higher taxation for the rich  more measures to support the purchasing power of the lower middle class  and the creation of a popular referendum mechanism But after months of ritual gatherings every Saturday in Paris and other cities around France  sometimes with clashes between riot police and Yellow Vests or more radical agitators  the number of protesters has dwindled to a small fraction of the more than 250 000 who demonstrated across the country in the movement s early days ImageThe control center at in the Paris Police Prefecture on Saturday CreditGeoffroy Van Der Hasselt Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesLast weekend  shopkeepers on the Champs Élysées who had grown accustomed to shutting their stores and boarding them up had let their guard down and opened up as usual  But in a burst of violence  protesters smashed windows  looted stores and set a bank on fire  putting Mr  Macron s government under renewed pressure to step up security France s prime minister  Édouard Philippe  said on Monday that the authorities would ban protests in  areas that have been most targeted  if they became aware of  extremist elements  that intended to vandalize them  and that fines for attending banned demonstrations would increase Most controversially  the government said that police forces would be supported by the military to help secure cities where protests were planned Mr  Macron s opponents pounced  calling the move a dangerous incursion of the military into domestic law enforcement  Jean Luc Mélenchon  leader of the far left France Unbowed party  said on Friday that it was  a reckless and dangerous decision  with consequences that could be very risky   He added   A soldier s job is not that of a policeman  ImageTourists walked by as workers set up steel protections on Friday at Fouquet s  an upscale Paris restaurant attacked in last week s protests CreditChristophe Ena Associated PressBut the government emphasized that the soldiers   part of the approximately 7 000 who patrol and protect important areas like train stations as part of France s antiterrorism strategy   would not be stationed near demonstration areas and would not make contact with protesters Instead  the soldiers would replace police officers currently guarding sensitive sites  freeing them up to handle the protests  the government said The Yellow Vests are united by anger against Mr  Macron but have struggled to channel their frustration  spontaneously organizing online but rejecting any formal structure or leadership  A few have announced bids to run in the upcoming European parliamentary elections  but they are not expected to make much headway Some  partly satisfied by economic concessions made by Mr  Macron last year  or tired by the continuing demonstrations  have stopped protesting ImageSoldiers patrolling around the Eiffel Tower  The government said that the military would secure sensitive sites to free more police officers to control the protests CreditKiran Ridley Getty ImagesIn his bid to overcome the Yellow Vest crisis  Mr  Macron also held a weekslong  great national debate  to let people express their grievances  Tens of thousands have done so online  in special town hall registers and in meetings across the country But a small minority of protesters   20 000 to 30 000 nationwide in recent weeks   have stuck with the Saturday ritual  attracting increasingly radical and sometimes violent crowds that have targeted symbols of the government or of affluence Their anger has also been fueled by what critics call an excessive use of force by the French police  most notably the use of rubber projectiles that have wounded dozens of protesters Opinion polls after last weekend s protests showed that while support or sympathy for the Yellow Vests and their cause was still at roughly 50 percent  that figure had decreased  with a significantly lower tolerance for violence  

LONDON   Recently  in the comforting gloom of a half empty cinema  I found myself subjected to an advertisement for the country in which I live  A series of Britain s cultural and sporting great and good  interspersed with  normal  people  rode in taxis  strode through the airport and squeezed themselves into economy class   Dear Britain   they said  taking turns with the lines while stowing their luggage and settling into their seats   Dear old Britain  We love you   The way you pick yourself up when things get tough   How you follow your own path   How you tell it like it is  politely  of course     You ve led revolutions of all kinds  yet you won t shout about it  it s just not in your nature  Instead  you ll quietly make history   At the end  cozily occupying the sweet spot between the roundly unifying and the vapidly uncontroversial  Olivia Colman  who recently won an Oscar for playing Queen Anne  said something about tea As an ad celebrating British Airways  an international airline  it s strikingly devoid of internationalism  As a hymn to the solipsistic backwater we ve become  it s painfully apt  If Britain were an airline  we d be very much like the one British Airways gives us in its ad   idling on the runway  sipping our tea and mumbling our self congratulatory eulogies  reveling in our isolation because all sense of a destination has disappeared The ad speaks to the experience of living in Britain at this moment  It s not just our political life that feels suffused with the toxicity of Brexit  but also our cultural and even personal lives  too  At dinner with friends and family  on our couches in front of the television  even in our attempts at cinematic escape  there is only one subject of conversation  our departure from the European Union  the need to either oppose it or enact it  As we walk the supermarket aisles  speculating as to the continuing availability of our favorite foods  as we sit with our European loved ones and try to convince ourselves of the security of their stay  as we lay out the day s medicines and fret about the continuing viability of their procurement  Brexit is inescapable But something else is inescapable  too  because Brexit is so bound up with  Britishness   that never quite defined and often nebulous shared culture that has become as impossible to avoid  Brexit is not just an event  it is a feeling   suffocating and dispiriting and freighted with gloom  With no refuge from that feeling  we seek solace in another  national pride March 29 was supposed to be the date Britain exited the European Union  In the 33 months since our narrow decision to do that  our political paralysis around the terms of our departure has reached a terminal  possibly fatal state  The deal that Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with Brussels was robustly defeated in Parliament   twice  Yet now  she must bring it back for a third time  If the deal cannot be agreed upon  we very well might  after a derisory extension of two weeks  leave without a deal at all   an eventuality that Parliament has already rejected as too calamitous So we re all agreed  In our bid to  quietly make history   we would prefer a deal that does not in fact exist and for which there is no time left to negotiate because we ve spent all of our time getting a deal we don t want  meaning that now we re readying ourselves to sidestep the humiliation of a deal we don t like by accepting the ruin of a non deal we don t like either  We are  in almost every sense  on a plane to nowhere  and because we have nowhere to go  we have to convince ourselves that nowhere is exactly where we wish to be With nothing meaningful to say about our future  we ve retreated into the falsehoods of the past  painting over the absence of certainty at our core with a whitewash of poisonous nostalgia  The result is that Britain has entered a haunted dreamscape of collective dementia   a half waking state in which the previous day or hour is swiftly erased and the fantasies of the previous century leap vividly to the fore  Turning on the television or opening Twitter  we find people who have no memory of the Second World War invoking a kind of blitz spirit  or succumbing to fits of self righteous fury because someone has dared to impugn the legacy of Winston Churchill At the same time  in our determination to rekindle the embers of our cooling significance  we seem perfectly happy to burn the future of our young for fuel  Efforts by students to counter the colonial arrogance that has been our ruin by decolonizing the curriculum have been met with sputtering  insecure outrage  Recently  a group of students  and future voters  protesting the government s hopeless stance on climate change were dismissed as mere truants by a leading member of the Conservative Party  We re so obsessed with our past that we cannot  any longer  even countenance a future  To protect that past  we seem prepared to abandon the future entirely  to tell ourselves that there is no future  just as to British Airways there are apparently no countries to fly to The problem with all this self deluding preservation of the past isn t just that it s regressive  or alienating for those of us who don t spend our time musing on Churchill s legacy or swelling with pride at our good fortune to accidentally be born British  it s that it pollutes and stagnates even the discourse that ought to oppose it ImageLondon s Piccadilly district  teeming with cars and pedestrians  in 1953 CreditBert Hardy Picture Post  via Getty ImagesThe Brexiteers aren t alone in wanting to turn back time and behave as if certain significant events never happened  A look at the more unequivocal end of the pro European Union spectrum of British political life   the die hard Remainers   finds similar retrospection  The referendum result  they claim  was not a statement but a mistake  the consequence not so much of mass dissatisfaction and a decades long tabloid project of anti European propaganda but of a plot to subvert our democracy  Their solution  To hold another referendum  magically erasing both the bitter divisions of the intervening years and the social and political conditions that nurtured anti European Union rage in the first place In an age of hidebound regression  moving forward becomes inseparable from looking backward and inward  Frustrated by what they see as the outdated and ineffective deadlock of the two party political orthodoxy  a shiny new breakaway faction has emerged in Parliament called The Independent Group  Pressed for clarity on such tiresome details as policy  one of its more significant members  the ex Tory Anna Soubry  defensively claimed that even to ask such a thing was the  old way  of politics  and that this group is based on  shared values   The slightest scratch at the surface of those values  however  reveals nothing new whatsoever  with the No  1 shared value  as listed on their website  turning out to be the drably predictable assertion that  Ours is a great country of which people are rightly proud   It s the same old pillar of jingoism and self regard to which  it increasingly seems  everyone must genuflect before  or even in place of  saying anything else at all Here  ultimately  lies the Gordian knot at the heart of Britain s predicament  To shape from our current inertia a meaningful future  we need to address the brutal reality of the present  We are not quietly leading any revolutions right now  unless one counts as a revolution our project of self dismantlement We re the world s fifth largest economy and likely to sink to seventh this year  Industry and finance are falling over themselves to flee  Nor am I convinced that anyone should be  rightly proud  of a country in which  according to the homelessness charity Crisis  the number of people sleeping on the streets has risen 140 percent since 2010  in which over a million emergency food packages were given to those struggling financially in the 2017 18 financial year  in which over 4 million children are living in poverty  and in which local councils in England face an  8 billion financial black hole by 2025  endangering not only their upkeep of communal spaces  but also their ability to provide adequate care for children  the elderly and people with disabilities  Indeed  when the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights visited Britain last year  his verdict was damning  depicting not a nation  picking itself up when things get tough  and  quietly making history  but a society in which  as he put it   British compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive  meanspirited and often callous approach   We are even  in point of fact  going off tea Our inability to state difficult truths without first offering some reassuring patriotism accounts  in some ways  for the failure of the Remain argument  In making a negative case against leaving the European Union   that it will cause irreparable harm to the economy  that vital flows of food and medicine may be disrupted  that we will consign ourselves to bit part status on the global stage   Remainers  concerns have been dismissed as traitorous fantasy  the manipulative catastrophizing of what Brexiteers call  Project Fear  And so  all too often  Remainers reach for the same dreamy jingoism as those who would have us violently depart the European Union with no terms in place  There is no patriotic argument for Remain because Brexit itself is a cautionary argument against blind national pride  It s precisely this empty  hopeless paradox that in June 2016 led to Prime Minister David Cameron  in a last ditch effort to persuade voters to side with the European Union  telling us  pathetically  that  Brits don t quit   It s also  one assumes  why in January a group of German political leaders and prominent figures encouraging Britain to stay in the Union wrote an open letter not to make a case for Brussels but to appeal to our beverage sipping sense of self  writing that if we left  they would miss  going to the pub after work hours to drink an ale  and  tea with milk and driving on the left hand side of the road    a gale of pure wind with all the meaninglessness of a British Airways ad So here we are  facing more delays and uncertainty  The Defense Ministry reportedly is hunkering down in a nuclear bunker  preparing for  no deal   a crash headlong into a future from which we mistakenly thought our past would protect us  We are pathologically unable to say what needs to be said  that nostalgia  exceptionalism and a xenophobic failure of the collective imagination have undone us  This is not a time of national pride  it is a moment of deep and lasting national shame  We are unable to lead yet determined never to follow  We have nothing of note to say and yet still refuse to listen  The very forces that have shored up our self regard and poisoned our place in history are about to erode us from within  and unless we find in ourselves the humility we ve always abhorred  we face a brutal and potentially permanent humbling Cups of tea will neither turn back time nor show us  in their cold and increasingly bitter leaves  the future we ve failed to imagine  a future in which what limited achievements we might have been proud of   our system of social care  our commitment to protecting the people least able to protect themselves   lie in ruins  and all we can do is sit in the dark

SEOUL  South Korea   North Korea on Saturday escalated its attempt to create a rift between South Korea and the United States  as Washington sent mixed signals over whether it would tighten or relax sanctions on the North Ever since the summit meeting between the North s leader  Kim Jong un  and President Trump in Hanoi  Vietnam  late last month abruptly ended without a deal  North Korea has ceaselessly urged South Korea to distance itself from the United States and to push ahead with joint economic projects that have been held back by American led United Nations sanctions North Korea s official trade has been devastated by international sanctions imposed since 2016  The country has tried to circumvent them by importing refined fuel or exporting coal through ship to ship transfers on the high seas  a move banned under United Nations sanctions  It has also sought to undermine the sanctions by boosting economic cooperation with South Korea President Moon Jae in of South Korea remains eager to boost inter Korean economic ties  raising fears at home and abroad that he may steer his government away from international efforts to enforce sanctions against the North  But in reality  Mr  Moon s hands are tied unless the United States and North Korea reach an agreement on denuclearizing the North and Washington helps to ease sanctions On Saturday  DPRK Today  a North Korean government run website  accused Mr  Moon s government of reneging on its promise to improve inter Korean ties and giving priority to  cooperation with a foreign force  over  cooperation among the Korean nation   The South Korean authorities  behavior is deeply deplorable   it said   The only things the South will get from cooperating with the U S  will be a deepening subordination  humiliation and shame  North Korean state media has been issuing similar messages in recent days  even denigrating Mr  Moon s efforts to mediate talks between his  American boss  and North Korea  and advising Mr  Moon s government to throw its policy  in a garbage can  Mr  Moon suffered another slap in the face when the North abruptly withdrew its staff from a joint inter Korean liaison office on Friday  The South s authorities can t do anything without approval or instruction from the United States  so how do they think they can be a mediator or facilitator   the North Korean website Meari said on Friday   They should know their place  Mr  Moon has dedicated his diplomatic resources to facilitating dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang  and has promoted building peace on the Korean Peninsula as his main policy goal  But his mediator s role has run into a wall since the breakdown of the Hanoi meeting between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kim He faced accusations that he had oversold Mr  Trump on Mr  Kim s willingness to give up his nuclear weapons  even as North Korea accused him of working on behalf of Washington  But Mr  Moon remains determined to keep the momentum for diplomacy alive The Hanoi summit meeting broke down when Mr  Kim insisted that the most punishing United Nations sanctions against his country should be lifted in return for a partial dismantlement of his country s nuclear program Before the Hanoi meeting  analysts had feared that Mr  Trump might sign onto a partial denuclearization deal and claim it as a victory  But in the end  he listened to his aides  advice and walked away without signing a deal After the Hanoi meeting  Mr  Trump has continued to reaffirm his good relationship with Mr  Kim and his willingness to make a deal  But the American president s aides remain firm against lifting sanctions  arguing that it would deprive Washington of its most powerful tool to force North Korea s complete denuclearization On Thursday  the United States Treasury Department demonstrated Washington s determination to keep squeezing the North by designating for punitive measures two Chinese shipping companies that had helped North Korea evade sanctions through deceptive methods like ship to ship transfers of cargo South Korea was thrown into confusion after Mr  Trump tweeted that he ordered his government on Friday to withdraw  additional large scale sanctions  against the North  The tweet was initially taken as overruling the Treasury s announcement the day before But United States officials later explained that Mr  Trump had been referring to additional North Korea sanctions that were under consideration but not yet formally issued  President Trump likes Chairman Kim  and he doesn t think these sanctions will be necessary   Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  told reporters That raised hopes among Mr  Moon s domestic supporters  who took Mr  Trump s latest move as a sign that Washington did not want to antagonize North Korea with new sanctions  During a news conference in Hanoi immediately after his meeting with Mr  Kim  Mr  Trump said he didn t want to talk about increasing sanctions partly because there were  a lot of great people in North Korea that have to live also   By withdrawing additional sanctions against North Korea  President Trump showed his firm will to continue dialogue to realize the denuclearization of North Korea   Lee Hae sik  a spokesman of Mr  Moon s governing Democratic Party  told reporters on Saturday But the main opposition Liberty Korea Party said that Mr  Moon has been used as  a pawn  by Mr  Kim and had ended up creating a fission in the alliance with Washington  President Moon Jae in and his Blue House still don t grasp the reality and have a delusional belief that he is a mediator or facilitator   Jun Hee kyung  a spokeswoman for the opposition party  said in a statement By dropping North Korea related sanctions  Mr  Trump was trying to defuse growing tensions between Washington and Pyongyang after the Hanoi breakdown  said Harry J  Kazianis  director of Korean studies at the Washington based Center for the National Interest Recently  Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son hui of North Korea threatened to suspend negotiations with Washington and said that Mr  Kim would soon decide whether to resume nuclear and missile tests  which it has not carried out in more than a year  Trump s canceling out of sanctions might have been a bid to get North Korea to change its thinking   Mr  Kazianis said  

JACKSONVILLE  N C    The main road that connects a strip of tattoo parlors  pawn shops and restaurants to Camp Lejeune is still lined with broken trees bent by Hurricane Florence s winds  Inside the gates  a new threat has arisen for the sprawling Marine Corps base as it contends with billions of dollars in hurricane damage and lingering effects of contaminated water  President Trump s border wall On Tuesday  the House will try to override the first veto of Mr  Trump s presidency and rescue Congress s bipartisan bid to block the president s national emergency declaration  which Mr  Trump wants to use to siphon military funds from projects like Camp Lejeune s reconstruction to build a wall on the Mexican border Last month  Democrats appealed to Republicans   with only limited success   to vote down the president s emergency on the lofty grounds of constitutional prerogative and Congress s control of federal spending  This time  on the veto override  their appeal is more parochial  Look where the wall money will come from ImageA strip of businesses bordering the base in Jacksonville caters to military personnel CreditJeremy M  Lange for The New York Times A bipartisan majority of Congress went on record in voting to rebuke this ill conceived idea   said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island  the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee   Now that members of Congress can see the potential impact this proposal could have on projects in their home states  I hope they will take that into consideration before the vote to override the president s veto  The expansive list of Defense Department projects targeted for possible cuts    12 9 billion in all   spans nearly all 50 states and more than two dozen countries where troops are stationed  Fire station repairs  new schools and training complexes are all slated for potential funding delays to fulfill Mr  Trump s intent to take up to  3 6 billion in military construction funds for the wall  So are plans for Camp Lejeune s new water treatment facility  What may seem small is large to others   said Monique Gibbs  39  a Jacksonville  N C   native who works with survivors of trauma and abuse ImageThe expansive list of Defense Department projects targeted for possible cuts    12 9 billion in all   spans nearly all 50 states and more than two dozen countries where troops are stationed CreditJeremy M  Lange for The New York TimesOn Monday  Patrick M  Shanahan  the acting defense secretary  authorized the first transfer of Defense Department money to fencing construction at the southwestern border  up to  1 billion from military personnel funding toward the construction of 57 miles of border wall  improving roads and adding lighting in Yuma  Ariz   and El Paso  according to a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security That transfer was made without having to use the emergency declaration  but the Defense Department is rushing to sign contracts on several projects  hoping that will protect them before officials turn to military construction funds to fulfill the president s request  But some projects would be hit if the emergency decree survives its congressional rebuke and court challenges  and delays could be consequential for service members and their families National Guard officials are scrambling to award money to build a  9 million fire rescue station in Peoria  Ill   before it is lost to the border and locals are left with an outdated fire station   built in 1992 and incapable of providing 24 hour support ImageSome project delays could prove consequential for armed service members and their families CreditJeremy M  Lange for The New York TimesAt Fort Campbell  Ky   home of the historic 101st Airborne Division  base housing and maintenance facilities are throwbacks to the 1950s  The structures have slowly degraded under the rapid deployment tempo of the wars since the Sept  11  2001  attacks  according to congressional aides who recently toured the facility  And without congressional intervention  construction on a  63 million middle school will be delayed and base officials will likely repurpose an aging high school in the interim In Jacksonville  there is discomfort among residents that money for Camp Lejeune s projects could be delayed for a wall more than a thousand miles away John Henley  a defense contractor here  doubted the  financial feasibility  of Mr  Trump s signature campaign promise  but he also was resigned to a local hit ImageDemocrats have condemned Senator Thom Tillis  Republican of North Carolina  for putting  his political career ahead of the well being  of local military families CreditErin Schaff The New York Times I hate to make it so nonchalant  a building or two may fall down before they get repaired   Mr  Henley  34  said as he polished off a black cherry and grape snow cone a couple miles from Camp Lejeune  But  he added   we re a resilient type  Efforts to turn the list into political ammunition against Republicans are particularly pointed in North Carolina  where Senator Thom Tillis  a first term Republican  is running for re election next year  Mr  Tillis publicly outlined his intent to vote against Mr  Trump s national emergency declaration last month in a Washington Post opinion piece last month that dwelt on his constitutional responsibilities Then  just before the vote last week  he changed his mind and voted with the president Already  the state Democratic Party has blasted out emails detailing which North Carolina projects were on the list   including the Camp Lejeune water treatment facility   and condemning Mr  Tillis for putting  his political career ahead of the well being  of local military families  That fund raising email sparked more than double the average amount in donations  according to a person familiar with the results ImageThe Montford Point Marine Memorial near Camp Lejeune  The area is still recovering from Hurricane Florence CreditJeremy M  Lange for The New York Times This definitely damaged Senator Tillis s re election concern in a way that s unique  more so than the government shutdown or some of the past votes he took   said Robert Howard  a spokesman for the North Carolina Democratic Party  citing the potential effect on Camp Lejeune  Fort Bragg and other military bases   We very much understood what the emergency declaration could mean to our state  Mr  Tillis said on Monday that he was concerned about the potential threat to the projects  but added   I feel like the critical needs   we ll be able to secure funding   I m not worried about that   Mr  Tillis said when asked about Democrats weaponizing his vote and the threat to North Carolina projects   They ll always be looking for ammunition  ImagePollen in the New River in Jacksonville CreditJeremy M  Lange for The New York TimesRepublican strategists and several conservative voters said his flip flop suited them fine  I m glad he changed his mind   said Ann Sulliview  68  speaking ahead of a Republican convention in Wayne County  where officials emphasized the need to keep both the Senate and the presidency in Republican control  But  she conceded   he was going to catch flak for that either way he went  Patrick Gallagher  a Wayne County chiropractor  agreed   We put him in office because he s going to help the Republican Party   he said   The fact that he had a change of heart shows that he reflected back on why he s there  He s not there to thwart what we re trying to accomplish  Potentially losing money for military projects  he acknowledged   is not the best  for the state  But he said it was something he and other conservative voters could accept for Mr  Trump and his wall  I think we would give that up to do the greater good   Dr  Gallagher said   It s not the best  but we re forced to do that  Republican lawmakers who voted against the national emergency declaration found that sentiment prevalent when they returned to their districts  Senator Roy Blunt  Republican of Missouri  was disinvited from a Republican dinner after his vote against the emergency declaration  the Kansas City Star reported And at a town hall style meeting in Spokane  Wash   on Monday  Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers told about 20 constituents that her vote for the resolution of disapproval    a difficult vote for me   she repeated   was a vote against a president trying to secure taxpayer funds without congressional approval  not against a border wall  Some applauded her resolve  but others were unconvinced of her support for Mr  Trump s border security vision  I appreciate your vote  but I disagree   said Kerry Schmidt  62   There s a lot of people fighting against it  Where are the people fighting for it   

BANGKOK   Pauline Ngarmpring is running for prime minister of Thailand  one of around 70 candidates for the job  She will not win One reason is that she was born a he But a more fundamental explanation is that Thailand s elections  scheduled for Sunday  were circumscribed even before campaigning began  For nearly five years since a military coup  Thailand has been ruled by a junta that has suppressed dissent  targeted political parties and  now  orchestrated an election that will give voters only partial franchise That hasn t stopped around 80 parties from running  Their aims are eclectic  Ms  Pauline s party wants to represent not only transgender individuals like herself  but any Thai whose human rights have been compromised  People think of Thailand as a party place  so happy and nice for holiday  but we have a lot of problems with human rights that need to be solved with better government   Ms  Pauline said in an interview ImageCampaign posters in Bangkok  On Sunday  Thailand will hold its first general election since the 2014 military coup CreditLauren Decicca Getty ImagesAnother major party  Bhumjaithai  which came in third in the last elections  has tied the nation s future to the legal cultivation of marijuana  Its leader  Anutin Charnvirakul  says that Thailand s soil is perfect for growing cannabis and that small scale farming could bring each household an extra  13 000 a year   if people don t hoard too much for their own recreational use There is a political party for defenders of Buddhism  and another with 15 candidates who all legally changed their names to those of the Shinawatra siblings  two popular former prime ministers whose governments were unseated by military coups Yet these diverse platforms and colorful candidates camouflage a darker truth  After years of delay by the junta  Thailand may at last be going through the rituals of democracy  but the elections are taking place in a much diminished political landscape  Thailand is moving into a custodial democracy under long term military supervision   said Thitinan Pongsudhirak  a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok   Anti junta forces are likely to win the vote in the lower house  but because the Constitution is so stacked in the military s favor  a junta led coalition government is likely  Even pro military Thais agree that Pheu Thai  a populist party affiliated with the Shinawatra family  will be the top vote getter on Sunday  as were its sister parties in every previous election this century  But the junta s Constitution ensures that the Senate is entirely appointed  and the prime minister does not need to be a sitting member of Parliament ImagePrime Minister Prayuth Chan ocha  center  the head of the National Council for Peace and Order  as the junta is known  has been nominated to stay in his current job by a military affiliated political party CreditJewel Samad Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesGiven the constitutional limits  it is improbable that Pheu Thai will be able to form a government In addition  several other parties and their executives have court cases hanging over them that  after the election  could result in the dissolution of parties or jail time for their leaders  Nothing about this upcoming election is free and fair   said Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  the leader of the Future Forward Party  a new youth focused party that has enjoyed a groundswell of online support in a country with some of the most active users of social media in the world In recent elections  only about one third of Thais between the ages of 18 and 25 voted  But social media campaigns have energized the demographic  and more than 10 percent of the electorate is young Mr  Thanathorn  who has enjoyed strong crowd support during campaign stops  is facing computer crimes charges over a Facebook Live video in which  prosecutors say  he spread fake news  Human rights groups say the charges  which also have been made against Future Forward s deputy leader and could involve prison time  have been trumped up in order to kneecap the party A decision in Mr  Thanathorn s case could be made in the coming week Thailand has had a fractious relationship with democracy since absolute monarchy was outlawed nearly nine decades ago  The nation s generals have staged more than a dozen successful coups  and the country has churned through 20 constitutions  The average prime minister s tenure is less than three years ImageSupporters of Pheu Thai at the party s last campaign rally in Bangkok on Friday before the general election CreditLauren Decicca Getty ImagesFor years  the nation has been bifurcated between elite urbanites  and debt ridden farmers and factory workers  who have seen Thailand s wealth gap grow under junta rule  A survey by Credit Suisse found that Thailand is the most unequal society on earth  beating out Russia and India  with 1 percent of the population controlling more than 65 percent of the wealth  In the past in Thailand  it has always been the rich who use their capital to take the profits from poor farmers  who accumulate debt to survive   said Mr  Anutin of the Bhumjaithai Party  which is campaigning on agricultural reform  including cannabis production   This cannot continue  An earlier incarnation of Pheu Thai was one of the first parties to heavily court the nation s rice growers and working class  offering health care subsidies and agricultural incentives  The result was landslides in every election since 2001  when Thaksin Shinawatra  a billionaire telecoms entrepreneur from the north  swept to victory and discomfited the establishment in Bangkok Mr  Thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and has since been convicted in absentia of corruption linked crimes  as has his sister  Yingluck Shinawatra  another former prime minister  whose government was toppled in the 2014 coup  Both remain popular  even from self imposed exile Prime Minister Prayuth Chan ocha  the head of the National Council for Peace and Order  as the junta is known  has been nominated to stay in his current job by a military affiliated political party ImagePauline Ngarmpring  center  a candidate for prime minister  campaigning in Bangkok last month CreditGemunu Amarasinghe Associated PressMr  Prayuth is openly distrustful of some of the trappings of democracy  He has threatened  perhaps jokingly  to shoot journalists whose coverage he dislikes  Under junta rule  dissidents have been sent to detention camps for attitude adjustment  Cybercrime and sedition legislation has been used to target thousands of people who have spoken out against the junta and its limits on freedom of assembly and speech In the weeks before the election  Mr  Prayuth  who writes his own songs and likes to perform them  has tried to show off a gentler mien  His party has released gauzy photos of the prime minister on social media  one with his hands cupping his smiling face  accompanied by a sentiment attributed to Mr  Prayuth   Sometimes I want to look handsome  Even if Pheu Thai and other Shinawatra linked parties mimic history and do well in Sunday s election   one such party was dissolved this month by the Constitutional Court  in a controversy that involved the Thai king s sister s brief candidacy for prime minister   the bloc of 250 senators appointed by the military is likely to jettison their chances of leading the country What may follow  instead  is a weak  fractious coalition  The Democrat Party  a long established force that gave tacit support to the last coup  is angling for a major role in any coalition  It is likely to be among the top vote getters on Sunday  winning support in its traditional urban and southern power bases But waiting in the wings  and even on the ballots  is the military  If anti junta forces coalesce again  no one is discounting another putsch  Every time there s a coup d état  the country falls behind   Mr  Thanathorn said   This vicious cycle must be stopped   

Duke University will pay  112 5 million to the federal government to settle allegations that researchers submitted applications and reports containing falsified data to win more than two dozen grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency  the Justice Department said on Monday  Taxpayers expect and deserve that federal grant dollars will be used efficiently and honestly   Matthew G T  Martin  United States attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina  said in a statement   May this serve as a lesson that the use of false or fabricated data in grant applications or reports is completely unacceptable  The allegations were initially made in a whistle blower lawsuit brought by Joseph Thomas  a research analyst who worked in Duke s pulmonary division  He claimed that another researcher  Erin Potts Kant  had fabricated data linked to as much as  200 million in federal research grants Mr  Thomas filed the lawsuit under the False Claims Act  a federal law that allows individuals to sue on behalf of the government  Under the law  the plaintiff may receive a portion of the damages  Mr  Thomas is to receive more than  33 million from the settlement Neither Mr  Thomas nor Ms  Potts Kant was immediately available for comment Although Mr  Thomas s lawsuit alleged that the fraud occurred between 2006 and 2013  the Justice Department said that the settlement announced Monday resolved allegations covering a longer period  from 2006 to 2018 University officials said on Monday that they discovered the possible research misconduct in 2013  after Ms  Potts Kant was fired for embezzling funds  Ms  Potts Kant eventually pleaded guilty to two counts of forgery and paid restitution  the university said In a statement announcing the settlement  Vincent E  Price  president of Duke University  said that the payment would include reimbursement of the grants obtained as a result of the falsified data  as well as additional penalties  This is a difficult moment for Duke   Dr  Price said   This case demonstrates the devastating impact of research fraud and reinforces the need for all of us to have a focused commitment on promoting research integrity and accountability  The university has taken steps in recent years to promote ethics in research  he added  including the creation of an office for scientific integrity  requiring mandatory research integrity training for all medical school faculty  and keeping all research data records The university will take several additional measures  to promote values and a culture of excellence and accountability   Dr  Price said  Among them will be creating an advisory panel on research integrity and excellence  to be led by Ann M  Arvin  a professor of pediatrics and microbiology at Stanford University  that will include and professors from the California Institute of Technology and Rockefeller University  

Even as the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  submitted his confidential report to the Justice Department on Friday  federal and state prosecutors are pursuing about a dozen other investigations that largely grew out of his work  all but ensuring that a legal threat will continue to loom over the Trump presidency Most of the investigations focus on President Trump or his family business or a cadre of his advisers and associates  according to court records and interviews with people briefed on the investigations  They are being conducted by officials from Los Angeles to Brooklyn  with about half of them being run by the United States attorney s office in Manhattan Unlike Mr  Mueller  whose mandate was largely focused on any links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government s interference in the 2016 presidential election  the federal prosecutors in Manhattan take an expansive view of their jurisdiction  That authority has enabled them  along with F B I  agents  to scrutinize a broader orbit around the president  including his family business Mr  Trump told The New York Times in 2017 that any examination of his family s finances  beyond any relationship to Russia  would cross a red line  and last year he privately asked the former acting attorney general  Matthew G  Whitaker  if someone he viewed as loyal could be put in charge of the investigations at the Manhattan office  The Times reported last month  Read more  Before Mueller s report  the president waged a two year war against the Trump Russia investigations  Some of those federal investigations in the Manhattan office  known as the Southern District of New York  grew out of its case against Michael D  Cohen  the president s former lawyer and fixer  The inquiry into Mr  Cohen was turned over to the Manhattan federal prosecutors early last year after Mr  Mueller s office spent months investigating him  court records unsealed this week show By dint of its location in Manhattan  a few miles south of the Trump Organization s offices on Fifth Avenue  the Southern District was a natural landing spot for the Cohen case ImageProsecutors in Brooklyn have raised questions about donations to the Trump inaugural committee  which was chaired by Thomas J  Barrack  a longtime friend of Mr  Trump CreditAlbin Lohr Jones Sipa USA  via Associated PressSituated in a drab  nine story Brutalist style building nestled among the federal courthouse  Police Headquarters and the Church of St  Andrew  the office has a history of high profile prosecutions and personnel  From the espionage trial of the Rosenbergs in the early 1950s to the case of an Egyptian sheikh who plotted to bomb city landmarks four decades later  the office s prosecutions have started the careers of judges  F B I  directors and even a New York City mayor Since Mr  Cohen pleaded guilty in August to helping arrange hush money payments to women who said they had affairs with Mr  Trump  the prosecutors have focused on what role the Trump Organization and its executives  including its longtime chief financial officer  may have played in the scheme  according to people briefed on the matter Mr  Cohen  who is scheduled to begin serving a three year prison sentence in May  has assisted the prosecutors with that inquiry as well as a separate investigation into the president s inaugural committee  the people said The prosecutors have also examined information brought by Mr  Cohen that he hopes will reduce his sentence  the people said  including whether Mr  Trump s lawyers considered offering him a presidential pardon to keep him quiet and whether the Trump Organization possibly inflated insurance claims several years ago At this point  it is unclear whether anyone will be charged with a crime  Some of the investigations involve allegations that may be too old to be prosecuted  Yet taken together  the investigations show that the prosecutorial center of gravity has shifted from Mr  Mueller s office in Washington to New York  The important thing to remember is that almost everything Donald Trump did was in the Southern District of New York   said John S  Martin Jr   a retired federal judge who was the United States attorney in the Southern District during the Carter and Reagan administrations  He ran his business in the Southern District  He ran his campaign from the Southern District   Judge Martin said   He came home to New York every night  In an interview that aired on Friday morning  Mr  Trump told Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network that his lawyers were perplexed by reports that he faces multiple investigations VideoThe special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  has conducted an extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race  Here is the story of how it all started CreditCreditDoug Mills The New York Times I said to my lawyers   Are we being looked at here    Mr  Trump said  adding that his lawyers  don t even know what people are talking about  James M  Margolin  a spokesman for the Southern District  declined to comment  as did the Trump Organization The precise number of federal investigations around the country that have grown out of the special counsel s work remains unknown because such inquiries are conducted in secret  But the special counsel s office farmed out strands of its inquiry to at least three other United States attorneys  offices  including in Brooklyn  the District of Columbia and the Eastern District of Virginia People briefed on the federal investigations said the prosecutors in Brooklyn have raised questions about donations to the Trump inaugural committee  which was chaired by Thomas J  Barrack  a longtime friend of Mr  Trump  They have been examining Mr  Barrack s ties to the Middle East  among other matters  according to the people briefed on the work  Read more  Unraveling the Trump Russia story so far  Federal prosecutors in the District of Columbia will handle the prosecution of the Trump political adviser Roger J  Stone Jr   who was charged as part of Mr  Mueller s investigation  And the Justice Department continues to investigate the business and political dealings of Elliott Broidy  a top fund raiser for Mr  Trump s campaign and inauguration  who tried to use his access to the Trump team to boost his businesses  Federal investigators in Los Angeles have also taken part in the inquiry and have raised questions about the inauguration  according to people briefed on the matter Separately  state authorities in New York are pursuing several investigations focused on the president  his associates and his business  Those matters include a mortgage fraud case against Mr  Trump s former campaign chairman  Paul J  Manafort  as well as civil inquiries into the Trump Organization s insurance practices  real estate deals  and whether the family s charitable foundation violated tax laws As for the Southern District  it is known to move aggressively   more so than some other offices   to stake a claim to new investigations based on tips from cooperating witnesses and other sources  In this instance  it appears to be leading some of the most sensitive spinoffs   ones with the potential to directly affect Mr  Trump s business  his inaugural committee and possibly himself In the hush money investigation  the Southern District prosecutors have already implicated the president  claiming in a court filing that Mr  Cohen  acted in coordination with and at the direction of  Mr  Trump  While the prevailing view at the Justice Department is that a sitting president cannot be indicted  the prosecutors in Manhattan could consider charging him after he leaves office  particularly if he does not win re election and is a private citizen before the legal deadline to file charges expires ImageFederal prosecutors in the District of Columbia will handle the prosecution of the Trump political adviser Roger J  Stone Jr   who was charged as part of Mr  Mueller s investigation CreditCliff Owen Associated PressThe investigation into the Trump inaugural committee partly grew out of a recording that F B I  agents seized when they raided Mr  Cohen s home and office  On the recording  Mr  Cohen is heard discussing potential irregularities with one of the main contractors for the inauguration  The Southern District is investigating  among other things  whether the committee made false filings with the Federal Election Commission and received illegal donations from foreign nationals  a subpoena from the investigation shows In addition  the Southern District took on two investigations stemming from the cases against Mr  Manafort  who was prosecuted by Mr  Mueller s office and was recently sentenced to more than seven years in prison for a litany of crimes In one of the investigations  the prosecutors are weighing charges against the officer of a bank that Mr  Manafort has acknowledged defrauding  according to people briefed on the matter In the other  Mr  Mueller s team referred investigations involving three firms that worked with Mr  Manafort   the lobbying firms Mercury Public Affairs and Podesta Group  and the law firm Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher   Flom   to the Southern District for potential prosecution under the Foreign Agents Registration Act Since then  Skadden reached a settlement with the Justice Department  But prosecutors in Washington are weighing charges against Skadden s lead lawyer on the firm s work in consultation with Mr  Manafort in 2012 on behalf of the Ukrainian government  while the Southern District has retained control of the investigations of Mercury and the Podesta Group  according to people familiar with the matter The Southern District s reputation for nonpartisanship   and history of autonomy from the Justice Department in Washington  giving it the nickname  Sovereign District    may make it less vulnerable to attacks from the president and his allies  The president s lead lawyer  Rudolph W  Giuliani  led the office from 1983 to 1989 and later became New York s mayor The Southern District s role in Trump related cases comes at a time of transition for the office  which is led by Geoffrey S  Berman  who was appointed in January 2018 by the Trump administration Mr  Berman notified Justice Department officials early last year of a possible appearance of a conflict of interest in the Cohen investigation  and officials concluded that he should be recused  for reasons that have not been disclosed ImageThe Southern District s role in Trump related cases comes at a time of transition for the office  which is led by Geoffrey S  Berman CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesIn his stead  Mr  Berman s handpicked deputy  Robert S  Khuzami  led the Cohen investigation  But on Friday  Mr  Berman announced that Mr  Khuzami will step down from his post next month to return home to Washington Mr  Berman named his senior counsel  Audrey Strauss  as Mr  Khuzami s successor  Ms  Strauss  who had already been deeply involved in the Cohen investigation  will assume responsibility for any remaining aspects of the Cohen inquiry that were subject to Mr  Berman s recusal Mr  Khuzami s departure will not directly affect most of the other Trump related investigations  which Mr  Berman has supervised  Mr  Berman s name  for example  appeared on a February grand jury subpoena served on the president s inaugural committee For the most part  the investigations surrounding the president and his associates have been assigned to career prosecutors in the office s public corruption unit  which has a track record of convicting politicians on both sides of the aisle  Those prosecutors work on the eighth floor of the building  down the hall from Mr  Berman s office The unit is led by two office veterans  Russell Capone and Edward B  Diskant  and although line prosecutors shift in and out   one assistant who worked on the Cohen inquiry  Rachel Maimin  recently went into private practice  and another  Andrea M  Griswold  returned to work full time on securities cases   the unit has a deep bench Two prosecutors who worked on the Cohen case  Thomas McKay and Nicolas Roos  remain in the unit  The investigations are overseen by the office s criminal division  which recently got a new chief  Laura G  Birger  she succeeded Lisa Zornberg  who left the office to return to private practice Robert B  Fiske Jr   a former United States attorney in Manhattan who later served as the first independent counsel investigating the Whitewater matter during the Clinton administration  said the Southern District prosecutors would maintain the kind of professionalism associated with Mr  Mueller s team  If the question is  should the public have confidence that there will be the same kind of integrity and independence in the Southern District of New York that there has been in the Mueller investigation  the answer is absolutely   Mr  Fiske said  

WELLINGTON  New Zealand   As Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand considered on Monday how her government would investigate the terrorist attack that traumatized the country 10 days ago  she also began returning to normal business  announcing that she would make a long delayed trip to Beijing next week The announcement signaled a shift after signs of growing tensions between the countries  Ms  Ardern  who told reporters that she would meet with China s president  Xi Jinping  and the country s premier  Li Keqiang  said the long planned trip had been scaled back to a single day in light of the attack The visit will be  literally 24 hours  and traveling with as little time away as possible   Ms  Ardern said  adding that the trip had been planned  some weeks ago  and that Chinese officials had been  incredibly accommodating  about her decision to shorten it after the shooting attacks on two Christchurch mosques in which 50 people were killed Her original plan had been to travel with a business delegation from New Zealand and to make stops in three cities  Instead  she will travel without the group and will visit only Beijing There have been growing fears that New Zealand s close economic relationship with China was fraying after Ms  Ardern was unable to schedule a visit there to follow up on a November invitation  Around the same time  the start of a much anticipated joint tourism initiative with China was canceled  and that has now been rescheduled for Friday China is New Zealand s largest trading partner and imports more than  10 billion of its products Commentators suggested that Ms  Ardern s government was facing retaliation because it had joined other Western nations in taking a tough stance against the Chinese technology company Huawei  The company took out advertisements in the country s largest newspapers last month  trying to win public support in New Zealand for its involvement in the country s 5G telecommunications networks  China is an important regional and global actor with whom we must work on challenges facing the global community and those critical to the security and prosperity of our region   Ms  Ardern told reporters on Monday  having previously played down talk of tensions The apparent shift in the relationship came as her cabinet met on Monday to decide what form its investigation into the Christchurch attacks would take  settling on a royal commission   an independent inquiry reserved for the most serious matters in New Zealand public life Ms  Ardern said the commission would investigate whether anything could have been done to prevent the attacks  in which a gunman killed 50 people and injured 50 more as they worshiped at two mosques during Friday Prayer on March 15  The gunman broadcast the killings live on Facebook ImageA makeshift memorial on Monday to victims of the shooting in Christchurch  New Zealand  in front of the Linwood Mosque  one of two targeted in the attack CreditAdam Dean for The New York TimesThe inquiry would also examine the accessibility of semiautomatic weapons   Ms  Ardern has already acted to ban military style versions of such guns   the role social media played in the attack  and whether New Zealand s security services or other government agencies could have done anything to prevent it Muslims in New Zealand and overseas were  quite rightly asking questions about how this terror attack was able to happen here   Ms  Ardern said Dean Knight  a public law professor at Victoria University of Wellington  said royal commissions were usually led by retired judges  lawyers or industry experts and took  as long as they need to take   though Ms  Ardern said this inquiry would not take  years  as others have in the past  Because they can be bespoke in their work  it s possible to develop a strategy to deliver things promptly   Dr  Knight said by email   But if the inquiry is run with the tradition of court like processes  it will slow things down  Ms  Ardern said it was  unacceptable  that the gunman s video was still available on social media platforms  even after tech companies assured her that they were working to remove it  While she would not comment on the policies of individual companies  shortened videos of the shooting   which has been classified as illegal to share by New Zealand s chief censor   were still available on Twitter on Monday Twitter said in an emailed statement that it had  rigorous processes and a dedicated team in place  for emergency situations such as the Christchurch attacks  and that it cooperated with law enforcement where required The company did not detail what the emergency processes entailed or how they differed from normal moderation tools  It did not say whether New Zealand law enforcement had made specific requests Twitter has asked users to report such material if they see it  but Ms  Ardern said relying on users to flag the video was  not an effective way of managing incredibly disturbing content

COPENHAGEN   Can a city cancel out its greenhouse gas emissions Copenhagen intends to  and fast  By 2025  this once grimy industrial city aims to be net carbon neutral  meaning it plans to generate more renewable energy than the dirty energy it consumes Here s why it matters to the rest of the world  Half of humanity now lives in cities  and the vast share of planet warming gases come from cities  The big fixes for climate change need to come from cities too  They are both a problem and a potential source of solutions  The experience of Copenhagen  home to 624 000 people  can show what s possible  and what s tough  for other urban governments on a warming planet  The mayor  Frank Jensen  said cities  can change the way we behave  the way we are living  and go more green   His city has some advantages  It is small  it is rich and its people care a lot about climate change Mr  Jensen said mayors  more than national politicians  felt the pressure to take action   We are directly responsible for our cities and our citizens  and they expect us to act   he said Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter In the case of Copenhagen  that means changing how people get around  how they heat their homes  and what they do with their trash  The city has already cut its emissions by 42 percent from 2005 levels  mainly by moving away from fossil fuels to generate heat and electricity  ImageWind turbines along the strait that separates Denmark from Sweden  seen from the Amager Strandpark in Copenhagen ImageA suburban commuter train  A new subway line  scheduled to open this year  will put most residents less than half a mile from a station Politics  though  is making it hard to go further  A municipal government can only do so much when it doesn t have the full support of those who run the country  Mr  Jensen  57  a left of center Social Democrat  for instance  has failed to persuade the national government  led by a center right party  to impose restrictions on diesel guzzling vehicles in the capital  Transportation accounts for a third of the city s carbon footprint  it is the largest single sector and it is growing By contrast  the national government  in a move that its critics say encouraged private car use  has lowered car registration taxes  The transportation minister  Ole Birk Olesen  said the government wanted to reduce what he called  the over taxation of cars   though he added that  ideally  Danes would buy only zero emissions cars in the coming decades And so  Copenhagen s goal to be carbon neutral faces a hurdle that is common around the world  a divide between the interests of people who live in cities and those who live outside  Many opposition politicians and independent analysts say they doubt Copenhagen can meet its 2025 target  and some critics say the plan focuses too much on trying to balance the city s carbon books rather than change the way people actually live  We run around in fossil fuel burning cars  we eat a lot of meat  we buy a hell of a lot of clothes   said Fanny Broholm  a spokeswoman for Alternativet  a left of center green party   The goal is not ambitious enough as it is  and we can t even reach this goal  Mr  Jensen  for his part  is bullish on what he calls the capital s  green transformation   City officials say this is only the start A new Metro line  scheduled to open this year  will put the vast majority of the city s residents within 650 meters  a bit less than half a mile  of a station  Bicycle paths are already three lanes wide on busy routes for the whopping 43 percent of Copenhageners who commute to work and school by bike   even on wet  windy days  which are plentiful  ImageRecycling bins in the Christianshavn district of Copenhagen  The city requires residents to sort recycling into eight separate categories All that wind helps generate the city s electricity  Buildings are heated  in part  by burning garbage in a new high tech incinerator   what garbage there is to burn  that is  considering that every apartment building now has eight separate recycling bins  For every unit of fossil fuels it consumes  Copenhagen intends to sell units of renewable energy  The city has invested heavily in wind turbines In big cities  you have the money and the scale to change things  Mr  Jensen said as he led me on a bike tour from City Hall  where excavations for a new Metro station recently turned up the remains of two Vikings  We crossed a bicycle bridge that led to a once industrial district  now home to trendy restaurants  As we rode  Mr  Jensen talked about parliamentary polls set for this spring   Elections will come up in the next few months  and a lot of people living in the suburbs still have diesel cars   he said   It s a political challenge  It s not a technological challenge   For Copenhagen  the path to carbon neutrality is paved with imperfect solutions ImageFrank Jensen  the Copenhagen mayor  at City Hall  Some of the city s power plants have switched from coal to wood pellets  shipped in from the Baltics  That s carbon neutral  in principle  if more trees can be planted in place of those that are cut down  and that has helped the city bring down its emissions significantly  But burning wood produces emissions  a lawsuit filed in the European Court of Justice argued that wood pellets should not count as renewable energy  Critics contend that big public investments in biomass only compel the city to use it for years to come Then  there s garbage  The city recently opened a  660 million incinerator  85 meters tall  or about 280 feet  resembling a shiny half built pyramid  with an even taller stack  It s just a short walk from one of the city s most popular restaurants  Noma  Designed by one of the country s best known architects  Bjarke Ingels  it comes with a year round ski slope to attract visitors  and recoup some of the expenses   The mayor was one of the first to take a test run Every day  300 trucks bring garbage to be fed into its enormous furnace  including trash imported from Britain  That has a carbon footprint  too  But the chief engineer  Peter Blinksbjerg  pointed out that instead of going into a landfill  the rubbish of modern life is transformed into something useful  heat for the city s long  cold winters ImageThe Arc incinerator  right  with its year round ski slope visible on the roof  The stack releases steam  not smoke ImageInside the Arc  which burns 300 truckloads of garbage each day  including imported trash  Scrubbers remove most chemical pollutants before releasing steam into the air  By summer  a cafe is set to open in the shadow of the stack Pedaling through the city these days  it is difficult to imagine what Copenhagen once looked like  There were factories in the narrow streets and ships in the oil stained harbor  Coal fired power plants brought electricity  The air was smoggy  A generation of city dwellers moved out to the clean air suburbs Today  even on wintry  wet days  commuters move along a busy bike highway that connects the warrens of the oldest part of the city  where some buildings date to the 1400s  to the northern neighborhoods  whizzing past the stately apartment blocks that overlook the lake  The bike lane is slightly elevated above the car lane  which feels safer than just a white line that demarcates bike lanes in many other cities Inside a cozy neighborhood cafe  a medical student named Mariam Hleihel said she welcomed Mr  Jensen s efforts to reduce the number of polluting cars in the city   If we don t do anything about it now  the consequences could be irreversible   she said ImageMorning commuters on the Dronning Louises Bro  a bridge in central Copenhagen She reflected a widespread sentiment among Danes  A 2018 survey by Concito  a think tank  found that addressing climate change was a top issue for voters  Slightly more than half of those polled said

On a bitter night nearly two and a half squandered years ago  Donald Trump was duly elected the 45th president of the United States of America  His victory was a political scandal  a democratic emergency and a moral shame   but as Robert Mueller seems to have concluded after a definitive investigation  Mr  Trump s win was not the illegitimate product of a treasonous conspiracy There was no collusion  The president was not a Manchurian candidate  And we can t lay the blame for this whole thing on Vladimir Putin Indeed  the truest horror in Mr  Mueller s finding is that we did not need Mr  Putin to be pulling the strings  We know now that under our shambolic democracy  a man as unfit as Mr  Trump really can legitimately acquire all the terrifying powers of the presidency without being controlled by a foreign puppet master  Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter  The second true horror concerns a historically wasted opportunity  In the years we ve spent chasing the fantastical ghosts of collusion  we have all but ignored the structural weaknesses plaguing every corner of the American establishment  from its political parties to its news media to its tilted economic landscape and  most important  the unfair machinery of its democracy Mr  Mueller s indictments show that Russian agents interfered with the 2016 election by sowing discord on social media and hacking and disseminating Democrats  emails  Yet it now seems wiser to point to our intrinsically American shortcomings  more than Russian interference  for Mr  Trump s victory  And in rushing to blame Russian collusion  we have wasted time and political opportunity that we might better have spent reckoning with how to prevent a Trump like catastrophe from happening again I m spelling all this out starkly  because in the spinning to come  it will be all too easy to lose yourself in misdirection  If you are a liberal  you might be especially tempted to give in to the aggrieved and embarrassed  resistance tweeting punditocracy now throwing up endless reasons for downplaying Mr  Mueller s finding  We still haven t seen the whole report  The attorney general is a toady  Don t forget about all those other investigations of all those other crimes These are all important points  But don t overlook the headline finding  Like the Trump victory itself  Mr  Mueller s no collusion conclusion should leave a mark  It lands like a rotten egg on a political and media establishment that had gone all in on its own self serving   and wrong   theory of the case  Before we embark on yet more investigations  it is worth examining  now  why the collusion fantasy proved so irresistible to so many of us   and what we all might have done with our time instead Here s my theory  Collusion was a seductive and convenient delusion  For many Americans  the simple truth that Mr  Trump really had won was too terrible to bear  The ease with which a racist  misogynist  serial con man had slipped past every gatekeeper in American life suggested something deeply sick at the core of our society In particular  Mr  Trump s win pointed to tectonic failures within the mainstream news media  whose leading brands had fanned the showman s rise with copious television coverage  indulged his every gimmick with yet more attention  and elevated his opponent s trifling email management kerfuffle into a scandal of world historic import Mr  Trump s win also pointed to the failure of our political parties  After years of playing footsie with extremists  the Republicans created an environment in which a racist demagogue could swallow them whole Democrats  meanwhile  dismissed the economic and social unease roiling their ranks and nominated a deeply unpopular candidate who lacked any novel vision for American life  And then she forgot to campaign in Michigan There were other minor factors in this American tragedy  Jim Comey s grandstanding  the tech giants  inability to appreciate or curb the chaotic powers of their new communications platforms  our collective innumeracy regarding polling  and a naïve failure to appreciate the profound fragility of our national enterprise Finally there was the plainer constitutional failure  You didn t need a two year federal investigation to determine the single most important lesson of the 2016 race  America does not treat all its voters  and all of its votes  equally  Across the country  the voices of thousands and possibly millions of people were suppressed  Millions more votes went essentially uncounted  because the perversities of the Electoral College elevate a few thousand votes in the Midwest over a few million in California It s true that we have begun  belatedly  to shine a spotlight on many of these deep rooted problems  But the Mueller investigation sucked up all the political energy  For many in the political and media establishment  the possibility of collusion offered moral expiation for collective complicity  Rather than begin the hard work of addressing what had actually gone wrong  many of us were swept up in social media fueled feedback loops looking for an instant fix  The orgiastic pee tape would turn up and clear up the whole funny misunderstanding From here  the story of 2016 looks rather straightforward  Mr  Trump was the corrupt  misbegotten choice of a citizenry mired in partisan mistrust  seething with racial grievance  informed by a beleaguered and fracturing news media  and laboring under an economic and political system that had long ceased functioning for all but the wealthiest of its citizens His victory pointed to a systemic failure  In the end the only golden shower that mattered was the one soaking American democracy   but it s been raining so long and so hard that we re just about content to ignore the storm RelatedOpinion   Michelle Goldberg  No Criminal Collusion  Lots of Corruption March 25  2019Opinion   Tim Wu  Investigate the Swamp

PARIS   France rolled out red carpets and honor guards for President Xi Jinping of China on Monday  but beneath the pomp  there were wary statements about China s influence by his host  President Emmanuel Macron With Italy last week breaking from Europe in signing on to China s global infrastructure project for moving Chinese goods  Mr  Macron has made it clear that a unified European response  in his view  is critical in dealing with the Chinese hegemon He reiterated that sentiment Monday as Mr  Xi listened in a deal signing ceremony at the presidential Élysée Palace  where more than a dozen commercial and governmental treaties were signed worth billions of euros Earlier Mr  Macron welcomed Mr  Xi at a symbol of French imperial history and power  the Arc de Triomphe Beneath the tight smiles and brisk handshakes  Mr  Macron s sharpened words resonated as the template for France s attitude toward China  a country that floods France with luxury shopping tourists but competes directly with it in a principal arena of mutual geopolitical interest  Africa Mr  Macron  keenly aware of France s small position in the Chinese market   between 1 and 2 percent of imports   talks about Europe when he talks about China  Germany s position is nearly five times as large After saying last week that the era of European  naïveté was over   and that China had  played on our divisions   he emphasized to the Chinese leader Monday that in talking to France  he was talking to Europe It was not immediately clear how France had avoided the  naïveté  Mr  Macron criticized  nor how it had reinforced the multilateral unified European approach he promulgated  in signing the French deals with the Chinese on Monday Still  unlike Italy  France has not signed on to China s global goods moving project  which it calls  One Belt One Road  Making reference to Gen  Charles de Gaulle s famous declaration in 1964 that recognizing China was a matter of  reason  and  evidence   Mr  Macron said Monday at the Élysée that those same words applied to the  choice  of the 21st century  the  relationship between Europeans and Chinese  De Gaulle was bucking the United States when he uttered those words  and Mr  Macron  55 years later  was doing something of the same ImageThe two leaders at a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe on Monday CreditPool photo by Francois MoriAppealing to China as a partner  he made a pointed reference to the United States under President Trump  who has repudiated multinational agreements like the Paris Climate accord and Iran nuclear deal  The order of things has been shaken   the French president said  and  faced with the risk of the destruction of the multilateral order  France and China have a responsibility   as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  No country can redefine the rules of the international game   Mr  Macron asserted  saying that France  like China  would stick to an agreement with Iran  and saying the two countries had made progress on the subject of climate change  and on the lifting of import restrictions for French beef and poultry Earlier French and Chinese officials and executives signed agreements on aeronautics   the Chinese are buying 300 airplanes from Airbus   and on space  banking and investment  shipbuilding and cultural exchanges On human rights violations in China  a subject that preoccupies French media but not official discourse or French business  Mr  Macron made only a hurried reference  Mr  Xi is visiting at a time when Galeries Lafayette  the emblematic French department store  is projecting a rapid expansion in China  which represents a third of the world market for luxury goods Jet lagged Chinese tourists are bussed directly from the airport to the Galeries Lafayette store in central Paris  and the Rue Saint Honoré  a thoroughfare studded with luxury shops  routinely decks itself out for Chinese New Year The Chinese have invested in a wide scattering of French sectors  including wine  hotels  and industrial food production  including milk  France was the recipient of 9 percent of Chinese investments in the European Union in 2018  the Chinese have bought more than 150 wineries in Bordeaux  and China is the top export market for Bordeaux wine  The Chinese push into that culturally symbolic sector has created some backlash  but not enough to stop French owners from selling their properties With Mr  Xi silently listening Monday Mr  Macron said that Europe had never considered individual rights as  culturally specific   and that its preoccupation remained for  the respect of fundamental and individual rights   He said that the two had  had frank exchanges  on the subject But French analysts of relations with China said Monday that commercial relations were the real subject of preoccupation   It s the question of reciprocity   said Jean Philippe Béja of Sciences Po  the research university   We ve been open towards trade and investment  and the Chinese have never let us enter their state procurements process  Europeans  he suggested  had also become more aware  and wary  of technology transfers and investments that  help the Chinese government develop its potential  and in the case of artificial intelligence it s about control  and exporting control   said Mr  Béja  referring to advances in Chinese government surveillance of its own citizenry  We re more fearful than the other  members of the European Union about Chinese power and hegemony  said François Godement  an expert at the Institut Montaigne research center in Paris   China is pushing its own pawns   he said  particularly in parts of Africa where for decades French dominance has been undisputed Mr  Macron insisted Monday that France and China were  not strategic rivals  in Africa  though he said the two nations could be  much more important partners   appearing to reflect a worry about Chinese investment on the continent

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  Near the High Line in Manhattan  more than 250 people gathered at The Park  a restaurant  last week to hear about a Democratic mayor s long shot bid for the presidency The New York City Council speaker  Corey Johnson  worked the crowd  boasting about the mayor s accomplishments  and how he had done a  tremendous amount  to  create jobs  and move  the conversation nationally  to important issues But the mayor in question was not Bill de Blasio  mayor of New York City  population 8 6 million  It was Pete Buttigieg  mayor of South Bend  Ind   population 102 245 Both men are considering a presidential run but only one of their potential candidacies seems to be taken seriously Mr  Buttigieg  37  has raised money from more than 65 000 individual donors  qualifying him to participate in the first Democratic debate in June  A recent poll of the Iowa caucus by Emerson Polling placed Mr  Buttigieg in third among Democrats Mr  de Blasio  57  has appeared before small crowds in early primary states such as Iowa  South Carolina and New Hampshire  and came in last in a recent Quinnipiac University poll that asked which New York politician would make the best president  Bill de Blasio s Embarrassing Quest for National Fame   was the headline on a recent article in The New Republic about Mr  de Blasio s travels to early primary states Even in New York  Mr  Buttigieg  perhaps unsurprisingly  seemed to be the mayor of choice for a White House bid  Mayor Pete is fresh  he s untainted   said Michael Zorek  58  who attended a fund raiser Friday for Mr  Buttigieg in Chelsea with his wife  Shelly Friedland  53  a lawyer  the couple lives on the Upper West Side   He has an entirely different story than any other politician in our lifetime  Mr  Buttigieg  pronounced BOOT edge edge  is gay and married and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who speaks Arabic  He gained exposure in 2017 after a failed run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee  Mayor de Blasio s record here is mixed   Ms  Friedland chimed in   I don t think he s terrible  but I don t support him moving to another job  Katie Held  35  a tech product manager who has lived in Manhattan for four years  said Mr  Buttigieg has  East Coast values with a Midwestern knowledge  Asked about a potential de Blasio campaign for president  Ms  Held said   No  Stay where you are  Work on that  Ever since Mr  de Blasio unexpectedly emerged from a clump of Democrats to become mayor in 2013  he has sought to broaden his message and profile to a national audience Mr  de Blasio quickly achieved his signature accomplishment  universal prekindergarten  but his tenure has been marred by increased homelessness  the continued deterioration of the city s public housing stock and scrutiny over some of his fund raising techniques ImageThe City Council speaker  Corey Johnson  introduced Mr  Buttigieg at the recent fund raiser in New York  saying that having an openly gay mayor be taken seriously as a presidential candidate  is a very  very exciting thing  CreditStephanie Keith for The New York TimesHe has even been blamed for the city s troubled subway system although he is not in charge of it Mike Casca  a spokesman for Mr  de Blasio  said comparing Mr  Buttigieg and Mr  de Blasio was  apples and oranges  because the mayor is not a candidate  Mr  Casca  it should be noted  previously worked for Bernie Sanders on his 2016 presidential campaign and in his Senate office  and is one of two City Hall aides helping the mayor with his presidential aspirations Rebecca Katz  a former special adviser to Mr  de Blasio who is not currently attached to his exploratory bid  said that the mayor  has a progressive record to run on that is strong  but of all the candidates he has the busiest day job   Bill de Blasio put almost as many kids through pre K last year as who live in South Bend   she added But there is no question that Mr  Buttigieg has generated more buzz  his recent visit to Manhattan was his third fund raising effort in New York City  To have an openly gay mayor to now be considered the hottest ticket in town running for president is a very  very exciting thing   said Mr  Johnson  who is gay Why not Mr  de Blasio  I think Bill has accomplishments to point to like universal pre K   Mr  Johnson said  If Mr  de Blasio runs   there needs to be a message that inspires people  Mr  Johnson stressed that he has not endorsed anyone for president yet  that was also the case for Phil Walzak  a former top de Blasio adviser who attended Mr  Buttigieg s fund raiser at The Park  Mayor Pete has a compelling story and message   said Mr  Walzak  now the top spokesman for the Police Department  But he added that Mr  de Blasio  has a real record to run on  Kenneth Sherrill  a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College  said that there was a general sense that Mr  de Blasio  has not been terribly successful at managing New York City  He added   He started out very well  made good appointments  did pre K  a major achievement  and family leave  The first six months to a year made you hungry to see what was coming next  and the answer was bupkis  Mr  de Blasio has offered a different view of his tenure  on a recent trip to New Hampshire  he highlighted initiatives like universal prekindergarten and a push to make mental health services more broadly available as things that should become national priorities All of these efforts are going  full steam   the mayor said recently  in response to a question of how he would respond to New Yorkers wondering why he was in South Carolina or Iowa  The fact that Mr  Buttigieg is getting more attention will not deter him  the mayor said  I don t pay a whole lot of attention to what other folks do   he said Mr  Buttigieg also declined to speak specifically about his fellow mayor  At a moment where the party is really trying to figure out what its future will be  the bigger the range of options  the better off we ll be   Mr  Buttigieg said just before leaving New York for South Carolina Still  it was somewhat telling that Mr  Buttigieg had been introduced by Mr  Johnson  Mr  de Blasio s City Hall colleague  One of the most attractive qualities in politics is authenticity  and a good story and a level of enthusiasm and charisma  and I think Mayor Pete has shown that through the course of this short campaign   Mr  Johnson said   His message has been inspiring for people  and people at this moment in time want to be inspired   

GREENSBORO  N C    On the east side of Greensboro  the boundary separating North Carolina s 6th and 13th congressional districts takes an abrupt detour  The line yanks hard to the west until it reaches Laurel Street  turns northward  and disappears into the brown brick campus of North Carolina A T State University  where it neatly bisects the nation s largest historically black college Five dormitories lie in the 6th district  seven in the 13th  All are in unassailably Republican territory  as the line splits both the university and the city s mostly Democratic 285 000 residents between two conservative rural bastions Nikolaus Knight  a senior and political science major  was assigned to a new dormitory after his freshman year   and had to re register to vote as a result   We had the power as a student body to sway an election   he said   And our voice as a campus was stripped away when we were cut in half  This is the power of mapmaking by the state s Republican legislature  which drew new political borders three years ago that allowed Republicans to capture 10 of this state s 13 House seats last fall  even though nearly half of all House votes went to Democratic candidates Nobody disputes that the North Carolina map was drafted to elect a maximum number of Republicans to the House  not even the Republicans themselves  The map has a 10 3 Republican tilt  one of its drafters said   because I do not believe it s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats  On Tuesday  the Supreme Court will hear arguments over whether such partisanship violates the Constitution  One case involves the Republican drawn map in North Carolina  A companion case centers on Maryland s 6th Congressional District  which Democrats admit they redrew in 2011 to make it harder for the Republican incumbent there to win re election The two cases hold the potential to set the course of American politics for generations  A decision to rein in partisan gerrymanders could reshape House maps in a number of states  largely but not exclusively to the benefit of Democrats  A decision not to rein in the mapmakers would give both political parties carte blanche to entrench themselves and hogtie their opponents when state legislatures draw the next decade s House districts in 2021 The justices have dodged the issue of gerrymandering for decades  gridlocked over whether it is even possible to distinguish acceptably partisan maps from unconstitutional ones Chief Justice John G  Roberts Jr  worried aloud last year that creating a legal standard to identify partisan gerrymanders would turn the court into a sort of electoral kingmaker But now the North Carolina House map could force him and other justices to confront the issue head on  The redrawing of Maryland s House map by Democrats was also baldly political  ousting a 20 year Republican incumbent by infusing the rural 6th District with tens of thousands of urban Democrats  But compared with the lawmakers in North Carolina  the Maryland Democrats were restrained  turning down maps that would have wiped out the state s other Republican leaning House district as well Created three years ago  the North Carolina map was drawn for overtly partisan reasons  Indeed  the Republican chairman of the state House Elections Committee  Representative David R  Lewis  opened the drafting session by saying   I acknowledge freely that this would be a political gerrymander   Republicans ordered that the next map create  as many districts as possible in which G O P  candidates would be able to successfully compete for office  The result  drawn by the master Republican redistricting strategist Thomas B  Hofeller  met that mandate  It anchored three overwhelmingly Democratic districts in liberal cities   Charlotte  Raleigh and Durham  The remaining urban strongholds  in Asheville  Fayetteville and Greensboro Winston Salem  were filleted along party lines  with their most Democratic areas absorbed by otherwise rural Republican territories Democrats in the state had done their share of gerrymandering in the past  but it was nowhere near what the Republicans were now doing The map eliminated any competition for House seats in all but the most exceptional circumstances  In November  amid the strongest national Democratic electoral performance since Watergate  only one of the 10 Republican held House seats was in serious jeopardy  that race  in the 9th Congressional District  was marred by election fraud complaints and will be rerun this summer   Democrats won the three districts that were gerrymandered in their favor by an average of 45 percentage points That highlights collateral damage from gerrymanders that is sometimes overlooked  Not only do they entrench a majority party  but they weaken the opposition as well  Candidates don t want to run losing races  and donors and parties don t want to support them Pete Glidewell can testify to that  Mr  Glidewell  a real estate agent and Democratic activist in Elon  about 15 miles from Greensboro  ran in 2016 against the incumbent Republican in the newly drawn Sixth Congressional District  Mark Walker  Mr  Walker had won in 2014 with nearly 59 percent of the vote  Mr  Glidewell was the only Democrat to oppose him   I thought I was better qualified than him   he said   I still do  Mr  Glidewell soon got a call from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  the arm of the Democratic Party that doles out money and tactical support to House candidates  They were seeking a donation  I said   Ma am  I am actually running for Congress in this district  and I wish you d pass along that I need as much help as you say you do    he recalled  But to the committee  Mr  Glidewell was a lost cause   They wouldn t talk to me   he said In the campaign that followed  Mr  Glidewell s largest contribution   5 400  came from his wife  His campaign cost  93 300  most of it spent on internet advertising  yard signs and car magnets   No television   he said   We couldn t afford it   Mr  Walker s campaign spent more than that    94 716  to be precise   on fund raising consultants alone That November  Mr  Walker shellacked Mr  Glidewell  59 percent to 41 percent  and had more than  225 000 in unspent donations in the bank  Other incumbent House members have leftover funds from past campaigns  too    2 4 million  in one case   So it s even more impossible to get a credible opponent   Mr  Glidewell said Tim Moreland is a Democratic political operative in Guilford County  where Greensboro is located  He said that uncompetitive districts lead to lazy incumbents  less qualified challengers and election campaigns that provide little clarity  We get a lot of politicians who have been in seats for a very long time   he said   They ve never had to run a competitive election  or raise a lot of money  or work to build relationships with the other party  Input from the average voter matters less and less  Some academics dispute it  but political veterans say gerrymanders widen political divisions because incumbents have no incentive to court moderates and swing voters  If the most competitive race you ve got is against some right wing or left wing person in the primary  and you don t have to worry about the general election  you end up with representatives who aren t really representative   Thomas Mills  a onetime Democratic campaign consultant who ran his own losing campaign for a gerrymandered House seat in 2016  said in an interview The case against partisan gerrymanders is not merely a Democratic one  Republican candidates in North Carolina s three safe Democratic House seats also were disenfranchised  along with their supporters  So were Republicans in Maryland s 6th District The plaintiffs in the North Carolina and Maryland cases argue that the maps violate the Constitution in a number of ways  They say the maps effectively punish supporters of gerrymandered candidates for expressing their political preference  violating both the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment  which guarantees equal treatment under the law And they say the maps pervert Article One of the Constitution  whose rationale for frequent House elections was to make the chamber s members more responsive to the American people  But with a gerrymander  they argue  the people have almost no voice Yet even if a majority of the justices agree  that may not carry the day for the opponents of gerrymanders  The question of how to spot rigged maps still remains  Since no political map is completely free of bias  how do judges distinguish between the acceptable and the unacceptable Defenders of North Carolina and Maryland s maps say the court has no business trying  and will shred its reputation for above the fray fairness if it starts deciding whether maps favor one party or another  Partisan gerrymandering  they say  is a political issue best addressed by the politicians in Congress and the states But that is precisely the issue  voting rights advocates say  Gerrymanders are creations of lawmakers  who have seldom had much interest in curbing their own power And the modern tools of map drawing   powerful computers and software  and an unprecedented cascade of data on voters   have allowed drafters to turn political districts into near impregnable fortresses that can sustain a party s hold on power from one redistricting cycle to the next  Because of the availability of data  we can aggregate voting patterns and organize them in a way that the political system can be controlled by decision makers   said Douglas Berger  a Durham lawyer and a plaintiff in one of the North Carolina lawsuits He speaks from experience  His firm s political action committee uses data analytics to assess a candidate s prospects with ever greater precision before deciding whether to donate to a campaign  Partly because of that  the PAC largely steers clear of supporting North Carolina candidates for the House Yet technology may also provide an answer to the conundrum that has kept the court from acting Social scientists have devised a host of new yardsticks in recent years for gauging partisan leanings in maps  Perhaps most important among them is that advances in computing now permit experts to randomly generate thousands and even millions of hypothetical maps  all drawn using the same criteria  that can be compared with the maps challenged in gerrymander trials  Mathematical formulas can then

  The investigation found that neither President Trump nor any of his aides conspired with the Russian government   The report offered a mixed assessment on the question of obstruction of justice   The Special Counsel states that  while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him    Attorney General William P  Barr wrote  Mr  Barr said that he had concluded after reviewing the report that there was not sufficient evidence to establish that the president committed obstruction of justice   On his way back to Washington from Florida  Mr  Trump said it was  a complete and total exoneration  and said that he hoped someone would  look at the other side  No coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia  Mueller says Mr  Barr s letter said that Mr  Mueller s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to manipulate the 2016 presidential election  He quoted the following takeaway line from the special counsel report    T he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities  Mr  Barr s letter went on to note that  despite multiple offers from Russian affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign   the special counsel did not find evidence of  agreement   tacit or express   between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference   The letter did not use the word  collusion   which has become the term of art for the question at the heart of the Russia investigation  though Republican lawmakers were quick to declare that there was  no collusion  Read Attorney General William Barr s Summary of the

Read the attorney general s summary of the Mueller report   No ruling on obstruction of justice For each of the relevant actions by Mr  Trump the special counsel examined   the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as  difficult issues  of law and fact concerning whether the President s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction  The Special Counsel states that  while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him   While Robert S  Mueller III did not take a position on whether Mr  Trump committed obstruction and explicitly said his report did not exonerate the president  Attorney General William P  Barr said that he and Rod J  Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr  Mueller  separately concluded that the evidence Mr  Mueller gathered  is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense  Importantly  Mr  Barr stressed that this conclusion was not based on the Justice Department s view that the Constitution bars indicting a sitting president The president declares vindication  It was a complete and total exoneration   Mr  Trump said  in brief remarks to reporters in Florida before he boarded Air Force One en route back to Washington   It s a shame that our country had to go through this  To be honest  it s a shame that your president has had to go through this  In his first public remarks  an hour after the report summary was released  Mr  Trump claimed victory on Twitter Video

through this  CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesMr  Trump  who learned about the special counsel s findings on Sunday  falsely said that the report exonerated him  when Mr  Barr cited the special counsel report  which specifically said   While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  also claimed victory for the White House   The Special Counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction  AG Barr and DAG Rosenstein further determined there was no obstruction  The findings of the Department of Justice are a total and complete exoneration of the President of the United States  Trump immediately attacks  the other side  In his brief remarks  Mr  Trump was critical of the lack of investigation into people he perceives as his opponents  So after a long look   Mr  Trump said   After a long investigation  after so many people have been so badly hurt  after not looking at the other side  where a lot of bad things happened  a lot of horrible things happened  a lot of very bad things happened for our country  it was just announced there was no collusion with Russia   the most ridiculous thing I ve ever heard  He later added   This was an illegal takedown that failed  And hopefully somebody s going to be looking at the other side  ImageWilliam P  Barr  the attorney general  leaving his home on Sunday morning in McLean  Va CreditAlex Wong Getty ImagesMr  Trump did not specify who or what was on  the other side   but he has previously suggested that senior officials at the Justice Department and the F B I  were working against him  as well Democrats  including his one time political opponent Hillary Clinton Mr  Trump also falsely said that the Russia investigation was started  illegally   a claim he has made previously  accusing the F B I  of straying from its own investigative policies and opened an inquiry because of political motivations  Mr  Trump has always been especially critical of a dossier of allegations that the F B I  received during the 2016 campaign The special counsel s investigation was exhaustive In completing his investigation  the special counsel had an array of resources at his disposal  The team consisted of 19 lawyers  about 40 F B I  agents  analysts  forensic accountants and other staff  Since his appointment in May 2017  Mr  Mueller s team issued more than 2 800 subpoenas  executed nearly 500 search warrants and interviewed about 500 witnesses  It also made requests to 13 foreign governments for evidence But it may be a while before we see the report Mr  Barr said that it was  my goal and intent  to  release as much of the special counsel s report as I can consistent with applicable law  regulations  and department policies   In short  that means   as expected   he has concerns about grand jury secrets and other sensitive investigative material in Mr  Mueller s report Democrats will not be satisfied with that answer  but in the short term they are unlikely to get access to Mr  Mueller s evidence Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation Minutes after the

Representative Doug Collins of Georgia  the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee  called on its Democratic chairman to  rethink his sprawling investigation  into obstruction of justice and abuse of power  Russia is a bad actor with dark intentions  but there is no evidence that they compromised a presidential nominee  The special counsel s investigation was long  thorough and conclusive  There was no collusion  There is no constitutional crisis   Mr  Collins said   I look forward to moving ahead and working with everyone on the Judiciary Committee to do the business of the American

of the House Judiciary Committee  said that Mr  Barr s letter was hardly the end of the inquiry  noting  Special Counsel Mueller clearly and explicitly is not exonerating the President  and we must hear from AG Barr about his decision making and see all the underlying evidence for the American people to know all the facts  Mr  Nadler also sounded a call for Mr  Mueller to turn over all of his underlying investigative documents  There must be full transparency in what Special Counsel Mueller uncovered to not exonerate the President from wrongdoing   Mr  Nadler said on Twitter   DOJ owes the public more than just a brief synopsis and decision not to go any further in their work  Mr  Nadler suggested that the Justice Department did not spend enough time considering whether the evidence presented by the special counsel was sufficient to support a charge of obstruction of justice  He said that his committee would soon be calling on Mr  Barr to testify about his findings  Special Counsel Mueller worked for 22 months to determine the extent to which President Trump obstructed justice   Mr  Nadler wrote in a Twitter post   Attorney General Barr took 2 days to tell the American people that while the President is not exonerated  there will be no action by DOJ  ImageMr  Barr said that he and Rod J  Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr  Mueller  separately

Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the minority leader  said Mr  Barr s summary  raises as many questions as it answers   They said that given  Mr  Barr s public record of bias against the Special Counsel s inquiry  he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report  Like many other Democrats  they called for Congress to be given access to the full report and all underlying documents Some Democrats see bad news for Trump in the findings Other Democrats had a starkly different view of Mr  Barr s summary Representative David N  Cicilline  Democrat of Rhode Island and a member of the House Judiciary Committee  said   The Special Counsel did not exonerate the President  In fact  according to the Attorney General s letter  he described a pattern of evidence suggesting the President engaged in obstruction of justice  The Attorney General needs to make this evidence available to Congress immediately  along with the entirety of the Mueller report  so we can decide what steps to take next  A summary of the report is released Senior Justice Department officials huddled at the agency s headquarters since midmorning Sunday  examining the report that marked the conclusion of the special counsel s investigation into Russia s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and possible obstruction of justice by Mr  Trump  The inquiry was led by Mr  Mueller  who delivered his report to Mr  Barr on Friday About an hour after his letter was delivered to lawmakers  Mr  Barr left the Justice Department Mueller reaffirms that Russians interfered in 2016 election Mr  Barr wrote in his letter to Congress that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the presidential campaign in 2016  He said the first was to  conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord   The second element included Russian government computer hacking operations to influence the election Mr  Barr said the special counsel also found  multiple offers from Russian affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign  The president is headed back to Washington He was scheduled to return to the capital at 6 45 p m Mr  Trump s golf partners at his Florida course on Sunday were Senator Lindsey Graham  Trey Gowdy  the former representative  and Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  All three men are from South Carolina In Palm Beach  the president s supporters were in celebration mode  and are focusing more on the Russia findings in the report than on the obstruction question  Toni Holt Kramer spoke with the president at Mar a Lago this weekend and described his mood while interacting with his supporters as  fantastic   Ms  Holt Kramer  who founded the Trumpets booster group  said that she and her group would be in  full campaign mode  now that she said the president had not been found to have worked with Russia during the campaign   He is in a phenomenal mood   she said   It was just like when he won the election  The president is scheduled to make his first appearance in front of supporters on Thursday at a  Make America Great Again  rally in Grand Rapids  Mich  

The sense of mourning started to take hold over the weekend  after Attorney General William P  Barr said that Robert S  Mueller III  the special counsel  had not found coordination between President Trump s campaign and the Russian government s election interference in 2016 Over the nearly two years of the Mueller investigation  a segment of liberals and activists built up fervent hopes that it would bring Mr  Trump down  They elevated Mr  Mueller  a former F B I  director  into an anti Trump cultural icon  complete with T shirts  scented candles and holiday themed songs like  We Wish You a Mueller Christmas  For some of them  the report felt like a betrayal  To many others  it was a disappointment  I was hoping that the truth would come out   said Shawn Foster  a 45 year old music video and television producer in Nashville  Mr  Foster had taken to wearing a yellow pin showing the top of the special prosecutor s head rising like a shark from the sea  Mr  Foster said he was wearing the pin on Sunday when Mr  Barr s summary of the report came out  It is definitely embarrassing   he said   It s a drag knowing there are people out there who are gloating  Jennifer Taub  a Vermont Law School professor who had become known for punchy anti Trump columns with titles like  Yes  Collusion  Now What   said   There are definitely people who thought that Mueller would save us  Ms  Taub said she remained hopeful that Mr  Mueller s full findings  which have not yet been made public  would somehow contradict the summary given by Mr  Barr  But she said she understands that the legal threshold for proving conspiracy is high Last week  she posted a picture of herself on Facebook lighting a candle with Mr  Mueller s face on it   I would hope that people who were in this cult of Mueller would have been self aware or ironic   she said on Monday Democrats running in the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential race have mainly tried to ignore the Russia investigation  focusing instead on policy issues like climate change  universal health care and raising taxes on the wealthy  But that has not stopped certain members of their political base from becoming ultra fans of Mr  Mueller Now  as Mr  Trump and his supporters claim victory  those who had hoped the Mueller investigation would end the Trump presidency are split between feelings of defiance and devastation This group  which differs from more traditional Democratic activists and party operatives  was sure that Mr  Mueller would implicate the president in conspiracies to influence the 2016 election and obstruct justice  That belief drove an almost obsessive Mueller fandom among the group  which formed its own internet subculture among the wider anti Trump base  Mr  Mueller was personally revered for being everything the group thought Mr  Trump was not  in ideology  integrity and temperament A popular podcast called  Mueller  She Wrote   which is streamed up to 200 000 times a week  calls its Russia obsessed fans Muellerites  One of the three hosts  a California comedian who goes by A  G  and has a tattoo of Mr  Mueller s silhouette on her arm  said the community was in what could only be described as a collective state of muted shock  I ve had to talk a couple people off the ledge   she said One fan of the podcast  Anne Craig Tillmond  said she wants to see the full report before she s  completely deflated   I ve been emotionally invested from the start  and was I let down by what Barr said  Absolutely   Ms  Craig Tillmond said   Was I let down by what Mueller said  I don t know what he said  The Facebook page of the Robert Mueller Fan Club says on its  About  page   All hail Robert Mueller   through his work we shall be delivered from this ignorance and evil we suffer   Barbara Llewellyn  a retired real estate agent from Naperville  Ill   had written  Hallelujah  on the page  But by Monday  she had changed her tune  I am very disappointed  because I felt that there were so many public instances where Trump acted guilty and tried to shut down the investigation in various ways   Ms  Llewellyn said   And I am realizing that this is just Barr s interpretation of what the report said  And I m hoping very quickly that Congress gets ahold of it totally unredacted  and we can go from there  Some progressive activists have been calling for Mr  Trump s impeachment almost since he took office  and billionaire Tom Steyer ran television advertisements with that aim across the country  But the sense of profound disappointment that has set in on the left illustrates why Democratic campaigns have been so leery of resting their electoral hopes on Mr  Mueller s investigation and the possibility of impeachment Top party strategists have long asked Democratic candidates to ignore the Russia investigation and concentrate their fire on more clear cut targets like Republican attempts to gut or repeal the Affordable Care Act Tyler Law  a former spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  said his party s House candidates in 2018  didn t run a single district paid media campaign on Russia  because extensive research had found that the issue did not  persuade voters or mobilize the base  Even Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  who is running for president in 2020 and has called Mr  Trump  corrupt   has focused her attacks on his business entanglements and failure to release his tax returns  not on the possibility that he coordinated election interference with Russia At a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids  Iowa  earlier this year  she said   By the time we get to 2020  Donald Trump may not be president  In fact  he may not even be a free person   But it wasn t the Russia investigation alone that she had in mind  she explained afterward   Come on  how many investigations are there now   she said   It s no longer just the Mueller investigation  they re everywhere  And these are serious investigations  This reluctance by Democratic candidates has not stopped other figures on the left from capitalizing on the Mueller obsession among the Democratic base  Ed Krassenstein  who runs a prominent anti Trump social media account with his brother  Brian  announced plans for a children s book last year depicted Mr  Mueller as a superhero   complete with a shirtless  muscular pose  After criticism  the Krassenstein brothers changed the book to a  political parody  Ed Krassenstein said in an interview on Monday that he does not think liberals should regret investing their hopes   Robert Mueller is still an American hero   he said Some Mueller fans say Mr  Barr s announcement over the weekend is far from the final word   We haven t been able to see the report   said Ruth Story  75  a former head of the local N A A C P  chapter in Gulfport  Miss   We just have Barr s word  and we knew from the beginning that Barr was determined that nothing would happen  I m pretty sure that s why he is now the attorney general  The little yellow Mueller button that Mr  Foster wore was created by Henry Owings  an Atlanta area graphic designer  and his friend Rebecca Dudley  an architect and children s book author and illustrator in Evanston  Ill  On Monday  Ms  Dudley said that they had cranked out a total of 48 000 of the buttons She also said she was not too disappointed by the Barr letter   I knew there was no way anything could live up to two years of hype   she said   I knew nothing was going to come down like a hammer on the White House  Ms  Dudley said she was most interested now in understanding what she called  the difference between Barr s summary and Mueller s report  and what may come of other investigations still in progress  including by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York She said she was also thinking about making new buttons  These  she said  would be emblazoned with  S D N Y   

WASHINGTON   More than 18 000 activists will converge in Washington on Sunday for the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  as Democrats wrestle with the left s rising criticism of Israel and as President Trump seeks to divide his political rivals while bolstering Israel s embattled leader In some respects  the three day Aipac conference will look much as it has in years past  American and Israeli luminaries will speak  including Israel s prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  Vice President Mike Pence  Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mr  Netanyahu s main challenger in Israel s election next month  Benny Gantz  It will wrap up on Tuesday with a  lobbying day   when thousands of activists will flock to Capitol Hill to press Aipac s legislative agenda But this year s confab is playing out in a changed and charged Washington political environment  Mr  Trump and his fellow Republicans have spent weeks lobbing accusations of anti Semitism at Democrats  although the party remains the home of the vast majority of American Jews  And Democrats are under mounting pressure from their left flank to distance themselves from Aipac  which aligns itself closely with Mr  Netanyahu s far right policies A string of Democratic presidential candidates   Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California  as well as Beto O Rourke and Julián Castro  among others   are skipping the conference  A group of freshman Democrats in the House  Ilhan Omar of Minnesota  Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York  has emerged as forthright critics of Israel and the United States  policy tilt toward the Israeli government Those trends will stand in stark contrast to Mr  Trump s embrace of Mr  Netanyahu  who will meet the president for talks at the White House on Monday and at a dinner on Tuesday  I don t know what happened to them  but they are totally anti Israel   Mr  Trump said on Friday of the Democrats   Frankly  I think they re anti Jewish  The swirl around this year s conference represents  two new realities   said Aaron David Miller  an expert on the Israeli Palestinian conflict at the Wilson Center  a Washington based foreign affairs research organization The first is the deepening generational divide in the Democratic Party  which will be reflected in protests by progressive Jews outside the conference while older Democrats like Ms  Pelosi and Representative Steny H  Hoyer  the majority leader  address delegates inside  Mr  Trump might call Democrats  anti Jewish   but Jewish Democrats hold the gavels of some of the most powerful committees in the House   Judiciary  Appropriations  Foreign Affairs  Intelligence  Budget and Ethics   as well as the post of Senate Democratic leader  But a younger generation of Democrats is clashing with that old guard ImageSenator Chuck Schumer  the Democratic leader  is one of Congress s most influential Jewish members CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThe second is the divide in Israeli politics  which will be reflected in the competing speeches by Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz  These conferences are supposed to be cohesive unity builders   Mr  Miller said  But  he added   rarely has Israeli politics been more divided  and Aipac is going to mirror those divisions  Republicans will almost certainly use the conference to portray their party as the home for Israel s supporters  Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  is expected to talk about legislative efforts to support Israel and to oppose anti Semitism  Representative Kevin McCarthy  the House Republican leader  will tell conferees that  Aipac should not be boycotted  Aipac should be celebrated   said his spokesman  Matt Sparks For Democrats   who for decades have relied on the Jewish vote   the task will be trickier  They must reiterate their support for the Jewish state without alienating progressives  including millennials and many young Jews who are increasingly willing to accuse Israel of human rights abuses  It will be interesting to see if Democratic leaders who are going to be speaking at Aipac are going to be speaking about Israeli policy as well  where they see differences with them   said Yousef Munayyer  the executive director of the U S  Campaign for Palestinian Rights   The applause lines that are going to go over well with Aipac are not going to go over well with the rest of the Democratic Party  That tension will really be on display here  Mr  Hoyer  the Democratic leader  will speak on Sunday evening  He plans to remind his audience that the Jewish state and the United States Israel relationship have  broad  bipartisan support because most Americans see them as integral to standing up for America s values and our national security and interests   according to a spokeswoman  Annaliese Davis  He will also  talk about what Israel and America have in common as fellow democracies   and the threat posed by Iran Washington  meanwhile  has been gearing up Mr  Trump announced on Thursday that the United States should recognize Israel s authority over the Golan Heights  a reversal of longstanding policy against accepting territorial changes acquired by force  The strategic area was seized from Syria in the Six Day War of 1967  The policy by tweet was a valuable election eve gift to Mr  Netanyahu In the Senate  Mr  McConnell and his colleagues are eager to take concrete legislative steps to demonstrate support for American Jews   and to reignite a divisive debate that erupted this month among House Democrats  after Ms  Omar suggested that supporters of Israel were pushing  for allegiance to a foreign country   That and other comments prompted the House to pass a resolution condemning all forms of bigotry  despite the wishes of veteran Jewish lawmakers who wanted it centered on anti Semitism Senator Ted Cruz  Republican of Texas  has been circulating a resolution condemning anti Semitism in isolation   a not so subtle effort to draw a contrast with the House  Mr  Cruz has also joined Senators Tom Cotton  Republican of Arkansas  and Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina  in proposing legislation to codify Israel s authority over the Golan Heights ImageRepresentative Ilhan Omar  Democrat of Minnesota  has been critical of Aipac s influence in American politics CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesIn the House  Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York  moved last week to fulfill one of Aipac s legislative priorities  a congressional resolution opposing the boycott  divestment and sanctions movement  known as B D S   which is aimed  in part  at pressuring Israel to improve its treatment of Palestinians  But the resolution  which is nonbinding  is much weaker than another Aipac backed measure that the Republican controlled Senate adopted last month Founded more than 50 years ago to  strengthen  protect and promote the U S  Israel relationship   Aipac  which is bipartisan  is today widely regarded as one of the most influential lobbying groups in Washington  It does not endorse or donate to political candidates  though it encourages its members to do so  and maintains relationships with every lawmaker on Capitol Hill This year  the organization s activists will press Congress for the adoption of Mr  Nadler s anti B D S  resolution  security assistance for Israel  enhanced cooperation between the United States and Israel in areas such as security and technology and a letter to the Trump administration about the threats on Israel s northern border from Iran and its surrogates  an Aipac official said But there is evidence that Aipac s influence is waning  and its rightward tilt has strained its claims of bipartisanship  A number of Democrats in Congress have fled to J Street  a liberal Jewish political action committee that also bills itself as pro Israel  The conference and the political dynamics around it are the political fruits that are reaped by the partisanship that Netanyahu has sown   said Jeremy Ben Ami  the president of J Street  adding that Mr  Netanyahu s  bromance with the president  has turned Israel into a partisan issue in the United States  which is  not in the best interest of the state of Israel and not in the best interest of the Jewish community  MoveOn  the progressive advocacy group  urged Democratic presidential candidates not to attend the Aipac conference this year  Some who have attended in the past  such as Ms  Harris  did not share why they are sitting this year s conference out  But Mr  Sanders  who has not attended in the past  took the occasion to issue a strong anti Aipac statement through his policy director  Josh Orton Mr  Orton said the senator was  concerned about the platform Aipac is providing for leaders who have expressed bigotry and oppose a two state solution    an obvious jab at Mr  Netanyahu  whose recent pact with a racist anti Arab party has prompted so much outrage in the United States and Israel that even Aipac criticized it IfNotNow  an advocacy organization of progressive young Jews  is planning protests under the  ResistAIPAC hashtag and has gathered thousands of signatures on a petition saying   Aipac doesn t represent me as a Jew   said Emily Mayer  a founding member of the group  Ms  Mayer said she had a message for Ms  Pelosi and the other Democratic leaders on the agenda  It s clear that they re not the future of the party  they re the past   she said   The future of the party rests in a different set of politics that Aipac doesn t represent   

The Islamic State s territorial rule has ended  On Saturday  the Syrian Democratic Forces  a United States backed group  announced that the final sliver of territory under the jihadist group s control had fallen  Even before this news  President Trump has rushed to declare  mission accomplished  in Syria  Yet as the United States has learned before  rhetoric cannot block out reality  And the reality is that it is premature  reckless even  to pen the Islamic State s obituary Although the group has been dealt a hard blow  ideologically and operationally the organization is degraded  not defeated  and its extremist network still functions  This is not to say that the Islamic State is invincible  but so long as the causes that gave rise to the extremist group are permitted to persist   the broken politics in the Arab and Islamic world  the fraying and delegitimization of state institutions  as well as ongoing geostrategic rivalries and foreign interventions   there will be opportunities for the Islamic State and like minded groups to rebound This is not hyperbole  A key insight from the movement s recent history should be how it has proved resilient  adaptive and resourceful  tapping into the deep sense of outrage and injustice felt by Sunni Muslims in Iraq  Syria and beyond The first factor that engenders the Islamic State is the organic crisis of governance  and ungovernable spaces  that plagues Syria  Iraq  Libya  Yemen  Egypt s Sinai Peninsula  West Africa and Afghanistan  Areas where state and local authorities hold little to no sway  and provide little to no support  are fertile breeding grounds for extremist organizations The second factor is the fierce Cold War between Sunni dominated Saudi Arabia and Shiite majority Iran  Although the Saudi Iran clash is driven by geostrategic calculations  it has taken on local sectarian overtones that play out daily on streets in Iraq  Syria  Lebanon  Yemen and elsewhere  The Islamic State has capitalized on this rivalry by portraying itself as the defender and protector of persecuted Sunnis Overlaying the geostrategic clash between Saudi Arabia and Iran are the machinations of other regional and foreign powers that are using local radical groups to achieve their self interested political ends  For example  Syria  Iraq  Yemen and Libya are areas where other international powers  like Turkey  Russia and the United States  are battling for influence and control   a situation that the Islamic State and Al Qaeda exploit to their advantage The third factor is the distribution of the Islamic State s combatants and the persistent threat they pose  As far back as 2016  when the Islamic State began to lose control of major urban centers  its leaders began planning for this day  Thousands of fighters have reportedly dispersed with fleeing civilians in Iraq and Syria and gone into hiding  Cells have already carried out hundreds of devastating attacks in both countries The movement also spread its tentacles near and wide  dispatching hundreds of veteran operatives to new fronts in Turkey  Egypt  Libya  Yemen  West Africa  Afghanistan and beyond  Not unlike Al Qaeda   though now on a greater and more lethal scale   the Islamic State is a transnational network with bases and sleeping cells in more than a dozen countries Thus  notwithstanding the catastrophic military blows the group has suffered and the loss of its territorial rule  the Islamic State has made it unmistakably clear that it will carry on the fight even if the caliphate is militarily incapacitated  In early March  Islamic State fighters released a video from the Syrian town of Baghuz that urged the group s followers to maintain their faith in the caliphate  even as Kurdish forces advanced toward the last of its territory Unfortunately  it appears that the Islamic State has both the will and limited assets necessary to survive to fight another day Indeed  before he was killed by an American airstrike in Syria in 2016  Abu Mohammed al Adnani  the Islamic State s second most powerful leader  after Abu Bakr al Baghdadi  prepared followers for the future battles  He said  referring to the group s progenitor  Al Qaeda in Iraq   Do you  O America consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of land  Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq and were in the desert without any city or land  Like Al Qaeda in Iraq  which was declared  defeated  from 2006 until 2010  the Islamic State is returning to its insurgent roots  And less than a year after its expulsion from major urban centers  the organization now wages a low intensity guerrilla campaign that has already killed hundreds of Iraqis  including key security personnel and tribal leaders  Designed to terrorize local communities  sow instability and expose the impotency of Iraq s security forces  the Islamic State s strategy is paying dividends The corrupt and dysfunctional Baghdad government has neglected the emaciated Sunni inhabited cities  such as Mosul  that were liberated from the Islamic State s rule  Once again  the extremist organization is appealing to disgruntled Sunnis who feel forsaken by the Shiite dominated authorities  The recent intensification of the United States  rivalry with Iran in Iraq under President Trump has served to only further weaken the central government in Baghdad and embolden the Islamic State Similarly  in Syria  sleeper cells frequently attack the liberated Raqqa and Deir Ezzor province and inflict heavy casualties on the Syrian Democratic Forces  an American backed coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters  Like in Iraq  the Islamic State bides its time in Syria  hoping that Turkey s fixation with the Kurds and Mr  Trump s decision to ultimately withdraw most American troops from the northeast will create a security void that it can fill Before Mr  Trump takes a victory lap  he should know that the next phase of the struggle against the Islamic State and Al Qaeda will be complex  costly and prolonged  A counterterrorism strategy is not sufficient  Permanently defeating these jihadist groups will require an economic  political and ideological strategy with a long term focus The challenge that Arab and Islamic societies face is to develop a counternarrative to the ideology of jihadism  This will require transparent  inclusive and representative government that delivers jobs and hope  and gives millions of young men and women who feel excluded and unserved a stake in the future of their countries Specifically  instead of wantonly fueling geostrategic rivalries and inflaming Arab Israeli tensions  the United States  together with other great powers  must help war torn Muslim societies reconcile  heal and rebuild  Unless the United States does so  the Islamic State will remain a threat in the years to come It seems unlikely that Mr  Trump has either the desire or vision to pursue such a farsighted strategy  But if he wants to celebrate a true  victory  over the Islamic State he should consider the long term consequences of his actions Fawaz A  Gerges  a professor of international

Attorney General Bill Barr s summary of the report from Robert Mueller is only a first step in the accounting of this president s behavior  but it is not too early to reach this conclusion  It marked a good day for some norms   but a much  much worse one for others A special counsel s investigation of a president is first and foremost a mechanism for addressing strictly legal questions  But it is necessarily always more  and the investigative process and the ultimate legal and factual findings reflect  help shape and often reinforce the state of key norms   fundamental expectations of presidential conduct  Legal process norms have mostly emerged in sound condition  The Mueller investigation was completed without  as Mr  Barr affirmed  any action rejected by the attorney general or Rod Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general  Soon after Mr  Barr had received the Mueller report  he released a summary of the principal conclusions  So far  the attorney general is proceeding in compliance with the special counsel rules for congressional notification and a more general   public interest  release  And he has pledged additional transparency The attorney general s involvement in the final decision on potential obstruction of justice is more questionable  After all  Mr  Barr s views were well known to the White House on this topic  He did not bring an open mind to it Still  the Senate confirmed him  and he was clear that he would not recuse himself on these grounds  And in reaching a prosecutorial judgment on obstruction  Mr  Barr consulted Mr  Rosenstein  who concurred in the decision to decline prosecution  he also claims to have engaged the Office of Legal Counsel These process norms fared well  But the Mueller report marked a low point for more substantive norms of presidential conduct  It shows that a demagogic president like Donald Trump can devalue or even depart radically from key norms  just short of committing chargeable crimes  so long as he operates mostly and brazenly in full public view  For a demagogue  shamelessness is its own reward Such a president can have openly  actively encouraged and welcomed foreign government support for his political campaigns  and his campaign can reinforce the point in direct communications with that government s representatives  The Barr summary reveals that the special counsel uncovered not just a couple but  multiple offers  of support from the Russians  and yet neither Mr  Trump nor his campaign reported them to counterintelligence or law enforcement authorities  Mr  Trump went further still   while in office  he dictated a statement for his son and campaign aide  Donald Trump Jr   that falsely represented the purposes of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign representatives and a Kremlin connected representative  and others  offering assistance in the 2016 election Mr  Mueller proceeded cautiously on this and other evidence  Federal campaign finance laws prohibit soliciting and receiving support from foreign nationals or  substantially assisting  them in their efforts to influence an American election  but Mr  Mueller concluded that the rules as applied to the facts did not support a criminal prosecution  This was a conservative judgment   but it underscores again the urgent work norms must do if the law is inadequate to the task  Similarly  the letter notes that much of the president s obstructive behavior during the investigation was in  public view   This was apparently a significant consideration in the decision by Mr  Barr and Mr  Rosenstein not to prosecute  along with the determination that there was no underlying  collusion  legal offense   Here  once again  the president who is a demagogue   who is fully prepared to flout well established  vitally important expectations about how American presidents faithfully execute the laws   can safely bring self interested  self protective pressure on the Department of Justice and undermine its public standing and authority In this case  the president s all out assault on the department  the special counsel and the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not prevent Mr  Mueller from completing his investigation and reporting his conclusions  or his reasons  in the case of obstruction  for not reaching a conclusion and leaving it to the attorney general to decide   Who is to say that the next demagogue to occupy the Oval Office won t follow this same path but take it one or more steps further  Mr  Trump has shown the way For the classic demagogue  so feared by the founders  the only question is what works to serve his own interests  He will do  and he will say  what it takes  weighing only the personal costs against the personal benefits  In the polarized politics of the day  Mr  Trump is bolstered in his demagogic conduct by a passionately loyal  base  impressed by his norm busting  So  even before other facts emerge  the urgent question is how to revive and even strengthen the norms  We have reason to salute Mr  Mueller  As a prosecutor  he did his job conscientiously  and the process generally worked as designed  But we now have cause to worry about the future of the norms that Mr  Trump could trash on a calculation that he could get away with it It was a good moment for the demagogue more on the mueller report and barr letterOpinion

MOSUL  Iraq   The drawn men waited silently outside the morgue on Saturday for the scream of an approaching ambulance carrying another victim of the devastating raft accident on the Tigris River this past week  I am looking for these boys   said one  Mohammed Thanoon  23  holding out his phone to show photos of his nephews to anyone who would look  This one is Omran Majid   Mr  Thanoon said as if introducing him to a visitor  showing a slender boy with blue eyes and dark hair   This is Abdullah Majid   he said  displaying a photo of a serious looking child  They were 6 and 11 Mr  Thanoon and the others awaited word of loved ones whose fates remained unknown after an overloaded pleasure craft carrying people between Mosul s riverfront and a small island in the middle of the Tigris capsized on Thursday  dumping its passengers into the water and then sinking The bodies of 97 people had been found by Saturday  but the morgue director  Dr  Hassan Wafiq  said 60 or more people were most likely still missing  While there is little hope that any will be found alive  their families want to at least give them a proper Islamic burial Mr  Thanoon s family has been rocked by the accident  The body of Omran and Abdullah s brother  4 year old Mustapha  was found on Friday  the body of Mr  Thanoon s 29 year old sister was brought to the morgue on Thursday after the boat sank People had crowded onto the small craft   a raft with flimsy railings and a canopy to keep off the sun   to make the short journey across an arm of the Tigris to the island  home to a picnic ground and small amusement park  On Thursday  the festive crowd was celebrating Nowruz  the Kurdish and Persian New Year The river was high and the boat so overloaded it was sitting low in the water as metal cables cranked it across the Tigris  In the middle of the river  one of the cables broke  the raft tipped and the passengers slid in that direction  their weight quickly causing the craft to capsize Rescue workers continued to find victims through late Friday  some as far as 25 miles downstream  where the swift current had taken them  Though 40 or more people were rescued  many are still unaccounted for The horror of the accident set off angry protests in Mosul on Friday  mostly by young residents who blamed not only the boat s owners  but also the government  which licensed the raft  and especially the provincial governor  Nawfal Hamadi Within a day of the accident  as the toll steadily grew  Prime Minister Adil Abdel Mahdi requested that the Iraqi Parliament relieve Mr  Hamadi of his post ImagePeople waiting for word of their relatives in a tent outside the morgue in Mosul on Saturday CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesIn a letter to the Parliament  which has the authority to fire Mr  Hamadi  the prime minister cited  negligence  and  shortcomings in carrying out his duties and responsibilities   Mr  Hamadi has not responded publicly Despite Mr  Mehdi s demand  few people seem satisfied By the river  near where the accident occurred  the usually crowded cafes and restaurants were closed on Saturday  Many Mosul citizens came to mourn  even if they had not lost a family member A couple of local organizations set up funeral tents  a tradition in Iraq when someone dies so that relatives  friends and neighbors can sit with the bereaved and pay their respects  But these tents were for the citizens of Mosul who have borne so much   a four year occupation by the Islamic State and now this tragic accident Tariq Mohammed Ali  a teacher who two months ago had taken his students to the island for a school trip  said he had been worried about the system used to pull the boats and the number of people being allowed aboard He said the cable was  fraying and rusty  and the boat  shaky   More than 200 people were crowded onto the vessel that day  he said  But O K   the accident happened   Mr  Ali said   The problem is they had no equipment to save people  They had just two boats  there were no safety preparations  no safety guard  no life jackets  Others in the crowd chimed in  saying corruption and carelessness were at the root of the problem  We have to say this was a crime   said Amar Abdul Karim  28   The reason is the corruption  They didn t give the license for the river boats to the right person  The Mosul citizens are being sold out for money   why else would you put so many people on the boat  The price of a ticket to the island and back was about 80 cents  said several people  With 200 people aboard  each trip would earn about  160 The boat landing was closed on Saturday and the government officially renamed the island  Martyrs Island  for those who had died As evening fell and rain spattered the dust  among those standing or squatting outside the morgue  keeping vigil in case the body of their son  sister  brother or cousin were brought back  there was growing hopelessness  This was the fault of the governor and the provincial council   said Aziz Karim  60  who had been hoping to find his 20 year old son  Magid  Today no one came here to speak to us   not the governor nor the provincial council members  No one came to ask  What do you need  How can we help you   he said  gulping back tears  his face creased and tired Asked what kind of work he did  Mr  Karim hesitated  then answered as he turned away   I am the father of one who is missing

PINE RIDGE  S D    Ella Red Cloud Yellow Horse  marooned for days by a blizzard and then a flood  needed to get out  Supplies at her house were running low  She had come down with pneumonia  She had a chemotherapy appointment to keep But her long driveway was blocked by mountains of mud   impassable even for an ambulance or a tractor So Ms  Red Cloud Yellow Horse  59  set off toward the road on foot  She fell repeatedly  almost got swept away in the current of a creek  and became stuck in the mud  Finally  more than an hour later  she made it the half mile to the highway where she was picked up  I couldn t breathe   she said   but I knew I needed to get to the hospital  Such stories are startlingly common these days on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota   a stunning stretch of land larger than Delaware   as an overwhelming bout of snow and flooding has set off a humanitarian disaster that seems unlikely to abate soon With some residents approaching two weeks stranded in their homes  and with emergency rations able to reach parts of the back country only by horse  boat and helicopter  Pine Ridge remains in a state of shock and triage ImageThe rising floodwaters stopped just sort of the home where Henry Red Cloud and his family rode out the storm  but other buildings on their property including their solar power business were inundated CreditKristina Barker for The New York TimesOfficials with the Oglala Sioux Tribe  which administers the reservation  say they lack the training  manpower and equipment needed to deal with such a large scale crisis  And there s a pervasive sense on Pine Ridge  a place of long strained relations with the state and federal governments  that help has been woefully slow to arrive  and that few people beyond the reservation know or care much about its plight  This is a state of emergency right now   said Henry Red Cloud  whose family s losses in the flooding include five homes  a forklift  a truck  a van and the building where his solar energy business was based Mr  Red Cloud now rides a flat bottomed boat each night to the one home on his family s property that is not a total loss   What we need to be doing is building sandbag walls   not a southern border wall   he said Pine Ridge was far from alone in being hit with damaging quantities of snow and water this month  Huge portions of the Midwest were swallowed by rivers in the last 10 days  with devastating consequences for farms  roads and small riverfront towns  So far  at least three people are confirmed to have died  and the affected states have estimated that they have suffered more than a billion dollars in damage and economic harm But while conversations about recovery were already underway in the hardest hit portions of Nebraska and Iowa  where most roads have reopened and many rivers have started to recede  Pine Ridge  with a population of about 20 000  remained in a state of hour to hour chaos  Some of the tribe s scarce heavy equipment was lost in the mud  Jail inmates were enlisted to fill sandbags  New parents worried as they ran low on infant formula ImageDay laborers and volunteers unload non perishable foods from a truck during an emergency delivery by the Food Distribution Program in Oglala  S D CreditKristina Barker for The New York TimesUnlike in Nebraska  where the National Guard rescued 111 people  including some by helicopter and boat  outside help for Pine Ridge was conspicuously scarce at first  South Dakota s governor  Kristi Noem  has been seen by many Pine Ridge officials and residents as slow to respond  But Ms  Noem  who visited the reservation on Saturday  said that the tribe had only made formal requests for help in recent days  which she quickly approved  Since then  Ms  Noem said  the state had sent ATVs  a boat rescue team and a small group of National Guard soldiers to distribute drinking water  When we became aware is when we responded   Ms  Noem said in an interview after her visit The reservation  in the southwestern part of the state  is among the most scenic places in the Great Plains states  Pine crested buttes punctuate the skyline  open prairie stretches for miles  and creeks wind through pastures and yards  But the vast distances  scattered population and relatively untamed terrain can make it difficult to reach people in blizzards or floods The tribal led relief effort on Pine Ridge has been mired in challenges  Though employees pulled marathon shifts and slept in their work vehicles  there were simply not enough people or equipment to reach everyone needing help  residents said  Julian Bear Runner  the Oglala Sioux Tribe s newly elected president  said many had voiced frustration with the tribal government s response  People are getting angry   Mr  Bear Runner said   and that s understandable   But he added   We re doing the best we can with what little we have  He said resources had been stretched so thin that he had slept on his office floor most nights since the storm  and had driven his own pickup truck to respond to calls for help because there were too few tribal workers ImageHighway 28  a main route on the Pine Ridge reservation connecting Wounded Knee and Manderson  S D   has been closed for days by flooding from nearby Fast Horse Creek CreditKristina Barker for The New York Times If we would have had state of the art equipment  if we would have had adequate manpower  we could have gotten a lot done   said Mr  Bear Runner  who said the state assistance  though late to arrive  was greatly appreciated Tribal officials said the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs had also provided equipment and manpower to help The crisis on Pine Ridge is a collision of nature  poverty and inadequate infrastructure  No sooner were Pine Ridge s highways mostly cleared of snow than temperatures shot up  and the rush of newly melted water overflowed from creeks and rivers  The flooding   the worst in at least a generation  several residents said   turned the rugged dirt roads that many people live along into a liquefied mud soup Adding to the urgency  late last week about 8 000 residents lost drinking water  It s gotten worse   Mr  Bear Runner  the tribal president  said on Friday Pine Ridge is a place accustomed to struggle  and its people have had well publicized battles with alcoholism and teen suicide  Half the reservation s residents live in poverty  according to the Census Bureau  and the unemployment rate is 20 percent  compared with about 3 percent for South Dakota as a whole  Many people on Pine Ridge live in aging houses a mile or more from a highway  and some depend on wood burning stoves to keep warm ImageGarfield Steele  left  president of the reservation s Wounded Knee District  said tribal officials were short of resources to cope with the flood   We know people are panicked and claustrophobic   said Babette Thin Elk  right  the district secretary   We are doing what we can  CreditKristina Barker for The New York Times The lack of resources  the lack of water  lack of transportation and the lack of facilities   this really compounds all of the issues   said Valentina Merdanian  a tribal council member who on Friday was fielding calls from stranded constituents and trying to organize rescue crews In the few quiet moments  some people expressed worry that the treacherous conditions could become a new normal   With climate change  it s getting worse and worse   said Robert Pille  who had to leave his home because of the floods   This is going to be a regular thing  Mr  Bear Runner said there had been no time to tally up how many buildings were destroyed  how many rescues had been made or how many people remained unreached  We didn t have the proper training for the E M S   we didn t know what to do   said Garfield Steele  the president of the reservation s Wounded Knee District  the site of the 1890 massacre of Native Americans by United States soldiers and the 1973 siege by members of the American Indian Movement Governor Noem  who took office in January  has a strained relationship with her state s Native American nations  some of which requested that their tribal flags not be displayed at the State Capitol after she introduced and lawmakers passed a set of bills this month that would restrict protests Rising Waters  See How Quickly the Midwest FloodedMapping the severity of the region s flooding  which has killed three people Despite those tensions  several people on the reservation said they would have liked to see a more robust National Guard and state government presence during the storm response  As members of the tribe volunteered to cook meals and unload food delivery trucks on Friday  and as people checked on older neighbors who lived far from the highway  some of the biggest needs remained unmet  We just need the technical skills   said Mary Tobacco  who was helping lead recovery efforts  but who became stranded herself on Friday as rising water made it impossible to leave her home on a butte   The water was moving too fast  she said  to make it out in her kayak  Tribal officials were still working to determine whether as many as four more deaths in the past two weeks could be attributed to the storm  including some involving patients who needed medical help and could not be reached by ambulance  The tribe s police chief  Robert Ecoffey  said on Friday that it was not known whether those people would have survived if an ambulance had reached them In the meantime  some on Pine Ridge were hunkering down for what could be weeks more with little or no access to the outside world Bernadine Rowland  stranded since March 12  said Saturday that she and her grandchildren had remained in good spirits and had passed the days by watching Netflix and YouTube videos  But her pantry had started to get bare   only two bags of beans left  plus some oatmeal and rice   and an attempted food delivery by horseback had to be aborted Friday afternoon because a creek that had to be crossed was running too high Just before sunset Friday night  the horseback riders came back  this time by canoe  carrying big plastic bags full of macaroni and cheese  toilet paper  Hamburger Helper and canned pasta  It was a relief   Ms  Rowland said   We ll have something to last us for a while   

BERLIN   Germany s second richest family built its multibillion dollar fortune with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts  Jimmy Choo shoes and Calvin Klein perfume   and forced laborers under the Nazis The Reimann family  which controls the consumer goods conglomerate JAB Holding Company  recently commissioned a historian to dig deep into company archives and shed light on its activities during the 12 years of Nazi rule The initial revelations  74 years after World War II ended  are damning Albert Reimann Sr  and his son Albert Reimann Jr   who ran the company in the 1930s and 1940s  were enthusiastic Hitler supporters and anti Semites  who condoned the abuse of forced laborers  not only in their industrial chemicals company in southern Germany  but also in their own home Female workers from Eastern Europe were forced to stand at attention naked in their factory barracks  Those who refused were sexually abused  Workers were kicked and beaten  among them one Russian woman  who cleaned in the Reimanns  private villa News of the family s dark history broke Sunday in the tabloid Bild  Peter Harf  the family spokesman and one of two managing partners of JAB Holding  said the historian s findings  completely matched  those of the family  Reimann Sr  and Reimann Jr  were guilty   Mr  Harf said   They belonged in jail  The exploitation of forced workers was widespread in Germany during the war  a time of acute labor shortages  An estimated 12 million people from more than a dozen European countries were abducted by the Nazis and forced to work in support of the German war effort  At their peak  forced laborers made up an estimated 20 percent of the German work force Farms and industrial companies that mattered to the war effort got priority from the government office that allocated the workers   men and women taken from their homes in Nazi occupied territories or  sometimes  prisoners of war The Reimann case stands out for the particular brutality detailed in some of the reported documents  and the fact that father and son appear to have been involved in the abuse themselves  said Andreas Wirsching  director of the Munich based Leibniz Institute for Contemporary History  It was very common for companies to use forced laborers   but it was not common for a company boss to be in direct and physical contact with these forced laborers   Mr  Wirsching said Albert Reimann Sr   who died in 1954  and Albert Reimann Jr   who died in 1984  reportedly never spoke about the Nazi era after the war  It was only in the early 2000s that the younger generation began looking at old company documents and stumbled across material that suggested their father and grandfather had been committed Nazis In 2014  the family asked Paul Erker  an economic historian at the University of Munich  to document the history  Mr  Erker s research is still underway  What has emerged so far came from an interim presentation he gave earlier this year  Mr  Harf said ImagePeter Harf  one of two managing directors at JAB Holding  and a spokesman for the Reimann family CreditSoeren Stache DPA  via Associated Press We were speechless   Mr  Harf said   We were ashamed and were white as a wall  Once the report is completed next year it will be made public  he said  The family plans to donate 10 million euros  or about  11 3 million  to a charity that has yet to be identified In 2000  the German government helped set up a 10 billion mark  about 5 1 billion euros  fund to provide compensation to forced laborers  with half the money coming from companies like Siemens  Deutsche Bank  Daimler and Volkswagen The list of well known German companies that profited from forced labor   and Nazi crimes more generally   is long  and it often took decades for them to open their books Daimler was one of the first  in the 1980s  The Mercedes maker used nearly 40 000 forced laborers toward the end of the war  Volkswagen used some 12 000  including concentration camp prisoners who were locked up in a dedicated camp used by the company  Hugo Boss produced the black SS uniforms  Deutsche Bank was one of many companies that profited from businesses being taken from their Jewish owners The Reimanns initially made their fortune from a chemical company that became Reckitt Benckiser  the  58 billion consumer products giant whose brands include Lysol  They then channeled much of their wealth into JAB  a conglomerate that has become one of the biggest players in the consumer world through a rapid fire series of corporate takeovers JAB has spent billions to become a rival to the likes of Starbucks and Nestlé by buying chains like Peet s Coffee   Tea  Krispy Kreme and Pret A Manger  Last year  it also helped the pod coffee company Keurig Green Mountain buy Dr Pepper Snapple for nearly  19 billion It also controls the cosmetics giant Coty  owner of Calvin Klein fragrances  and previously owned luxury fashion labels like Jimmy Choo The fortune of the Reimanns  one of the most secretive industrial families in Germany  was estimated last year at 33 billion euros  according to Manager Magazin  a financial publication  In lists of the wealthiest families in the country the Reimanns most recently ranked second Based on what has been revealed so far  Mr  Wirsching  the historian  said the Reimanns had most likely not just been opportunists but also  committed Nazis  Father and son joined the Nazi party and donated to the SS even before Hitler came to power  In July 1937  Albert Reimann Jr  wrote a letter to Heinrich Himmler  the leader of the SS  who oversaw the Holocaust  We are a purely Aryan family business that is over 100 years old   he wrote   The owners are unconditional followers of the race theory  By 1943  175 workers  or a third of the total  were forced laborers  Bild reported  In addition to Russian and Eastern European civilians  the Reimanns used French prisoners of war  In 1940  Albert Reimann Jr  reportedly complained to the mayor of Ludwigshafen  the town where his factory was based  that the French were not working hard enough At the end of the war  the Reimanns were investigated by the allied occupying powers  The French barred them from continuing their business activities  but the Americans overturned the judgment  Bild reported  

On Sunday afternoon  soon after Attorney General Bill Barr released a letter outlining the Mueller investigation report  President Trump tweeted  Total EXONERATION   But there are any number of reasons the president should not be taking a victory lap  First  obviously  he still faces the New York investigations into campaign finance violations by the Trump team and the various investigations into the Trump organization  And Mr  Barr  in his letter  acknowledges that the Mueller report  does not exonerate  Mr  Trump on the issue of obstruction  even if it does not recommend an indictment  But the critical part of the letter is that it now creates a whole new mess  After laying out the scope of the investigation and noting that Mr  Mueller s report does not offer any legal recommendations  Mr  Barr declares that it therefore  leaves it to the attorney general to decide whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime   He then concludes the president did not obstruct justice when he fired the F B I  director  James Comey Such a conclusion would be momentous in any event  But to do so within 48 hours of receiving the report  which pointedly did not reach that conclusion  should be deeply concerning to every American  The special counsel regulations were written to provide the public with confidence that justice was done  It is impossible for the public to reach that determination without knowing two things  First  what did the Mueller report conclude  and what was the evidence on obstruction of justice  And second  how could Mr  Barr have reached his conclusion so quickly Mr  Barr s letter raises far more questions than it answers  both on the facts and the law  His letter says Mr  Mueller set  out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the special counsel views as  difficult issues  of law and fact concerning whether the president s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction   Yet we don t know what those  difficult issues  were  because Mr  Barr doesn t say  or why Mr  Mueller  after deciding not to charge on conspiracy  let Mr  Barr make the decision on obstruction On the facts  Mr  Barr says that the government would need to prove that Mr  Trump acted with  corrupt intent  and there were no such actions  But how would Mr  Barr know  Did he even attempt to interview Mr  Trump about his intentions  What kind of prosecutor would make a decision about someone s intent without even trying to talk to him  Particularly in light of Mr  Mueller s pointed statement that his report does not  exonerate  Mr  Trump  Mr  Mueller didn t have to say anything like that  He did so for a reason  And that reason may well be that there is troubling evidence in the substantial record that he compiled Furthermore  we do not know why Mr  Mueller did not try to force an interview with the president  The reason matters greatly  Mr  Mueller could have concluded that interviews of sitting presidents for obstruction matters are better done within the context of a congressional impeachment investigation  perhaps because a sitting president cannot be indicted  the Barr letter says this legal argument didn t influence Mr  Barr s conclusion but again is pointedly silent as to Mr  Mueller   Or Mr  Barr could have concluded that the attorney general  not a special counsel  should carry out such an interview  The fact that Mr  Barr rushed to judgment  within 48 hours  after a 22 month investigation  is deeply worrisome  The opening lines of the obstruction section of Mr  Barr s letter are even more concerning  It says that the special counsel investigated  a number of actions by the president   most of which have been the subject of public reporting   That suggests that at least some of the foundation for an obstruction of justice charge has not yet been made public  There will be no way to have confidence in such a quick judgment about previously unreported actions without knowing what those actions were On the law  Mr  Barr s letter also obliquely suggests that he consulted with the Office of Legal Counsel  the elite Justice Department office that interprets federal statutes  This raises the serious question of whether Mr  Barr s decision on Sunday was based on the bizarre legal views that he set out in an unsolicited 19 page memo last year  That memo made the argument that the obstruction of justice statute does not apply to the president because the text of the statute doesn t specifically mention the president  Of course  the murder statute doesn t mention the president either  but no one thinks the president can t  commit murder  Indeed  the Office of Legal Counsel had previously concluded that such an argument to interpret another criminal statute  the bribery law  was wrong As such  Mr  Barr s reference to the office raises the question of whether he tried to enshrine his idiosyncratic view into the law and bar Mr  Trump s prosecution  His unsolicited memo should be understood for what it is  a badly argued attempt to put presidents above the law  If he used that legal fiction to let President Trump off the hook  Congress would have to begin an impeachment investigation to vindicate the rule of law Sometimes momentous government action leaves everyone uncertain about the next move  This is not one of those times  Congress now has a clear path of action  It must first demand the release of the Mueller report  so that Americans can see the evidence for themselves  Then  it must call Mr  Barr and Mr  Mueller to testify  Mr  Barr in particular must explain his rationale for reaching the obstruction judgment he made No one wants a president to be guilty of obstruction of justice  The only thing worse than that is a guilty president who goes without punishment  The Barr letter raises the specter that we are living in such times RelatedMore on the Mueller report Mueller Finds No Trump Russia

ROME   Italy resisted the entreaties and warnings of its European Union and American allies on Saturday by officially joining China s vast new Silk Road at a signing ceremony with President Xi Jinping of China  a move that crystallized shifting geopolitical balances and the populist Italian government s willingness to break with its traditional partners The agreement will  build a better relationship  between China and Italy  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy said Italy became the first of the Group of 7 nations that once dominated the global economy to take part in China s  One Belt One Road  project  which makes enormous infrastructure investments to move Chinese goods and resources throughout Asia  Africa and Europe The Trump administration  which tried and failed to stop the deal  focused in the days leading up to Mr  Xi s visit on blocking any Italian use of 5G wireless networks developed by the Chinese electronics giant Huawei  which Washington warned could be used by Beijing to spy on communications networks Against the backdrop of Italian  Chinese and European flags  a host of Chinese and Italian ministers and business leaders signed 29 separate agreements at the Villa Madama  marking the culmination of Mr  Xi s visit to Rome  where he was welcomed as a prized ally and  critics said  conqueror ImageCrowds waiting to welcome President Xi on Friday  Italy became the first of the Group of 7 nations to take part in China s  One Belt One Road  project CreditAlessandra Tarantino Associated PressThe memorandum of understanding formalized on Saturday provides a framework agreement for billions of euros in business deals between Italian and Chinese state backed companies  But analysts said that what mattered more was its political symbolism  as it signaled waning American influence  a rising China and tensions among the founding partners of the European Union Interior Minister Matteo Salvini  Italy s most powerful politician  was notably absent from the signing ceremony  In the weeks leading up to the agreement  he publicly assumed a more American aligned and skeptical posture toward the deal  though he did not try to stop it  After the deal was done  he again ridiculed the notion that China was a  free market   but said that as long as the deal served Italian interests  he was satisfied By contrast  his coalition partner  Luigi Di Maio  the leader of the anti establishment Five Star Movement  championed the deal and made several visits to China in recent months  On Saturday  he beamed at the Villa Madama as he signed the first several agreements with Chinese counterparts  including those explicitly declaring Italy s participation on new economic and maritime Silk Roads  Like someone in the United States said  America first    Mr  Di Maio said   I continue to repeat  Italy first  in commercial relations  The Chinese leader punctuated the signings by shaking the hand of Mr  Conte before flying off to the Sicilian capital  Palermo  a port city that hopes to benefit from Chinese investment  tourism and orange exports to China ImageFrom left  President Xi  the chairman of China s National Development and Reform Commission

celebrated by the Italians with a state dinner and cavalry escort  is likely to get a less festive greeting on Sunday when he visits Nice  France  President Emmanuel Macron  Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and representatives of the European Union will meet with him there and present a united front against what they consider China s aggressive  and troubling  economic expansion into Europe This past week  as Mr  Xi met with Italian leaders  Mr  Macron announced an end to  the period of European naïveté  with regard to China and sought to strengthen rules protecting strategic economic sectors  They insisted on more reciprocity and transparency from China and sought to convince Mr  Conte that he was making a critical error by joining the One Belt One Road project Italy  which is saddled with crushing debt  hopes to lift its lagging economy by exporting goods to China and inviting more Chinese investment But opponents of the project in the Trump administration and in the European Union worry that Italy has turned itself into a Trojan Horse  allowing China s economic   and potentially military and political   expansion to reach into the heart of Europe The Italians say their allies are exaggerating Michele Geraci  the chief Italian negotiator of the deal and an under secretary for economic development  said that Italy would avoid China s debt traps and that its laws prevent foreigners from taking control of its ports  as China has done in Piraeus  Greece  He also argued that Italy s European partners  who do billions of dollars more business every year with China  had already let them in ImageMr  Xi and his wife  Peng Liyuan  arriving at the Quirinale Palace on Friday  The Chinese president was celebrated by the Italians with a state dinner and cavalry escort CreditGiuseppe Lami EPA  via Shutterstock China uses the European Union as 28 Trojan doors   he said  referring to the number of member states in the bloc  Italy  he said  had expanded its legal powers to defend against Chinese predatory acquisitions  especially in sectors of national security  We are the country in Europe and probably the world that would least fear a Trojan effect   said Mr  Geraci  adding that because he had lived in China for a decade   I know China very well  and we are more able than others to spot any risks  Even critics of the government argued that the agreement gave Italy a chance to catch up to Germany and France  which had much more business with China than Italy did  It s a positive thing   said former Prime Minister Romano Prodi  who attended the state dinner for Mr  Xi on Friday night   It s a competition between the countries of Europe  China also sees positive opportunities in Italy s ports  which are connected to railways that run into the heart of Central Europe  But that is not new  The difference now is the willingness of the Italians to let them in Zeno D Agostino  the president of Trieste s port authority  who signed one of the agreements in Rome on Saturday  said it was only natural that Italians would be looking to China because the Trump administration had withdrawn from the world China  he said   is opening because it feels strong   and a port had to do business with those who engaged in the world  

The Federal Emergency Management Agency unnecessarily shared sensitive personal data of more than two million disaster victims with a contractor  subjecting that information to potential identity theft and fraud  a government memo released on Friday said The memo  known as a management alert and written by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security  said the data of survivors of the 2017 California wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey  Irma and Maria were released to an unidentified contractor There were no indications that the data had been compromised  the agency said in a statement on Friday night  The agency said it had worked with the contractor to scrub the unnecessary data from its computer networks The memo  which was dated March 15 but surfaced on Friday  found that 20 data fields were unnecessarily shared with the contractor  including details about the victims  financial institutions  electronic funds transfer numbers and bank transit numbers  Investigators estimated 2 3 million people helped by FEMA might have been affected The victims were enrolled in a program called Transitional Sheltering Assistance  which provides hotels to people displaced by disasters  The memo said that previous iterations of the program did require the kind of sensitive personal data that was overshared to be provided to a contractor but that was no longer the case The memo said the contractor did not alert FEMA that it was receiving more information than needed but noted that the contractor was not required to do so Had the contractor alerted FEMA  the agency  may have been able to remedy this situation earlier and avoid additional privacy incidents   the memo said  Without corrective action  the disaster survivors involved in the privacy incident are at increased risk of identity theft and fraud   the memo said The name of the contractor was unavailable  The report redacted its name In a statement on Friday night  the agency s press secretary  Lizzie Litzow  acknowledged that FEMA transferred  more information than was necessary  to the contractor  Since discovery of this issue  FEMA has taken aggressive measures to correct this error   the statement said   FEMA is no longer sharing unnecessary data with the contractor and has conducted a detailed review of the contractor s information system  A memo from FEMA to the Inspector General s Office dated March 8 said that the agency considered any  unnecessary sharing of survivor data to be a serious matter  and that it was  dedicating substantial resources  to address it Investigators recommended steps to ensure that future needless sharing of data was not repeated  The memo said FEMA concurred with the recommendations The discovery of the excessive sharing of data was made during an audit of the sheltering program  Investigators said that the audit was continuing and that additional recommendations might be included in a full audit report  

MOSCOW   There was crowing in Russia on Monday that the special counsel s investigation did not find coordination between Moscow and the Trump campaign in 2016  but optimism about improved relations was tempered by the report s extensive focus on Russian meddling in the presidential election Official reaction to a summary of Robert S  Mueller III s report that was released on Sunday proved decidedly muted Dmitri S  Peskov  the spokesman for President Vladimir V  Putin  told reporters that the only news in the summary was the  recognition that there wasn t any collusion   and he repeated his denial that Russia had interfered in the American election  Mr  Putin has maintained a steady interest in good relations with the United States  he said  while American actions toward Russia have been erratic  so the ball is in Washington s court From others in the Kremlin elite  however  the main refrain was  we told you so   along with some hope that President Trump would now be free to pursue his campaign goal of improving relations with Russia  Mueller s long awaited report proved what was known in Russia from the very beginning   Konstantin Kosachev  the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the upper house of the Russian Parliament  wrote on Facebook   There was no collusion between Trump and any of his team with Russia  Rossiya 24  the main state television news channel  was more mocking  saying it took tens of millions of dollars for  the mountain to bring forth a mouse  The full report has not been released  and an extended battle is expected in Washington over its fate  But the four page summary issued by Attorney General William P  Barr noted twice that the investigation had not established that the Kremlin and the Trump campaign had worked together in the Russian meddling  The Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign  or anyone associated with it  conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts  despite multiple offers from Russian affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign   Mr  Barr s summary said Mr  Kosachev said he regretted the two lost years during which Russian American relations were hampered by sanctions and continued accusations of wrongdoing  Various officials and analysts said they hoped that there would be new initiatives soon toward Russia from the Trump administration  but there were varying degrees of optimism about when this might happen and how substantial they might be  To some extent  the leader of the United States now has greater room to maneuver  which  in principle  he can use   Mr  Kosachev wrote  Still  he noted  Congress retains significant control over lifting sanctions  and hawks like John R  Bolton  Mr  Trump s national security adviser  will not necessarily endorse improving ties   In any case  there is a chance to reset to zero a lot in our relations   Mr  Kosachev said   but will Trump take that risk   for now it s a question  There are  of course  serious issues dividing Moscow and the West that are unrelated to the 2016 election or the Mueller investigation  Russia s aggression against Ukraine  its alliance with Iran and support for President Bashar al Assad in Syria s civil war  its backing of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and the poisoning of a retired Russian spy and his daughter with a nerve agent in Britain  I don t think this will change much   said Aleksei V  Makarkin  an analyst with the Center for Political Technologies  a Moscow think tank  The myriad areas of conflict  do not allow us to consider these relations with optimism   he said Others noted that a significant portion of the Mueller report summary addressed Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election and damage Mr  Trump s opponent  Hillary Clinton One element of that effort was the work of the St  Petersburg based Internet Research Agency to sow social discord in the United States through a disinformation campaign  Another involved computer hacking  especially of the Clinton campaign  to obtain information that could influence the election The investigation resulted in indictments against 26 Russians  many of them government intelligence officers  and three Russian companies  although there is no real expectation that they will ever stand trial Aleksandr Morozov  a frequent Kremlin critic  noted that the report confirmed Russian interference in the election  The Kremlin can hope either to reset relations  to wait until the damage fades or to continue with business as usual  said Mr  Morozov  a researcher at the Boris Nemtsov Academic Center for the Study of Russia branch in Prague Moscow will probably choose to continue with its campaign of disinformation and disruption against American democracy  he said in an interview   It is difficult to imagine that relations can get better now   he said   So that means that the Kremlin will try to continue with the hybrid war and also attempt to push this event out of the Russian American agenda with the help of some new ones  Analysts of all stripes said that without the cloud of the Mueller investigation over him  Mr  Trump might return to his idea of a grand bargain with Mr  Putin  something he had appeared to put on the back burner as the accusations swirled  Now he can say this is my political plan and not the result of any wrongdoing   said Ivan I  Kurilla  a historian at the European University at St  Petersburg who specializes in Russian American relations Whether that will be enough to clear a path for Mr  Trump is another matter  The Kremlin is cautious about his mercurial moods  and Democrats will continue to challenge the president over Russian actions  particularly the election meddling described by Mr  Mueller  He is not seen as a reliable partner for Russia   said Dmitri Trenin  the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center   Russia will continue to be what it has been for the last two years in the United States  a political football kicked around by all sides  Mr  Kurilla said there was a panoply of issues on which talks could at least get started  ranging from smaller disputes like the recent mutual expulsion of diplomats and closing of consulates to larger issues like the war in Ukraine  arms control or the situation in Venezuela Compared with the summit meetings that Mr  Trump has held with the leader of North Korea  Kim Jong un  Mr  Putin may seem a far more important  more tempting target  he said  I always see Trump s meeting with Kim Jong un of North Korea as a rehearsal of what he was going to do with Putin   Mr  Kurilla said   A meeting of two strong men  and some big deal to make the world less dangerous  He will probably return to the idea of some bargain  some grand deal between Russia and the United States  Still  any change will take time  I don t expect Trump to lift the sanctions and he and Putin to embrace each other tomorrow   Mr  Kurilla said  

On its face  the letter that Attorney General William Barr sent to Congress on Sunday afternoon  summarizing the key findings of the special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation  is good news  not just for President Trump According to Mr  Barr s four page summary  Mr  Mueller and his team were unable to establish that anyone connected to the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government when it interfered to help Mr  Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign This should provide some relief to all Americans who have harbored fears that a presidential candidate was conspiring with Vladimir Putin to subvert American democracy  Mr  Mueller   who never once responded to the shameless stream of insults Mr  Trump has hurled at him over the last two years   is as careful and thorough an investigator as there is  His investigation lasted almost two years  issued more than 2 800 subpoenas and roughly 500 search warrants and heard from a similar number of witnesses  If he couldn t find any links  it s doubtful anyone could What this outcome is not  however  is a  Complete and Total EXONERATION   as Mr  Trump unsurprisingly spun it  Mr  Mueller explicitly declined to exonerate the president on the matter of obstruction of justice   a crime that constituted one of the articles of impeachment for both Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton  After examining Mr  Trump s actions and weighing  difficult issues  of law and fact  Mr  Mueller punted   While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him   the report states Mr  Barr wasn t as cautious  Less than 48 hours after receiving Mr  Mueller s report  the attorney general briskly decided that Mr  Trump had not obstructed justice  Why not  Because there was no underlying crime to obstruct  Mr  Barr said  and anyway  most of Mr  Trump s behavior took place in full public view  had no connection to any legal proceeding  and wasn t  done with corrupt intent   How did Mr  Barr make these determinations so quickly  On what evidence in the report did he base it Recall that Mr  Barr got his current job only after Mr  Trump shoved out his predecessor  Jeff Sessions  for not showing him enough personal loyalty and shutting down the Russia investigation at the start  Among the reasons Mr  Barr may have appealed to the president was an unsolicited memo he sent last year to the Justice Department  taking the position that Mr  Mueller should not be allowed to question Mr  Trump about obstructing justice  and that the president could not be guilty of obstruction unless there were an underlying crime to obstruct In other words  Mr  Barr did exactly as Mr  Trump hoped he would  But there s a reason obstructing justice is a crime on its own  The justice system doesn t work when people lie to authorities  no matter why they do so  Mr  Barr s curious views on obstruction are just one reason that Mr  Mueller s full report must be made available  immediately  to both Congress and the American people Also  while Mr  Mueller may not have found sufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy  let s not lose sight of what we already know  both from his investigation and from news reports over the past two years We know that the Russian government interfered repeatedly in the 2016 presidential election  by hacking into computer servers of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign  We know that it did this with the goals of dividing Americans and helping Donald Trump win the presidency  We know that when top members of the Trump campaign learned about this interference  they didn t just fail to report it to the F B I  They welcomed it  They encouraged it  They made jokes about it  On the same day that Mr  Trump publicly urged the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton s emails  they began to do just that  And we know that when questioned by federal authorities  many of Mr  Trump s top associates lied  sometimes repeatedly  about their communications with Russians  None of this is in dispute That Mr  Mueller couldn t find sufficient evidence that Mr  Trump or anyone involved in his campaign had coordinated directly with the Russians may be explained by the fact that they didn t need to  They were already getting that help We also know that what began as a counterintelligence investigation quickly turned into a criminal investigation  in large part because Mr  Trump surrounded himself with criminals  To date  his campaign chairman  Paul Manafort  his deputy campaign chairman  Rick Gates  his national security adviser  Michael Flynn  his campaign foreign policy adviser  George Papadopoulos  and his personal lawyer and fixer  Michael Cohen  have all pleaded guilty or been convicted of federal crimes  In January  Mr  Mueller charged Roger Stone  Mr  Trump s longtime aide  with multiple counts of witness tampering  obstructing justice  and making false statements Imagine if we d learned all of this just Sunday  in one fell swoop  rather than in a trickle of indictments and prosecutions over the last 18 months  Americans are  of course  continuing to learn more unsettling truths from the dozen or so other investigations that are continuing  such as the one in New York that has already landed Mr  Cohen a three year prison sentence for campaign finance violations that prosecutors said Mr  Trump was also involved in  from the White House One might expect Mr  Trump to feel happiness at Sunday s news  but for him  that emotion seems to transform into a desire for vengeance  It s no surprise that he and his allies are once again floating the idea of prosecuting Mrs  Clinton  Remember her  She was the candidate who  during a presidential debate all the way back in 2016  said   It s pretty clear you won t admit that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America  that you encouraged espionage against our people  that you are willing to spout the Putin line  sign up for his wish list  break up NATO  do whatever he wants to do and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race  Mr  Putin did have a clear favorite  He interfered on his behalf  and his favorite was elected president  Trump campaign officials knew about this and were more than happy for the help  Then they lied about receiving that help  This isn t so complicated  And while Mr  Mueller may not be able to do anything about it  Congress  and the American people  certainly can RelatedMore on the

WASHINGTON   Senator Mitch McConnell  the majority leader  will force Democrats on Tuesday to take a stand on the Green New Deal and its ambitious goal of conquering climate change   after a long windup designed to drive a wedge between cautious Democratic senators and the liberal activists pushing for climate action The resolution  which pairs quick action to throttle carbon emissions and liberal job creation programs  will fail at the hands of the Republican majority  Many  if not most  Democrats plan to vote present  arguing that the resolution up for a vote is not anything like a fully formed piece of legislation and has not even received a hearing  Stunt votes in the past by both parties have had little political impact But Republicans say putting the Democrats on record is significant  and it is just the beginning  They intend to keep the Green New Deal in the spotlight as long as possible to paint Democrats as socialists  out of touch with American values  It s the gift that keeps on giving   said Senator James M  Inhofe  an Oklahoma Republican who once brought a snowball to the Senate floor in an effort to disprove climate change Over the past several weeks a parade of Republicans have accused supporters of the Green New Deal of plotting to ban cars and cows  outlaw air travel  and criminalize milkshakes  all while spending trillions of dollars on a dubious effort to eliminate coal  oil and gas and guarantee jobs Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  called the proposal a  utopian manifesto   Senator John Thune of South Dakota called it a  socialist fantasy   Representative Rob Bishop of Utah munched on a hamburger at a news conference where he mused between bites that if the Green New Deal becomes law   I could no longer eat this type of thing   since cattle would be eradicated Using a price tag calculated by the conservative American Action Forum    93 trillion over 10 years   fact sheets circulated among Republicans offer a litany of fanciful ways to use Green New Deal funds  such as filling Lake Michigan with Coca Cola Democrats have accused Mr  McConnell of trying to sabotage any action on climate change and pushed Republicans to come up with a plan of their own for tackling it Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York  who introduced the House version of the Green New Deal  blasted Republicans on Twitter for holding a  bluff vote  and called it a  disgrace  Earlier this month  a handful of Democratic senators   including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader   interrupted speeches attacking the Green New Deal with questions about their Republican colleagues  belief in climate change  Do you believe climate change is real   Mr  Schumer repeatedly asked Democrats acknowledge that Republicans have been aided by the Green New Deal s effort to link the reduction of planet warming pollution to controversial economic goals like employment guarantees and single payer health care  And the resolution s botched rollout   when a staff member issued and then quickly retracted a fact sheet that joked about how long it will take to  fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes    also gave opponents ready made talking points But many question the political impact of a stunt vote  Daniel Lashof  who directs the United States operations of the World Resources Institute  a global environmental think tank  accused Republicans of a  bad faith effort to label whatever the Democrats do as socialism   He predicted it wouldn t resonate beyond those already antagonistic to climate change Senator Sheldon Whitehouse  Democrat of Rhode Island  an outspoken advocate for addressing climate change  dismissed Republican attacks on the Green New Deal as  a lot of made up calumnies  Several Democrats said the caucus still is not unified on how to approach the vote on the Green New Deal  though most are expected to vote  present  But Republicans say they are on to something  At a political level  it s clearly dividing the Democrats   said J  Scott Jennings  a former campaign adviser to Mr  McConnell   There are clearly Democrats who understand what a disaster this was to be rolled out the way it was  but they feel trapped by the base of their party that is demanding this sort of extremely out of the mainstream stuff  But climate change is not  extremely out of the mainstream   Concern about climate change in the United States is the highest it has ever been  On the heels of a deadly wildfire season supercharged by climate change and a report by 13 federal agencies finding global warming poses a serious threat to the economy  Americans are more convinced than ever that emissions from tailpipes and smokestacks are having an impact on the planet In many ways the Green New Deal  with its call to power the country entirely on wind  solar and other zero carbon energy and ensuring the United States eliminates as much carbon pollution as it creates by about 2030  has injected a new enthusiasm for tackling the problem  Every Democratic presidential candidate has been pressed on his or her support of the plan  and it has helped propel climate change into a top tier issue for 2020 But it also has created awkward moments for moderate Democrats  Senator Dianne Feinstein of California  for example  was excoriated and mocked on  Saturday Night Live  after she told a group of visiting school children that she opposed the Green New Deal because it wasn t practical and  there s no way to pay for it   Ms  Feinstein has a 90 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters  which rates lawmakers on their environmental votes and policies  and has sponsored major climate change legislation for more than 20 years Joseph Pinion  a Republican political consultant who advocates a carbon tax  criticized Green New Deal supporters for making it a purity test of support for to address climate change  He called the resolution  possibly the largest setback in terms of getting Republicans to the table certainly in my lifetime  By packaging efforts to curb emissions with unrelated issues like promises of a federal job guarantee  vacation pay for all Americans and a single payer health care system  he said the Green New Deal feeds the belief among conservatives that Democrats are using climate change as a cover to enact a broadly liberal economic agenda  The problem with the Green New Deal is that it unifies Republicans   Mr  Pinion said   From your never Trumpers to your Trump skeptics to your Trumportunists  all of these individuals are united in the idea that the policies of a Green New Deal would be disastrous for America  But polling on the plan is strong  at least among Democrats  Data commissioned by environmental groups in early primary states found 74 percent of likely primary voters reacted favorably when presented the Green New Deal  A new Iowa poll this week reinforced that  finding 91 percent of Iowa Democrats want a candidate who supports the Green New Deal  If anything the Green New Deal has brought energy to an issue that had gone stale   Mr  Whitehouse said   and as long as we can stay united and keep making progress  it will work out really well for us   

A former Hong Kong official s repeated good deeds while in custody led a federal judge to sentence him on Monday to much less time in prison than United States authorities had wanted for conspiring to bribe foreign leaders on behalf of a Chinese oil company Judge Loretta A  Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan sentenced Patrick Ho to three years in prison   two years less than federal prosecutors had sought in a sentencing memorandum  Corruption is insidious   and the crimes Mr  Ho committed warrant a prison sentence  the judge said  But she noted that Mr  Ho had a long history of helping ordinary people and gave him substantial credit for tutoring and counseling many fellow inmates at the Manhattan Correctional Center  The random acts of kindness to so many is something extraordinary   Judge Preska said after Mr  Ho expressed remorse for his actions and bowed to the judge at the end of his statement Mr  Ho was also ordered to pay a  400 000 fine Mr  Ho  an ophthalmologist and a frequent visitor to the United Nations in recent years  was convicted in December on charges of trying to bribe government leaders in Africa to secure business for CEFC China  Mr  Ho worked for a think tank set up by the once fast growing company  The trial put a spotlight on the aggressive methods CEFC used to expand its reach from Asia to Africa  Europe and the United States Mr  Ho  69  has been held in federal custody since his arrest in November 2017  He will get credit for the roughly 16 months he has spent in federal detention  meaning he has completed nearly half his sentence  After his prison term  he will most likely be deported to Hong Kong Mr  Ho told the court that he was remorseful and said he was heartened by letters of support from the inmates he had helped counsel who were either on suicide watch or studying for their high school equivalency exams  At one point during his statement  Mr  Ho s voice began to quaver  and Judge Preska had her clerk take him a box of tissues  At times I felt my life was over   Mr  Ho said Prosecutors and the federal Probation Office recommended a sentence of five years  far less than the more than 20 years called for under federal guidelines As part of its recommendation  the probation department noted that the bribery scheme had been initiated and controlled by high level officials at CEFC  including its former chairman  Ye Jianming Mr  Ye  who was served with a subpoena by federal authorities during a visit to the United States in late 2017  has not been seen since March  He is believed to be in Chinese custody and under investigation for unspecified crimes  

CARACAS  Venezuela   A visit to Venezuela by two military airplanes from Russia  which landed in broad daylight at the international airport in Caracas  has set off alarms that the Kremlin might be acting more brazenly to protect President Nicolás Maduro from the uprising against him Russian and Venezuelan officials have not disputed the arrival of the airplanes  which were first seen at the airport on Saturday  Such flights ordinarily would be sent to a protected military air base beyond the sight of the public  Why is Russia helping Venezuela  The planes brought supplies and technical advisers to Caracas  Venezuela s capital  according to a Russian state news agency and a Russian diplomat  The visit was related to military cooperation contracts signed years ago between Russia and Venezuela  said the news agency  Ria Novosti  suggesting it was routine A Russian diplomat in Caracas  who spoke on condition of anonymity because the diplomat was not authorized to speak to the media  confirmed the Ria Novosti account and said there was nothing unusual But opposition members said the visibility of the military planes was unusual and had been meant to send a message  The timing showed that both Russian and Venezuelan officials wanted to convert a routine technical stop into a show of strength  said Rocio San Miguel  a Venezuelan security analyst  They want to make it as visible as possible   said Ms  San Miguel   This is a sort of bluff in a strategically important moment for Maduro  Russia has emerged as Mr  Maduro s main backer since opposition leader Juan Guaidó proclaimed himself interim president in late January with support of the United States and about 50 other states Russia has maintenance contracts for weapons sold to Venezuela under late President Hugo Chávez  including air defense systems  fighter jets and tanks  that are worth billions of dollars Flight tracking websites showed an Ilyushin IL 62 jet and an Antonov AN 124 cargo plane flew from Moscow s military airport to Caracas s international airport via Syria  The cargo plane flew back to Syria on Monday  according to flight tracking website bosphorusobserver com The arrival of the advisers came as Venezuela activated Russian made S300 air defense systems last week  according to satellite imagery analysis firm ImageSat Intl  Russia has also recently deployed the S300 in Syria Members of Venezuela s opposition have accused Mr  Maduro of escalating the country s deepening political crisis  They have pointed to widespread irregularities during the last election  consider Mr  Maduro s government illegitimate and have asked him to step down and to allow them to call new elections President Trump has repeatedly said that all options are on the table to remove Mr  Maduro  not ruling out military intervention State Secretary Michael Pompeo told his Russian counterpart in a phone call Monday that the United States will  not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela  Last week  Venezuelan secret police detained Mr  Guaidó s chief of staff on terrorism charges  a move that the Trump administration said would be punished  

A California avocado company is voluntarily recalling shipments that were sent to six states after officials said the fruit might be contaminated with a bacterium that can cause health risks The recalled California grown avocados were packed at a facility in California and distributed in that state  Arizona  Florida  New Hampshire  North Carolina and Wisconsin  the company  Henry Avocado Corporation  said in a statement on Saturday It was not immediately clear how many avocados were affected  but the company said that all shipments from its packing facility were subject to the recall  In an article posted on the company s website about its move into the facility last year  officials said it would give them the ability to ripen more than two million cartons of avocados each year From November 2017 to October 2018  the last period for which data is available  338 million pounds of California avocados were harvested in the state  according to the California Avocado Commission Henry Avocado  based in Escondido  Calif   north of San Diego  said it was issuing the voluntary recall  out of an abundance of caution  because a routine government inspection of its packing facility had turned up positive test results for the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes Dr  Robert Glatter  an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City  said that listeria lives naturally in soil and water and that produce can become contaminated by listeria living in the soil  or when manure is used as a fertilizer Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children  frail or older people and others with weakened immune systems  the company said  It can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women  Healthy individuals may suffer from short term and less severe symptoms such as high fever  severe headache and nausea  the company said Still  in its statement on Saturday  the company said there had been no reported illnesses associated with the recall  We are voluntarily recalling our products and taking every action possible to ensure the safety of consumers who eat our avocados   Phil Henry  the president of Henry Avocado  said in a statement  The company is  fully cooperating with federal and state health officials to facilitate an efficient and complete recall of these avocados   he added The affected products are sold in bulk at retail stores  and the company said it was contacting buyers to ensure that the recalled avocados would be immediately removed from store shelves Specifically  the company said that both its California grown conventional and organic avocados had been affected  Consumers can identify the conventional avocados by the  Bravocado  stickers on them  the company said  Henry Avocado s organic products do not carry the  Bravocado  label on the sticker  the company said  those products are labeled  organic  and include  California  on the sticker In its statement  the company urged consumers who have bought the recalled avocados not to eat them and to either discard them or return them for a refund The company noted that avocados imported from Mexico and distributed by Henry Avocado were not subject to the recall and could still be consumed  

LONDON   Three years ago  as Britons were preparing to vote in a referendum on whether to leave the European Union  the Conservative lawmaker John Redwood put forward a proposal  Rather than bet on negotiating a favorable trade deal with its former club  Britain should get ready to simply walk away But Mr  Redwood was an outlier  part of the Conservative Party s euroskeptic fringe The mainstream Brexiteers  who led the campaign for leaving the European Union to victory  assured the public that all necessary agreements would be in place in time for Brexit Britain would still have  access to the single market   promised Boris Johnson  who became the foreign secretary  Even Nigel Farage  Brexit s ideological godfather  had said that  on day plus one  we will find ourselves part of the European Economic Area and with a free trade deal  One of the mysteries of Brexit   one that will be studied by political scientists for generations   is how  for much of the country  a gradualist goal of achieving a less restrictive relationship with Europe was replaced by an extreme and risky one  walking away with no deal at all Many in Britain are deeply alarmed by this prospect  including a majority in Parliament  It would leave most of the country s imports and exports   including a large part of its food supply and much of its medicine   subject to new controls overnight without the infrastructure or people to implement them The central bank has said it could cause the country s worst recession since the 1920s  It would also throw into question the status of an international border that was central to a 30 year armed conflict ImageBoris Johnson  center  Gisela Stuart  then a Labour lawmaker  left  and Michael Gove  then the justice secretary  at a Vote Leave news conference in London in 2016 CreditAdam Ferguson for The New York TimesBut a large part of the population has shrugged off those warnings  A poll released by Opinium on Thursday found that if Parliament rejects Prime Minister Theresa May s deal for a third time  46 percent of respondents would prefer a no deal exit over 39 percent who preferred delaying to allow for a public vote  Mr  Johnson declared in January that a no deal exit  is closest to what people actually voted for   Mr  Farage rolled out the slogan  No deal  no problem  A lot of this shift comes down to frustration  Even now  on the surface  life seems normal in much of Britain  But the psychological state of the country is more fragile after being held hostage for two years by a political process that never progresses  drowns out everything else and has only deepened the divisions exposed by the 2016 referendum  Many people here just want the noise to stop Gisela Stuart  a former Labour lawmaker who was one of the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign  said she didn t even consider embracing a no deal exit until four or five months ago  People like me wouldn t have stood up and said   Please  vote so that  after 40 years of a political and economic relationship  we just walk out     she said   But can you say that  if after two years we cannot manage to negotiate an agreement  we should walk out  Well  maybe  Her frustration  she said  had become almost existential  I ve spent 40 years of my life not needing a watch in the morning because I listen to the  Today  program   the BBC s flagship radio news show  she said  reeling off the exact times  to the minute  of her favorite segments   In the last couple of months I have not been able to bear to listen to it anymore  I switch to classical music  It is relentless speculation  It is no longer news  It is water torture  I can t bear it anymore  The same sentiment has emerged in her constituents  she said   Earlier  they said   We want a trade deal     she said   Now  they say   We just want out    Henry Newman  who campaigned for Vote Leave and is director of Open Europe  a policy group that focuses on Brexit  said he has

delaying for a public vote CreditAndy Buchanan Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesIn recent months  he said   there s now almost an idea that any of these relationships will be a national humiliation   For many ordinary voters  frustration with the process has  led to a sense   Why can t we just walk away     he said   That s in danger of becoming an identity pole  a center of gravity  It s in danger of crystallizing into an identity  Back when Britain voted to leave   no one was talking about no deal as an outcome   said Asa Bennett  who covered the referendum for The Telegraph  the daily British newspaper   The consensus was that of course we d have a deal  It would be patently obvious  It didn t even come on the radar  The notion that a no deal exit was an option was powerfully normalized by Mrs  May herself  as negotiations with Brussels bogged down  and the complexities of removal became more obvious  In a tough talking January 2017 speech at Lancaster House  she adopted a warning that had been used only by a small group of hard line euroskeptic campaigners  She warned that Europe should not try to corner Britain into accepting a  punitive  deal  because Britain would walk away  It represented Britain s main point of leverage  since Europe would suffer severely from a chaotic separation  While I am confident that this scenario need never arise   while I am sure a positive agreement can be reached   I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain   she said  She followed this up by articulating a series of  red lines   promising to exit the customs union  single market and European Court of Justice Mr  Redwood  an anti Europe voice in Parliament for decades  said the Lancaster House speech marked the moment when his group s thinking became fully mainstream  That was the point of the slogan that we got her to adopt   Mr  Redwood said   It was very important  and it wasn t one speech  she said it consistently   He added   In those days  she was advised by Nick Timothy  who was very much on our side  Ms  Stuart  the Vote Leave leader  said that phrase  which was later included in the Conservative Party manifesto  set off a significant shift in public perception   It did mean suddenly that talk of no deal was no longer seen as an extreme position   she said ImageMrs  May in Brussels on Thursday  She powerfully normalized the idea that a no deal exit was an option in a tough talking January 2017 speech CreditGeert Vanden Wijngaert Associated PressIt was one of Mrs  May s most resonant speeches  casting her in the mold of the Iron Lady  Margaret Thatcher  who famously  handbagged  opponents by digging out briefing papers from her purse  a gesture that typically signaled the approach of a political knockout blow Only as the negotiations reached their end point in Mrs  May s withdrawal agreement  though  did the notion of a no deal exit begin to gain currency as a positive outcome  Ms  Stuart said she came to the point reluctantly  out of disappointment with Mrs  May s failure as a negotiator  If you would in your wildest dreams imagine a Tory P M  would put us into this position   no  no my skills as a scriptwriter would have completely failed me   she said Mr  Redwood also said she had failed  giving the European Union the impression that she was bluffing and would not go through with it  You needed to say it to provide leverage  but we also understood that she meant it   he said   Her more recent advisers didn t mean it  The E U  decided we were weak  weak  weak and wouldn t walk away  For the public  said Tom McTague  who reports on Brexit for Politico  the talks have taken on the sting of a national humiliation   and the natural reaction is to say   Well  screw you     You set up these unachievable and conflicting goals  of a perfect trade deal with the E U   pure sovereignty at home and no border with Ireland  and when you are forced to make a choice between them  you resent that choice   said Mr  McTague  author of  Betting the House   a chronicle of Mrs  May s effort to build leverage in the Brexit negotiations by calling a snap election  The inherent complexity of Brexit is causing people to think   Just rip the Band Aid off  I can t think about this anymore  Just rip the Band Aid off  and let s start again  We ll take a little pain

Michael Avenatti  the lawyer best known for representing the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels in her lawsuits against President Trump  arrived in New York on Monday for a negotiating session with Nike executives that he believed could net him millions of dollars Armed with sensitive information  Mr  Avenatti approached the meeting as though he had the upper hand  He left in the custody of F B I  agents Federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed charges accusing him of trying to extort millions of dollars from the apparel giant in exchange for evidence he said he had of misconduct by company employees in the recruitment of college basketball players The arrest of Mr  Avenatti  who in a separate case was charged by federal prosecutors in California with bank and wire fraud  was the latest development in a spectacular fall by a lawyer who is known for orbiting and representing an array of celebrities and who has been central to some of the most salacious headlines about Mr  Trump In court documents filed Monday  prosecutors said that Mr  Avenatti and a client  a basketball coach for a traveling youth team  had threatened a flurry of negative publicity right before a Nike earnings call and the N C A A  men s basketball tournament  Prosecutors said Mr  Avenatti had told Nike that he and the basketball coach  said to be Gary Franklin Sr  of the club team California Supreme in Los Angeles  had evidence that Nike employees had funneled money to recruits in violation of N C A A  rules Mr  Franklin could not be reached for comment The prosecutors said Mr  Avenatti and the coach had threatened to release the evidence in an attempt to damage Nike s reputation and market capitalization unless the company paid them at least  22 5 million Geoffrey S  Berman  the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York  based in Manhattan  said at a news conference that Mr  Avenatti s conduct amounted to a  shakedown  VideoFederal prosecutors accused the lawyer Michael Avenatti of attempting to extort more than  20 million from Nike  Mr  Avenatti is best known for representing Stormy Daniels in her lawsuits against President Trump CreditCreditSpencer Platt Getty Images Avenatti used illegal and extortionate threats for the purpose of obtaining millions of dollars in payments from a public company   he said   Calling this anticipated payout a retainer or a settlement doesn t change what it was   a shakedown  When lawyers use their law licenses as weapons  as a guise to extort payments for themselves  they are no longer acting as attorneys  Mr  Avenatti was released Monday evening on  300 000 bond and under several conditions  including restrictions on travel  In a brief news conference after his release  Mr  Avenatti said he was  highly confident  that when all the evidence was presented  he would be  fully exonerated  and justice will be done  A veteran plaintiffs lawyer  Mr  Avenatti rose to fame in March 2018 when he filed a lawsuit against Mr  Trump on behalf of Ms  Daniels  who said that she had an affair with Mr  Trump and then received a hush money payment leading up to the 2016 election Mr  Avenatti became a fixture on cable news  leveraging Ms  Daniels s case to build his own profile as a foil to Mr  Trump  He was even taken half seriously when he declared that he was interested in making a presidential run in 2020 Ms  Daniels s suit  which sought to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement  was dismissed by a federal judge in California this month  and a separate defamation suit Mr  Avenatti filed against Mr  Trump on Ms  Daniels s behalf was dismissed late last year  The discussion about Ms  Daniels  however  has remained a leading sore point for the Trump administration  as checks made out to her with the president s signature on them were given to Congress last month by his former personal lawyer  Michael D  Cohen  who has pleaded guilty to federal charges Last September  Mr  Avenatti inserted himself into the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M  Kavanaugh  The week before Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed  Mr  Avenatti announced that he had a new client  Julie Swetnick  Ms  Swetnick said that she had witnessed sexual misconduct by Justice Kavanaugh and some of his friends at high school parties in the Washington area in the early 1980s  when she was a college student in Maryland As Mr  Avenatti s national profile grew  so did his legal and financial troubles He was arrested in Los Angeles in November on suspicion of domestic violence  which he called an effort to intimidate him  though he was not charged with a crime  His firm  formerly known as Eagan Avenatti  has repeatedly filed for bankruptcy  most recently on March 7  in Santa Ana  Calif The charging documents in the Nike case refer to an unnamed co conspirator  another lawyer who worked with Mr  Avenatti  That lawyer is Mark Geragos  according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity  citing the sensitivity of the continuing investigation Mr  Geragos  a top celebrity lawyer  is best known in the sports world for representing the former quarterback Colin Kaepernick in his collusion case against the N F L   which was recently settled  He also played a role in Mr  Kaepernick s negotiations with Nike over 2017 and 2018  which resulted in Nike s making Mr  Kaepernick one of its highest paid football endorsers and a face of a new advertising campaign Mr  Geragos did not respond to phone calls or an email seeking comment  Mr  Berman declined to say why Mr  Geragos had not been arrested  He said the investigation was continuing Federal officials announced the charges around the same time that Mr  Avenatti  in a post on his Twitter account  announced that he would hold a news conference on Tuesday to accuse Nike of  a major high school college basketball scandal   In the past week  he has also privately reached out to reporters  telling them that he had explosive information about a major company Last year  two former employees of Adidas were among those convicted of fraud for participating in a similar scheme  outlined by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York  in which families of recruits were paid in exchange for their sons  commitments to college teams sponsored by Adidas In a statement  Nike said it  will not be extorted or hide information that is relevant to a government investigation  Nike has been cooperating with the government s investigation into N C A A  basketball for over a year  Nike said that it had immediately called federal prosecutors when it became aware of the matter and that it had worked with the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner to assist in the investigation According to people with knowledge of the cases  once Nike heard Mr  Avenatti s claims  it acted to inform federal officials of the allegation that the company s employees were paying players  The nature of the discussion with Mr  Avenatti raised the possibility that extortion was taking place In the case filed in California on Monday  Mr  Avenatti was charged with embezzling from a client and with defrauding a bank by using false tax returns to obtain loans Nicola T  Hanna  the United States Attorney in Los Angeles  said the two cases were unrelated  but the authorities in California and New York coordinated to arrest Mr  Avenatti and execute search warrants at the same time In the Nike case  the federal prosecutors said Mr  Avenatti had represented a coach  later identified as Mr  Franklin  whose team recently did not have a contract with Nike renewed  according to the court documents  Mr  Avenatti told Nike that he had evidence that at least three former high school players had been paid by Nike in ways that were intended to be concealed  the documents said California Supreme had three alumni taken in the 2018 N B A  draft  including Deandre Ayton of the Phoenix Suns Mr  Avenatti  according to prosecutors  threatened that he would hold a news conference when it could maximally disrupt Nike  before its quarterly earnings call last week  which coincided with the start of the N C A A  men s basketball tournament  The tournament is among the biggest annual events on the sports calendar  featuring many prominent teams that are sponsored by Nike  like Duke  North Carolina and Kentucky Mr  Avenatti said he would refrain from publicizing his evidence if Nike paid  1 5 million to his client  the court documents said  though prosecutors did not name Mr  Franklin  Mr  Avenatti also demanded that Nike hire him and another lawyer to conduct an internal investigation  for billings worth between  15 million and  25 million  court documents said As an alternative  prosecutors said  Mr  Avenatti said he would accept  22 5 million from Nike for himself and his client in exchange for not releasing the evidence According to the complaint  Mr  Avenatti told Nike that his client s information  if publicized  would ultimately lower the value of Nike stock by billions of dollars  He believed that once he went public  parents  coaches and players all across the country would reach out to him with information about payments that violated N C A A  rules  The company will die   not die  but they are going to incur cut after cut after cut after cut  and that s what s going to happen as soon as this thing becomes public   Mr  Avenatti said in a meeting with Nike lawyers that was recorded for video and audio Nike  Adidas and Under Armour sponsor dozens of basketball teams for high school players that compete mainly in the summer  The equipment companies shower those teams with tens of thousands of dollars in financing and apparel  and also organize huge tournaments attended by the country s most prominent college coaches  More than high school basketball  these leagues represent the hub of recruiting for college basketball programs The 2017 charges of corruption against former Adidas employees and several other figures in

MONTREAL   Fred Sasakamoose thought this day would never come Sasakamoose  the N H L  s first Indigenous player when he skated in 11 games with the Chicago Black Hawks during the 1953 54 season  watched from the Ahtahkakoop Cree Nation in northern Saskatchewan on Sunday night as the Montreal Canadiens battled the Carolina Hurricanes   and heard his own language It was the first N H L  broadcast in Plains Cree  the Algonquian language he grew up speaking  It makes me so proud that they re going to broadcast the game in my language   he said in a telephone interview before the game  I heard people broadcast local tournaments  the Indian Stanley Cup they call them  This evening I am going to listen to the game and understand  because I m a Cree Indian  Sunday s production was born out of discussions between Sportsnet  the league s Canadian national TV rights holder  and the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network  a Canadian cable channel dedicated to promoting the country s Indigenous heritage Community leaders approached Sportsnet last year  wanting to continue the work done at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver  British Columbia  where A P T N  aired 10 hours a day of coverage in a mix of Indigenous  French and English languages  As a group  we discussed how to use hockey and tie it in with the Cree language   said Rob Corte  Sportsnet s vice president of N H L  production   It was a very informative  interesting and emotional meeting  and we left there thinking that we wanted to do something  The broadcasters Clarence Iron  Earl Wood  Jason Chamakese and John Chabot  an eight year N H L  veteran and former assistant coach with the Islanders  called the game from the A P T N  studios in Winnipeg  Manitoba  via a live feed provided by Sportsnet  It s very monumental in that a lot of our people struggle on an everyday basis because of their disconnection from their everyday self   said Wood  who hosted the studio show   A lot of our young people are shy about speaking the language  If they hear it on the mainstream media  we can use this to our advantage for the retention of our language  ImageFrom left to right  John Chabot  Clarence Iron  Jason Chamakese and Earl Wood called Sunday s game between Montreal and Carolina in Plains Cree from the studios of the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network in Winnipeg  Manitoba CreditA P T N One of the biggest challenges for the broadcast team was finding words in Plains Cree that describe the in game hockey events and projecting them quickly enough during the real time action The commentators built their vocabulary during the 2010 Olympics  when A P T N  covered hockey in Cree  They developed words by talking with community elders and Plains Cree speakers  The puck itself  we call it napakiwanis  which is something that is pressed down   Iron said Other terms like kociw  he shoots   osihew pihtokwahew  he scores   kipahwaw  penalty   and tako  overtime  translate more directly from English The game also served as a showcase for the league s most prominent Indigenous player  Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price  whose mother is a former chief of the Ulkatcho First Nation in northern British Columbia  During a stellar career that has seen him become the Canadiens  franchise leader in wins  Price has supported Indigenous youth by hosting them at games  I feel like this game is meant for everybody   Price said this month after winning his 315th career game to pass Jacques Plante for first place in franchise history   It s obviously a league motto  but I definitely have seen that first hand  I think it s important that you need to be proud of where you come from and enjoy the game for what it is  Lining up opposite Price on Sunday was Hurricanes forward Micheal Ferland  who is Cree  The Hurricanes won  2 1  in overtime The trailblazing Sasakamoose acknowledged the hardships that Indigenous Canadians still face  including significantly higher rates of suicide and alcoholism  Nights like Sunday  with Indigenous ice hockey stars showcased on national television in their own language  have the potential to inspire youth and make them proud of the heritage  he added Sasakamoose spent years at one of Canada s notorious residential schools  a government supported program that for a century sought to assimilate Indigenous children by separating them from their families and often forbidding them from speaking their Native languages  This is going to create opportunities for young people   he said   They re going to change the world for our young people by giving them that chance  that someday they too could be the same as the Micheal Ferlands on TV   

WASHINGTON   President Trump and his Republican allies went on the offensive on Monday  vowing to pursue and even punish those responsible for the Russia investigation now that the special counsel has wrapped up without implicating him or his campaign in a criminal conspiracy to influence the 2016 election Mr  Trump  grim faced and simmering with anger  denounced adversaries who have pounded him for two years over Russian election interference  calling them  treasonous  people who are guilty of  evil  deeds and should be investigated themselves   Those people will certainly be looked at   he said On Capitol Hill  the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee announced he would do just that while also calling for a new special counsel to look at the origins of the last one  White House officials and Republican lawmakers demanded the resignation of a Democratic committee chairman investigating the Russia matter  and Mr  Trump s re election campaign lobbied television networks to blackball Democrats who advanced the collusion theory The assertive posture indicated that despite initial calls by Republican leaders to move on after the investigation by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  the president and his supporters were intent on turning the tables on his foes  While Democrats saw the actions as revenge  Mr  Trump s defenders said they wanted accountability for a  witch hunt  that has consumed half of his term  There are a lot of people out there that have done some very  very evil things  very bad things  I would say some treasonous things against our country   Mr  Trump told reporters at the White House   I ve been looking at them for a long time   he added   and I m saying why haven t they been looked at  They lied to Congress  many of them  you know who they are  They ve done so many evil things  The approach  if it lasts  contrasts with those of other presidents who survived major scandals  After the Iran contra affair  President Ronald Reagan happily dropped the subject and focused on arms control talks with the Soviet Union and other issues  After being acquitted at his Senate impeachment trial  President Bill Clinton was just as eager to move on to Social Security and other initiatives But Mr  Trump and his allies on Monday sought to put his adversaries on the defensive and cement the view that Mr  Mueller s report represents complete vindication  Mr  Mueller found no conspiracy between Mr  Trump s campaign and Russia  but he pointedly declined to exonerate the president on obstruction of justice  according to a Justice Department letter to lawmakers on Sunday Mr  Mueller s report has yet to be released  so it remains unknown whether it includes damning new details that question the actions of Mr  Trump or his associates  even if they do not represent a crime  Six House Democratic committee chairmen sent a letter on Monday to Attorney General William P  Barr demanding he provide them the full report by next Tuesday Mr  Trump said on Monday that releasing the report  wouldn t bother me at all   but Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the Republican leader  later in the day blocked a nonbinding resolution   already passed unanimously by the House   calling for the report to be made public  arguing that Mr  Barr should decide Democrats struggled to find a path ahead  with some urging the party to turn its attention to policy differences with Mr  Trump  Speaker Nancy Pelosi has credited such a strategy with fueling last year s midterm election victories and said she opposed trying to impeach the president  unless there s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan   She plans to unveil a health care plan on Tuesday  The report vindicates Nancy Pelosi s judgment of proceeding with deliberateness and caution and focusing on issues that we can deliver for the American people   said Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and a leading liberal voice in the House Republicans faced their own choice  After two years shadowed by Mr  Mueller  Mr  Trump has the opportunity to reset his presidency  but as he strode with new confidence into a post Mueller world  he appeared more intent on payback Stephen K  Bannon  his former chief strategist  predicted that Mr  Trump  is going to go full animal  now that Mr  Mueller has wrapped up  The president  Mr  Bannon told Yahoo News  will  come off the chains  and use the findings to  bludgeon  his opposition Others close to the White House urged the president not to do that but instead focus on his own agenda   The president has a unique historical opportunity  while in his re election cycle  to reconnect to millions of Americans who have assumed he was guilty of serious wrongdoing  due to the unrelenting irresponsible media coverage of fake collusion   said Matt Schlapp  the chairman of the American Conservative Union Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina  who golfed with Mr  Trump in Florida last weekend  agreed   My advice to the president  for whatever it s worth  is that you are probably stronger today than you have been at any time in your presidency   he said  adding   And if I were you  Mr  President  I would focus on what s next for the country  Instead  Mr  Graham said  the president should leave it to him to go after the authors of the Russia investigation  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Mr  Graham announced that he would investigate anti Trump bias at the F B I  and Justice Department and called on Mr  Barr to appoint a second special counsel to study the same issues  By any reasonable standard  Mr  Mueller fully investigated the Trump campaign   he said   You cannot say that about the other side of the story  Mr  Trump s lawyer  Rudolph W  Giuliani  echoed that  saying that the origin of the Russia investigation should be examined   Who made it up   he said on Fox News   It had to come from somewhere  It didn t just come out of thin air  I want to know who did it  who paid for it  who fueled it  Other Republicans piled on Democrats who have vocally asserted wrongdoing between the Trump campaign and Russia  taking aim specifically at Representative Adam B  Schiff of California  the outspoken chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  Has anyone heard from slimy Adam  fullofschiff Schiff today   Donald Trump Jr   the president s eldest son  wrote on Twitter   I mean it must be embarrassing to have have spent the last 2 years as the leader of the tinfoil hat brigade and have it all come crashing down so quick  Kellyanne Conway  the president s counselor  and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the House Republican leader  called on Mr  Schiff to resign as chairman  Schiff has met the standard that he has imposed on other members of Congress of when they should step back from their positions   Mr  McCarthy told Politico   He has exceeded that standard  and there is no question he should step down from the intel chairmanship  The president s re election campaign sent a memo to television producers naming Mr  Schiff and several other Democrats that it argued had  made outlandish  false claims  and should therefore be reconsidered before being booked again The National Republican Congressional Committee moved to use the special counsel s conclusions against vulnerable Democrats who had accused Mr  Trump of colluding with Russia  The committee reached back for a July 2017 tweet from Representative Joe Cunningham of South Carolina  who won one of the most Republican seats now held by a Democrat  Now it s time for Cunningham to put his big boy pants on and apologize to President Trump and his constituents for peddling dangerous conspiracy theories that divided the country   the committee said in a statement As it happened  the one person Mr  Trump made a point of not going after on Monday was Mr  Mueller  who has been on the receiving end of scalding presidential Twitter blasts for more than a year  Asked by a reporter if Mr  Mueller acted honorably  Mr  Trump said   Yes  he did  Yes  he did  Congressional Democrats were not backing off  promising to push ahead with an array of investigations into Mr  Trump  his businesses and his policies  while arguing that Mr  Mueller s scope was relatively narrow and that without seeing all of Mr  Mueller s evidence  there was no reason to adjust course Senator Mazie K  Hirono  Democrat of Hawaii and a member of Mr  Graham s committee  accused Republicans of taking a narrow minded victory lap  The pattern of the Republicans is very clear that they continue to play up to the president   she said   That is a pattern  They don t want to look into his activities  They make excuses to him  They support everything he does and it continues  Mr  Schiff  for his part  said he  would not be intimidated  by the Republicans and stood by his comments about public evidence of collusion  He did concede that after reading Mr  Mueller s full report he would probably need to reorient the Intelligence Committee s inquiry into possible foreign influence over the president  We have a constitutional obligation to make sure that the president and the people are not compromised by a foreign power  and that s what we intend to do   he said

WASHINGTON   Over the 22 months of their inquiry  Robert S  Mueller III s investigators examined countless documents and interviewed dozens of witnesses  including some of the highest ranking lawyers and aides in the White House  to determine whether President Trump obstructed justice  But in the end  the special counsel reached no conclusion   instead producing a report that merely marshaled evidence on both sides Then  Attorney General William P  Barr  a political appointee whom Mr  Trump installed less than a month ago and who began reading Mr  Mueller s report on Friday  stepped in  With the concurrence of his deputy  Rod J  Rosenstein  Mr  Barr seized the opportunity to render a judgment   pronouncing Mr  Trump clear of committing any criminal offense The propriety of that move by Mr  Barr   who had written an unsolicited memo last year arguing that Mr  Mueller ought not be permitted to investigate Mr  Trump for obstruction of justice   is certain to be a focus of political contention as Congress grapples with what it now knows about the still secret Mueller report Representative Jerrold Nadler  the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  cited Mr  Barr s memo as a reason for suspicion and suggested that Mr  Barr s action may amount to a  hasty partisan interpretation of the facts  Reiterating demands to disclose the special counsel s report itself and saying he would seek testimony from Mr  Barr  Mr  Nadler added   I would in fact wonder if the attorney general pressured the special counsel into not making that finding so he could make the finding  But Mr  Barr s clearing of Mr  Trump will arm Republicans with fresh arguments to dismiss Democrats  inquiries as politically motivated  The top Republican on the Judiciary Committee  Representative Doug Collins of Georgia  urged Mr  Nadler to drop issues that Mr  Mueller s report covered Mr  Trump s lawyers had believed that out of all the issues Mr  Mueller examined  the president faced the most criminal exposure from the obstruction investigation  Mr  Mueller had investigated a range of the president s actions as possible obstruction  pressuring James B  Comey  then the F B I  director  to drop an investigation into Michael T  Flynn  Mr  Trump s first national security adviser  firing Mr  Comey  and the president s lawyer dangling pardons to witnesses The pattern of behavior raised the question of whether Mr  Trump had violated obstruction of justice laws  which make it a crime to impede an investigation with corrupt intent  Courts have ruled that otherwise lawful actions can be such a crime if the motive was malign But investigators never got a chance to interrogate Mr  Trump about his motives  Concerned about his penchant for falsehoods and whether he might perjure himself  the president s lawyers persuaded the special counsel team to accept written answers to their questions ImageListen to  The Daily   Coordination  Not Established  Obstruction

waiting on the star michael barbaroHi maggie habermanIt s Michael Barbaro  host of  The Daily  michael schmidtDoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today   Attorney General William Barr has sent a letter to Congress summarizing the findings of the special counsel investigation  No coordination with Russia  More complicated on obstruction of justice  My colleagues Maggie Haberman and Mike Schmidt explain  It s Monday  March 25  O K  Maggie  like  it is 6 00 p m  on Sunday evening  Two hours ago  the attorney general  Bill Barr  sent a letter to congressional leaders outlining the major conclusions of the special counsel s report michael schmidtThe report is broken into two parts  The first one is on the biggest  most central question that has surrounded the president since he was elected  What are the ties between his campaign and Russia  And on that issue  Barr is unequivocal michael barbaroWhat does he say michael schmidtHe says there are no ties between what Russia did in the election and Trump s campaign  That despite how aggressively the Russians tried to interfere in our election  and even outreach that they made to the campaign  they were able to find no evidence that they actually worked together michael barbaroBut Mike  help me understand this  In the lead up to the report  the Mueller investigation issued a number of subpoenas and charges that felt like they revealed forms of collusion  I m thinking about Papadopoulos  Manafort  a meeting inside Trump Tower that involved the president s son and his son in law  Those all felt like forms of collusion michael schmidtI think that what went on was that the Trump campaign was sort of collusion curious in the sense that they were open to sort of talking to anyone about anything  And the Russians were reaching out right  And that meant that there were a lot of odd contacts that occurred  What I think Mueller and Barr are saying is that even though a lot of that stuff looks funky  we have no evidence that they linked hands and tried to work together to hurt Clinton michael barbaroSo collusion curious does not equal coordination maggie habermanNo  Being interested in getting information is something that you have heard either the president say or people around the president say  You know  of course  we took these meetings  Of course when people reached out to us  we listened to them  Who wouldn t  Their argument has been that they were just doing what anyone would do  And the other argument they ve made repeatedly is that they were too discombobulated and too green and too new at this to even know how to collude  And as someone who covered that campaign  I can tell you there is some logic to that argument michael barbaroAs somebody who s slightly more removed from the day to day of this investigation than either of you  it s starting to feel from this summary from Bill Barr of the Mueller report that what the investigation found was what we all kind of knew the investigation found as it was finding  That there was nothing all that big being held back  And that helps us understand this conclusion maggie habermanWhat we saw in indictments either of Paul Manafort  or of his deputy Rick Gates  who pleaded guilty  or of Mike Flynn or George Papadopoulos  this might have been  it seems  all there was  This was all the information that they were able to prove existed michael barbaroMike  what do you think of that michael schmidtLet s go back and look at the indictments and guilty pleas  George Papadopoulos  a campaign official who had contacts with individuals who said the Russians were going to be releasing information about Hillary Clinton s emails before it came out  When George Papadopoulos pleads guilty  he does not plead guilty to conspiring with the Russians  He pleads guilty to making false statements to investigators about that contact  The president s former national security adviser  Michael Flynn  has these odd phone calls with the Russian ambassador during the transition in which they discuss lifting sanctions that have just been imposed by the Obama administration for election meddling  When Mike Flynn goes into court to plead guilty  he doesn t plead guilty to conspiring with the Russians  He pleads guilty to making false statements to the F B I  about it  So as we went along in the investigation over the past 22 months  we never saw charges that said that the campaign conspired with Russia  There was some question   was Mueller holding out something like that until the end  Was he going to wait and then make a move on it  Well  today  we know that they never found anything michael barbaroRight  He wasn t making those kinds of indictments because he didn t have any evidence of it maggie habermanOr at least he didn t have enough to bring an indictment  I mean  he might have found strains of information  he might have found pieces along the way  but it clearly was not enough to bring a charge michael barbaroSo in the end  this was a bunch of people around the president lying  perhaps to avoid what might look like coordination if they were going to tell the truth  but not actually coordinating  according to the legal definition michael schmidtCorrect michael barbaroAnd what about the second question in this letter  the question of obstruction of justice  What does Barr s summary of the Mueller report say about that michael schmidtSo the obstruction part is not nearly as clean cut as the collusion section  On obstruction  Barr essentially says that Mueller did not come to his own determination on whether the president obstructed justice  That Mueller could not indict or exonerate the president for that charge  But that left the door open for Barr to say  look  Mueller has not made a determination on this  I  as the attorney general  along with the deputy attorney general  Rod Rosenstein  will make that call  And we do not believe there is a case to be made the president obstructed justice michael barbaroI don t quite understand what s going on here  Why do we think  Mike  that Mueller declined to weigh in on this question of obstruction of justice  Why leave it kind of up in the air maggie habermanThere s not really a full explanation for that  And I m not sure  For the past 22 months  Democrats and a lot of folks in the media have built Mueller up as sort of this paragon of justice  and someone who was willing and able to go out and make determinations and calls on really tough issues in non partisan  follow the facts ways  And here  we have Mueller essentially saying  I don t really have a determination on it  For each of the relevant actions  the letter says  that were investigated  the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the special counsel views as  quote   difficult issues of law and fact concerning whether the president s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction   The special counsel states that  quote   while this report does not conclude the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  michael barbaroLet s pick apart what I think we can all agree is the most salient example of this  where maybe disentangling motive and law and obstruction of justice is really tangled up  And that would be the firing of James Comey  The president at first says it s not about Russia  then goes on television  says  it really is about Russia  And yet we all know that the president can pretty much fire anyone at that level if he wants to  Is that what Bill Barr  in summarizing Mueller  is saying  That this stuff is just really difficult  and so we re not making a call maggie habermanMueller is saying this is really difficult  and it s hard to get in the president s head and know what his intent was and his frame of mind was  And he decides that he is not going to be the one to make that call  Bill Barr  not wanting  I think  to leave this as an open ended thing puts a pin in it and says  this is done michael barbaroAnd says  I will make that call maggie habermanI will make that call  And we do not believe that this is sufficient to say that the president obstructed justice  And remember  obstruction of justice was key to Richard Nixon  This was a piece that the president s folks were worried about  They had felt really confident the whole time that there would not be an evidence based case of conspiracy related to Russia  But they were concerned about what it would find on the obstruction piece michael schmidtInterestingly   and I still don t think this issue has gotten enough attention   the central question here was the president s intent when he took actions like firing Comey  But at the end of the day  the president of the United States never sat for an interview with investigators to answer those questions  So here you have the attorney general saying  this thing is done  but we ve never heard from Donald Trump on it  And the reason we never heard from Donald Trump on it was that his lawyers were so afraid that if he sat down to answer questions  he would make a factually inaccurate statement and would increase his criminal exposure michael barbaroAnd it s within the president s rights not to sit down for such an interview michael schmidtThat s not true  The Justice Department could have subpoenaed him for an interview michael barbaroBut why didn t they michael schmidtOne of the unanswered questions in this  But in an investigation where the central question was what was the president s intent  Bob Mueller was never able to ask him that question michael barbaroBut he wasn t able to ask him the question because he never issued a subpoena  He never pursued all legal avenues maggie habermanWe don t know whether he pursued a legal avenue and was told that there wasn t sufficient anything to go get a subpoena  or whether he just didn t seek one  And that is  to me right now as we sit here  an open question  I don t know whether Bob Mueller actually sought to go after this subpoena  which a lot of people thought that he would do  We re not going to know for some time michael schmidtBut what we did learn on Friday when Barr first announced the end of the Mueller investigation was there was no instance in the investigation where Mueller wanted to take a major step  like indict someone  or subpoena them  or get a search warrant  in which he was told by his superiors at the Justice Department that he could not do that  So that would sort of bolster the argument that Mueller was not stopped by the Justice Department from seeking a subpoena to interview the president  He s saying there were no instances in which Mueller was stopped from moving forward with something he wanted to do michael barbaroNo matter what  in this moment where so much of this second question of obstruction of justice comes down to the president s motivation  which is essentially a matter of getting into someone s head  never hearing from President Trump feels very significant maggie habermanIt s a huge deal  Barr lays it out in this letter to Congress about what Mueller s thinking was  where he describes that the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question  And I think what you have there is the president s lawyers have repeatedly offered up explanations for why the president could have been doing something that were not necessarily nefarious or that were not undermining  And the main thing that they have said over and over is  this isn t obstruction because it s all playing out in public  It s not hidden  He has a right to express his views as a citizen of the country  And I anticipate that should we ever see what is in this report  that is going to show up a lot michael schmidtWhen Maggie and I would talk to Rudy Giuliani during the investigation  michael barbaroThe president s lawyer michael schmidtHe would say things like  obstruction of justice and trying to interfere in an investigation is going into a dark alley and threatening to break someone s leg if they cooperate with investigators  It s bribing someone to not testify  But what Giuliani said is that all this stuff is happening out in the open  He s not trying to twist anyone s arm  He s just blowing off steam about the investigation  And what conspiracy is there in that michael barbaroWere either of you surprised by either of these actions outlined in this letter when it comes to obstruction of justice   by Mueller declining to make a call  or by Barr being so quick to make a call maggie habermanI was not surprised that Mueller didn t make a call  I was surprised that Barr moved so quickly  I did not think that the collusion aspect of this letter was going to be revelatory  but I did think that the obstruction one possibly would be  And it shuts it down definitively  There is a piece of the letter that we haven t talked about  which is that Bill Barr  the attorney general  tells Congress that Robert Mueller  the special counsel  recognized that  quote   the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference  And that while not determinative  the absence of such evidence bears upon the president s intent with respect to obstruction   So a big piece of the thinking for Barr seems to have been that since there is not an underlying crime that was found related to the president  that obstruction is harder to prove michael barbaroIn other words  there is a connection between these two questions  Between coordination and obstruction of justice  That if there was no coordination  if there is no original sin  then it s hard to establish that there was obstruction of justice maggie habermanRight  If there is no crime that was committed  it is hard to suggest that the president was trying to obstruct justice in the course of pursuing evidence about that crime  And that is an argument that Mike and I also heard the president s lawyers say repeatedly  which was that there couldn t be obstruction of justice because there s nothing to obstruct michael barbaroDoes that seem like universally sound legal logic  That you can t commit a crime in obstructing investigations into something that wasn t a crime  Because it certainly feels like if someone s investigating me  and I decide to stop the investigation in violation of the law  that that could be itself a violation of a law  separate and apart from whether or not what I was being investigated for in the first place was a crime  I mean  are those two things necessarily connected michael schmidtI think there s two reasons why the Justice Department would not want to bring a case like this  The first is that if there s not an underlying crime  then do you really want to bring an obstruction case  Do you really want to go to court to try and convince a jury that someone took actions where there was nothing to cover up  I think that s a tough case to make  The second thing is that while the president huffed and puffed a lot about this investigation  I m not sure how much real damage it did to it  Bob Mueller was able to pursue his inquiry  He was not fired  They finished what they had  They weren t impeded by the Justice Department  So what was the real damage  If the president was obstructing  how did he really hurt the investigation  Give me the damage report  And I don t think at the end of the day there was that much that actually hurt Mueller s team s ability to do their job  It may have been loud  it may have been annoying  it may have been dispiriting  But I think they were able to pursue what they needed to maggie habermanI think  also  there s a third point  which is that I think that Bob Mueller was very mindful that he was dealing with the presidency and the damage that an ongoing case like this  if it was iffy  and not locked solid  not completely nailed down  could cause not just the office of the presidency  but the kind of trauma that brings to a country michael barbaroI m very struck as we re talking  Maggie and Mike  that  at least according to this letter  this is exactly what we have had in front of us all along maggie habermanUnless the report has a lot of information that we re not seeing  what we saw play out publicly is what was there  The attorney general made clear that this investigation was ending without a recommendation of more indictments  That includes sealed indictments  This is what we re getting  It will now move to Capitol Hill  and Democrats will seek to get as much material as they can  But in terms of the part the president was really concerned about in terms of Mueller  that is over michael barbaroSo let s talk about what Congress is going to do now  Congressional leaders have just received this letter  Mike  you have told us in the past that Democrats were going to be very cautious in how they proceeded under any circumstances  And that if Mueller didn t find the sort of thing that would force even Republicans in Congress to acknowledge that the president had violated the law  impeachment proceedings would be very unlikely  And it seems like this letter is not at all what Democrats would have needed to move forward in that sort of way michael schmidtI think it takes a lot of wind out of their sails  They basically have full blown investigations into obstruction and collusion going on  And here  you have Mueller  someone who has far better tools than they will ever have to investigate  coming out and clearing the president on the Russia issue and giving a mixed message on obstruction that allows Barr to clear him there  It gives the Republicans a very good argument to say  why are you guys continuing to look at these issues  Why are you continuing to rummage around in the president s life when we ve received clarity on this from the Justice Department  So I think it hurts them maggie habermanI think that you re going to see Nancy Pelosi  the Democratic House speaker  proceed carefully  As of late evening Sunday  she still had not said anything about how she was going to handle this  And I think that you are going to see a lot of Republicans reminding Democrats that they were holding Robert Mueller up as this avatar of credibility when the investigation was going on  so that it is hard to now say  we need to know more  because we need to make a determination that he couldn t  That will almost inevitably look very political michael schmidtSo the Democrats are going to ask for everything that Mueller had in the report  And it s clear from the letter that a lot of obstruction of justice issues were looked at and detailed and analyzed  And the question is that if the Democrats get their hands on that  how damaging is the obstruction stuff  And is it strong enough to give Democrats more of an oomph on their obstruction investigation michael barbaroIs it both of your understandings that Congress will get a full copy of the Mueller report that they can then examine for these answers maggie habermanI don t think that s been resolved yet michael schmidtThat s the big question michael barbaroMaggie  after months of the president calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt or worse  would it be better now for him to lean into that description or turn around and say  you know  this investigation is the gold star of investigations  and it says I m in the clear maggie habermanThere are a lot of people in the White House who are encouraging the president to turn and say  this was a highly respected prosecutor who just said there was no collusion  And I hope we can all accept this and move on  and try to strike a healing note  It is the president s political instinct to burrow into his base and say  this was a witch hunt  this was a hoax  And that is what I have heard a number of his advisers say publicly in the last few hours  It s what his son said in a statement that he gave me  I think they are going to go full on by telling people this was a waste of two years  This was an effort to undo an electoral result in 2016  and don t let this happen again michael barbaroAnd I wonder if you can explain for listeners why it wasn t what you just said the president might call it   a waste of two years  A waste of everyone s time and an effort to politically undermine him maggie habermanIt might have had the effect of undermining him  That might have been one of the impacts  But we do know  based on numerous assessments from the intelligence community  that Russians did seek to interfere in the 2016 election  We do know that there were many contacts between Russians and people involved in the Trump campaign  So trying to find out what was at the heart of that  one would think  was not a waste of time  And now there is an answer  There is a world in which the president could say  this gave me a clean bill of health  and now you can trust me going forward michael barbaroMike  I want to ask you the same question  What is your explanation for why this investigation was not a waste of time michael schmidtWell  there were legitimate issues and questions that had to be answered  And along the way  the president took action after action that only made the perception that he did something wrong worse  He fired the F B I  director  He asked the F B I  director to end an investigation into whether his former national security adviser was talking improperly to the Russian ambassador  He said things publicly about the investigation time and time again to demonize the investigators  He criticized his own attorney general  who recused himself from the Russia investigation  He called Mueller s team a bunch of angry Democrats  He made the perception worse  And there were things that he did that walked up to the line of obstruction and had to be looked at  that had to be sorted through  Whether it was to clear the president and say  hey  look  he did nothing wrong  for his sake  or to give the public some confidence that the president of the United States was not a Russian agent michael barbaroSo among the questions that had to be answered in an investigation into Russian interference in our election  regardless of the answer  was what was the president s role in this  And it happens to be that the answer was seemingly nothing illegal  But that answer had to be unearthed michael schmidtA significant portion of the country thought that the president of the United States either wittingly or unwittingly had worked with a foreign adversary to influence the election  That was something that had to be looked into michael barbaroAnd because he didn t do that  Bill Barr also believes he did not obstruct this investigation michael schmidtThere was nothing to obstruct maggie habermanAt least that s what they found michael barbaroNo one asked me  but  maggie habermanMichael  what do you think michael barbaroI think that Russia could never have fathomed just how cosmically disruptive their efforts to influence the election would be maggie habermanI think they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams  yes michael schmidtLook at how distracted we ve been as a country because of this for the past two years  Think about all the other issues that we could have been talking about or looking at  This was an enormous  enormous distraction for the country maggie habermanAnd for Donald Trump michael barbaroMaggie  Mike  thank you very much maggie habermanThank you michael schmidtThanks for having us archived recording  donald trump So after a long look  after a long investigation  after so many people have been so badly hurt  after not looking at the other side  where a lot of bad things happened  a lot of horrible things happened  a lot of very bad things happened for our country  it was just announced there was no collusion with Russia  The most ridiculous thing I ve ever heard  michael barbaroOn Sunday afternoon  on his way back to Washington from his home in Florida  President Trump addressed the major findings of the Mueller report archived recording  donald trump There was no obstruction  and none whatsoever  And it was a complete and total exoneration  It s a shame that our country had to go through this  To be honest  it s a shame that your president has had to go through this for   before I even got elected  it began  And it began illegally  And hopefully  somebody is going to look at the other side  This was an illegal takedown that failed  And hopefully  somebody is going to be looking at the other side  So it s complete  michael barbaroNot long after  the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  Representative Jerry Nadler of New York  disputed the president s characterization of the Mueller report during a news conference in New York archived recording  jerry nadler Earlier today  I received a four page letter from Attorney General Barr outlining his summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report while making a few questionable legal arguments of his own  I take from this letter three points  First  President Trump is wrong  This report does not amount to a so called  total exoneration  michael barbaroNadler seemed to accept Mueller s conclusion that the president did not coordinate with Russia  but seized on less definitive statements made by Mueller and Barr about whether the president obstructed justice archived recording  jerry nadler The attorney general s comments make it clear that Congress must step in to get the truth and provide full transparency to the American people  The president has not been exonerated by the special counsel  Yet the attorney general has decided not to go further or  apparently  to share those findings with the public  We cannot simply rely on what may be a hasty partisan interpretation of the facts michael barbaroThat s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow The outcome was a victory for Mr  Trump s lawyers  who initially pushed the president to cooperate with the investigation but later kept him from sitting down to talk with Mr  Mueller s investigators about what he had been thinking when he took steps that potentially affected the inquiry All that the public   or Congress   knows at this point about Mr  Mueller s findings consists of how Mr  Barr portrayed them in a four page letter he sent to lawmakers on Sunday  Mr  Mueller cataloged numerous actions by Mr  Trump  Mr  Barr wrote   he did not specify but said most were publicly known   and that the special counsel report presented evidence both for and against concluding that Mr  Trump had broken the law But in an unusual move Mr  Barr did not explain  Mr  Mueller left that question unresolved  instead stating that  while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him   according to a brief excerpt from the special counsel report that Mr  Barr quoted  With Mr  Rosenstein s concurrence  Mr  Barr embraced that opening to declare the president broke no law ImageRobert S  Mueller III completed his 22 month special investigation last week CreditCliff Owen Associated Press The special counsel s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime   Mr  Barr wrote  adding that he and his deputy  concluded that the evidence developed during the special counsel s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense  Mr  Barr wrote that his decision that Mr  Trump violated no criminal obstruction of justice laws was not based on the Justice Department s view that the Constitution does not permit a sitting president to be indicted  If he had relied on that theory  it would have left Mr  Trump vulnerable to potential indictment after he left office But Mr  Barr appeared to make implicit reference to other disputed constitutional arguments about presidential power  and whether obstruction laws could be legitimately applied to constrain certain actions by a president  Without spelling them out  Mr  Barr quoted the special counsel report as referring to   difficult issues  of law and fact concerning whether the president s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction  Notably  Mr  Trump s lawyers have taken the position that Congress lacks the authority to constrain in any way how the president exercises his constitutional powers to oversee the executive branch  including deciding whether to direct the Justice Department to close an investigation  to fire a subordinate and to pardon someone  Mr  Barr himself endorsed that view in his June 2018 memo for the Trump administration  when he was still a lawyer in private practice Under that view  even if a president abuses his power by acting for corrupt reasons  it would be unconstitutional for Congress to make that a crime  Many legal scholars dispute that view  but the Supreme Court has never addressed the issue It was hard to know from Mr  Barr s letter what gave Mr  Mueller pause  noted Samuel Buell  a former federal prosecutor who now teaches white collar criminal law at Duke University  Without seeing Mr  Mueller s underlying report  he said  it was impossible to evaluate the merits of both Mr  Mueller s demurral and Mr  Barr s decision to make a definitive statement in favor of Mr  Trump  We really need to see what this report says   we need to see the analysis   he said  adding   How much of this is Mueller and how much of this is Barr  And certainly it seems a relevant fact to consider that Barr just happens to be someone who  before he became attorney general  had gone on record as someone who was skeptical of the obstruction issue  Mr  Mueller s refusal to make any conclusion about obstruction was coupled with a more definitive finding that  the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference  While acknowledging one can be guilty of obstruction of justice even without an underlying crime  Mr  Barr wrote that he and Mr  Rosenstein nevertheless took into account that separate exoneration of Mr  Trump when deciding how to interpret Mr  Trump s intent with respect to obstruction in the evidence Mr  Mueller had gathered Obstruction cases are notoriously difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt because prosecutors have to prove that the defendant was acting with a corrupt intent  and the evidence is often ambiguous Essentially  he wrote  that meant Mr  Trump must get the benefit of the doubt  Mr  Mueller s report  he wrote   identifies no actions that  in our judgment   could be proven in court as an obstruction crime David Kris  who ran the Justice Department s national security division and now heads the consulting firm Culper Partners  said he was struck by the fact that Mr  Mueller failed to reach a conclusion on whether to prosecute Mr  Trump after nearly two years of work  but Mr  Barr  with Mr  Rosenstein s help  decided in a single weekend  It is very unusual to punt on that kind of decision   he said of Mr  Mueller   When we read that report and walked a mile in his shoes  we may be able to assess what he did and why he did it  But I confess that I did find it surprising   

WASHINGTON   President Trump was in the private quarters of his Palm Beach  Fla   club on Sunday afternoon when two White House lawyers briefed him on the details of Attorney General William P  Barr s four page summary of the Russia investigation Mr  Trump  just back from a round of golf  expressed vindication  though no great display of emotion  two people close to him said  An hour later  as he boarded Air Force One to fly to Washington  a very different Mr  Trump emerged Speaking with barely concealed fury  he told reporters   It s a shame that our country had to go through this  To be honest  it s a shame that your president has had to go through this   He denigrated the investigation  led by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  as an  illegal takedown that failed  and said those responsible for it should face scrutiny Mr  Trump s aides warned him not to react to the findings with a sense of triumphalism  people close to him said  But the president  who has long felt victimized by the Russia investigation and the shadow it has cast over his legitimacy  presented Mr  Barr s statements as an unalloyed victory  There was no collusion with Russia   he declared   There was no obstruction and   none whatsoever  And it was a complete and total exoneration   In fact  Mr  Barr s summary quoted from Mr  Mueller s report that  while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  For Mr  Trump  it was a deeply satisfying end to one of the most fraught weekends of his presidency  Like everyone else in the country  he had been forced to wait while in Washington  Mr  Barr and a small circle of officials at the Justice Department pored over Mr  Mueller s report and decided what to make public Mr  Trump s remarks  aides said  were an early taste of how he is likely to react to his new political reality  He plans to attend a rally in Grand Rapids  Mich   on Thursday evening  which will give him a platform to go on the offensive Mr  Trump was already at his club  Mar a Lago  when the special counsel submitted his findings to Mr  Barr on Friday afternoon  The lack of additional indictments was the first indication that the 22 month investigation of the Trump campaign s ties to Russia would not be as damaging to Mr  Trump as many once feared Aides described Mr  Trump as generally upbeat but still preoccupied by what Mr  Barr would decide to disclose  Surrounded by White House aides  Mr  Trump was uncharacteristically silent  staying off Twitter and making no public statements On Friday evening  Mr  Trump and his wife  Melania  had dinner on the patio at Mar a Lago with their son  Barron  and Mrs  Trump s parents On Sunday  the president played golf with three political allies from South Carolina  Senator Lindsey Graham  former Representative Trey Gowdy  and Mick Mulvaney  another former representative now serving as the acting White House chief of staff Early in the day  Mr  Trump broke his Twitter silence  posting  in quick succession   Good Morning  Have a Great Day   and  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN     which could be read as expressions of either hope or growing confidence At 3 p m   Mr  Barr s chief of staff  Brian Rabbitt  called one of the White House lawyers  Emmett T  Flood  and read him the letter that Mr  Barr planned to send to the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees In an unusual staffing decision  Mr  Flood and the White House counsel  Pat Cipollone  accompanied Mr  Trump to Florida for the weekend  They were in constant contact with him about the status of Mr  Barr s deliberations ImagePresident Trump spent his flight back to Washington on Sunday chatting with his staff members  making phone calls and watching television CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesMr  Cipollone and Mr  Flood then briefed Mr  Trump about Mr  Barr s letter as he was preparing to leave Mar a Lago for the airport   This is very good   he said  according to Hogan Gidley  the deputy press secretary The White House does not yet have access to the full Mueller report  Mr  Gidley said  and it was not clear when  or even if  the president would get complete access Minutes after the release of Mr  Barr s letter  the White House issued a statement in which the press secretary  Sarah Huckabee Sanders said   the special counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction  In fact  Mr  Barr said Mr  Mueller chose not to render a judgment about whether the president was guilty of obstruction of justice The White House followed that up with a statement that highlighted three passages from Mr  Barr s letter  that the special counsel found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia  that Mr  Barr found no actions that constituted  obstructive conduct   and that the Justice Department did not find evidence sufficient to  establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense  Mr  Gidley dismissed questions about why the president claimed to have been exonerated when the report did not say that   Prosecutors don t exonerate  they prosecute   he said   They don t prove a negative  That s just silly  The White House quickly went on the offensive  holding a briefing call for a group of surrogates after the letter was released  In an email sent by the White House  Mr  Trump s surrogates were given a detailed list of talking points  including the falsehood that the report served as a  complete and total exoneration  for Mr  Trump The email  which was obtained by The New York Times  said  the president and the administration fully cooperated with the investigation   which is also not entirely true  Mr  Trump declined to ever speak in person with special counsel investigators despite a lengthy negotiation process Kellyanne Conway  the counselor to the president  was among the president s senior aides who took the opportunity to remind the public that what she had been saying all along    no collusion    was correct  Ms  Conway shared a photo to Twitter that showed her holding up one sign that read  Conclusion  Collusion  with the latter word crossed out  and another that said  Illusion Delusion  Ms  Conway said she had been correct on July 13  2017  the day she went on TV and brandished the signs   and many days since  Despite Mr  Trump s threat to go after those involved in the investigation  Mr  Gidley said he had no plans to ask the attorney general to investigate Democrats Mr  Gidley sought to cast the results of the investigation as  a great day for the American people  Their vote for Donald Trump was vindicated  He described an ebullient Mr  Trump  who he said spent the flight chatting with staff members  making phone calls and watching television  In addition to Mr  Mulvaney and himself  he said Dan Scavino  Mr  Trump s social media aide  was in the president s office on the plane Other staff members delighted in watching the coverage on MSNBC  a rare change from Fox News on the presidential aircraft  He s feeling very good   Mr  Gidley said   He s in a really good mood  He s just very happy with how it all turned out  As Air Force One arrived outside Washington  the president was in the cockpit for the landing  

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William P  Barr and his team on Saturday pored over the highly anticipated report by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  a senior Justice Department official said  preparing to deliver the investigation s  principal conclusions  to jittery lawmakers and President Trump as soon as Sunday Mr  Barr and Rod J  Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr  Mueller and oversaw much of his work  were cloistered inside the Justice Department debating how to present the findings  Mr  Mueller was not participating in the process  the official said With little concrete information about the investigation circulating outside that tight circle  Washington was rife with speculation bouncing among reporters  lawmakers scattered across the country for their spring recess and lawyers for people involved in the case Mr  Trump himself remained uncharacteristically silent  After months attacking Mr  Mueller s inquiry as a partisan  witch hunt   he had yet to comment on its conclusion by Saturday afternoon  Spending the weekend at his Mar a Lago estate in Palm Beach  Fla   Mr  Trump was surrounded by members of his family and a larger coterie of aides than usual  He spent much of Saturday on the golf course and had lunch with Kid Rock  according to people familiar with his plans Mr  Mueller delivered his report to Mr  Barr on Friday  signaling the end to a 22 month investigation into Russia s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and any attempts by Mr  Trump s associates to aid them  Mr  Mueller also examined whether Mr  Trump obstructed justice to try to protect himself or his allies from investigators As part of the winding down of his investigation  Mr  Mueller s office was handing off one of its remaining cases  a spokesman said on Saturday  Prosecutors in the United States attorney s office in the District of Columbia will handle the sentencing of Rick Gates  the former Trump campaign deputy who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to investigators and agreed to cooperate with the inquiry Regulations governing the special counsel give Mr  Barr latitude to decide what  if anything  to share publicly  In a letter to Congress notifying lawmakers that he had the report  Mr  Barr said he planned to hand over to them  and by extension the public  a summary of Mr  Mueller s  principal conclusions  as soon as this weekend  He wrote that he  remained committed to as much transparency as possible  Only a few people in the Justice Department had seen the report and a copy had not been given to the White House  said the senior law enforcement official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning The Justice Department appears to be moving quickly  at least in part because it has known for some time that Mr  Mueller was in the homestretch When Mr  Barr was briefed on the investigation this month  he was told that there would be no more subpoenas or indictments  and that Mr  Mueller s team was ready to wrap up in mid March  according to people familiar with the investigation who were not authorized to discuss it  The special counsel s office later notified Mr  Barr that it needed a few additional days to take care of administrative issues  which pushed the delivery to Friday Without certainty about what Mr  Barr would disclose or when  House Democrats convened a 30 minute conference call on Saturday afternoon to line up talking points  Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have begun insisting that only the release of Mr  Mueller s full report and underlying findings will be sufficient so that Democrat led House committees can conduct their own scrutiny of Mr  Trump The top Democrats on nearly a dozen House and Senate committees sent letters on Friday to the F B I   the Justice Department  the White House and other federal agencies demanding that all documents  communication and evidence amassed by Mr  Mueller and his team be preserved because Congress might request access to it  Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents so that the committees can proceed with their independent work  including oversight and legislating to address any issues the Mueller report may raise   Ms  Pelosi wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats before the call During the call  she added that she would reject any offer from the Justice Department to brief the bipartisan Gang of Eight House and Senate leaders or some other configuration of lawmakers in a classified setting on findings that are not made public  according to a person present  Ms  Pelosi said she would insist any briefing be unclassified to allow lawmakers to discuss the full investigative findings publicly Republican leaders convened their own brief call on Friday night  after the Justice Department notified Congress that it had received the report from Mr  Mueller s office  but it was primarily limited to logistics  according to one person with knowledge of the call  Welcoming the news that the special counsel would seek no further indictments  members of the president s party were cautiously optimistic The Republican National Committee circulated talking points to allies on Friday that emphasized Mr  Trump s cooperation with the inquiry and appeared to set the stage for the president and his party to claim political victory  They asserted that  speculation  about interference with the investigation had been proved  dead wrong   It s long past time Democrats drop their politically motivated calls for never ending investigations   said a copy of the talking points  obtained by The New York Times Allies surrounding the president at Mar a Lago found themselves in a similar place  Mr  Trump s lawyers and aides urged him to stay quiet  people briefed on the discussions said  Wait and see what was in the report  and trust that Mr  Barr is not trying to harm you  they cautioned  They assured him that there would be ample time to claim vindication after they knew what was in the report  the people said Mr  Trump appeared to be in good spirits on Friday night when he dined on the Mar a Lago patio with his wife and some of his children But he was circumspect about the end of an investigation that has been a backdrop of his presidency  He told people who greeted him that he was tired  but he still returned to the patio after giving brief remarks at a local Republican Party dinner in the club s ballroom  He sat sipping coffee until fairly late in the evening One friend of Mr  Trump said that despite his outward good spirits  the president remained anxious about the contents of the report and was concerned that its release was taking longer than he expected In recent weeks  Mr  Trump has been canvassing friends and allies for their opinions of Mr  Barr  a long serving Republican legal hand who was confirmed last month  Mr  Trump  people who have spoken with him said  does not know Mr  Barr well or what to expect from him  Do you know Barr   the president has asked others of his attorney general  

WASHINGTON   A day after President Trump reveled in the apparent fizzling of a two year effort to prosecute him for possible illicit coordination with Russia during the 2016 campaign  Washington s most prominent Moscow native arrived at the White House on Monday to celebrate The milestone  A hockey championship Some members of the Washington Capitals  who won their first Stanley Cup title in June  boycotted the White House event in their honor  which included a private tour and a meeting with the president in the Oval Office  But not Alex Ovechkin  the team s Russian captain and the National Hockey League s most valuable player  who is also a vocal admirer and personal friend of President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia Mr  Ovechkin was not the only Russian player in the Oval Office on Monday  He was joined there by two teammates  Evgeny Kuznetsov  a forward  and Dmitry Orlov  a defenseman  who were part of a 55 member Capitals delegation  the first from a Washington team to visit the White House since the Washington Redskins won the Super Bowl in 1992  You re champions   Mr  Trump told them  after reading out Mr  Ovechkin s statistics for the season  You have a champion s heart  Braden Holtby  the Capitals goalie and an outspoken gay rights advocate  declined to visit the White House   I ve got to stay true to my values  and I m going to respectfully decline   Mr  Holtby told reporters last week  Two other members of the championship team  Brett Connolly and Devante Smith Pelly  also said they would not attend The irony of the photo op  in which Mr  Ovechkin stood smiling behind the Resolute Desk next to Mr  Trump  wearing a red tie that matched the president s signature look  wasn t lost on some former White House officials  Perhaps the only time Russians have visited the Trump White House with bipartisan support in D C    said Andy Hemming  a former White House staff member ImageAlex Ovechkin  the Capitals  captain  with the Stanley Cup last year CreditNick Wass Associated PressAnother former aide pointed out that the White House was a natural place for the Stanley Cup to visit  after Mr  Ovechkin took the trophy on a tour of Moscow s Red Square last summer Mr  Ovechkin has said he is an apolitical sports star  But questions about his connections to Mr  Putin  and whether he is a participant  knowingly or unknowingly  in a Kremlin propaganda machine  have swirled around his career  They peaked when Mr  Ovechkin announced last year the creation of a  civic movement  that he branded online as  putinteam  ahead of Russia s elections Mr  Ovechkin  who received a wedding gift from Mr  Putin and reportedly has his personal phone number  insisted that the hashtag and the campaign were simply his own project  involving no input or signoff from Mr  Putin s government  There were questions  however  about whether a public relations firm with Kremlin connections was involved The three Russians on the Capitals have said their concern is providing entertainment and escape  not influencing global leaders   A real sport  like art  always brings people together   Mr  Kuznetsov said in a recent interview with the Russian news media   And the better we play  the more people will get away from political and other news  But the optics of Monday afternoon s event recalled another Oval Office meeting Mr  Trump took with Russians  in May 2017  At that meeting Mr  Trump told Sergey V  Lavrov  the foreign minister  and Sergey I  Kislyak  then the Russian ambassador to the United States  that firing the F B I  director at the time  James B  Comey  took  great pressure  off him That conversation reinforced the belief that Mr  Trump had fired Mr  Comey because of the F B I  s investigation into possible collusion between Russian operatives and the campaign   a move that would have potentially implicated him in another crime  obstruction of justice But as the Capitals players balanced the Stanley Cup on the Resolute Desk  another  great pressure  seemed to have been relieved  On Friday  the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  concluded his two year investigation  and in a four page letter to congressional leaders released on Sunday night  William P  Barr  the attorney general  said the investigation had ended without finding any collusion with the Russians Mr  Ovechkin thanked the president for hosting his team and promised to try to win the Stanley Cup again this season  

The first black woman to serve as a police chief in Virginia said Monday that she was forced to resign last week by a group of racist officers who opposed her efforts to change the culture of the Portsmouth Police Department The former chief  Tonya D  Chapman  said in a statement that when she took the job in 2016  she knew about  public friction  between city leaders and  the external strife that existed between the community and the Police Department as a result of several officer involved shootings  But she said those tensions soon reached a boiling point when a former officer  Stephen Rankin  was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in August 2016 in connection with the 2015 shooting death of an unarmed black teenager  William Chapman II  who was not related to the former chief  Mr  Rankin was sentenced to two and a half years in prison and was released in November After Mr  Rankin s conviction   racial tensions within the Police Department became blatantly apparent to me   Ms  Chapman wrote  That included deeply held prejudice among  a small contingency of the Police Department   which serves a city of about 95 000 people in Southern Virginia that according to census data is more than 52 percent black A spokesman for the Police Department did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday  Having been a member of two other law enforcement agencies  I have never witnessed the degree of bias and acts of systemic racism  discriminatory practices and abuse of authority in all of my almost 30 year career in law enforcement and public safety   Ms  Chapman wrote   I am acutely aware of the differences in the officers  attitudes and demeanor  therefore  I was determined to change this culture  Efforts to reach Ms  Chapman on Monday were unsuccessful In her statement  she said that most of the officers on the force supported her reform efforts  But she said she also witnessed racism on the job that was  so inflammatory  that she declined to describe it publicly  out of concern for public safety   She said she would share her recollections with  the appropriate governmental entity  if called to do so The former chief said she faced especially deep hostility from  members of a highly influential fraternal organization   which she declined to name  who resisted her efforts to change the department  My goal was to develop a highly ethical  high performing organization that embraces diversity and treats everyone with respect and dignity   she wrote  Recently  she said  some of her opponents in that effort  were dealt with in accordance within the disciplinary policies of the Portsmouth Police Department   As with any organization  there were officers in the department that did not like my style of leadership and did not want me to hold them accountable for their actions   she wrote   Some quite frankly did not like taking direction from an African American female  Ms  Chapman said her tenure as police chief came to an abrupt end because her opponents on the force appeared to have succeeded in influencing the city manager  L  Pettis Patton  The city manager  whom Ms  Chapman described in her statement as  a mentor and a mother figure to me   did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday The former chief said she was summoned last week to Dr  Patton s office  where the city manager read her a written statement that said she had lost the confidence of the Police Department  Ms  Chapman said the city manager then threatened to fire her if she did not resign  which would allow her to collect two months of severance pay  Citizens of Portsmouth  I ask you   Ms  Chapman wrote   if I had done anything to warrant my immediate dismissal  would I have been offered a severance  Dana Woodson  a spokeswoman for the City of Portsmouth  said on Monday   We will not be providing any information  This is a personnel matter  The Police Association of Virginia declined to comment on Ms  Chapman on Monday  and the Southern States Police Benevolent Association did not respond to messages seeking comment Dana G  Schrad  the executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police and Foundation  said the organization does not comment on the personnel matters of individual police departments  All I can say is this   she wrote in an email   The public s demands on police professionals  and especially the chief of police  are extraordinary  and we are disappointed to hear of Chief Chapman s departure from the Portsmouth Police Department   

ROME   Cardinal Godfried Danneels of Belgium  a liberal supporter of Pope Francis and a former Vatican adviser whose long pastoral career was damaged in a sex abuse scandal after his retirement  died on March 14 at his home in Mechelen  north of Brussels  He was 85 A spokesman for the Archdiocese of Brussels Mechelen  which Cardinal Danneels had led for three decades  confirmed the death  No specific cause was given Cardinal Danneels  who spoke several languages  was considered a progressive in Roman Catholic leadership  supporting a greater role for women in the church and a less rigid policy against contraception  He believed that H I V  positive people should be able to use condoms rather than risk transmitting the virus Years before Pope Benedict XVI shocked the world by retiring in 2013  Cardinal Danneels had raised the possibility of popes retiring in advanced age or when their health deteriorated He was a target of conservative critics in his 29 years as president of the Belgian Bishops  Conference  They complained that he had not done enough to thwart growing secularization in Belgium  whose government has approved same sex marriage  in vitro fertilization  euthanasia and experiments on human embryos Cardinal Danneels s reputation was badly hurt shortly after he retired in 2010  when Belgian newspapers released recordings of a secretly taped conversation in which he was heard urging a victim of serial sexual abuse by a bishop to say nothing about it for a year  until the bishop   the victim s own uncle   could retire  The bishop was Roger Vangheluwe  who was 73 at the time On the tapes  which church authorities confirmed were accurate  Cardinal Danneels told the victim   The bishop will resign next year  so actually it would be better for you to wait  I don t think you d do yourself or him a favor by shouting this from the rooftops  The cardinal was then heard warning the man against trying to blackmail the church and suggested that he accept a private apology from the bishop and not drag  his name through the mud  The victim responded   He has dragged my whole life through the mud  from 5 until 18 years old   and asked   Why do you feel sorry for him and not for me  After the tapes  release  the police interrogated Cardinal Danneels for hours and raided his home and the church s offices in Mechelen  searching for indications that archdiocese officials might have concealed evidence of pedophilia ImageCardinal Danneels leading a memorial Mass for Pope John Paul II at the Cathedral of St  Michael and St  Gudula in Brussels in 2005  He was on a rare diplomatic mission to China when John Paul II died CreditVirginia Mayo Associated PressThe nephew ultimately exposed Bishop Vangheluwe  saying he had been abused for 13 years  The bishop resigned in disgrace  A year later he admitted to having abused a second nephew The revelations prompted hundreds of people to come forward  claiming that they  too  had been victims of priests  plunging the Belgian church into deep crisis  one being replicated in countries throughout Europe as reports of sex abuse spread No legal action was taken against Cardinal Danneels  but the scandal left him tarnished as having tried to protect a sex offender The episode was not the first time he had had to deal with sex abuse charges against members of the clergy  In the late 1990s he established an independent commission to support the victims of abusive priests after the police had verified the allegations of a 12 year old against a pedophile priest  The archdiocese had to pay damages to the boy Godfried Maria Jules Danneels was born on June 4  1933  in Kanegem  in rural western Belgium  the oldest of six children  His parents were schoolteachers He studied theology at the Higher Institute of Philosophy of the Catholic University of Louvain in 1954 and received his doctorate from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1961  He started teaching theology at the Flemish Catholic University of Louvain in 1977 He was ordained a priest in 1957 and named the spiritual director of the main seminary of Bruges two years later  Pope Paul VI made him bishop of Antwerp in 1977 at age 44  He became archbishop of Mechelen Brussels in 1979  Pope John Paul II made him a cardinal in 1983 Cardinal Danneels was an adviser to the Vatican secretary of state and helped oversee the appointments of bishops  He was on a rare diplomatic mission to China in April 2005 when John Paul II died  and he had to cancel a meeting with the deputy premier to return to Rome After Benedict s retirement  Cardinal Danneels was an active supporter of Pope Francis  whose election he had long favored  Years before the last conclave  he told me that the church needed a Francis as head of the church   Geert De Kerpel  spokesman of the Archdiocese of Mechelen Brussels  said in a phone interview After his retirement  Cardinal Danneels spent his time with friends and acquaintances  praying and reading literature   what he held most dear to his heart   said Cardinal Jozef De Kesel  his successor as archbishop of Mechelen Bruxelles  in a statement announcing his death He is survived by two sisters  a brother and many nieces and nephews In a telegram of condolence  Francis called Cardinal Danneels a  zealous pastor  who had been  attentive to the challenges of the contemporary Church   

President Trump s proposed reversal of decades of American policy on the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights has more to do with Israeli politics than American interests   or good sense  On Thursday  he announced on Twitter that the United States should recognize Israeli sovereignty in the disputed Golan Heights  on Israel s border with Syria  even though no other country has done so  The United Nations has declared that official annexation of the territory would violate international law Mr  Trump created a controversy where none needed to exist  Israel has been under no pressure to end the occupation of the Golan  which began during the 1967 Arab Israeli War with the seizure of some 400 square miles by Israeli troops  But Israel s prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  is facing a tough re election fight  and he has pleaded with Mr  Trump to make the move  The tweet bolsters his claim that he can best keep Israel safe because of his close ties to the White House  Support for Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights would also give Israel s right wing parties an opening to argue for Israel s annexation of the West Bank  Such a move would crush any remaining hope of Palestinian statehood and put Israel s future as a Jewish democracy at risk  Even the liberal group Americans for Peace Now  while opposing Mr  Trump s policy shift  said that Israel has legitimate reasons to maintain its hold on the Golan Heights for now  because  Syria is in shambles  swarming with belligerent extremist groups  and Iran has gained a foothold there in the course of Syria s horrific civil war   For decades  the United Nations and the United States refused to officially recognize Israel s seizure of the Golan Heights or the West Bank  on the ground that the boundaries of Israel and any new Palestinian state must be negotiated  In 1981  when Israel claimed to have annexed the Golan Heights  the Reagan administration retaliated by suspending a strategic cooperation agreement with Israel  The two countries reached another military cooperation agreement two years later But since the Syrian war began in 2011  with Iranian and Russian military forces intervening in support of the Assad regime  pressure on Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights has dissipated As has become a pattern  there was no sign that the new policy went through any formal review before the president announced it  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  visiting Jerusalem in a show of support for Mr  Netanyahu before the April 9 election  appeared surprised by the timing of Mr  Trump s tweet  Hours before  Mr  Pompeo had told journalists that America s policy on the Golan Heights had not changed Recognition of Israel s claim to the Golan Heights was the latest in a series of decisions  like moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and abrogating the Iran nuclear deal  that demonstrated the administration s unwavering support for Israel s conservative government  Mr  Trump fancies himself a tough negotiator  but he has given away this valuable American diplomatic leverage  built up by previous presidents across decades  in exchange for nothing of benefit to the United States  Mr  Netanyahu  his Israeli supporters and pro Netanyahu members of Congress applauded the decision  Mr  Netanyahu will be in Washington next week  where he will meet with Mr  Trump and attend the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  the pro Israel lobbying group Unsurprisingly  the European Union  once America s closest ally on Middle East issues  announced that it would not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Leaders in Syria and Iran condemned Mr  Trump s decision  and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey warned that it brought the region to the brink of crisis  Syria vowed to take the territory back Effectively endorsing the forcible expropriation of Syrian land will certainly make it harder for the United States to continue credibly opposing Russia s 2014 annexation of Crimea  In general  though  the response was more muted than it might have been in the past  before Arab leaders decided they were more interested in having Israel as a partner against Iran Mr  Trump  facing his own re election in 2020  no doubt hopes his decision will build support among his base of pro Israel evangelicals and American Jews  It s more likely to exacerbate growing divisions among Americans over his administration s unwavering support for Mr  Netanyahu and its damaging effect on American interests RelatedMore

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William P  Barr s summary on Sunday of the special counsel investigation keeps the impeachment of President Trump off the table  at least for now  but Democrats vowed to push forward with investigations into every aspect of the presidency and for access to the full report of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III Although Democrats did not dispute Mr  Mueller s conclusion that Mr  Trump and his campaign did not conspire with Russia to influence the 2016 election  they moved quickly to seize on less definitive statements made by Mr  Mueller and Mr  Barr on whether the president obstructed justice Specifically  they said an apparent disagreement between the two men over how to judge evidence collected by the special counsel made it imperative for Congress to scrutinize every detail of the case to ensure impartiality  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  which is investigating whether Mr  Trump obstructed justice or abused power  promptly said he would call Mr  Barr to explain  very concerning discrepancies  in a hearing before his committee Mr  Barr quoted from Mr  Mueller s report in his summary   The special counsel states that  while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him    But then added that he and Rod J  Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general  had concluded the evidence developed by Mr  Mueller  is not sufficient to establish  that Mr  Trump obstructed justice The top Democrats in the Senate and House also urged public release of Mr  Mueller s full report to see that evidence  The fact that special counsel Mueller s report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay   Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said in a joint statement  The American people have a right to know   they added With other congressional investigations of Mr  Trump swirling  the Democrats  stance raised the prospect that they could undertake months  if not years  of scrutinizing federal prosecutors and top officials of the Justice Department   a prospect that echoes Republicans  yearslong pursuit of the federal officials who handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server  Taken together  the investigations still threaten to damage Mr  Trump politically But Republicans  including the president  are already demanding that Democrats accept Mr  Barr s conclusions and move on  They moved swiftly to claim political victory and shift the onus to Democrats to justify their continued scrutiny of the president  Good day for the rule of law   said Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina and the Judiciary Committee chairman in his chamber   The cloud hanging over President Trump has been removed by this report  Representative Doug Collins of Georgia  the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee  was more provocative to his Democratic counterparts Mr  Nadler and the Democrats  he said  had  the chance to rethink his sprawling investigation  which retreads ground already covered by the special counsel and is already a matter of public record  ImageRepresentative Jerrold Nadler of New York  the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  cited  very concerning discrepancies  between the attorney general and the special counsel in the case CreditCraig Ruttle Associated Press I hope he recognizes that what may be political fodder for Democrats may not be good for our country   he added Mr  Trump  who has already denounced  presidential harassment   is certain to amplify that message in the coming months as he shifts more of his attention to his 2020 re election campaign But for now  with their base behind them and views of Mr  Trump largely baked in across the electorate  Democrats said there was no chance the argument would work  They view Mr  Trump s potential wrongdoing as consequential  and after two years of watching powerlessly from the House minority  will not be quick to give up on the oversight they deem essential Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee  ground zero for the investigations and any potential impeachment  convened an emergency conference call for members Sunday afternoon to talk through next steps  Lawmakers were almost uniformly on the same page  one Democrat on the call said  and it only further resolved their intent to fight for Mr  Mueller s underlying work  We re going to move forward with our investigation into obstruction of justice  abuses of power  corruption  to defend the rule of law  which is our job   Mr  Nadler told reporters in New York afterward   It s a broader mandate than the special prosecutor has  His mandate is only for crimes  Mr  Nadler said he rejected Mr  Trump s claim of vindication  and zeroed in on Mr  Barr  whom he described as having prejudged the matter of obstruction  He auditioned for his job by writing a 19 page memorandum giving a very extreme view of obstruction of justice in presidential power and saying basically no president can commit obstruction of justice   Mr  Nadler said  referring to a memo Mr  Barr wrote in June 2018 about executive authority  Mr  Nadler pledged to use every tool at his disposal to gain access to the full report and evidence   the public release of which Mr  Barr said Sunday raised challenges given grand jury and other sensitive information Mr  Nadler s committee is not the only one scrutinizing the president and his administration  Since they took control of the House  Democrats have been investigating Mr  Trump s businesses  his role in hush money payments during the campaign to a pornographic film actress who claimed to have had an affair with him  accusations of corruption in various federal agencies and other topics  I don t know that any of our investigations depended on the red herring concept of collusion between the Trump campaign and Putin s forces   Representative Jamie Raskin  a Maryland Democrat and former constitutional law professor  said in an interview  referring to a series of ongoing investigations into numerous aspects of the Trump White House and Mr  Trump s businesses The collusion theory is the basis  at least in part  for the House Intelligence Committee s own investigation of Russian election interference  and it was less clear on Sunday how Democrats leading that panel would incorporate Mr  Mueller s definitive conclusion that there had been no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to undermine the 2016 election  Then again  the committee s chairman  Representative Adam B  Schiff of California  had in a sense already built in a response  framing his inquiry as not just about Russia  but any other foreign powers that could have financial or other leverage over Mr  Trump and his associates At least on the question of impeachment   a constitutional remedy so grave it has been pursued seriously against a president only twice in modern American history   the outlook appeared to be clearer  Mr  Nadler and Ms  Pelosi  students of the failed Republican attempt to remove Bill Clinton from office in the 1990s  have warned repeatedly that they would not go down that path unaccompanied by Republicans  Unless there s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan  I don t think we should go down that path  because it divides the country   Ms  Pelosi told The Washington Post two weeks ago   And he s just not worth it  Though Ms  Pelosi did not address impeachment in her statement with Mr  Schumer  Republicans  jubilant declaration of presidential innocence seemed to all but foreclose the kind of defection from his own party that she and Mr  Nadler had said would be necessary  

This article is part of David Leonhardt s newsletter  You can sign up here to receive it each weekday There s a lot of discussion about what the Mueller report says  But almost none of it is based on the actual report  It s based on the Barr letter  And the Barr letter is not an objective summary of the Mueller report Here are my three big takeaways 1  Barr should release much more information William Barr  the attorney general  works for the president  By releasing just a short summary on a matter of such importance  he comes off as a cross between a law enforcement officer and a spin doctor It s certainly conceivable that parts of Robert Mueller s full report   the one that remains secret   would need to be redacted for national security or other reasons  But Barr s four page summary is unacceptable  So is his vague explanation that he will release as much of the report as he can Until we get more information  the most reasonable assumption is that Barr is trying to protect Trump by hiding the full report For more  Neal Katyal  a former Justice Department official who helped write the special counsel regulations  argues that Barr has left out crucial information  including justification for his claim Trump did not obstruct justice  Congress  Katyal writes in The Times   must first demand the release of the Mueller report  so that Americans can see the evidence for themselves  Then  it must call Mr  Barr and Mr  Mueller to testify  2  Trump critics should keep an open mind on Russia  I m obviously not a fan of the president  And I think it s important for all of Trump s critics to accept the possibility   the likelihood  at this point   that his campaign did not work together with Russia in a meaningful way Yes  the Trump campaign seemed shockingly and unpatriotically open to doing so  But that s not the same as following through  Progressives shouldn t go down the Fox News road and start adopting their own factually weak or outright false conspiracy theories  like those involving Barack Obama s birthplace  voter fraud  Uranium One  George Soros  Solyndra and on and on 3  Trump is unfit for office He directed a criminal conspiracy to break campaign finance laws  He has used the presidency for personal enrichment  He has undermined democracy  He has damaged America s global standing  He has lied repeatedly to the American people  He has obstructed justice   Barr s statement to the contrary is brief and unpersuasive  When I wrote a Sunday Review piece earlier this year arguing that Trump had violated his oath of office and should no longer be president  I listed four main reasons  None of them involved the idea that his campaign colluded with Russia The Mueller investigation led to criminal convictions of the president s former campaign chairman  his longtime personal lawyer and his former national security adviser  It added an enormous amount of evidence to the case against Trump s fitness for office  And that s before the Trump administration has allowed the public to see the full results of the investigation   Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  For more  The Mueller report could be full of good news for the president   or it could have found plenty of evidence of collusion that simply didn t rise to the level of a prosecutable crime  Mikhaila Fogel  Quinta Jurecic  Susan Hennessey and their colleagues at Lawfare explain   There is a huge range of conduct and findings that would be consistent with this top line summary   they write Barr s summary doesn t answer why Russia went to such lengths to help Trump win  writes The Atlantic s David Frum   Mueller hasn t provided answers  so much as he has posed a question  The Politico Magazine editor Blake Hounshell asks a related question  What s behind Trump s unique affinity for Russian president Vladimir Putin   It seems quite clear now that Trump did not collude with Putin to game the 2016 presidential election  Why he still seems to want to collude with Putin to reshape U S  foreign policy remains a mystery  Writing in Slate  the legal expert Richard Hasen poses another unanswered question  Why did Mueller not charge Paul Manafort and Donald Trump Jr  for encouraging Russian officials to give them dirt on Hillary Clinton   Mueller s reasoning matters  and we need to see the full report   Hasen writes If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter  you can subscribe here  You can also join me on Twitter   DLeonhardt  and Facebook Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

Good Monday   Want this by email  Sign up here  Mueller s finished  What now The special counsel  Robert Mueller  did not find evidence that President Trump coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election  Attorney General William Barr said yesterday  But the White House still faces legal challenges Mr  Trump claimed victory from the report  which concluded Mr  Mueller s two year investigation into the Russia issue  Especially comforting to the president  Mr  Mueller did not recommend additional indictments of his inner circle The president was not found to have obstructed justice  Mr  Barr added  saying that the special counsel did not find enough evidence  But the report did not exonerate Mr  Trump on this accusation  as Mr  Mueller did not provide a verdict either way Mr  Trump derided the inquiry as an  illegal takedown that failed   and demanded that those responsible for it face additional scrutiny  That triumphalism ran counter to advice from aides But the White House isn t in the clear yet  Congressional Democrats pledged to continue pursuing investigations into Trump and his allies  And prosecutors in New York City are still investigating an array of issues that touch on Mr  Trump s business and political dealings The markets may get a small boost from the end of the investigation  according to analysts who spoke to CNBC China s new trade play  opennessChina s top economic policymakers have promised more market based competition and international trade  in the latest sign that the country is eager to end its trade war with the U S   Keith Bradsher of the NYT writes The promises being made were significant  Officials at the China Development Forum  the country s premier annual economic policy conference  spoke of increasing imports  a desire for more foreign investment and a willingness to allow foreign financial firms to own larger stakes in their Chinese competitors They may sound familiar  however   Chinese officials have said for years that they were ready to allow foreign competitors to enter their market on a more equal footing   Mr  Bradsher writes   The promises made over the weekend in many cases repeated pledges that have been made before  But China now has other reasons to embrace openness   In addition to a trade war that is hitting the country s exporters  China s economy has also been hurt by private sector business leaders who have become increasingly cautious in recent months about making new investments   Mr  Bradsher adds The promises will most likely feature in trade talks  American and Chinese officials are scheduled to hold trade talks in Beijing in the coming days  and another round of talks in Washington the following week ImageBoeing 737 Max planes at a factory in Renton  Wash

which have crashed in recent months   are near It tested a software update  for the Max 8 aircraft with pilots from five airlines over the weekend  the NYT reports  Using flight simulators  the pilots were able to safely land planes suffering from problems believed to have brought down Lion Air Flight 610 last year And the company outlined other software fixes that are meant to eliminate flaws in an automated piloting program at the heart of the crashes  Boeing also said that it would now make two previously optional safety features on the planes free of charge But Boeing is facing heat from

economists worry about broader fallout from Boeing s problems Don t panic  but part of the yield curve invertedThe yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short term government bonds and long term government bonds  Since 1960  every time that it has inverted   when long term rates were lower than short term rates   a recession has followed It happened on Friday More on that from Matt Phillips of the NYT    The yield on the 10 year Treasury note tumbled to 2 44 percent Friday  its lowest level since January 2018  That was just below the 2 45 percent yield on three month Treasury bills     Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has cited the yield difference between three month Treasury bills and 10 year Treasury notes   which inverted Friday   as the most reliable predictor of recession risk     On Friday  the S P 500 fell 1 9 percent  as stock market investors grew concerned about the outlook for economic growth  It was the second worst drop for the market this year  Don t hyperventilate  Some parts of the yield curve have not yet inverted  and experts say the inversion doesn t necessarily predict economic collapse   A model is just a model   Campbell Harvey  a Duke University finance professor  told the NYT   It s not an oracle  It helps us forecast the future  but it might at any point fail  ImageCreditJosh Edelson Agence

ImageCreditRichard Vogel Associated PressCalifornia has long been seen as a leader on climate change  The state s history of aggressive action to reduce air pollution  accelerate the use of renewable energy and speed the transition to a low carbon  climate resilient economy has inspired governments around the world to set more ambitious climate goals But there is trouble on the horizon  and California s climate leadership is at risk Across most of the state s economy  greenhouse gas emissions have been trending steadily down  But ballooning car traffic on city streets and freeways is negating much of that progress  In California  about 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are from transportation  and they are increasing  In some California counties  two thirds of emissions are from vehicles In November  the California Air Resources Board released an update on efforts to reduce pollution from transportation  The numbers were alarming  Despite headlines about California s push for more electric vehicles  pollution from cars is still climbing   With emissions from the transportation sector continuing to rise  California will not achieve the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to meet mandates for 2030   the board warned The solution   Significant changes to how communities and transportation systems are planned  funded and built   the board said Put more directly  in order to solve the climate crisis  we have to solve the housing crisis Numerous climate researchers have a similar conclusion  In an assessment of the carbon footprint of 700 California cities  experts with the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California  Berkeley  including one of us  Dr  Kammen   found that  for most coastal California cities   infill  housing   that is  housing built in urban areas  near transit  jobs and services   can reduce greenhouse gas pollution more effectively than any other option Other research has confirmed this work  and bolstered the case for using denser housing and public transportation as weapons against climate change The relationship between housing and transportation emissions is not complicated  The housing crisis in our cities and job centers   California is short 3 5 million homes  according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute   is forcing more workers to  drive till they qualify   the term used by real estate agents for what a growing number of Californians have to do to find housing they can afford  As cities that are job centers make it hard or impossible to build housing   for example  through de facto bans on apartment buildings in areas zoned for single family homes   people who are priced out move further away  resulting in sprawl that covers up farmland and open space  clogs freeways and increases greenhouse gas emissions Cities With the Most  Super Commuters Of the 100 largest U S  metropolitan areas  these are the 20 with the greatest proportion of residents working full time who spend 90 minutes or more getting to their jobs   Nationally  72 percent of these super commuters drive   Eight of these areas are in California  the San Francisco area has seen the most growth in ultra commuters since 2005         g wiener box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g wiener box  g artboard p     margin 0       g aiAbs     position

shockingly expensive near jobs and transit  cities force low income and working class people to live far away from where they work  Our communities lose their economic diversity  while the abundant opportunities  services and neighborhood amenities of cities are walled off to all but the very wealthy Low density  single family home zoning is effectively a ban on economically diverse communities  Californians need more and better alternatives to cars for transportation  and easier access to walkable communities and affordable housing near mass transit  Of course  we also have to accelerate the electrification of our vehicles  another way to reduce pollution from cars  But  as the air resources board has found  electrification alone cannot happen fast enough to solve the problem  and we need to reduce the number of miles people drive by 25 percent  In his first major speech since taking office  Gov  Gavin Newsom placed solving the housing crisis at the top of his agenda  Under his proposed budget  cities that don t build enough housing will lose state transportation funding  And this legislative session  a bipartisan coalition of California legislators is supporting the More Homes Act  which is sponsored by one of us  Senator Wiener   The bill would override local restrictive zoning by legalizing small to midsize apartment buildings  up to five stories  near job centers and public transportation and set minimum affordability standards for some of those units  The legislation would also help existing renters keep their homes in areas that qualify for new housing  The measures are intended to stem the growth of super commuters   workers who are priced out of areas near their jobs and forced to drive long distances to get to work Cities across the United States face issues similar to those in California  too many of which have largely closed the doors to new residents   only to force them into similar patterns of crushing commutes and worsening pollution Measures like the More Homes Act offer a road map to cities and states that want to address these issues head on  In fact  we d argue that surging interest in urban housing and transportation issues  and the rise of the grass roots Yes in My Back Yard movement that s behind it  is perhaps the most hopeful development in the American climate movement in recent years Unlike many of our climate policy challenges  housing and transit are largely controlled by cities and states  If we can build more momentum for more homes near transit and jobs  we can continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  in

The studios at Fox News  CNN and MSNBC filled with anchors and commentators  waiting for Attorney General William P  Barr to make news on Sunday afternoon with the release of a letter summarizing the findings of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III As the cable teams assembled  NBC News prepared to interrupt a golf tournament and ABC News got ready to break into coverage of a professional video game contest NBC was the first broadcast network to provide details of Mr  Barr s four page summary of Mr  Mueller s far lengthier and still unpublished report  The network s justice correspondent  Pete Williams  stood before the Justice Department headquarters in Washington and simply read aloud from the attorney general s letter to Congress After he was through  Kate Snow  the NBC anchor on duty  said   Some of what you just read cold on the air is a lot of legalese  Mr  Williams scanned the document and found a key sentence about Russia s attempt at meddling in the 2016 presidential election    The special counsel did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts    Mr  Williams said  reading aloud He also said that  while the report apparently did not conclude that President Trump had committed a crime  it also did not exonerate him On CNN at roughly the same time  three correspondents  who were seated side by side  by side  in the network s Washington studio  stared at their phone screens and called out important phrases from the Barr letter Their well meaning efforts were interrupted by the anchor Wolf Blitzer  who read aloud a tweet that had been posted by Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York    The Special Counsel states that  while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him     Mr  Blitzer said Mr  Blitzer ceded the stage to Jeffrey Toobin  the CNN legal analyst  who said that  in his view  Mr  Mueller s report amounted to  total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion  After a fanfare of timpani drums  George Stephanopoulos of ABC broke into that network s broadcast of a professional video game contest at 3 42  a few minutes after NBC had aired its live reading of the news making letter The matter of Mr  Mueller s elusiveness came up during the ABC special report   We never heard from the man in 22 months   Mr  Stephanopoulos said of the special counsel Pierre Thomas  the senior justice correspondent for ABC  nodded in agreement and recalled being told that  Robert Mueller would be the president s best friend  if he found no evidence of collusion  CBS waited until 3 51 to cut into its coverage of the annual men s college basketball tournament with a 90 second report by Paula Reid  a correspondent covering the Justice Department and the White House When a full gamut of panelists appeared on CBS  they were not news reporters  but sports commentators  and they were offering halftime analysis   It feels like it should be more than an 8 point lead for Carolina   Greg Gumbel said of a game between the University of Washington and the University of North Carolina   CBS followed the game commentary with a second report from Ms  Reid and its chief White House correspondent  Major Garrett  also during halftime  Hours before Mr  Barr had provided his rundown of the much anticipated report   which Mr  Mueller had assembled in seemingly leakproof silence over a 22 month period   it was the main fodder for the politically oriented Sunday morning shows and early afternoon cable news programs Chuck Todd led a wall to wall discussion on NBC s  Meet the Press   It included commentary on whether the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O Rourke had jumped the gun at a campaign stop on Friday when he said   This is an unprecedented attack on this country and on our democracy  and we are owed the facts  And if we do not receive them  243 years in  there s nothing that guarantees us a 244th  On  Fox News Sunday   the program hosted by Chris Wallace  Representative Doug Collins  Republican of Georgia  said the president had been proved right in repeatedly saying  no collusion   On the same show  Mr  Nadler called for the release of the entire report and its underlying materials Also in the morning hours  on CNN s  Reliable Sources   the host Brian Stelter asked of whether reporters and talking heads had inflated expectations He seemed to be reacting to an analytical article posted online on Saturday by the Rolling Stone journalist Matt Taibbi  who wrote that the lack of new charges emerging from the report  is a deathblow for the reputation of the American news media   Mr  Taibbi cited instances of overreaching by some reporters and pundits to make his case Mr  Stelter pushed back against that view   Don t be fooled by the partisans who cherry pick the worst mistakes of individual journalists or the craziest ideas from commentators and claim that s the entire media   he said The problem  Mr  Stelter said  lay in the competing interests of  agenda driven columnists  and  journalists who report the news   He put Joy Ann Reid  of MSNBC  and Jesse Watters  of Fox News  in the agenda driven camp  Then he rolled a clip of Ms  Reid suggesting that Mr  Barr may have an interest in covering up the facts  and another of Mr  Watters characterizing the Mueller report as  a knockout blow to the Democrats and the press who say   Collusion  collusion  collusion   The Nixon era reporting led by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post seemed newly exceptional  now that Mr  Mueller s work was done  Mr  Bernstein  a CNN contributor who was a guest on Mr  Stelter s show  praised recent coverage of President Trump and the allegations that have surrounded him  He singled out the journalism of The Wall Street Journal   owned by Rupert Murdoch s News Corporation   as a sign that democracy was working Noting its assiduously reported articles on Mr  Trump  Mr  Bernstein said   It ought to be stressed that the same owner of Fox News published these stories in his paper

covers nearly her entire body and that grows several feet a day   that will spark warranted comparisons to novels such as Salman Rushdie s  Midnight s Children  and Gabriel García Márquez s  One Hundred Years of Solitude  Serpell does not try to charm her readers to death  Her men and women are not cute  except  sometimes  to each other   and they are not caricatures  Even the most virulent racists in  The Old Drift  aren t one dimensional Serpell is a pitiless and often very funny observer of people and of society  She describes polo as  that strange game that seems like a drunken bet about golf and horse riding   A man on a leather sofa is commended for  expertly unlocking that complex apparatus   a clothed woman  She offers this definition of  history    the word the English used

scent that Adriana found both puerile and daunting  The plot of  The Old Drift  is not simple to unpack  The book begins  at the start of the 20th century  at a colonial settlement on the banks of the

WASHINGTON   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in Washington on Sunday for what amounted to a brief campaign swing through the White House  hoping that President Trump s praise and latest gift   recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights   would persuade wavering voters that his diplomatic achievements should offset any worries about his integrity Yet with barely two weeks left until Israel s parliamentary elections  in which he is running neck and neck with Benny Gantz  a retired army chief  a fresh new scandal has embroiled Mr  Netanyahu  delaying his flight to Washington by hours and dogging him even after he arrived Mr  Netanyahu  who will also be leaving Washington earlier than expected after a rocket from Gaza struck a house in Israel  was already facing indictment on bribery and other corruption charges  He now faces two related accusations The first is that he improperly authorized the sale of advanced German made submarines to Egypt without the approval of top military officials  possibly at a cost to Israel s national security  The second is that he engaged in self dealing  through an undisclosed and enormously profitable financial stake in a company that supplied the German builder of both the Egyptian subs and several new Israeli warships The new scandal builds on an earlier one involving the multibillion dollar purchase of submarines and missile boats from the same Germany manufacturer In November  the police recommended charges against four of Mr  Netanyahu s confidants  including his cousin and personal lawyer  over corruption in buying the ships  Mr  Netanyahu was not named a suspect But state prosecutors are said to be considering opening yet another investigation over the latest revelations With Mr  Gantz s allies in the Blue and White party pummeling the prime minister on television Saturday night over the new submarine scandal  Mr  Netanyahu hastily invited himself into the newsroom of Channel 12  a television station he ordinarily treats as a mortal adversary  for his first interview in several years  He was  on my way to the airport   he said  and thought he  would stop by here and shatter this wave of lies  He insisted that his investments had been unrelated to his role in buying submarines for Israel  and that he had sold his stock in the company before those deals were made  The basic false claim is that I made money on the submarines   he said   That is a complete lie  I did not make a shekel  Far from putting the matter to rest  however  the 40 minute television appearance confirmed much of the recent reporting on the submarine scandal and raised troubling new questions ImageBenny Gantz  at the microphone  with other Blue and White party leaders this month  As Israel s parliamentary elections approach  Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz  a retired army chief  are neck and neck CreditTsafrir Abayov Associated PressMr  Netanyahu confirmed that the company on whose shares he had turned a sevenfold profit  clearing more than  3 million  a year after returning to power as prime minister  was in the supply chain of the German shipyard that builds Israel s submarines  He admitted  after dodging the question for some time  that it was he who had told the Germans that Israel would not object to the sale of advanced submarines to Egypt And he acknowledged keeping both Mr  Gantz  who was then the army chief of staff  and Moshe Yaalon  then the defense minister  out of the loop about that decision  Mr  Yaalon is now the No  2 candidate of the Blue and White party  All of Netanyahu s first time revelations connect to one main suspicion   wrote Amos Harel  the military analyst for Haaretz   A cloud of conflict of interest hangs over him  Mr  Netanyahu asserted that the decision not to object to the sale of submarines to Egypt was based on  state secrets  that justified his failure to consult either the military chief of staff or the defense minister But in Washington on Sunday  Mr  Gantz dismissed Mr  Netanyahu s state secrets assertion as ludicrous  The sale of submarines  or to give permission to sell submarines to a neighboring state  this is not a special operation in the middle of the night   he told reporters   This is going to affect us for many years to come  and it cannot but take place through the formal channels   It makes no sense   he added   Why do we have a National Security Council  Why do we have a Ministry of Defense  Why do we have a Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Why do we have so many official committees  if it comes to one of our most important strategic decisions  and we bypass them all by cousins and lawyers  This was not the story line Mr  Netanyahu was aiming for as he headed to Washington  His trip had been carefully orchestrated to remind Israelis  who overwhelmingly admire Mr  Trump  of how effectively Mr  Netanyahu has managed their relationship  At their Monday meeting  Mr  Trump is expected to sign a document formalizing the United States  recognition of Israel s sovereignty in the Golan Heights   a strategically important plateau that Israel captured from Syria in the Arab Israeli War of 1967 but which under international law is considered occupied territory As an added bonus  the White House meeting is to take place on the same morning that Mr  Gantz takes the stage across Washington at the annual gathering of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  ensuring that Mr  Gantz s big debut there is utterly eclipsed Mr  Netanyahu s early departure means that he will abandon plans to take his turn addressing the Aipac meeting on Tuesday  and he will miss talks with congressional leaders and a dinner at the White House with Mr  Trump The Aipac appearance  a yearly ritual for Mr  Netanyahu at which he is accustomed to bathing in the applause of thousands of approving supporters of Israel  had threatened to expose him to some embarrassment  Aipac departed from its studious avoidance of internal Israeli politics recently  after Mr  Netanyahu brokered a deal to bring a racist right wing party into the government if he is re elected  by calling the party  reprehensible  Liberal Jews who object to Mr  Netanyahu s policies and who are concerned that Israel is becoming a partisan issue in the United States  had been pointing to his appearance as a chance to protest  T ruah  a rabbinical human rights advocacy group  urged Jews attending the Aipac conference to walk out on Mr  Netanyahu s speech  while a prominent rabbi  Rachel Timoner of Congregation Beth Elohim in Brooklyn  on Friday called on Democratic leaders to  sound the alarm against  Mr  Netanyahu s policies from the Aipac stage  

LONDON   A cruise ship that set out with more than 1 300 people but became stranded off Norway s coast finally reached the shore on Sunday afternoon  after rescuers launched a harrowing operation in rough weather to evacuate hundreds of people one by one by helicopter More than 890 people   436 passengers and 458 crew members   were left on the 47 800 ton ship  the Viking Sky  as it headed to Molde  a coastal town in western Norway  On Sunday about 4 30 p m  local time  after about six hours of traveling at sea with one tugboat in front and another in the rear  the vessel docked In footage shared on Twitter  cheers and whoops could be heard from onshore  It has reached Molde  everything has gone according to plan   Einar Knudsen  a spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center for Southern Norway  which led the rescue operation  said by phone on Sunday Earlier  some passengers  who were airlifted from the ship s deck  had arrived onshore bruised and battered  the Red Cross said  Passengers told NBC News that many had been hurt by falling objects and shattered glass as waves rocked the ship  Nothing similar has happened before  not in this magnitude   Mr  Knudsen said The ship  which left Bergen  Norway  on March 14  had been scheduled to arrive on Tuesday in Tilbury Port on the River Thames in southeastern England  Passengers onboard included people from the United States  Britain  Canada  New Zealand and Australia  But when the vessel was traveling between two Norwegian ports  Tromso and Stavanger  it sent a mayday alert on Saturday afternoon that several engines had failed It was not immediately clear what had caused the cruise ship to lose power  But it did so along a particularly dangerous part of the Norwegian coastline called Hustadvika  according to Eirik Walle  a coordinator for the southern rescue center Five helicopters and several other vessels were involved in the rescue effort   According to local reports  two helicopters also helped a cargo ship on Saturday  the Hagland Captain  which was in Norwegian waters when it sent an SOS message saying it  too  had  engine problems   The crew members were evacuated  Rough weather   high winds and 26 foot waves   hampered the effort to evacuate the passengers of the Viking Sky  which began around 2 p m  local time on Saturday  At least three passengers sustained serious injuries  Currently  we understand 20 people suffered injuries as a result of this incident   a spokesman for Viking Cruises  which operates the ship  said by email  He added that they were all receiving medical care in Norway and that some had already been discharged The Red Cross said on Sunday that several of the rescued passengers had suffered cuts or broken bones   Many are also traumatized by what they have experienced  and need to be taken care of when they land   the statement said Video footage shared by the cruise ship passengers on social media showed a terrifying ordeal as the ship swayed and furniture  plants and people were sent sliding across the floor  Other footage depicted hundreds of people strapped in fluorescent life jackets as water rushed past their feet inside the ship  The ship is rocking and rolling but at anchor   Alexus Sheppard  a passenger  told The New York Times on Saturday after having waited to be evacuated for six hours   Everyone is calm  except when we get rolled by a big wave   she said         g 0325 for webNORWAYmap box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g 0325 for webNORWAYmap box  g artboard p     margin 0       g aiAbs     position

Sunday He also said that the passengers would be compensated   They will get their money back   he said  adding   They will also have a letter from me  and be invited back again  Mr  Hagen told the newspaper VG Sunday   What happened today is among the worst I ever experienced  But as it seems to all end well  I ve got to say we have been lucky  We keep doing the best we can  In a statement on Sunday  Viking Cruises said   The 479 passengers who were airlifted from the vessel are currently on shore and arrangements have been made to fly them home  with the first passengers leaving today  It also said that the company s next sailing  which had been scheduled to embark on March 27  had been canceled   Guests and their travel agents have been contacted directly  We do not anticipate any additional cancellations at this time   the statement said The ship will remain at the port in Molde for a public investigation into what happened  Mr  Knudsen  the spokesman for the rescue operation  said The cruise ship industry has suffered a number of disasters in the past decade  including the sinking of the Costa Concordia in 2012 and the deadly fire of the Norman Atlantic in 2014  as well as setbacks such as outbreaks of illness and onboard drug raids  

MAZAR I SHARIF  Afghanistan   After the second firefight in the past 10 days between American soldiers and their Afghan allies  at least 14 civilians  most of them women and children  were killed in an airstrike on Saturday in northern Kunduz province  according to Afghan officials  At least four Afghan soldiers were also killed A spokeswoman for the American military confirmed the attack  but blamed the outcome on the Taliban  We are fighting in a complex environment and this firefight is a prime example of the challenges Afghan and coalition forces face every day   said Sgt  1st Class Debra Richardson   The Taliban were hiding in civilian homes and maneuvered in and out of compounds without any concern for the families living inside  The episode on Saturday came a day after two members of an American Special Forces unit and four Afghan Special Forces soldiers were killed during a joint operation in Gul Tepa District  on the outskirts of Kunduz city  and involved some of the same forces  according to Afghan official accounts  The insurgents were reportedly massing on the outskirts of the city  which they have twice overrun  in 2015 and in 2016 The latest episode began around 3 a m  Saturday  after a convoy of American and Afghan Special Forces left the area of the previous day s combat and an armored vehicle used by the Americans broke down as they were heading to a security checkpoint  When the soldiers got out to fix the vehicle  an Afghan soldier nearby opened fire on them  Afghan officials described him as a Taliban insider who deliberately provoked the attack The Americans fired back at the attacker  and Afghan soldiers stationed in a nearby outpost returned fire at them  not realizing what had happened  according to Mohammed Ibrahim  the commander of Afghan Local Police in Kunduz Province  who described it as an accident set off by the insider who first opened fire  The combined Afghan and coalition ground force was fired on by an unknown assailant at close range from the checkpoint as well as from two other directions   Sergeant Richardson said   The fire from the enemy was indiscriminate and came from multiple directions  Commander Ibrahim said the two allies exchanged fire for 20 minutes before there were airstrikes  which he said had killed 12 civilians and six soldiers  After attempting to find out if any Afghan units in the area were under fire  Sergeant Richardson said  the Americans called in airstrikes  bringing the fighting to an end Nangayalay  a local police commander in the area  who like many Afghans has only one name   also confirmed that sequence of events  One of the airstrikes  he said  struck a house  where a large family of refugees had taken shelter a month earlier  14 family members were killed  The American bombs also struck the Afghan outpost  with from four to eight Afghan soldiers killed  according to varying Afghan estimates Safiullah Amiri  deputy leader of the provincial council in Kunduz  also confirmed that account   Clashes erupted between Afghan soldiers in the outpost and American forces accompanied by Afghan Special Forces  then Americans called for the air support   He also said four Afghan soldiers and 14 civilians were killed An Afghan senator  Mawlawi Abdullah Qarloq  said he was from the same village and knew the victims  he provided a list of their names  Other local officials said that of the 14  at least eight were children  and four were women Neighbors took many of the victims  bodies to Kunduz city  where they staged a protest march  but were turned away from their intended destination  the governor s office  and went to the hospital instead Sergeant Richardson confirmed that the American military was aware of reports of  noncombatant casualty claims from those airstrikes   However  she added   We maintain the right to engage the enemy in self defense and we take every measure to prevent civilian casualties  even as the Taliban intentionally hide behind women and children  The American spokeswoman also suggested that witnesses to civilian casualties might have been coerced   There are multiple Afghan reports from the area of the Taliban coercing and beating local Afghan civilians to allege civilians were killed  The joint American and Afghan operation had the day before killed 87 Taliban  she said  and they may have been using claims of civilian casualties to hide their losses Ten days earlier  in southern Uruzgan Province  another joint American Afghan Special Forces patrol ended up in what American officials called a  fog of war  incident  in which the patrol exchanged fire with a nearby Afghan National Army base  As in Saturday s incident  the Americans called in an airstrike after  they said  confirming there were no friendly units under fire in the area  The airstrike wiped out the army outpost  killing or wounding 15 of the 17 defending Afghan soldiers Mohammad Ibrahim  a relative of the victims on Saturday who took those wounded in the airstrike to Kunduz Regional Hospital  said four women as well as four girls  a son and their parents were killed in the airstrike   Three women were wounded in the airstrike  one of them died of her wounds on the way to the hospital   Mr  Ibrahim said  He is unrelated to the local police commander with the same name After the incident  the insider who started it fled to Taliban positions but was killed by the insurgents in another apparent case of mistaken identity  according to Mr  Amiri  He said village elders had been summoned to the insurgents  position to recover the insider s body  and were told that the insurgent who shot the insider had himself been arrested by the Taliban for doing so The Kunduz fighting brought to four the number of American troops killed this year  all of them Special Operations troops or American soldiers assigned to a Special Forces unit  Those are the only remaining American units still engaging in active combat in Afghanistan  About half of the 14 000 American soldiers in Afghanistan are Special Operations troops  The remainder are trainers  advisers and support forces In an unrelated incident in southern Helmand Province  three people including a provincial department head  Mohammad Khan Nasrat  were killed  and 30 people were wounded by two Taliban bombs that were set off simultaneously during annual celebrations of Farmer s Day  according to Omar Zwak  the spokesman for the provincial governor  Among the wounded were three other government officials  The rest of the victims were civilians  

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today by email  Earlier this year  when Gov  Gavin Newsom gave his wide ranging State of the State address  he floated an idea that built upon last year s passage of a sweeping new consumer privacy act  I applaud this Legislature for passing the first in the nation digital privacy law   he said in the speech   But California s consumers should also be able to share in the wealth that is created from their data  And so  I ve asked my team to develop a proposal for a new Data Dividend for Californians  It s not a totally new concept  and the particulars have yet to be decided Still  it seems as if every day  a new symptom of tech driven inequality emerges  And the idea that the companies profiting most from consumers  personal information should be forced to share the bounty holds an obvious appeal  What I m ecstatic about is that one of the challenges in government is we re generally slow and look backward   we don t look forward   State Senator Bob Hertzberg  a co author of the California Consumer Privacy Act  told me recently   And this gives us an opportunity to do that in a very big way  The thing is  there s a huge range of ways a digital dividend could actually be structured It could  for instance  be a straightforward payment or reward for consumers in exchange for the use of their data  Though that s an idea that has raised concerns among privacy advocates who worry such a model could make privacy even more of a luxury  accessible only to those who can afford to opt out of selling their data  Read more about how screens used to be for the elite  but now  avoiding them is a status symbol  Or  it could be a  dividend  in the broader sense  in which companies are essentially taxed for the data they collect And no matter the model  experts told me the idea of a digital or privacy dividend hinges on a more fundamental question  How much is your data worth That s something Dominique Shelton Leipzig  a Los Angeles based partner with the law firm Perkins Coie who specializes in privacy and security  said she s been urging businesses and regulators to think more about   and quickly  At this point in time  there s just no such thing as a company that is not heavily reliant on their data   she told me   It s just not being tracked the way any other asset would be  Ms  Shelton Leipzig said many big companies   ones that you wouldn t think of as tech companies   have tended to look at data security as separate from their core business  They don t look at their customer data as a tangible asset  she said  in the same way they might look at real estate  say  or their inventory Part of the difficulty  said Christopher Armstrong  a managing director with the consulting firm KPMG  is that there aren t well established ways of figuring out the value of customer data to different companies  How much is it worth on its own  or collectively  or in conjunction with a company s technology A standard method would at least give businesses and regulators a common framework For now  Mr  Armstrong said   it seems like there s a lack of clarity and quite a bit of discretion  Here

There have been tipping points and bombshells  walls closing in and turning points  And there have been so  so many declarations of  The beginning of the end   that the comedian John Oliver had a recurring  satirical  We got him   segment on his late night HBO show  complete with a jubilant marching band and sequined majorettes celebrating President Trump s downfall But in the swirl of reporting and speculation about the 45th president  nothing has held viewers on the edge of their seats quite like the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  and his investigation into possible ties between Mr  Trump s 2016 campaign and Russian agents The story line had it all  Cold War era intrigue  allegations of shadowy meetings in Moscow and a cast of recurring characters that included an aide in a  15 000 ostrich skin jacket  Paul D  Manafort  and another who has a tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back  Roger Stone  Mr  Mueller s complete report hasn t yet been released  but on Sunday  Attorney General William P  Barr made public a four page letter to Congress reporting that the 22 month inquiry did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that Mr  Trump and his associates  conspired or coordinated with the Russian government  ahead of the 2016 election  The news blindsided many liberals   particularly those with an ambient knowledge of Rachel Maddow s nightly monologues on MSNBC Who could blame them  The news media s coverage of the investigation  particularly on cable TV  caused millions of Americans who disapprove of Mr  Trump to put their faith in Mr  Mueller  There were even prayer candles  key chains and paintings made in the likeness of the silent 74 year old Marine veteran  and his fans believed his looming report would bring  in the words of the  Bachelor  creator Mike Fleiss   the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever  When that didn t happen  Mr  Trump and his allies placed blame on the news media for its ravenous coverage   I think Democrats and the liberal media owe the president and they owe the American people an apology   the White House press secretary  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  said on NBC News s Today Rich Lowry  the editor of the conservative National Review  wrote on Twitter   The 3 biggest losers from the Mueller report in order   the media  the media  the media  It was a bipartisan ripping  Matt Taibbi  a Rolling Stone writer whose book on the 2016 election is titled  Insane Clown President   is not exactly a fan of Mr  Trump  And yet he called the apparent lack of new charges resulting from the special counsel s investigation  a death blow for the reputation of the American news media   He compared it to the erroneous reporting on weapons of mass destruction in the run up to the Iraq war Hogan Gidley  a White House spokesman  said that  by his count  The New York Times  The Washington Post  CNN and MSNBC had published a combined 8 500 stories on the Russia probe  He specifically pointed to CNN and chyrons that would include the phrase  amid Russia investigation   no matter what the topic  It s so painfully obvious they wanted it to be true so badly  and the last two years of their lives and two years of their news coverage has been an entire waste   Mr  Gidley said Jeff Zucker  president of CNN  said he was  entirely comfortable  with the network s coverage  We are not investigators  We are journalists  and our role is to report the facts as we know them  which is exactly what we did   Mr  Zucker said in an email   A sitting president s own Justice Department investigated his campaign for collusion with a hostile nation  That s not enormous because the media says so  That s enormous because it s unprecedented  Bill Grueskin  a professor at the Columbia School of Journalism  said there seemed to be some confusion about the role of journalists   Mueller and Barr need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt   do we file charges or don t we   he said   Journalists don t have that standard  In other words  Pulitzer Prize winning reports of alleged wrongdoing do not need to provide evidence of criminality in order to be factual  newsworthy and relevant to readers  The

contacts and other matters   said Martin Baron  executive editor of The Washington Post   Our job is to bring facts to light  Others make determinations about prosecutable criminal offenses  Dean Baquet  the executive editor of The Times  echoed that sentiment   We wrote a lot about Russia  and I have no regrets   he said   It s not our job to determine whether or not there was illegality  But in the nearly two years of the Russia investigation  there have been several high profile mea culpas ABC News apologized and parted ways with its chief investigative correspondent  Brian Ross  after an errant report that Michael T  Flynn  the former national security adviser  had been directed by Mr  Trump to make contact with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign  Three seasoned investigative journalists at CNN resigned after the network retracted a report that a close Trump aide had ties to a Russian investment firm  Mr  Mueller publicly rebuked a BuzzFeed News account that Mr  Trump had instructed his longtime lawyer Michael D  Cohen to lie in his testimony to Congress   BuzzFeed News stood by its reporting   It s pretty clear that a lot of people in the media  particularly on cable news  got ahead of their skis on this   said Michael Isikoff  a co author of  Russian Roulette  The Inside Story of Putin s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump  Ben Smith  the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News  defended coverage of the Russian investigation  including the decision to publish a dossier put together by British intelligence officer Christopher Steele full of tantalizing  and unsubstantiated  reports about Russian efforts to blackmail Mr  Trump  It s pretty hard to imagine a scenario in which people were aware of its existence but not allowed to see it   Mr  Smith said of the dossier The editor also expressed concern that journalism was so often churned   and reduced   through the filter of partisan punditry  I think it s a moment when the public conversation favors partisans who are totally convinced in the rightness of what they re saying and doesn t favor reporters who are cautious about what they know and are trying to get things right   Mr  Smith said That may be true  but in the current ecosystem of political news  when shoe leather reporters moonlight as cable news analysts  it can be hard for typical viewers to distinguish the pundits from the press Even if more damning findings come out in the full report  Mr  Trump has already cast the narrative that he is absolved and that the  fake news  media is to be blamed  said Kevin Madden  a Republican strategist and former adviser to Mitt Romney  You see the president s most vocal supporters  they re touting the headlines that the president was exonerated and vindicated and where are the apologies from the media   he said Those apologies aren t likely to come  as long as the same people who have been trying to erode trust in factual reporting are now ones demanding a reckoning  We will hold every fake news media liar member accountable   Sean Hannity wrote Sunday on Twitter Mr  Fleiss  the producer  who knew Mr  Trump in his  Apprentice  years  said cable news had taken a page from the president s reality TV playbook in teasing every development in the Russia investigation as if it were the final blow  He s a master exaggerator  been doing it his entire life   Mr  Fleiss said   The rookies tried to keep up and got burned   

Robert W  Sweet  who as Mayor John V  Lindsay s top deputy worked to end some of the most rancorous conflicts in 1960s New York  and who as a longtime federal judge struck down a state ban on begging on the streets  died on Sunday in Ketchum  Idaho  He was 96 His son Robert Jr  confirmed the death  Judge Sweet  who lived in Manhattan  also had a home in Ketchum  where he was on vacation  At his death he was a senior federal judge in the Southern District of New York Mr  Sweet was Mr  Lindsay s chief deputy mayor  and had been his former Yale Law School roommate  from late 1966 through 1969  representing the mayor in tense labor disputes These included a teachers  strike in 1967 that kept most of the city s one million public school students out of school for two and a half weeks  and a nine day sanitation workers  strike the next year that left garbage piled up throughout the city Those fights  largely over wages and working conditions  were nothing new in New York City s long history of labor relations  But three later strikes by the teachers in the fall term of 1968 proved far more intractable  because they revolved around who would control the schools The strikes  which emptied classrooms for a total of eight weeks  grew out of a plan intending to improve public education by decentralizing the city s school system  Pilot projects had been set up in three school districts  including Ocean Hill Brownsville  in a predominantly black and Puerto Rican area of Brooklyn The strikes were called after the district s board had summarily moved to transfer a group of teachers and administrators out of the district  Ten of the teachers resisted  but the board persisted even after a trial examiner for the school system did not find enough evidence to support the board s accusations that the 10 had tried to sabotage community control or had done unsatisfactory work The teachers  union saw itself in a must win fight to protect its members  rights and discourage such actions by other local boards  Many supporters of the district s leadership  which was largely black  saw the strikes as an effort by a largely white and heavily Jewish union to squelch community control  Anti Semitic and racist accusations punctuated the conflict Mr  Sweet  on Mr  Lindsay s behalf  sought to persuade the union  the district s leadership and the Board of Education to compromise  Though he won praise for his low key manner and his ability to relieve tensions in the negotiations   Sid Davidoff  an assistant to the mayor  told The New York Times that Mr  Sweet  can deal with anybody  even an adversary  in almost a friendly way    only the state was able to end the conflict  It suspended the district board  and the involuntary transfers were made subject to grievance procedures in the union s contract Mr  Sweet s cordial negotiating manner   the  Sweet schmooze   City Hall colleagues called it   was also an asset in Albany  where he often traveled to appeal for more state financial aid for the city Mr  Sweet stepped down as deputy mayor at the end of 1969  after Mr  Lindsay was elected to a second term  and returned to private law practice as a partner at Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher and Flom  President Jimmy Carter named him to the United States Court for the Southern District of New York  in Manhattan  in 1978 One of Judge Sweet s major rulings came in 1992  when he declared that the state s law against begging on the streets was an unconstitutional violation of free speech While the government has a  valid interest  in preserving public order  he said   the interest in permitting free speech and the message that begging sends about our society predominates  He added   A peaceful beggar poses no threat to society   while  aggressive panhandling  could be prosecuted under existing laws ImageMr  Sweet in 1968 as a deputy mayor in New York under John V  Lindsay  He could  deal with anybody  even an adversary  in almost a friendly way   an assistant to the mayor once said  City Hall colleagues called his cordial negotiating manner the  Sweet schmooze  CreditSam Falk The New York TimesThe ruling was upheld on appeal  In 1996  New York City enacted its own ban on aggressive panhandling  Panhandling remains illegal in the city s subways and buses and at Transit Authority stations Perhaps Judge Sweet s most controversial words were expressed off the bench  In a 1989 speech at the Cosmopolitan Club in Manhattan  he called for legalizing heroin  crack cocaine and all other illegal drugs The war on drugs was  bankrupt  and futile and overwhelming the courts  he maintained  If legalized  he said  the drugs could be produced by pharmaceutical companies  regulated like alcohol and kept unlawful for minors Those advocating legalization expressed gratification at having a federal judge on board  Critics argued that Judge Sweet was defeatist  and that heroin and crack were more addictive than alcohol In another prominent case  Judge Sweet  in 2003  dismissed a lawsuit that sought to hold the McDonald s Corporation liable for obesity and ill health in teenagers  If a person knows or should know that eating copious orders of supersized McDonald s products is unhealthy and may result in weight gain   Judge Sweet wrote   it is not the place of the law to protect them from their own excesses  He went on to note   Nobody is forced to eat at McDonald s   Except  perhaps  parents of small children who desire McDonald s food  toy promotions or playgrounds  and demand their parents  accompaniment   Robert Workman Sweet was born in Yonkers on Oct  15  1922  the son of James and Delia  Workman  Sweet  His father was a lawyer Mr  Sweet attended the Horace Mann School in the Bronx and the Taft School in Connecticut before graduating from Yale in 1944  He spent two years in the Navy  commanding a submarine chaser in the Atlantic  his family said  He graduated from Yale Law in 1948 That same year he married Lois Clapp  The marriage ended in divorce  In 1973 he married Adele Hall Leopold  a daughter of Dorothy Schiff  at the time the publisher of The New York Post  Ms  Sweet was assistant publisher of The Post under her mother and later headed the Dorothy Schiff Foundation  Adele Sweet died in December at 93 In addition to Robert Jr   Judge Sweet is survived by two daughters  Deborah Given and Eliza H  Sweet  another son  Ames  seven grandchildren  four great grandchildren  six stepchildren  and many step grandchildren and step great grandchildren After law school Mr  Sweet worked largely in private practice for 17 years  He was also active in Republican Party politics and served as Manhattan borough coordinator in Mr  Lindsay s first race for mayor  in 1965  The victorious Mr  Lindsay brought him to City Hall as his executive assistant  and made him chief deputy mayor after a year Among Judge Sweet s many former law clerks was former Gov  Eliot Spitzer of New York In his later years Judge Sweet was an avid figure skater  beginning many days with a morning skating session at the Chelsea Piers Sky Rink in Manhattan  He started skating after his wife Adele  a skater herself  gave him figure skates as a birthday present  Figure skating is often precarious at any age  and the fact that the judge does this at 92 is extraordinary   an instructor  Marni Halasa  told Corey Kilgannon of The New York Times one morning in 2015 for an article about the judge s hobby The judge proceeded to practice a fox trot ice dance routine as well as maneuvers like swing rolls  3 turns  Mohawk turns and crossovers Judge Sweet saw parallels between skating and judging  You really have to pay attention to detail  and it requires balance and hard work   he said   It doesn t make me a better judge or anything like that  but working hard at anything makes you better   

LONDON   Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched through London on Saturday afternoon in a last ditch  long shot effort to reverse Britain s looming split from the European Union  calling on lawmakers to heed the enormous anger among pro Europeans and break the political stalemate by holding a second referendum The protesters  some of whom traveled for hours on buses and trains  set off from Hyde Park holding placards that nodded at their European roots    50 percent French  50 percent British  100 percent European   one boy s sign read   and employed a bit of British understatement    Brexit really not going well  is it   read another The crowd   organizers estimated a million people turned out  though there was no way to independently confirm it   clogged vast stretches of

Parliament  there remains little appetite among lawmakers for another public vote  And as much as anti Brexit organizers have tried to cast their movement as inclusive of the people who voted to leave

Europe  a subject that will surely consume the political debate for years  This is about telling Theresa May that the people aren t on her side   she said  referring to comments this past week by Mrs  May in which she said lawmakers were undermining the public with their attempts to stall her exit plan As the marchers advanced  some blew whistles and erupted in cheers and jeers  A percussion band

about supporters   weekend plans   suggested they participate in local election events  a post that critics said was symptomatic of Labour s attempts to sidestep the biggest political crisis in a generation But the march on Saturday was also a reminder that the Labour leadership does not speak with a single voice when it comes to Brexit  The deputy Labour leader  Tom Watson  used the occasion to announce that he would vote for a Brexit deal that gave the public a chance to choose between the agreement and staying in the bloc ImageA petition calling to cancel Brexit had racked up more than

Conservatives who said they disagreed with their party s line on Brexit Daniel Poser  52  a residential landlord in London who belongs to Conservatives Against Brexit  was walking by government buildings stickered with anti Brexit slogans on Saturday  You re now seeing the proof that Brexit is a puzzle with no way out   Mr  Poser said   We as a nation are trapped by the lies told during the referendum  He said he saw another referendum as a practical way out of the crisis   The poison entered the system through the referendum   can we draw it out through a referendum and never talk about it again   he said Many polls show that Britons have now gone from mostly thinking that Britain was right to leave Europe after the referendum to mostly thinking the opposite  Support for a public vote has also grown  according to a mid March poll by YouGov for the People s Vote campaign  though pollsters  findings have varied widely depending how the question is asked Another protester  Olivia Leydenfrost  58  a British American communications professional who grew up in Nyack  N Y   north of Manhattan  but has lived in Britain for 17 years  arrived in London on Saturday from Bath  She said

Rafi Eitan  the canny Israeli spymaster who commanded the Nazi hunting team that captured Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and many years later was unmasked as the handler of Jonathan Jay Pollard  the American Navy intelligence analyst who pleaded guilty to passing on more than 1 000 secret documents to the Israelis  died on Saturday in Tel Aviv  He was 92 The death was confirmed by the Ichilov Medical Center  where Mr  Eitan had been hospitalized  Israeli news organizations said  In a statement  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Mr  Eitan  among the heroes of the intelligence services of the State of Israel  Mr  Eitan  a bespectacled man with thinning hair  was a legend in his country because so many feats of espionage and international intrigue seemed to bear his fingerprints  He exploited loopholes in national security to achieve masterful strokes of espionage  counterterrorism or simple revenge He played important roles in the surgical strike on Iraq s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981 and the assassinations of the Palestinian commandos who carried out the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972  He was also suspected of being involved in the late 1960s disappearance of at least 100 pounds of highly enriched uranium from a nuclear fuel plant in the Pittsburgh area  many believed that the uranium was diverted to Israel to help its atomic bomb program  In principle  when there is a war on terror you conduct it without principles   Mr  Eitan said in an interview with the Israeli newspaper Ha aretz in 2010   You simply fight it  No single deed garnered as much attention as the kidnapping of Eichmann  the SS official who drew up plans for the Final Solution  the mass deportation of Jews to camps for extermination Mossad  the Israeli counterpart of the Central Intelligence Agency  had learned from a German prosecutor that a young German woman in Buenos Aires had befriended a young man there named Nicolas Eichmann  who lived with his family in a suburb of the city  His father  it was determined  was using the alias Ricardo Klement Through surveillance  Mr  Eitan and his team established that Klement  who appeared to be Eichmann  returned home from work by bus each day  On May 11  1960  Mr  Eitan and his team  pretending to be a group of men fixing a stalled car  snatched Eichmann after he got off the bus  I grabbed him by the neck with such force that I could see his eyes bulge   Mr  Eitan recalled   A little tighter and I would have choked him to death  They drove three miles to a safe house  where Eichmann was kept for seven days  during which he admitted that he was indeed Adolf Eichmann  We did not want to show Eichmann how nervous we all were   Mr  Eitan told an interviewer   That would have given him hope  and hope makes a desperate person dangerous  I needed him to be as helpless as my own people were when he had sent them in trainloads to the death camps  The team dressed Eichmann in the outfit of an El Al airline crew member  forced him to drink a bottle of whiskey to make him wobbly  and escorted him onto a departing airplane as if he were an under the weather steward  An actual El Al crew member remained behind in Buenos Aires so that there would be no discrepancy in the manifest  The team was also aware of the Argentine whereabouts of the demonic Nazi medical experimenter Josef Mengele  but Mr  Eitan had blocked any attempt to seize him because it could have jeopardized the capture of Eichmann The kidnapping was condemned in Argentina as a violation of that country s sovereignty and of international law  but it was met with deep satisfaction and vindication by tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors  Eichmann faced a trial in Jerusalem that drew renewed attention to Germany s systematic genocide  He was found guilty of crimes against humanity and was executed by hanging in 1962 ImageEichmann during his 1961 trial for war crimes as the architect of the Nazi extermination of European Jews  Eichmann had escaped arrest for 15 years until Mr  Eitan  leading a team of Mossad agents  snatched him off the streets of Buenos Aires CreditAssociated PressIn his book  Gideon s Spies  The Secret History of the Mossad   1995   the British author and investigative journalist Gordon Thomas wrote that Mr  Eitan spoke to Eichmann in the execution chamber  Eichmann looked at me and said   Your time will come to follow me  Jew     Mr  Thomas quoted Mr  Eitan as recalling   and I replied   But not today  Adolf  not today    Rafael Eitan was born on Nov  23  1926  in the British Mandate of Palestine to Zionists who had immigrated from Russia three years earlier and lived in a small settlement near Tel Aviv  Not yet a teenager  Rafi joined the Haganah  the forerunner of the Israeli Army  to defend the settlement against Arab attacks and was later recruited into its more elite branch  the Palmach With Jews pressing the British for an autonomous homeland  his most dazzling venture was to crawl through sewers to blow up a British radar installation on Mount Carmel  It earned him the sobriquet  Rafi the Smelly   to distinguish him from another Rafael Eitan  who went on to become chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces  Mr  Eitan also played an important role in smuggling Jewish refugees from Nazism into Palestine Mr  Eitan was twice wounded in the 1948 war for independence  After telling his superiors that it was difficult for him to run in the field  they assigned him to an intelligence unit  His spying career had begun  though he took time to earn a degree from the London School of Economics Over the next few decades he served as operations chief at Shin Bet  Israel s equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  and as Mossad s deputy operations chief  In 1965  posing as an Israeli government chemist  he visited a nuclear fuel plant in Apollo  Pa   outside Pittsburgh  It was later discovered that a large quantity of enriched uranium had vanished  Though the case has never been solved  some American analysts concluded that it was more than a coincidence that Mr  Eitan s visit had occurred around the time of the disappearance In 1985  Mr  Pollard  an intelligence analyst for the Navy assigned to monitor classified materials on global terrorist activities  was arrested on charges of spying for Israel and turning over thousands of documents to it  He confessed and was sentenced to life imprisonment  After serving 30 years  Mr  Pollard  now 64  was granted parole and released from prison in 2015 The Pollard affair strained the close ties between the United States and Israel and raised the specter of divided loyalties among some American Jews   though today  after revelations in 2013 of the United States spying on allies through the National Security Agency  the double dealing seems routine Israeli officials at first tried to depict the Pollard case as a rogue operation by Mossad  But Shimon Peres  Israel s prime minister at the time  publicly apologized and allowed State Department officials to question Mr  Eitan  who had been the adviser on terrorism to a previous prime minister  Menachem Begin  and had overseen Mr  Pollard s spying  Mr  Eitan later told journalists that he had acted with  permission and authority  According to Mr  Thomas  the British author  Mr  Eitan was also for a time a secret adviser on counterterrorism to MI6  the British foreign intelligence agency  and had helped Mossad agents track an Irish Republican Army bomb squad in Gibraltar that was then killed by British special forces In the wake of the Pollard affair  Mr  Eitan lost his executive intelligence post but was made head of the state owned company Israel Chemicals  a job that ended in 1993 when he was 67 He and his wife  Miriam  were said to have had three children and several grandchildren  but there was no immediate information on his survivors Mr  Eitan s role in the operation to capture Eichmann was dramatized in the 2018 movie  Operation Finale   in which he was played by Nick Kroll In supposed retirement  Mr  Eitan undertook large agricultural and construction projects in Cuba and  like other Israeli spymasters  fashioned something of a political career  He represented the Gil Pensioners Party in the 2006 elections for the Knesset  Israel s parliament  It won seven seats  and he briefly served as minister for pensioners  But Mr  Eitan lost his seat in 2009 His one other avocation was sculpture  and Mr  Eitan produced more than 100 pieces over more than 30 years  None  however  have been as savored for their cleverness as his espionage operations

best friend  Laura Jaime  on the FaceTime app  She showed off the crocheted earrings she had bought in a local market and gave a video tour of her villa  The friends planned to see each other the next

women traveling alone have raised questions about how the world is greeting the documented rise in female solo travelers and about the role of social media in promoting the idea that far off lands are easily accessible and safe They have also shined a light on the enduring nature of gender violence worldwide and laid bare how a lone foreign traveler s cultural and social expectations do not always comport with local views about a woman s place in the world   and whether she should travel at all Thousands of women go abroad every year without incident  Many women experience catcalls and myriad other forms of harassment while traveling  women of color have written about being dismissed or ignored abroad because of their race  And while violence against male tourists is just as devastating  the harrowing experiences of female solo travelers can still shock the senses  In December  the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen  24  of Denmark and Maren Ueland  28  of Norway  were found with knife wounds in their necks in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco  Danish officials called the murders an act of terror  That same month  the Briton Grace Millane disappeared in Auckland  New Zealand  on the night before her 22nd birthday  she was found slain days later  In 2015  a 19 year old British backpacker was gang raped by bikers in Thailand  In March  an Australian man was convicted of kidnapping and raping a Belgian traveler seeking work after keeping her locked up in his pig shed for two days There s no question that women face unique risks when traveling solo  experts say  We have evidence that shows that women face risks that men don t face in public spaces  at home  wherever they may be   said Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka  executive director of UN Women  an organization that promotes female equality  Increasingly   wherever they may be  includes alone in foreign countries  But she said that violence against female tourists was a thread in the broader fabric of violence against women around the world  And violent episodes are just as likely to occur  experts note  in rich Western nations such as France  Italy and Germany as in the developing world   The root cause of this kind of violence against women in communities and in public and private spaces has a lot of do with the underlying gender stereotypes  social norms  entitlement and patriarchy   Ms  Mlambo Ngcuka said What the numbers tell  and don tSolo travel by women has grown in popularity year after year  according to travel industry studies Hostelworld  an online hostel booking platform  found in a 2018 study that bookings by solo female travelers increased by 45 percent from 2015 to 2017  compared with a 40 percent increase for men  Solo travel was once seen as brave and risky for female travelers  but a shift of attitude has meant that it is now an adventurous  exciting experience that allows them to feel free with no one else to worry about or please   the company said The online travel company 101 Singles Holidays found in a study of more than 60 000 British travelers that the number of people booking solo holidays rose by 14 percent in 2017 from 2016  and that tour operators were predicting a further rise of 11 percent in 2018  Solo female travelers also outnumbered their male counterparts by almost two to one  the study showed After Backpacker s Killing  New Zealand Looks

Travel s Darker SideMay 23  2014A 2018 global survey by British Airways of 9 000 women found that more than 50 percent had taken a solo vacation  with 75 percent of the women surveyed planning solo trips in the next few years  Another ad hoc sign of women s growing interest in hitting the road alone  Web searches for  solo female travel  have also risen drastically in the past five years  according to Google Trends But even as more women explore the world  there is no clear global picture of the scale of violence against female solo travelers  making it hard to pin down whether attacks are on the rise or people have wider access to the grim news  The reason  Most countries do not comprehensively track violence against female travelers  Global agencies like the United Nations have traditionally collected data on gender violence as a whole  The State Department offers tips for women but does not break down data on violence against travelers by gender  a spokesman said  A British Foreign Office spokesman said the agency no longer compiled the Helping Britons Abroad report  making 2015 the last year for which figures were available  when they showed a 4 percent increase in sexual assaults against Britons abroad from 2010  But the statistics are not gender specific  Experts find the lack of such figures troubling Ms  Mlambo Ngcuka  of UN Women  said that countries had little incentive to collect and publicize information that could be detrimental to their image   This would not be seen by many countries as important data to collect   she said   so you are unable to track the prevalence or patterns  The lure of traveling aloneWomen have always been explorers on a scale both grand and personal   long before the British trailblazer Freya Stark visited inhospitable areas in Turkey and the Middle East and before the Irish travel writer Dervla Murphy saw the world on a bicycle  Today  women s increased spending power has given them the means to travel more for leisure and adventure  Shifting attitudes in the West about who can travel alone have also added to a growing industry  Social media plays a big part  offering intimate glimpses of far off lands  A scroll through Instagram hashtags like  LadiesGoneGlobal   WeAreTravelGirls and  TheTravelWomen offer millions of photos of women posing on glistening beaches  trekking up mountains and exploring cobblestone streets   a collective and aspirational lure But some women  like Hannah Gavios  26  of Queens  discover horror away from home Ms  Gavios found her passion for traveling solo while studying abroad in college   I feel like it gives me the luxury of seeing the culture in the way I want to and being able to paint my own experience   she said ImageAfter being attacked  Ms  Gavios had to learn to walk again  She says she doesn t want her experience to scare other women away from having the rich experience of traveling solo CreditGeorge Etheredge for The New York TimesAfter college  she traveled to Southeast Asia on her own  visiting Thailand in 2016 on a break from teaching English in Vietnam  One evening  she was walking alone after dinner in Krabi  known for its beaches and as a popular hangout for young tourists  when a local man offered to guide her back to her hotel She said she was afraid of getting lost  so she followed him  But just as she grew increasingly uneasy  he attacked Fleeing for her life  Ms  Gavios tumbled from a cliff and fractured her spine  The man sexually assaulted her while she lay helpless for 11 hours  In the morning light  he left   but  surprisingly  returned with help Ms  Gavios was hospitalized for months  first in Thailand and then New York  and had to learn to walk again using crutches and custom leg braces  Her attacker was eventually arrested and sentenced to five years in prison A shattered familyThe week Ms  Stefaniak vanished  her friends and family scrambled to alert Costa Rican authorities  They organized a campaign through a Facebook page    Finding Carla   The State Department quickly became involved  and the F B I  pressed local officials When her body was discovered near her villa  her relatives were shattered   Ms  Jaime  her best friend  said the local authorities should have done more to publicize the risks to women in the country   They have a responsibility to tell tourists of all the risks  and they are not doing it   she said Ms  Stefaniak was the third foreign woman killed in Costa Rica in three months  But the country was also grappling with a deeper  more systemic problem of brutality against local women  ones who did not have the power of an American passport to help galvanize agencies like the State Department or the F B I  on their behalf  At least 14 women were killed in gender based violence in the country from January to August 2018  In September  the government declared violence against women a national problem The National Institute for Women  a government ministry  pointed to the murders of foreigners last summer in a statement to illustrate the issue   We are faced with the fact that  beyond the damage it may cause to the image of the country  they are clear examples of the serious situation of violence against women  which has its most brutal expression in femicide  Still  Costa Rica is considered one of the safest countries in Central America  particularly for tourists  with a lower homicide rate than many neighboring nations  Officials say they have made strides to combat gender based violence Ms  Jaime said she believed that her friend might have been targeted because she was a Spanish speaker who blended right in and her killer might have thought the police would be lax   Maybe because she spoke Spanish  he might have felt no one would have looked for her   Ms  Jaime said  But she said the attacker had underestimated the determination of Ms  Stefaniak s family  Not only are her relatives fighting for justice in Costa Rica s courts  they also filed a lawsuit accusing Airbnb of negligence  Their lawyer in Costa Rica  Joseph Alfonso Rivera Cheves  appeared to suggest a callous disregard in the aftermath  noting that the same day Ms  Stefaniak vanished  her Airbnb room was being cleaned and new renters checked in The family also says that the local host evaded negative reviews by changing the name of the listing  and no background check of the security guard was conducted even though he had access to all the rooms on site Airbnb  in a statement  said it had removed the villa where Ms  Stefaniak had stayed from its platform  and had been in contact with the authorities  The company also said it had made strides to address women s safety concerns  partnering with rights organizations and violence prevention groups in local communities  and creating policies that emphasize women s needs  That includes removing any host or guest accused of sexual assault from the platform and including a clause in its nondiscrimination policy that allows female hosts to accept only female guests The power of preparationSeasoned solo travelers say that preparation can be the key to minimizing risk For Cassie DePecol  29  who holds the Guinness World Record for  the fastest time to visit all sovereign countries   traveling alone means having a long list of precautions  The Connecticut born activist practices Krav Maga  an Israeli self defense technique  She carries a GPS tracker  She makes sure someone knows where she is at all times  Some of these might sound extreme   she said   But I attribute having safely traveled to 196 countries alone to these specific procedures  Ms  DePecol says that gender based violence is an unfortunate reality for women who travel  The awareness of needing to always watch our backs when we re both alone and in public places is something that men don t necessarily need to be aware of   she said ImageJessica Nabongo is on a mission to be the first black woman to travel to every country in the world  She said that while traveling alone  she has to deal with a whole other level of safety concerns CreditTodd Heisler The New York TimesJessica Nabongo  34  is on a mission to become the first black woman to visit every country in the world  Born in Detroit  she has been to 158 so far   54 of them alone   and hopes to complete her journey in October Her road map for safety includes trying to stay in hotels with 24 hour security  If she stays in an Airbnb  the host has to have received consistently excellent reviews and achieved  superhost  status  She takes Ubers so that her location is tracked Ms  Nabongo acknowledged that  we tell women what not to do to avoid being attacked instead of telling men not to attack women   But she says she dresses conservatively until she can assess whether what she wears matters in the place she is visiting She would prefer a world where women can just pack up and travel without having to do the extra legwork that solo male travelers don t have to  but says that s idealistic  Ms  Nabongo  however  like many women s advocates  believes that any focus on the way women dress   or the fact that they travel alone at all   provides a convenient scapegoat and does not address the true causes of gender based violence and rape culture Most headlines tend to highlight the experiences of young  white or Western victims   partly because of a dearth of public data on any violent experiences of women of color who travel alone  But Ms  Nabongo noted that as a black woman traveling solo  she has to deal with a whole other level of safety concerns  anxiety and fear  In many European cities that I ve been in   like Barcelona  Madrid  Rome  Milano   women of color are in more danger because a lot of people think we are prostitutes   she said   My fear is always that if something happens to me in a European city  no one will care  I could be running down the street screaming in Italy and onlookers won t care because I m black  To help one another traverse the world safely  women have formed their own online communities Dianelle Rivers Mitchell founded Black Girls Travel Too  which coordinates group travel  to serve a growing market  On her company s Facebook site  thousands of women share tips on where to stay  eat and visit  and hash out safety concerns  We are each other s keeper  especially when it comes to travel   said Ms  Rivers Mitchell  Apps provide another level of support for women traveling alone  Free ones like Chirpey  RedZone  MayDay  Tripwhistle and

Vasilisa Komarova grew up in the 1980s behind the Soviet Iron Curtain  She studied law  moved to London  learned English and became a British citizen  But she dreamed of traveling the wider world In 2016  at 35  she embarked on a solo motorcycle journey through the Americas  Image The attack  the process  it broke me down   Vasilisa Komarova said   But I had to find strength inside myself  CreditBicubik Photography for The New York TimesShe visited Cuba and spent time in the Atacama Desert and Chilean Patagonia  She linked up with motorcyclists and got odd jobs in a bike shop and in fitness training  She was living a dream  chronicling it all with photos on Instagram and posts on Facebook Then  everything changed  At some point  maybe because everyone I was meeting was so kind  I think I put down my guard a little   she said  While she was camping in northern Bolivia on June 4  2017  in an area people had told her was safe  three men with machetes dragged her out of her tent  They beat her  dislocating her arm in three places  While two held her down  one raped her  Then they broke her motorcycle  stole her belongings  urinated on her tent and left her for dead Afraid that they might come back  Ms  Komarova lay still all night  When the sun rose  she used her laptop  which her attackers had missed  to summon help  But what she experienced was a climate of impunity  she said  The authorities didn t want to take her to a doctor  the doctor didn t want to see her because she could not pay  Only after the Russian Embassy was involved did the police listen   Ms  Komarova said But the embassy retreated after connecting her with the local authorities  saying she was not in immediate danger  She felt she was on her own Experts say such a response isn t unusual   Some of these law enforcers are themselves part of the problem  and they do not take these crimes as seriously as they need to   Ms  Mlambo Ngcuka  of UN Women  said Bolivian and Russian authorities did not respond to several requests for comment With the help of the British Embassy  Ms  Komarova  made contact with an advocate who helped her file a criminal complaint and begin the legal fight against her attackers ResilienceMs  Komarova said she knew she had to be her own biggest advocate  she couldn t move forward in her journey or return home without getting some form of justice  But between the local bureaucracy and the corruption  she said  it was an arduous fight  The attack  the process  it broke me down   Ms  Komarova said   But I had to find strength inside myself  A year later  she watched as her attackers were sentenced to a combined 42 years in prison In November  Ms  Komarova rode out of Bolivia on her motorcycle  The first night she put her tent up after leaving  she was afraid  she admitted  She is still on the road  and wants other women to travel  but to be on alert   always  My guard is really high   Ms  Komarova said by Skype from Ecuador   People don t always deserve my skepticism  but that is how it is  That s how it has to be  As for Ms  Gavios  she is still partly paralyzed  but since the attack  she has become a yoga instructor and has learned Krav Maga  Last fall  she completed the New York City Marathon   on crutches   It hasn t prevented me from moving forward or traveling by myself   she said   I don t feel defeated  She says she doesn t want her experience to scare other women away from having the rich  eye opening experience of traveling solo  The more we tell women not to travel alone and the more we send the message that the world is very dangerous  in a way  we are also supporting that belief   Ms  Gavios said   Rather than horrifying people  I want people to go into it with a little more bravery and a little more knowledge  From her perspective  there are no dangerous countries  just dangerous people  It sucks  but you can t control the world   she said  adding   But you also have to go out and live your life and not let

WASHINGTON   Most Friday nights as he conducted his investigation  Robert S  Mueller III drove seven miles from his offices by the Capitol to Salt   Pepper  a dimly lit  mostly empty restaurant near his home  settling into a wooden booth partly covered by a dowdy red curtain The ritual   usually undertaken with two friends  a glass of white wine  a plate of scallops and no security detail   was perhaps the most public contrast to the way Americans came to know Mr  Mueller in his 22 months as special counsel  as a partisan symbol more than a person  his name synonymous with whatever they wanted to believe about President Trump and American law enforcement  their hopes and fears stashed in the pockets of his pinstripe suits Throughout his investigation  Mr  Mueller chose to remain silent  the rare recluse in a world rife with Twitter battles and talking heads  But now  with his report filed  Congress clamoring for more of his findings and a polarized public picking over the remains of his work  the tight lipped Vietnam veteran and former F B I  director  who will be 75 in August  remains a figure of mystery and fascination The post report spotlight may prove to be a new test  On Sunday  before his findings were revealed for the first time  a usually photo shy Mr  Mueller drew a gawking crowd outside St  John s Church near the White House  where he attended morning services  a visit that allowed for some of the first pictures of him since he was appointed special counsel in May 2017 But inside the church  few congregants took notice  Mr  Mueller  who is known to visit other Episcopal churches around Washington  is a regular  Let s put it this way  no unannounced visitors   Preston Cherouny  who runs business operations for the church  said in an interview   It was just a typical Sunday around here  For all the intrigue his investigation has spawned  Mr  Mueller   a lifelong Republican and consummate WASP whose nickname in government was  Bobby three sticks    led a secretive but ordinary life  bucking the spotlight that came with being painted as a liberal fantasy or conservative boogeyman The sightings were sporadic  Around the time he indicted over a dozen Russian nationals for election interference  Mr  Mueller was spotted in a 7 Eleven store by the National Zoo wearing Adidas running pants and a cinched waist parka ImageOne of the buildings that housed the special counsel s offices  At work  Mr  Mueller nurtured a sense of detachment CreditCarlos Barria ReutersLast September  Mr  Mueller and his wife  Ann Standish  were seen at a spacious help desk at Georgetown s Apple Store  peering curiously into a personal MacBook  just days after Paul Manafort  Mr  Trump s former campaign chairman  pleaded guilty and signed a plea agreement with the special counsel s team The Apple employee who fixed Mr  Mueller s computer told a reporter that he was stunned when he walked out of the back of the store to see his newest client  Come on  I read the paper   said the employee  who would only identify himself as Yit  citing concerns over Apple s privacy policies   Both of them were really nice  It was just business  In January  as Mr  Mueller closed in on indicting Roger J  Stone Jr   he visited Stohlman Subaru in Northern Virginia  The dealership declined to divulge details about its customers or transactions  but a person familiar with Mr  Mueller s negotiation said he either bought or leased a new Forester  the same model he drove to the office last week in the final days of his investigation At work  Mr  Mueller nurtured a sense of detachment  As the investigation unfolded  he stayed tucked in his own office outside his prosecutors  cubicles  drifting in and out of his team s windowless conference rooms and spartan open office space  Never one for small talk  he rarely sat in on interviews  sneaking into the room toward the end to sit in silently  or stopping in merely to say hello to a witness  letting his prosecutors speak for him When he met with Mr  Trump s lawyers  he entered the room through a digital lockpad and sat in the middle of a conference room table  his investigators seated to his sides  according to John M  Dowd  one of the lawyers  Mr  Mueller  when he did engage  would deploy corporate idioms like  we need to square the circle    or merely sit in silence  letting his team handle negotiations over an interview with the president In the absence of interviews and public statements  a rapt public began to search for clues in Mr  Mueller s appearance  turning the square jawed investigator into a political Rorschach test  His Sea Ranch branded baseball caps  his tailored suits and the Casio watch he and other investigators sported were pored over much in the same way that Melania Trump s clothes are examined for evidence of her concealed politics  He is very comfortable in a Brooks Brothers   Garrett M  Graff  a journalist who wrote a book about Mr  Mueller s tenure at the F B I   said in an interview   That carries through in a lot of what he does  He s deeply conservative  Not in a political sense  but in a traditional sense  His weekly visits to Salt   Pepper  an aggressively unhip restaurant in Washington s Palisades neighborhood near the gated community where he lives  were often set against the backdrop of explosive news his team generated  As he dined with confidants  including Kenneth L  Wainstein  his former chief of staff at the F B I   Mueller related news coverage would often be flashing on a large flat screen TV nearby ImageFront pages announcing the end of the Russia investigation  Speculation abounds about what Mr  Mueller might do next CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesOne evening  Mr  Mueller was eating and talking animatedly at the same time that his spokesman released a rare statement refuting a BuzzFeed News article about interactions between Mr  Trump and Michael D  Cohen  the president s former personal lawyer Even last Friday  as Washington hummed with anticipation over what might be included in his report  Mr  Mueller stuck to his routine  Hours after handing the report to Attorney General William P  Barr  Mr  Mueller was again in one of his favorite booths  at ease and laughing  drinking white wine and nibbling on appetizers and complimentary breadsticks  according to his waiter As the official part of the work winds down   CNN spotted Mr  Mueller driving into his office building on Monday   speculation abounds about what Mr  Mueller might do next  and his office has offered few clues   The special counsel will be concluding his service in the coming days   Peter Carr  his spokesman  said in an email  Mr  Carr declined to comment further about what might come next He has options  He could sign a tell all book deal  like James B  Comey  the former F B I  director who has since become a vocal opponent of the president  He could pick up where he left off on the paid speaking circuit  talking again to groups like the Nuclear Energy Institute or the Insurance Information Institute  He could become a Twitter clearinghouse for commentary on the investigations still encircling Mr  Trump Or he could return to WilmerHale  the white collar Washington law firm where he occupied a 12th floor corner office in the years leading up to his appointment as special counsel  defending clients such as the National Football League and Sony  Three co workers left the firm with him to become prosecutors in the Russia investigation Jamie S  Gorelick  who worked with Mr  Mueller at WilmerHale  said he was unassuming and  wickedly funny  as a partner at the firm  giving advice to lawyers on particularly complex cases  If Mr  Mueller returns  she said  he will most likely continue with his previous specialties  overseeing investigations for corporations and nonprofits and helping with cases related to cybersecurity Mr  Graff  who has dined out casually with Mr  Mueller  surmised that he might surprise with a memoir  wanting a last word on his life s work According to people who have known him for years  taking such a public route is unlikely  Mr  Mueller is not part of the gossipy Washington ecosystem of dinner parties and book celebrations   in a Time 2018 Person of the Year runner up profile  Mr  Mueller was described as  the kind of man who flicks the lights off and on at his home to inform guests that it s time to leave a social gathering  Cristina C  Arguedas  a lawyer who knows Mr  Mueller from when he was a young prosecutor and she was a public defender  described him as too regimented to break course now  I would bet you my house that you re never going to see him again in the public eye   Ms  Arguedas said  unless he is subpoenaed to testify to Congress  which is already a topic of discussion among Democrats   I think he resumes his civilian life as if he didn t have the most important job in the country for the last two years   

MISHMERET  Israel   Israel and Hamas exchanged blows on Monday after a rocket launched from Gaza struck a house in central Israel  wounding seven people Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that he was cutting short his visit to the United States  with the rocket attack posing a new challenge to his bid for re election just two weeks before Israelis go to the polls But the lack of enthusiasm for an all out conflict was apparent on both sides  Just hours after the fighting began  Hamas announced that Egyptian mediators had succeeded in brokering a new  albeit fragile  cease fire The Israeli military said that Hamas  the militant group that controls Gaza  had fired a long range rocket at dawn that struck the pastoral village of Mishmeret  about 20 miles north of Tel Aviv  I heard a kind of whoosh and a second later a boom   said a resident  Robert Wolf  60   I turn around and my whole house has gone   His wife  Susan  was hospitalized for a head wound and other members of his family suffered light injuries Hamas neither confirmed nor denied that it had carried out the attack Twelve hours later  at sunset  Israeli warplanes began striking back at Hamas targets throughout the Gaza Strip ImageFire and smoke envelop buildings in Gaza City during reported Israeli strikes on Monday CreditMahmud Hams Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesAppearing at the White House with President Trump before returning to Israel  Mr  Netanyahu said   As we speak  Israel is responding forcefully to this wanton aggression  Mr  Netanyahu appeared to be conducting the air campaign from his guest accommodation in Blair House  where aides said he was approving targets and overseeing the attacks after delaying his departure from Washington Intent on deterring Hamas after several recent bouts of rocket fire  Israel scaled up its response  opening with attacks on several buildings the Israelis said Hamas had used for military purposes in populated areas of Gaza City The Gaza health ministry said seven Palestinians were injured in the Israeli airstrikes  none of them seriously Gaza militants fired back  launching barrages of rockets into southern Israel  The Israeli military said it identified about 30 rocket launches from Gaza from dusk until 10 p m   when the cease fire was announced The rocket fire and the airstrikes appeared to taper off after that The Israeli authorities had ordered bomb shelters to be opened in cities as far north as Netanya on the Mediterranean coast  Most of the rockets or mortar shells were intercepted or fell in open ground Earlier Monday  the Israeli military said it was deploying an additional infantry brigade and an armored brigade to bolster forces around the Palestinian coastal territory  and was calling up a limited number of reservists from specialized units VideoDuring a meeting at the White House  President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel reinforced the close ties between their nations after a rocket launched from Gaza struck a house in central Israel CreditCreditDoug Mills The New York TimesThe flare up presented a test for Mr  Netanyahu  who also serves as Israel s defense minister and has made his national security credentials a cornerstone of his re election campaign Both Hamas and Israel have been avoiding another all out conflict since 50 days of fighting ended in the summer of 2014  but Mr  Netanyahu s political rivals have been denouncing what they call his lack of decisive action or clear policy regarding Gaza  despite several recent rounds of violence A strong response could protect Mr  Netanyahu politically while helping restore his reputation as a national security hawk  But a prolonged conflict that could put Israelis under heavy rocket fire and cause Israeli casualties could damage his political campaign Perhaps seeking a balance  the military bombed high profile buildings in Gaza that appeared to have been vacated by Hamas ahead of the attacks  They included Hamas s Internal Security offices  a five story building in the Rimal neighborhood where the group interrogates Palestinians belonging to extremist groups or suspected of collaborating with Israel  Israeli bombers also destroyed the office of Hamas s leader  Ismail Haniya There were no immediate reports of fatalities on either side Already facing indictment for bribery and other corruption charges  Mr  Netanyahu  who has long presented himself as Israel s security czar  is in a tight election race with his chief rival  Benny Gantz  a retired military chief of staff Mr  Gantz  who was also visiting Washington  criticized Mr  Netanyahu for allowing the situation in Gaza to fester  The reality in which Hamas turned Israel into a hostage is unprecedented and unfathomable   he wrote on Twitter   Netanyahu has to pack up now and return to Israel to handle this serious escalation  ImageBenny Gantz  a retired Israeli general and a political rival of Mr  Netanyahu  speaking during the AIPAC annual meeting in Washington on Monday CreditJim Watson Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesAt the United Nations  Stéphane Dujarric  a spokesman for Secretary General António Guterres  called the rocket strike on Israel  a serious and unacceptable violation   and urged all sides to  exercise maximum restraint  in the long simmering conflict  A further escalation is likely to make a bad situation worse   he said Magen David Adom  an Israeli rescue service  said it had treated seven people for burns  blast injuries and shrapnel wounds in Mishmeret  as well as several others suffering stress symptoms  The wounded included two children and an infant  the service reported Eli Bin  the director of Magen David Adom  said at the scene that the event had ended  miraculously with only light to moderate injuries  Maj  Mika Lifshitz  a spokeswoman for the Israeli military  said the rocket had been manufactured by Hamas  had a range of about 75 miles and was fired from Rafah at the southern end of the Gaza Strip  meaning it probably had reached its maximum range Though incoming rocket sirens sounded in Mishmeret  sending residents rushing to bomb shelters shortly before the rocket struck  there was no interception attempt by Israel s Iron Dome air defense system  Iron Dome protects the areas in which it is deployed   Major Lifshitz said  refusing to elaborate  but suggesting that the system did not cover Mishmeret The rocket attack came less than two weeks after Israel and Hamas worked to de escalate tensions after two rockets from Gaza were fired at Tel Aviv  One struck open ground near the suburb of Holon  The other may have exploded in midair or fallen into the sea ImageA house north of Tel Aviv that was hit by a rocket on Monday CreditYair Sagi ReutersIn that attack  Hamas and Islamic Jihad  a more militant group in Gaza that also possesses long range rockets  distanced themselves from the rocket fire  and the Israeli military accepted an explanation that the two rockets had been launched  by mistake   possibly because of a technical error Eran Lerman  a former deputy director of Israel s National Security Council and now vice president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security  a research group  said the latest rocket attack was  no longer something that can be explained away as a mistake or a technical failure  He told reporters that the militant groups in Gaza may have come to  the very dangerous conclusion that Israel s hands may be tied because of the impending elections on April 9 and that the prime minister and his government would be very wary about taking action so close to an election which could lead to a broad scale confrontation   Hamas  he warned  was  playing with fire  In Gaza  Hamas has come under harsh criticism for its recent violent crackdown on protesters demonstrating against harsh living conditions in the territory Mr  Netanyahu came under immediate attack from political rivals from the right  left and center The New Right party  led by the ministers Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked  said in a statement   Israel s deterrence has collapsed and it has to be said in all honesty  Netanyahu has failed against Hamas  The leader of the Israeli Labor Party  Avi Gabbay  and his No  2  Tal Rousso  a retired general  went to Mishmeret  where Mr  Gabbay denounced Mr  Netanyahu as a  failed prime minister and defense minister  and a man of  talk and not actions  Mr  Wolf  whose house in Mishmeret was destroyed  was wandering around in a daze on Monday  a bottle of beer in hand  The roof was blown off his single story house and the yard was strewn with rubble  A lemon tree heavy with fruit and a plastic children s swing were untouched His son  Daniel  30  had fallen asleep watching a soccer game on television  He heard the incoming rocket siren at around 5 20 a m  and woke up the rest of the family  who rushed into a safe room  He saved our lives  no doubt   Mr  Wolf said Mr  Wolf said he did not want to talk politics  But he said   I don t want anyone killed because of me  Nobody  I don t look for revenge   

ZAMBOANGA  Philippines   She was a Catholic math whiz with an M B A  from one of the best universities in the Philippines  He was the Muslim descendant of a sultanate family  schooled in computer science The couple  Ellen Barriga and Mohammad Reza Kiram  could have served as the model of a modern interfaith marriage  Instead  they are poster children for how violent ideology transformed educated Filipinos into agents of death for the Islamic State In 2015  Ms  Barriga and Mr  Kiram traveled to Syria to join the terrorist group  becoming key recruiters of other Southeast Asians  according to Philippine and American intelligence officials In January  American backed Syrian forces announced that the pair had surrendered  joining thousands of foreign militants caught between a crumbled caliphate  which lost its last territory in the region on Saturday  and home countries reluctant to take them back A year after arriving in Syria  Mr  Kiram  wavy haired with jutting cheekbones  appeared in a video for the Islamic State  In it  he and a Malaysian and Indonesian urged foreigners to wage jihad in Muslim parts of the Philippines  where the Islamic State has been gaining strength  Worshipers of the cross   he warned   we will use the language of swords and language of bullets  Our brothers in the path of Allah will soon rise in your own land  Holding a dagger  Mr  Kiram then beheaded a hostage kneeling in front of him Last year  the United States Treasury Department placed sanctions on Mr  Kiram  29  for  brutal acts as part of a propaganda campaign to attract radicals to join militant terrorist groups in Southeast Asia  Ms  Barriga  who converted to Islam after earning an accounting degree  has been accused by the Philippine authorities of channeling Islamic State funds to local militants and aiding in a failed bombing attempt in the southern Philippine city of Davao ImageA mosque in Zamboanga  Mr  Kiram s family worried that he was attending a hard line mosque associated with Tablighi Jamaat  a missionary movement from South Asia that has been accused of nurturing militants CreditJes Aznar for The New York TimesHer Christian name helped Ms  Barriga  38  set up bank accounts and avoid suspicion even as she was gravitating to the most radical fringes of Islam  the intelligence operatives said Sitting at home in Davao  Edgar Barriga  Ms  Barriga s father  said he was relieved to hear news of his daughter  even though he was devastated by her chosen path  I am happy if she is with ISIS in Syria   he said   because at least that way I know my Ellen is alive  A movement like the Islamic State needs two types of people  rank and file recruits  often poor and uneducated fodder for battle  and ideologues who can entice the masses to their cause  Mr  Kiram and Ms  Barriga were in the latter camp  smart  charming  well connected  We need to figure out how people like Reza Kiram  with no prior indication  become violent extremists   said Col  Leonel Nicolas  the commander of the joint task force in the southern city of Zamboanga  where Mr  Kiram grew up Even to their closest family and friends  the couple s path to radicalization is indistinct  There were no defining traumas or fractures with society  only small signs that  in retrospect  hinted at trouble  too much time spent online  perhaps  or a fearlessness that could ripen into fanaticism  I feel regret whenever I think of him because he was such a good student   said Sheikh Mahir Gustaham  who taught Mr  Kiram Islamic jurisprudence and considered him his favorite pupil   For me it s a lesson learned  to watch closely and intently the good and quiet students because they may change  Ms  Barriga grew up in a tidy neighborhood in Davao  attending the parish church of St  Michael  named after the archangel who defends the Christian faith against demonic forces  Her father worked for a cocoa company  Her mother volunteered at church ImageAyub

and organizing dances  She won a scholarship to the prestigious Ateneo de Davao University and worked as an accounting manager after graduation She had a Muslim boyfriend and converted  wearing a head scarf in public  The Virgin Mary  Ms  Barriga explained to her parents  wore a veil  so why shouldn t she Ms  Barriga s mother  Fely Barriga  consulted with their parish priest   He told me that I should let her go to Islam   she recalled   She would come back to the church when she was ready  After Ms  Barriga married Mr  Kiram  her parents saw their son in law only once  for 10 minutes in a hospital corridor after Ms  Barriga gave birth to a daughter Whenever her parents visited  there were excuses for his absence  Mr  Kiram was sourcing seafood  Ms  Barriga would explain  He was always busy with the dried fish and sea cucumbers   Fely Barriga said   I didn t want to ask too many questions  In 2015  the couple said they were moving to Zamboanga  a city on a southern tendril of the island of Mindanao  It was the last time Ms  Barriga s parents saw their daughter That same year  unknown to their families  Mr  Kiram and Ms  Barriga took a flight to Turkey  via Japan  and made their way overland to Syria with their daughter  according to the intelligence officials ImageEdgar and Fely Barriga  the parents of Ellen Barriga  at home in the southern Philippine city of Davao   I am happy if she is with ISIS in Syria   Mr  Barriga said   because at least that way I know my Ellen is alive  CreditJes Aznar for The New York TimesMs  Barriga called home regularly  but she forbade her parents to call back  When they tried anyway  the number wouldn t connect In 2017  Ms  Barriga asked for her father s assistance with a bank account that had been flagged following what the bank called a suspicious large transaction  Mr  Barriga went to the bank to unfreeze the account  which he confirmed to the police  She is my daughter   he said   It s natural to help your daughter  The Kiram family is royalty in Zamboanga  descendants of a Muslim sultanate that ruled a chain of islands stretching toward Malaysia  When Spanish colonialists arrived in the 16th century  most of the Philippines converted to Catholicism  but the southern part retained its Muslim roots Mr  Kiram s father was a businessman  His mother  like so many educated women in the Philippines  worked overseas  as a nurse in Saudi Arabia  As a result of his mother s foreign income  Mr  Kiram s life was comfortable  but he lacked parental discipline  his family said Mr  Kiram attended the Filipino Turkish Tolerance School  a private academy for Muslim and Christian students in Zamboanga  a frontier city with a long history of bombings and militant sieges For his younger cousins  Mr  Kiram  who went on to study computers at a technical institute  was a role model  always surrounded by a posse of friends  More than anything  Mr  Kiram distinguished himself through his staunch defense of his morals  said one cousin  who did not want to be named because he feared being stigmatized for his infamous relative The cousin found out about Mr  Kiram s radicalization when he saw news about the Islamic State video on television   It was the biggest shock of my life   he said Sheikh Gustaham  Mr  Kiram s former Islamic teacher  was impressed with his linguistic talent  Malay  Turkish  Arabic  English and a number of Filipino languages ImageMs  Barriga s high school in Davao  where she led student government and organized dances CreditJes Aznar for The New York Times In my opinion  he was brilliant   Sheikh Gustaham said After about a year of study  Mr  Kiram questioned his teacher about things he was reading online  the persecution of Palestinians  Syrians and Muslim Filipinos  His family worried that he was attending a hard line mosque associated with Tablighi Jamaat  a missionary movement from South Asia that has been accused of nurturing militants At the hard line mosque last month  Ayub Julpawai  the head imam  said he was unconcerned the Islamic State had bombed a church in the southern Philippines in January  killing 23 people  He also shrugged at the Philippine military s bombardment of Muslim communities in an effort to catch the perpetrators  The military campaign is a punishment from Allah because some Muslims no longer follow the way of Islam   he said The Philippine police now say that Mr  Kiram  known by the alias Abdul Rahman  was involved in the 2012 bombing of a bus terminal in Zamboanga That year  Mr  Kiram helped produce a militant video that was the first in the Philippines to use the black flag later associated with the Islamic State as a backdrop  according to Rommel Banlaoi  author of the upcoming book  Terrorism in the Philippines  From Al Qaeda to ISIS  The 2016 Islamic State video from Syria  with Mr  Kiram echoing the cadences of a preacher  was so slickly made that the Philippine military uses it in an internal course on effective propaganda Meanwhile  Ms  Barriga was making alliances with other Balik Islam  as people who convert from Christianity to Islam are known in the Philippines In 2012  Mr  Kiram and Ms  Barriga were arrested in connection with a foiled bombing plot in which an Indonesian man and his Balik Islam wife were accused of trying to target a night market in Davao  The Indonesian was shot and killed by the police  His wife  Mr  Kiram and Ms  Barriga were all released for lack of evidence It is not clear what will happen now to Mr  Kiram and Ms  Barriga  who are believed to be in a Syrian prison camp teeming with foreign militants  The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on their case In Zamboanga  Sheikh Gustaham and other moderate Muslims who knew Mr  Kiram are nervous  Clerics promoting interfaith events have gotten death threats  He may call on all Islamic teachers and tell them I am not a real Muslim   Sheikh Gustaham said of his once favorite student   It s frightening   

New York s government has never looked so female After record numbers of women ran and won in November  there are now 70 women in the State Legislature  the most women ever to serve in the state s lawmaking body   But 2019 is not just a historic year for women in Albany  it s also a historical one  Exactly 100 years ago  the state s first ever female legislators arrived in the Capitol  making New York the first state east of the Mississippi River to have women writing laws   New Yorkers also played a role in the eight frontier states that had already elected women  Of the three women who became the first ever female state legislators in Colorado in 1894  two were originally from New York City  In the century since  New York s female lawmakers have steered conversations on reproductive rights  child care  education  labor and far more  Their bills have often inspired change on the national level  They have also made clear how far New York still has to go  Even today  women make up only 32 9 percent of the Legislature  That makes New York 15th in the nation for female representation   Only Nevada is half female   Women still tell of sexual harassment and discrimination Nevertheless  for 100 years  they have persisted  Here are some of their stories 1919Two trailblazers arrive in AlbanyNew York s first female legislators arrived at the State Assembly chambers on Jan  1  1919  The armed guard couldn t believe it  You must go to the other door  lady  This door is for members of the Assembly   he told Ida Sammis  according to her written account of that day CreditI was thrilled by the opportunity for service which my new office gave me  yet sobered too  by a sense of my responsibility  as a pioneer  in the law making body of our State IDA SAMMISThe election of Ms  Sammis  from Long Island  and Mary Lilly  from New York City  directly followed women winning the right to vote in New York in 1917  The women s suffrage movement had deep roots in their state  most famously at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention  and New York was the first eastern state to grant women voting rights  Eleven western states and the Alaska territory had legalized women s suffrage before New York s law predated the 19th Amendment  which guaranteed women s suffrage nationally  by three years Within 14 days of her arrival in Albany  Ms  Sammis  a Republican  became the first woman to sponsor a bill into law  when Gov  Alfred E  Smith signed her bill to regulate the hunting season for water fowl She also attracted attention for her spittoon  a vessel that male legislators used to spit out chewing tobacco  Ms  Sammis had no use for hers   so she filled it with ferns instead  a story that female legislators still tell today Ms  Lilly  a Democrat  sponsored a number of bills that might seem bold even today  One would have forced the fathers of children born out of wedlock to pay child support  Others would have abolished the death penalty for minors  and required

1920s  But then the Great Depression  followed by the wartime frenzy of the 1940s  pushed women into public life  In the Assembly  the number of women peaked in 1947 at eight   the highest number until 1975 In 1933  New York passed a minimum wage law barring employers from paying women  oppressive and unreasonable wages   The law was critical in the nation s labor fight  It was the first state minimum wage law after the Supreme Court in 1923 ruled such laws unconstitutional  The court would eventually strike down New York s new law too  but the backlash paved the way for a federal minimum

pass to the ladies  room  recalled Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein  who was first elected in 1980 and is the longest serving woman in Assembly history At one point  the women presented the Assembly s leadership with a pink toilet seat After session ended that year  the men s room was split in two  with one for women CreditHans Pennink Associated PressWhen this building was built  there was not anticipation that there would ever be women serving in the chamber HELENE WEINSTEINThe number of female legislators surged in these decades  Between 1979 and 1983  the number nearly doubled  to 22 up from 13  Then came the so called Year of the Woman  the name commentators and historians gave to 1992  when more new women won seats in Congress than in any previous decade  The phenomenon arrived in Albany  too  Between 1991 and 1993  the number of female lawmakers jumped to 34 from 28  the biggest ever two year increase until 2017 After decades of serving only on  women s issue  committees  such as social services  they won important posts on other powerful bodies  such as the judicial  education and ways and  means committees Still  many of their male colleagues saw them as something of a novelty  After Nancy Larraine Hoffmann  a former model and go go dancer  won a Senate seat in 1984  The New York Post called her the  most beautiful woman lawmaker to reach the Capitol in decades

wave or a fourth wave  of feminism   women ran for and won elected office in record numbers last year  in New York and around the country It s not just the numbers that are newsworthy  though they are  Twenty women in the State Senate and 50 in the Assembly  the most ever in both chambers  many of whom unseated incumbents and bucked the wisdom of talking heads There s also the staggering array of diversity that these women bring  Senator Andrea Stewart Cousins  the head of the Senate Democrats  is the first woman to lead a New York legislative chamber  and Assemblywoman Crystal Peoples Stokes

The video of the Christchurch mosque killings portrays the murder of innocent people from the perspective of their killer  who also used it to disseminate his racist motivations and genocidal worldview  The recording was made with that intention   to spread  This  Facebook said  was among the reasons the company couldn t quickly eliminate the footage from its platform  which the killer chose as his medium for his broadcast  In the first 24 hours we removed 1 5 million videos of the attack globally  of which over 1 2 million were blocked at upload   Facebook said publicly on March 16  On March 20  the company elaborated on its efforts  explaining that existing  content matching  systems and artificial intelligence hadn t been able to stop the video s spread because the content itself had morphed so many times   The company also acknowledged criticism that it should have done a better job  Facebook can explain why such a video isn t welcome on its platform  and how they removed it  It can gesture blame  as it did  at  coordination by bad actors  who seek to re share the video with as many people as possible  But its other explanations suggest the company was also thwarted by a much larger and less organized group  the Facebook users behind the rest of that 1 5 million   the people who  as the company said  might have been  filming the broadcasts on TV  capturing videos from websites  filming computer screens with their phones  or just re sharing a clip they received   People wanted to see this  People wanted to share this  Elsewhere online  other platforms were also scrambling  Reddit banned a community called WatchPeopleDie  which had been active for the last seven years and attracted more than 400 thousand subscribers  after some of its volunteer moderators  already under increased scrutiny  refused to take down copies of the Christchurch attack  Liveleak  a YouTube style video site  compared the shooting video to the  glossy promo videos for ISIS  and said that it wouldn t  indulge  the shooter by hosting his recording  Liveleak  however  was far more frank about its users  desires   We ve received no small number of complaints regarding the fact we will not carry the video   the website said in a post   We fully understand some people will be very unhappy with this decision   Liveleak isn t the sort of site where you just happen upon something horrific  horrific videos are what its users  dedicated or casual  come there to see  Since 2006  under the tagline  Redefining the Media   the site has functioned as a smaller  grislier YouTube  with a stated emphasis on news adjacent footage that depicts war  crime or terrorism  Now nearly 15 years old  it still gets between 16 and 20 million unique visitors a month  with surges accompanying a rare viral sensation  a video of a plane landing sideways in heavy wind  or  more often  a spasm of well documented violence  It positions itself as an unfiltered companion to the mainstream media  but Liveleak has its roots in the culture of  shock  or  gore  sites  Its launch corresponded with the shutdown of its predecessor  Ogrish  on Halloween of 2006  at site that had  along with sites like Rotten com and Stile Project  openly reveled in the prurience of what it was sharing  Some shock sites presented photos and videos of death and violence in the manner of  and sometimes alongside  pornography  Rotten com accompanied shocking imagery with morbid news  essays and a reference  library  of dark esoterica  In its early days  Ogrish hosted footage of the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks A  Desire  to Transmit TraumaWhat were viewers getting out of videos of death  Of murder and massacre  Of car crashes  medical mishaps and workplace accidents  In a 2008 study of the Ogrish forums  Sue Tait  a professor formerly at the University of Canterbury  in Christchurch  New Zealand  identified four different  spectatorial positions  for viewers  There were those for whom the suffering on display was a source of stimulation  for whom shock and horror amounted to a form of pleasure  There were viewers who expressed vulnerability  sadness or empathy  There were viewers who said they were watching to prepare themselves for something   a deployment  a difficult job   and thought they could usefully desensitize themselves  And finally  there were viewers who seemed to see what they were doing as necessary  as a courageous or somehow countercultural act   against the media  against censorship   or in the service of witnessing some sort of truth  In an interview  Dr  Tait recalled how some users would judge videos in shallow aesthetic terms  and describe how they would get more of a  rush  from certain types of videos over others   We knew people could desensitize themselves over time   she said   But here we saw people doing that intentionally    Some people would talk about the way they enjoyed them  and how their enjoyment reduced over time   she said   But the things they were saying they enjoyed were symptoms of post traumatic stress   They were describing anxiety  They were reexperiencing their time on the site  as one might after a trauma  but describing this with a sense of accomplishment  Further  Dr  Tait said   I noticed a desire to transmit that trauma to other people  so that you could have other people to talk about it with   This called to mind recent conversations she d had with fellow Christchurch residents  one of whom had told her in a brief encounter at the supermarket that he d watched the shooter s video twice  He spoke abstractly about how it hadn t affected him as much as he had expected   It reminded me of people on Ogrish   Dr  Tait said   It felt to me that this guy who was watching it was a bit disappointed  Experts almost universally advise against casting the consumption of violent footage as a fringe phenomenon  Jennifer Malkowski  an assistant professor of film and media studies at Smith College  who uses they them pronouns and is the author of  Dying in Full Detail  Mortality and Digital Documentary   pointed out that Liveleak  which is just one of many sources for such footage  is ranked by the web tracking firm Alexa as the 695th biggest site in the world  right alongside The Onion  Jezebel  and Forever21  Mainstream internet platforms have thrown vast amounts of money and labor  much of it invisible  at removing nightmarish content  hiring thousands of content moderators to identify and remove often traumatic and illegal content  But  they re circulated by many many people   they said   I think when you see those numbers from Facebook  you re confronted with that reality   You realize that these videos aren t circulated by a few maladjusted individuals   they added   To be focusing on the tech platforms is kind of like an imported crisis   said Barbie Zelizer  a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of  About To Die  How News Images Move the Public   She said   You cant extricate one part of the media environment from the rest   Conversations and norms around representing death  violence and terrorism in media span generations and mediums   She notes in her book that Google experienced an extended surge of search for footage of a 2004 beheading of an American in Iraq   Norms about what should be shown on television and in newspapers   which Dr  Zelizer says have become more conservative   have given way to debates about tech platforms   There s no question that images have impact   she said   But we don t know what that impact is  not in a way that could propel some sort of reasoned set of responses  The big tech platforms  in other words  are inheriting  with much else  a problem that was once understood as the media s  But services like Facebook are far larger than any individual newspaper  Big social media platforms have inherited much of the rest of the web and it s users   including the ones who might have spent time on a site like Ogrish  Violence and More  Made for SharingThere are still plenty of videos of viscerally awful things on Liveleak  There are also a lot of videos about immigration  about how the media is attacking Donald Trump  about  political correctness  and about Islam  It s one of the few platforms that still hosts videos from Infowars  which was banned from YouTube and Facebook last year  although they do not appear to garner many views  The remaining founder  Hayden Hewitt  who made the decision not to host the Christchurch video  acknowledged that Liveleak s audience leans right  and that a racist contingent has found a home on the site   Yes  people who want to see these things will be drawn to it   he said   It s as plain as the nose on your face  He described racism as  the epitome of stupidity   but recited familiar complaints about the extremes of  both sides     If you criticize the Israeli government  some people will claim you re anti Semitic because of that  And if you criticize radical Islam  you re often accused of being Islamophobic   he said   He hosts an internet show called  Trigger Warning   on which he laments the rise of political correctness  He told me he believes that conservative speech is being suppressed on larger internet platforms  and that as long as that s true  its users will trend even further to the right  On shock sites  extreme violence often pairs with extreme politics  Whether witnessing the worst breeds particular views or spaces catering to one taboo invite others is less obvious  But Dr  Tait remembers racism as central to the community on Ogrish  as well   One of the most popular threads was a thread about white supremacy   she remembered   It was a lengthy debate that was really trying to give a scientific basis for racism    A lot of people talked about the reason for watching beheading videos  for example  as really wanting to see what the enemy was capable of   she said   And it was very associated with the right  and with the hatred of Arabs  In a 2017 article for Participations  a media studies journal  the writer Mike Alvarez wrote of BestGore  another large shock site   It is apparent from the data that BestGore users do not view all human lives as equal   Comments  often presented as jokes   betray a view of humanity in which the life of the  other  is deemed less valuable  if not valueless   he wrote  On many shock sites  videos portraying police interactions  including shootings that elsewhere have inspired activist movements and debates about racism in law enforcement  are viewed as a case of the victims getting what they deserve  After it was branded an alternative to mainstream news  Liveleak became popular with American soldiers deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq  and accumulated a library of footage of violence unfolding in Middle East  often posted with minimal context  There is footage from drones  of the aftermath of firefights  of mangled bodies  There is a lot of footage of cartel violence  though  as common on such sites  attribution is sparse and often unreliable  and the dead are treated as interchangable sources of content   The most popular post of all time on the site  according to Mr  Hewitt  was the cellphone video of the execution of Saddam Hussein   In 2008  when the anti immigrant Dutch politician Geert Wilders wanted to distribute his short film  Fitna  which intercut gory footage of the aftermath of terrorist attacks with an anti Islam polemic  he chose Liveleak    I put my life in danger for a man I disagree with on every level   Mr  Hewitt said of his decision to host Mr  Wilders film   But if sites like Liveleak ever had a case to make for showing audiences what the rest of the media won t  their argument has  in the last ten years  become more complicated  In 2019  videos of human suffering are recorded  like many videos  with a clear intention to share   and with a specific plan to do so  outside of any sort of professional or shared ethical context  Shock imagery  and violent imagery  isn t just sought out  it s hurled at people as a tool of harassment or intimidation  in service of ideology or of misinformation  Today  Liveleak is less a wire service than a macabre aggregator  Rotten com is offline  perhaps forever  On anonymous message boards such as 4chan   or 8chan  where the Christchurch shooter shared his manifesto   images of human death are deployed frequently  and easily  for shock value  And while millions of people still decide to go out of their ways to shock themselves  to  bear witness  or revel in the pain of others  it s also true that recorded death and murder has new ways to find them  Contrary to suggestions that the Christchurch shooter enacted a sophisticated media plan based on some keen sense of how the internet works  what he really did was horribly much simpler  he opened the most popular app in the world  pressed a button and shared  

Good Sunday morning  and welcome to a special edition of the DealBook Briefing  where we ll take a deep dive into Lyft s upcoming public offering  It s the first of many decacorns about to go public   Was this email forwarded to you  Sign up here  And   they re off Lyft plans to make its public market debut in the coming week  The car sharing company s I P O  will be the first of many highly valued tech companies that are expected to hit American stock exchanges this year Uber  Slack  Postmates and Pinterest have all filed documents with the S E C  to list shares  Palantir  Peloton and possibly Airbnb are expected to follow later this year America s most successful start ups have remained off limits to most investors for years   Venture capital cash allowed America s current wave of unicorns to eschew the public markets   and the spotlight that comes with them   That means a large portion of investors have been unable to buy a slice of the fastest growing start ups With Lyft s I P O   that s about to change  which explains much of the excitement it is generating  Here s your cheat sheet for the offering                             Today s DealBook Briefing was written by Stephen Grocer in New York and edited by Jamie Condliffe in London                             How Lyft s business stacks upFounded by Logan Green and John Zimmer in 2007  Lyft was initially called Zimride and focused on pooling riders for long distance trips  In 2012  Mr  Green and Mr  Zimmer renamed the company Lyft and shifted the business toward providing short trips  mimicking taxi rides Here s how it sizes up today   Lyft gave 18 6 million people at least one ride in the last quarter of 2018  up from 6 6 million in late 2016   It has a 39 percent share of the United States ride sharing market   based on estimates by the Japanese e commerce company Rakuten  which is an investor in Lyft  That is up from 22 percent in 2016  But Lyft has been offering discounts to riders ahead of its offering  and the company warned   We believe that much of the growth in our rider base and the number of drivers on our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives    Lyft only operates in the U S  and Canada  unlike Uber  which has operations across the globe   But it has matched its rival s innovation  by developing self driving car technology and expanding into short term bike and scooter rentals Its plan for the offeringLyft will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker of  er   LYFT  The company expects to be valued at as much as  23 billion  It plans to sell about 35 4 million shares  including the additional shares allotted to the underwriters  at between  62 to  68 a piece  At the high end of that range  it will raise  2 4 billion That s well above the  15 1 billion that private investors valued it at during a financing round in June And it would make it one of the largest I P O s in the past 10 years  At a  23 billion valuation  Lyft s offering would rank as the fifth largest since the financial crisis  and among the largest ever for American technology start ups   only Facebook s I P O  in 2012 would be larger Image JPMorgan Chase  Credit Suisse and Jefferies are the lead underwriters of the I P O  for Lyft  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley  the top underwriters of tech I P O s recently  are both working on Uber s offering In all  Lyft will have 29 underwriters for its I P O   13  or 45 percent  of which are firms owned or led by women  minorities and military veterans  By comparison  such firms accounted for 30 percent of the underwriters Facebook selected for its I P O  and 14 percent for Snap s Lyft s vision for maintaining controlAfter going public  the company will have two classes of stock  class A shares  which carry one vote each  and class B shares  which carry 20 votes  Lyft plans to sell only class A shares in the offering Lyft s two founders will hold the Class B shares  That means that Mr  Green  the C E O   and Mr  Zimmer  the president  will own roughly 5 percent of the company s outstanding stock but control nearly 49 percent of its voting shares This is quite normal in Silicon Valley  Facebook and Google went public with a dual class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share  Snap went further  It issued only nonvoting shares during its 2017 I P O But the practice is increasingly controversial among governance experts  Kenneth Bertsch  the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors  said in a letter to Lyft s outside board members   The principle of one share  one vote is a foundation of good corporate governance and equitable treatment of investors  Companies with dual class stock structures outperformed those with a single stock structure in recent years  according to some studies  But prior to 2010  studies show  such companies didn t perform as well A look at Lyft s booksLyft is growing quickly  Its revenue more than doubled to  2 16 billion last year from 2017 Its losses are also increasing  though not nearly as quickly  The company reported a loss of  911 million last year  up from  688 million in 2017  Total costs and expenses were  3 1 billion in 2018  up 77 percent from  1 8 billion in 2017 Image Uber s losses are smaller in percentage terms  Lyft s rival  which has disclosed its finances for several years even though it is not public  said in February that it lost  1 8 billion in 2018 on net revenue of  11 3 billion Bookings  which represent  fares less taxes  tolls and tips  surpassed  8 billion last year for Lyft  76 percent more than in 2017   In 2018  Uber increased its bookings to  50 billion  up 45 percent from 2017  Lyft plans to funnel some future profits into ethical investing  In its pitch to investors  it says it expects  to invest the greater of 1  of our profits or  50 million annually toward our social impact efforts  What can go wrong The risk factor section of any I P O  prospectus acts as a warning label for investors  Lyft s is no different  but it offers a discussion of regulatory and data security issues that could become a recurring theme in this year s I P O s Rivals  The company faces a long list of competitors on several fronts  Uber  Gett  along with its acquisition Juno  and Via are its main ride sharing rivals  along with regular taxi companies and automotive manufacturers  such as BMW  that are looking to enter the sector  Its bike and scooter sharing business faces competition from Lime  Bird and Uber s acquisition Jump  And Waymo  Apple  Baidu  Uber and a number of other tech and auto companies compete with it on autonomous vehicles Regulation  Lyft says its industry is  rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated   It warns investors that it has  been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipal regulatory authorities across the United States and Canada  and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ride sharing  Labor  Lyft s million plus drivers are independent contractors  not employees  Legal actions that classify them as employees  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations   the company says Autonomous driving  Among the biggest risks involved in the push to driverless cars is getting beaten in the race  The first companies to offer autonomous ride sharing  are expected to have long term advantages compared with traditional non autonomous ride sharing offerings   Lyft says Who s going to get rich For Lyft s current shareholders and employees  the I P O  could provide a windfall  Here s a rundown of who stands to gain   Mr  Green and Mr  Zimmer will hold stakes in the company that are set to be worth  570 million and  390 million  respectively   The Japanese e commerce giant Rakuten is Lyft s biggest shareholder  with a 13 percent stake  At  68 a share  its holdings would be valued at  2 1 billion  It will own 11 6 percent of Lyft s stock after the I P O   General Motors invested  500 million in Lyft in 2016  That stake could be worth as much as  1 27 billion at the time of the I P O   The fund giant Fidelity is Lyft s third largest shareholder  Its stake could be worth as much as  1 26 billion   Alphabet owns 12 828 964 shares  most of them purchased by its venture capital arm  CapitalG  That stake is worth  870 million at the high end of the range   The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz was among the earliest investors in Lyft  At  68 a share  the firm s stake will be valued at just over  1 billion Inside Lyft s boardGovernments and money managers have made a push to improve gender diversity on corporate boards  Last fall  California  where Lyft is headquartered  became the first state to require its publicly held corporations to include women on their boards Lyft will have three women on its board   Valerie Jarrett  The former senior adviser to President Barack Obama has been on Lyft s board since July 2017   Maggie Wilderotter  The former chief executive of the telecom company Frontier Communications joined Lyft s board in May 2018   Ann Miura Ko  The co founder of Floodgate Fund  a venture capital firm  has served on the board since June 2016 Rounding out the board of directors are  its chairman  Sean Aggarwal  of Soar Capital  Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz  David Lawee of CapitalG  and Hiroshi Mikitani of Rakuten What everyone s saying about the I P O Lyft and Uber are unlike any other businesses  Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion writes  That  makes it difficult for potential investors to feel confident that they re paying the right price given the potential reward and the potential risk that the on demand ride business isn t financially viable or as large as optimists believe  Lyft s investors  will need to strap themselves in for what may be long periods of rather ugly numbers   according to Heard on the Street s Dan Gallagher  That s because  decacorns tend to share two characteristics  plenty of money and a propensity to spend it in a race to build up share   Investors may still want to decide between  Lyft and Uber  argues Richard Beales of Breakingviews   If their fear of missing out allows them to look past the absence of foreseeable profit at either company  though  it s hard to see any sensible course other than to put money on both   The last time a fast growing  lossmaking tech company tried this hard to persuade Wall Street to judge it by its own measure of profits  things didn t end well   the FT s Richard Waters writes  He is referring to Groupon And finally  its elevator pitchAn I P O  prospectus often features an idealistic  sometimes corny  letter from the company s founders about their vision for the firm  Here are a couple of choice cuts from Lyft s letter  The Y in Lyft  The why in what Lyft is doing is most important to us  as well as the cities and communities we serve  and it will always be our company s North Star  Lyft s mission is to  improve people s lives with the world s best transportation   Lyft has the opportunity to deliver one of the most significant shifts to society since the advent of the car  We do not take that lightly  and we intend to lead this shift with integrity  humanity and strong execution  Thanks for reading  We ll see you on Monday You can

 I ll be there in a few minutes   my 15 year old son shouted from his room   I m playing Xbox with a friend   Who s your friend   I inquired  A guy named Scuzzball   he replied  Oh  what s Scuzzball s real name   I asked  I have no idea   he said  slightly annoyed  Where s he from   I continued  Somewhere in Canada  I think   no  wait  maybe it s France  I don t really know  Oh  wait  it doesn t even matter  because Scuzzball just left the game and he s been replaced with a bot   That sucks   I tried to commiserate   Your buddy is replaced by artificial intelligence   It doesn t matter  Dad  it happens all the time  The game continues  My son s indifference about playing with a person or a bot is actually very typical of gamers these days  They refer to one another as  friends   but to me their bond looks very tenuous  I don t recognize any sense in which Scuzzball and my son are real friends  And that concerns me  I wonder whether the pre internet  face to face experience of friendship that I knew growing up will be lost to our post internet children  And I m not alone  Friendship has been an important part of our understanding of the  good life   as far back as we can trace the human story   The Epic of Gilgamesh   which is perhaps our oldest tale  written some 4 000 years ago  is a bromance of sorts between Gilgamesh and his beloved friend Enkidu  The Bible  too  celebrates friendship in the story of Naomi and Ruth  revealing Ruth s great loyalty and devotion despite the lack of blood ties  Each year  more and more of our lives take place in the digital space  The average teenager spends up to nine hours a day online  My freshman college students tell me they are actually on screens for around 12 hours a day  since almost all homework is also now online  According to a 2018 Pew report  nearly 90 percent of 18  to 29 year olds regularly use social media  In 2016  the American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy statement warning   Children who overuse online media are at risk of problematic internet use  and heavy users of video games are at risk of internet gaming disorder   Even Silicon Valley is growing skeptical about digital utopia  32 percent of tech professionals now believe digital life will harm our mental well being over the coming decade Around 2005  people reported that the average number of their strong friendships had dropped from three to two  At the end of a 2006 study  close to 25 percent of respondents said they didn t have anyone they could truly trust  More recent research suggests that these trends are persisting  as intimacy among teenagers is replaced by efficiency  The loss of intimacy  however  does not seem to be a concern among the young people actually growing up online  they report feeling socially supported by large networks of online  friends  whom they rarely or never see face to face  Getting  likes  and other forms of digital grooming from larger audiences validates their repeated self disclosures  But do these young people even know what they are missing  And does it matter  Social isolation has certainly increased in Japan  where half a million young people live as  hikikomori    recluses who don t leave their homes  And loneliness in Britain has increased enough that the government has created a  minister for loneliness   According to a new survey  86 percent of American and British citizens believe that  increased use of technology  is contributing to social isolation Some of the earliest philosophical work on friendship comes from Aristotle  who pointed out in his  Nicomachean Ethics  that friendships of pleasure and utility are easily formed but also easily abandoned because such bonds are flimsy  Deep friendship  by contrast  is when you care for your friend for her sake  not for any benefit you can accrue from the relation  This is selfless friendship  You can have only a couple of these friends because they require a lot of time  work and effort  and a general blending or intertwining of two lives  You have to clock time with these people  and you must make sacrifices for each other Classmates and workmates can become friends  as can fellow members of sports teams and musical groups  spouses  religious or military colleagues  and so on  These examples suggest that friendship needs three criteria for full realization  shared experience  loyalty and shared intentionality  or mental connection  What about in the digital sphere  Our online  friends    whether it s Scuzzball or the Facebook friend you ve never met   satisfy the intentionality criterion  because we communicate extensively with language and report to each other long term goals  disappointments  beliefs and other facets of mental life We can share experiences with a person online  but the experiences seem thin when compared with face to face experiences  Online adventures  social networking  gaming  can certainly strengthen friendship bonds that were forged in more embodied interactions  but can they create those bonds Teenagers playing  Call of Duty  with online teams  for example  are having collective emotional experiences  as in the case when my son s squad must work to capture the enemy s munitions  And these shared adventures strongly trigger the dopamine pleasure system  so it seems like there should be bonding  However  the online  friends  may be little more than dopamine dosing tools and easily replaced without much dissonance  Indeed  one doesn t even know who Scuzball is  or where he lives  or if he s a he  or if he is a person or a bot  The kind of presence required for deep friendship does not seem cultivated in many online interactions  Presence in friendship requires  being with  and  doing for   sacrifice   The forms of  being with  and  doing for  on social networking sites  or even in interactive gaming  seem trivial because the stakes are very low  More important  the  shared space  of digital life is disembodied space  We cannot really touch one another  smell one another  detect facial expressions or moods  and so on  Real bonding is more biological than psychological and requires physical contact  The emotional entanglement of real friendship produces oxytocin and endorphins in the brains and bodies of friends   cementing them together in ways that are more profound than other relationships It is possible that virtual reality and augmented reality technology will soon be able to generate such friendship forming experiences  Having embodied adventures with another person   even in a V R  suit   is more likely to trigger the deeper oxytocin based bonding  Current social networking  however  seems to privilege the shallow triggers of the brain s reward system  dopamine squirts in the ventral tegumental area  Perhaps the most defining feature of deep friendship is  doing for   as when my friend has my back in a combat situation or  more prosaically  brings me soup or medicine when I m sick  Only strong bonds  built through embodied mutual activities  have the power to motivate real sacrifices  But it is unclear why online  friends  would bother to do the hard work of friendship  When the going gets tough  wouldn t my disembodied online friend just retreat to frictionless virtual friends who have few needs and make few demands  When I asked my undergraduate students whether they had people in their lives who would bring them soup when they re sick  they laughed at my Stone Age query and said they d just order soup from GrubHub or UberEats In the end there are three possibilities regarding friendship and digital life  First  digital life replicates all of the essential criteria of friendship  so there s nothing to worry about  I sincerely doubt that  Alternatively  digital life fills and absorbs waking life time so that people do not engage in paradigm cases of friendship  like sports  collective arts  free range childhoods  etc    In this way  digital life contributes to certain kinds of social isolation  Or last  digital life produces false friendships  because they are relatively disembodied   In other words  young people do not know that they lack real friends Maybe our fears about technology are exaggerated  My son reminds me that the average American kid still gets an enormous amount of face to face social time in school every day  We hang out   he told me  when I asked what he does with his friends   During lunch and free time we play multiplayer games on our phones   he elaborated   and we talk about the girls and teachers  We help each other with homework  We insult each other and laugh at memes  and maybe pull some pranks  When I asked what makes a good friend  he said   Friends should have common interests  and I like it if the person is funny  I guess they should also be nice and loyal   but be able to give and take a good put down too  These modest criteria are pretty close to my own  In my own friendships  I m willing to accept that flawed attachments are better than none  so I guess I should extend the same realism to my son s generation In truth  the more I learn about online life  the more I begin to doubt my understanding of friendship altogether  It wouldn t be the first time I theorized something into a corner  I was surprised and moved  for example  to learn from a BBC report about a young man named Mats Steen whose body was severely disabled by Duchenne muscular dystrophy  Before his death at 25  he had accumulated many devoted friends in the virtual space of  World of Warcraft  as a well loved muscular avatar  On his blog  Steen wrote   There my handicap doesn t matter  my chains are broken and I can be whoever I want to be  In there I feel normal   Some of his closest friends online did not even know about his disability  and they became close because their nightly communications jumped straight over the usual biases of gender  race  religion  place  age  ability  and got on with the mysterious bonding of souls  via the shared minutiae of everyday struggle  Some of Steen s online friends flew to Norway from various countries to attend his funeral and pay respects to his family  As a measure of friendship  that s way more impressive than bringing someone soup Our worries about online life are inevitable  I suppose  We ve never seen anything quite like it in the social world before  But maybe  just maybe  the kids are all right  Maybe even that Scuzzball kid  RelatedHuman Contact Is Now a Luxury GoodMarch 23  2019Stephen Asma is a professor of

cracking up But a mere utensil is not enough to hold Jennifer Lopez s attention for long  Soon  J Lo swings back around to return her focus to A Rod  Their engagement is on deck  after all When I meet up with Mr  DeVito for an interview the next night at the Palm  he explains that he was not trying to come between J Rod  No  she had her eyes glued to him   Mr  DeVito says  laughing   But I think

Mr  Burton  who has directed the  DeVito trilogy   of the actor as top hatted ringmasters in  Batman Returns    Big Fish  and now  Dumbo    Mr  Burton says that the film  featuring a very woke circus

Maureen Dowd plays a game with Danny DeVito  Michael Keaton  who has a dastardly turn in  Dumbo  as an archcapitalist  says he marveled that when Mr  DeVito played Oswald Cobblepot  better known as

last month at the Walt Disney Studio  which is putting out  Dumbo  CreditJake Michaels for The New York TimesPioneering Meme LordIt is a measure of Mr  DeVito s magnetic presence that  despite his diminutive stature  he has said he was never bullied as a child  The first time he emerges from the dispatcher s cage in  Taxi   the audience erupts into shocked laughter  because his height is such a contrast with his character s outsize confidence and belligerence Mr  DeVito says his older sisters  Angie and Theresa  filled him with self esteem  Angie brought him into her salon and taught him to do hair  He was affectionately nicknamed  Mr  Dan   They loved me  yeah   he says   They treated me like a little prince  A former altar boy  he is described by friends as a Tasmanian devil   He has

blithely  but  I m not shy about taking my clothes off  I tell him about a young guy in Boston who is such a big fan that he bought a 1996 Chevy Lumina van and named it Vanny DeVito  He tattooed it on his leg and printed out bumper stickers of Mr  DeVito s face to hand out on a cross country trip He s unfazed   Oh  yeah   he says   I know about these things  They re all over the place  There was a girl last year who took me to her prom with the cardboard cutout of me  I was her date  I love all that stuff  You know  I did a movie called  The Van  one time  It was like a low budget people in a van movie  When a sophomore at SUNY Purchase constructed a DeVito altar made from trash in a men s room last year  Mr  DeVito tweeted   Your shrine honors me  My heart is filled with love and garbage  He was a pioneering meme lord with his  trollfoot  pictures of his right foot out and about  from moments of repose  drinking wine on the beach  to painted in rainbow colors to match his feather boa on a float at the Los Angeles pride parade last year  My first tweet was   My nuts are on fire    he recalls   And then what am I going to do  So I started taking pictures of my foot and sticking it

Over the Cuckoo s Nest    Matilda  and  War of the Roses   which he also directed  And he has produced several  including  Gattaca  and  Erin Brockovich  He bought a script sight unseen from a fledgling filmmaker in the 1990s because he had liked the young man s first movie script and wanted to do whatever was next   A year later   and it was a long year   he finally showed up with 155 pages   Mr  DeVito recalls   It said    Pulp Fiction  by Quentin Tarantino  Final Draft   So I sat down in a comfortable chair and I read it  And I was blown away by it  I thought it was hysterical  I tell him that  Dumbo  is well timed for a Trump era  when the circus  clown and elephant in the room metaphors are flying fast and thick  Mr  DeVito himself has referred to both the president and Democrats as  clowns    Except for Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  whom he hails as  a gift   Mr  DeVito  who likes to listen to  Democracy Now  and is reading  Democracy in Chains  The Deep History of the Radical Right s Stealth Plan for America   says he will campaign for Bernie Sanders  as he did in 2016  and that he d like to see him run with Tulsi Gabbard  If you look back on that election  a lot of his progressive ideas are accepted now   he says   Like free college education  Yale s not going to be free  we know that  right   Indeed we do  thanks to Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin   I didn t go to any college  Forgive the debt  so people can live their lives and not feel they re under a wet blanket  Let s let the sun shine  We have a beautiful country  We got a lot of resources  You know  Medicare for all  What s the big deal  Why not open that up  We got to take a big breath and move on and get out of this muck and mire  I don t wish anybody ill  but I think it would be a good thing to get a lot of people out of our government  Let them go fishing or someplace south  stick them on a farm somewhere  and get our country moving  The ones that are there now are really stinking up the joint  Many liberals in the Twittersphere regard Mr  DeVito s succinct 2013 tweet as certified platinum   Antonin Scalia retire bitch   Even more gratifying than when he went on  The View  in 2006  after a long night of downing Limoncello with Mr  Clooney  and blurted out that George W  Bush was a  numb nuts  and that he and his wife  Rhea Perlman  had enjoyed a wild night in the Lincoln Bedroom when Bill Clinton was president ImageWhat  me worry  DeVito has enjoyed playing maniacally mean characters CreditJake Michaels for The New York Times We re All Suffragettes He has occasionally leavened his loathsome but lovable little men by playing a romantic lead  But Mr  DeVito relishes villains  Not gangsters  but crazy con men and ne er do wells in black comedies I wonder if kids ever get scared if they see him on the street and realize he s the really mean dad from  Matilda   No  it s cool   he says   The mother usually says   He s O K  He s not going to hurt you   He says playing the Penguin was the biggest kick  even though a monkey went wild on the set   leapt at my balls and grabbed me  It was the scariest thing  They had to rip him off  Other than that  he recalls   It was a lot of fun  You got to put all the clothes on and the suit and the mask  It s like real commedia dell arte  We all hide behind masks anyway  And you add something else onto that  which is like a beak  flippers  and you live in the sewer and you drool black crap out of your mouth  He is very relieved that the monkey in  Dumbo  is C G I At 74  Mr  DeVito has separated from Ms  Perlman  his wife of 37 years  and splits his time between a house in Los Angeles and an apartment in New York  I get to see everybody   he says   I see Rhea  I see the kids  I just live apart  He said he hasn t checked out Tinder  adding dryly   I rely on the kindness of strangers  He seems carefree  Asked about the Net azon streampocalypse underway in Hollywood  where many people were privately breathing a sigh of relief that Netflix s  Roma  did not win the Oscar for best movie  Mr  DeVito shrugs  He caught only some of the Academy Awards on TV because he was busy barbecuing  I m just looking for a good story   he says   And a good book  And a good screenplay  Work with people that you like  Go to dinner  Go on vacation  Have a good time  Yeah  no stress  Vote for Bernie Sanders  He was equally nonchalant about the racial politics roiling the town in the wake of  Green Book  beating  BlacKkKlansman  for best picture  which caused Spike Lee to try to storm out of the auditorium  I have nothing to say about  Green Book  and  BlacKkKlansman    he says   But I do know that we are a bunch of racists  I ask Mr  DeVito  father to two daughters and a son  if Hollywood has changed in the wake of  MeToo ImageCreditJake Michaels for The New York Times The only thing I can say is I ve talked to women about this and what I come away with is four words   Women must be heard   That s my mantra  Is that five words  No  four words  It s like I say to my agent every day  the magic four words   Get me a job   Come on  Are studio moguls just waiting to resume their bad old ways when the umbrage abates  Well  we re all suffragettes   he says   We got to get women equal pay  We got to get  em on the map  We got to respect  em  We got to keep our hands off  em unless they beg for it  Mr  DeVito produced and acted in  Man on the Moon  with Jim Carrey  about the late comedian Andy Kaufman  who played Latka Gravas on  Taxi   He recalls the days when Kaufman used to belittle and then wrestle with women delivering U P S  packages to the  Taxi  set  He d say   Why are you taking a job away from a man  You should be in the kitchen cooking  You know how many men need a job  You re taking a job  Go on  what are you going to do  honey   And they would wrestle him  I actually thought  in hindsight  that Andy was having us on  Now that I know everything about him  it s not out of the question that Andy got a woman  got her a costume  gave her a big package with nothing in it  and had her act like a U P S  person  He says the best way to thrive in Hollywood is to not focus on all the jerks and talentless hacks and insecurities  It s like going through the jungle   he says   You hear all the sounds  Somebody s being eaten on the other side of a plant  But you got to just stay on your path  Before we go  Mr  DeVito takes a stab at teaching me how to hang a spoon on my nose   Clean it off first   he instructs   You have to breathe on it  something about the condensation  I tell him that I ll probably see him out on the road with Bernie Sanders  He ll be the tall one   Mr  DeVito says  and jauntily waves goodbye
