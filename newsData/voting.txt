TEL AVIV   An Israeli entrepreneur went the extra mile to vote in Tuesday s parliamentary election   7 401 of them  11 910 km   to be precise Offir Gutelzon said he and at least 100 other expatriates flew back from the San Francisco Bay Area to make their mark in the heated contest between veteran conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud party and a variety of center left challengers  The result was  however  a mixed bag for Gutelzon  a 44 year old tech CEO who lives in Silicon Valley Exit polls gave Likud s main rival  the Blue and White party led by former General Benny Gantz the lead  Netanyahu nevertheless still stood a better chance to form the next coalition government And the left wing opposition Labour party Gutelzon voted for was poised to shrink by nearly two thirds to seven members in the 120 strong parliament  according to exit polls   I seem to be optimistic that the total vote for the center left seems to be good  It is pretty exciting  We worked really hard to make  the  change   Gutelzon said  speaking at the Labour party s campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv Israel does not allow absentee ballots  but any citizen can cast a vote within the country  even if his or her home is elsewhere  Gutelzon said that his identity as an Israeli abroad  and discomfort with Netanyahu s policies  motivated his long trip  We ve seen over the last four years more and more extremist points of view coming to Israel from  the  right   Gutelzon said A looming graft indictment against Netanyahu has  made it much harder to be an ambassador  for Israel  he added Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing in the corruption scandal and taken credit for Israel s booming international start up scene Gutelzon  who stayed abroad during three previous elections  co founded a Facebook group called  Israelis in the Valley Go to Vote  to bring others in with him this time around  The group has several hundred members Any success Gutelzon might have had in drumming up expatriate votes might also be explained by the fact that this election comes 10 days before the Jewish festival of Passover  a time of homecoming for many Israelis   We came to visit for Passover  and along the way  we ll vote   said Roi Zaltzman  a 40 year old realtor who lives in Denmark  after he flew in to Tel Aviv s Ben Gurion Airport   Reporting by Rami Ayyub  Editing by Tom Brown  

ISTANBUL ANKARA   President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party  AKP  will demand a new vote in Istanbul  a senior party official said on Tuesday after its bid was rejected for a citywide recount of March 31 election results that appeared to hand the party defeat  Initial results show the main opposition Republican People s Party  CHP  narrowly won control of Turkey s biggest city in the mayoral elections  seemingly bringing an end to the 25 year rule there by the AKP and its Islamist predecessors Since the vote  the AKP has filed a series of requests for recounts in the city  Overnight  the High Election Board  YSK  rejected a request to recount all votes across 31 of Istanbul s districts  the party s representative at the YSK said The YSK agreed only to a recount of 51 ballot boxes  spread across 21 of the city s total 39 districts  but the AKP called this decision  unfathomable  Speaking to reporters in Istanbul  AKP Deputy Chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said his party would file an extraordinary appeal to the YSK for a fresh vote in Istanbul over what he said were irregularities that directly impacted the outcome  We will file our extraordinary appeal today  We will say that there have been events that directly impacted the outcome of the elections and that we demand the renewal of the elections in Istanbul   Yavuz said  He later tweeted that the appeal could happen  in coming days  He said if the YSK rejected the party s appeal to renew the votes  doubt over the elections would remain until the next mayoral elections are due in five years Erdogan said on Monday the local elections were marred by  organized crime  at ballot boxes in Istanbul  raising the possibility of re running the vote in the city of some 15 million residents  Erdogan s comments  his strongest challenge yet to the election process in Istanbul  briefly drove the lira down and also weighed on Turkish stocks  The lira was steady at 5 6850 to the dollar on Tuesday In Istanbul  CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu called on the YSK to finalize the election results as soon as possible and said the AKP was to blame for the uncertainty surrounding the vote  If they re looking for the perpetrators  they should look in the mirror  Look in the mirror if you want to see who is responsible for this   he said  SORE LOSERS The loss in Istanbul  if confirmed  would be a setback for Erdogan s efforts to pull Turkey out of recession  He has dominated Turkish politics for more than 16 years on the back of stellar economic growth To justify its calls for recounts and for a full re run of the elections  the AKP said there were illegal appointments of representatives at ballot boxes and irregularities across the city The CHP said the AKP s appeals were unlawful  You are complaining and appealing nonstop  and this shows one of two things  Either you are so incompetent that you can t even get an election right  or you are such sore losers that you can t accept defeat   CHP spokesman Faik Oztrak said The YSK s decision on the AKP s appeal for a fresh vote in Istanbul will be final  If rejected  the ongoing recounts across the city will be completed and the results finalised If the appeal is accepted  the re run of elections in Istanbul would be held on the first Sunday 60 days after the initial elections  which would be June 2 Erdogan s party also lost the mayoralty in the capital Ankara to CHP candidate Mansur Yavas despite seeking recounts across the city  Yavas received his mandate on Monday after the YSK upheld the initial results Erdogan said the scale of irregularities his party had uncovered meant the margin of votes between Istanbul s top two candidates  currently at less than 15 000 in a city of 10 million voters  was too narrow for the opposition to claim victory However  his AKP candidate and former prime minister Binali Yildirim had declared victory by some 3 000 votes in Istanbul on election night  before conceding that Imamoglu held a lead   Additional reporting by Ali Kucukgocmen and Ece Toksabay  Writing by Daren Butler and Tuvan Gumrukcu  Editing by Jonathan Spicer  Catherine Evans and Frances Kerry

ANKARA   President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party is seeking a full recount of all votes cast in local elections in Istanbul  a senior party official said on Sunday  a week after initial results showed a narrow victory for Turkey s main opposition party The AKP is reeling from its apparent loss of the mayoralties of Istanbul and the capital Ankara  both cities which the party and its Islamist predecessors have dominated for a quarter of a century  Erdogan himself rose to prominence as Istanbul s mayor in the 1990s before emerging as national leader His party has already appealed the initial results in all 39 districts of the city of 15 million people  leading to partial or full recounts across Turkey s largest city So far the initial lead held by Ekrem Imamoglu  mayoral candidate for the secularist Republican People s Party  CHP   has narrowed from 25 000 immediately after the vote to a little over 16 000 after 70 percent of the recounts were completed With both Imamoglu and his rival  former prime minister Binali Yildirim  securing more than 4 1 million votes  the margin of victory is likely to be extremely slim  but Imamoglu has said the appeals and recounts will not change the outcome  AKP deputy party chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said there was  organised misconduct  in the original count  and the party will appeal to the High Election Body  YSK   the final arbiter on electoral disputes  for all Istanbul votes to be recounted  We chose the path to eliminate numerical mistakes  But it s not over   he told reporters in televised comments on Sunday PAINFUL LOSSThe losses in Ankara and Istanbul  if confirmed  would be especially painful for Erdogan  who campaigned relentlessly for the local elections For most of his 16 years in power he has overseen strong economic growth  largely supported by a construction boom funded with cheap debt  which has won backing for the AKP beyond its base of pious  conservative Turks  But sharp falls in the lira have tipped the economy into recession  eroding some support in the buildup to the vote Erdogan s party  which together with its nationalist MHP ally won more than 51 percent of the countrywide vote for local offices on March 31  says its overall performance was a victory  But that is scant compensation for losing the main cities Spokesman Omer Celik said on Saturday the party would accept the final verdict of the YSK   Whoever is declared winner by High Election Board  we will accept that   he told reporters Speaking shortly after Yavuz announced the AKP s latest appeal  Imamoglu said it was time for the party to accept defeat  He also promised  to reconcile this city  and to work closely with the president   I understand the feeling of defeat of the people who demanded a recount   Imamoglu said   You managed this city for 25 years  It is not easy  you lost  But democracy is like that   democracy is not a one way path    Editing by Dominic Evans and Peter Graff

TOKYO   Nissan shareholders voted on Monday to remove Carlos Ghosn from the company s board  severing one of its last ties to an executive who once was hailed as the automaker s savior Mr  Ghosn  Nissan s longtime chairman  who helped pull the company out of a deep slump nearly 20 years ago  is now in a Tokyo jail  where he faces four charges ranging from underreporting his executive compensation to  aggravated breach of trust  He was released on bail in early March  but Japanese prosecutors rearrested him late last week  accusing him of using a Nissan subsidiary to enrich himself to the tune of  5 million  Mr  Ghosn and a close associate  Greg Kelly  who was charged with helping him underreport his compensation  have denied all wrongdoing Nissan removed Mr  Ghosn from his position as chairman in November  shortly after he was arrested  but the board could not remove him as a director until Monday s special meeting Nissan s chief executive  Hiroto Saikawa  and the board of directors began the session with an apology and a deep bow to the assembled shareholders Nissan s top management  is in a state of soul searching   Mr  Saikawa said   We have to admit that there was a significant problem with our corporate governance   I have been asking myself over and over why the organization failed to stop the misconduct   he said   The reasons  I believe  were the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual for a long time  The audience was not in a forgiving mood  During a question and answer session  shareholders launched a salvo at board members  One person called for the entire group to resign to make amends for fumbling its responsibilities to the company  The suggestion was met with applause and hoots of approval from the assembly Mr  Saikawa responded by apologizing again   The board and executive committee members are dedicating their efforts towards the present and future of Nissan   he said  adding   I would like to ask for your support  Shareholders voted to replace Mr  Ghosn with Renault s new chairman  Jean Dominique Senard  He will assume the role of vice chairman on Nissan s board They also removed Mr  Kelly  who is free on bail in Tokyo  from his seat on the board Mr  Ghosn s sudden fall plunged the auto making alliance of Nissan and Renault into chaos  Mr  Ghosn led both companies and the alliance itself  and his arrest added tension to a relationship that already had begun to fray as Nissan struggled to assert independence from Renault But in recent weeks  the group  which includes the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi  has pledged to redouble its efforts to work together Renault is eager to move on and focus on the future business of the alliance  Tensions had blown up between it and Nissan after Mr  Ghosn s arrest  as Nissan leaked allegations of his wrongdoing into the media  Renault and the French government  its biggest shareholder  responded bitterly and maintained a presumption of innocence toward Mr  Ghosn But in recent months  Renault s own internal investigations began to turn up questionable use of company funds by Mr  Ghosn  These included a lavish Marie Antoinette themed wedding party at Versailles  and payments to a Renault Nissan business partner in Oman that are suspected of being used to help finance Mr  Ghosn s yacht  Renault referred both findings to French prosecutors In March  the companies announced the formation of a new operating board for the alliance  after discussions at Nissan s headquarters in Yokohama aimed at creating a new path forward for the three automakers  with a greater voice for the junior Japanese partners  The board includes two representatives from Renault and one each from Nissan and Mitsubishi Still  questions surrounding the imbalance in the alliance s ownership structure remain  While Renault has argued that closer ties would help the companies work better together and share costs  some Nissan executives remain concerned that Renault  which holds a 43 percent stake in the Japanese automaker  would still wield greater power  Nissan owns a 15 percent nonvoting stake in the French automaker Executives at both companies have said that the issue is one to be addressed in the future But it was clearly on the mind of at least one shareholder at Monday s meeting  who criticized Renault s role in making business decisions at Nissan  Does Renault  a French company  really know the Japanese market   he asked the board   Does it really understand Nissan s technology   I have my doubts   

An Israeli public relations firm aligned with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud party said it was behind the placement of some 1 200 cameras in predominantly Arab polling stations  and claimed the tactic helped lower Arab voter turnout in the election Tuesday The company  Kaizler Inbar  said in a  Facebook post on Wednesday that it had worked with Likud not only to distribute the cameras but also to deploy more than 1 300 activists to polling stations Arab voter turnout was just over 50 percent  a historically low level  Israeli news outlets reported  But that most likely resulted from several factors  analysts said  including a boycott of the vote by some Arabs over the passage of laws seen as discriminatory and a lack of robust representation On Wednesday  Mr  Netanyahu was in position to take a fourth consecutive term in office  with nearly all of the votes counted and the rival Blue and White alliance having conceded the race Likud claimed that it used the cameras  some of which were concealed  to record evidence of potential voter fraud  The Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint on Tuesday over the use of the cameras  calling it a voter intimidation tactic The Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said the action was prohibited  and the police confiscated dozens of the cameras Kaizler Inbar played off the committee s ruling on Wednesday  writing in its Facebook post   Shhhh     Don t tell anyone  It was us  After a  long period of preparations  and a  tight partnership with the best of people in Likud   the company wrote  it made a contribution to  the most important accomplishments of the right wing bloc  Kaizler Inbar is headed by Sagi Kaizler  a former leader of a West Bank settler group  The organization claimed it sent some 1 350 people to Arab polling stations Afif Abu Much  37  a computer engineer and political activist from Baqa al Gharbiyye  a town bordering the West Bank  said he was not surprised by Likud s decision to deploy the cameras  It is part of our prime minister s campaign of repression against Arab citizens in Israel   he said  Among other things  he cited the passage of a law last summer that declared Israel the  nation state of the Jewish people  Mr  Abu Much said Mr  Netanyahu would have been hurt by a large Arab turnout  an assessment shared by analysts   To beat Netanyahu  you need Arabs   he said   Without the Arabs  you cannot send Netanyahu home  He knows that  But Mr  Abu Much wasn t convinced that the cameras were the driving reason for the low Arab turnout  He noted that the Blue and White alliance  seen as the main threat to Likud  had done little to appeal to Arab voters or align itself with Arab parties  

BARCELONA   A Barcelona court on Tuesday charged 30 people with misuse of public funds over Catalonia s 2017 independence referendum  a move that may worsen tensions between the region and Spain s central government ahead of a nationwide election on April 28 Catalonia s stance is important as many polls suggest that Spain s governing Socialists may need the backing of Catalan pro independence parties to form a majority in Madrid  The biggest issue in campaigning for the April 28 vote has been Madrid s handling of Catalan discontent that led to the 2017 plebiscite and an ultimately abortive attempt to secede from Spain  with right of center parties calling for tougher action against the Catalan government in Barcelona In a separate trial that has been criticized by international rights groups  12 Catalan pro independence leaders face charges including rebellion and misappropriation of funds that could  if convicted  see them face decades in prison  The trial was a big factor in Catalan pro independence parties withholding support for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez s 2019 budget earlier this year  depriving him of votes needed to pass the plan and triggering an early national election The defendants in Tuesday s court session include aides to leading politicians in Catalonia s former pro independence government  They face charges including misappropriation of funds and falsifying documents  Graver charges of rebellion and sedition  faced by the 12 now on trial  were not included  The Barcelona court set joint bail at 5 8 million euros   6 5 million  in total for 17 of the accused  an amount equal to the public funds allegedly misappropriated for the organization of the referendum  a court writ said Catalan pro independence leader Quim Torra  speaking in a televised address on Tuesday  condemned the fresh charges   This  authoritarian stand confirms an absence of judicial independence and political persecution   he said in a statement  and added that Catalonia s independence quest would continue  No date was immediately set for the trial    Reporting by Sam Edwards  Editing by Mark Heinrich

Trying to reverse a stinging setback  Turkey s ruling party on Tuesday demanded a redo of last week s election for mayor of Istanbul  the country s largest city and long a source of power and prestige for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan The extraordinary stance came as it became increasingly clear that a days long recounting of ballots would not change the result that Binali Yildirim  the candidate of Mr  Erdogan s Justice and Development Party  known as the A K P   had lost to the opposition candidate  Ekrem Imamoglu  in the March 31 election  Mr  Erdogan s party had already demanded a recount of spoiled ballots in all of Istanbul and a full recount in some of the city s districts  When that did not change the result  it called for a recount of the entire Istanbul vote  which the High Election Council refused The latest demand now puts the High Election Council squarely on the spot and threatens to precipitate a crisis for both Istanbul and the entire country  becoming the latest test of democratic institutions already groaning under the authoritarian strains of Mr  Erdogan s 16 years in power  I find the chances extremely high that the election board will accept A K P  s request to repeat the elections    said Soner Cagaptay  director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy   Far from being independent  the election board  like other institutions  has fallen under Erdogan s power  and I would say the board has thus far taken steps to facilitate Erdogan s each and every next move    he added He noted that the council had already allowed a recount of invalid ballots  even though the A K P  presented no credible evidence  other than a narrow margin  that there had been irregularities That has not stopped the party or the president from alleging that the irregularities were systemic in Istanbul  where the candidates are separated by less than 0 3 percent of almost nine million votes cast  We will use the extraordinary appeal grounds and say we want to renew the elections in Istanbul   Ali Ihsan Yavuz  the deputy head of the party  said at a televised news conference in Ankara  the capital   Everywhere in Istanbul  organized acts were done  That is why we called it organized irregularity  Mr  Erdogan himself has cast doubt on the election and pressed the case for a do over by citing examples of American elections where the margin was so narrow that the balloting was redone  Irregularities are not just a few  almost entirely it is irregular   he said on Monday of the election in Istanbul  speaking at Ataturk Airport before leaving for a visit to Moscow Murat Yetkin  formerly the editor in chief of Hurriyet Daily News  wrote on his blog this week that even those in the president s circle were divided about how far to push the challenge  with a small  determined group urging the president to  put his weight for renewing Istanbul elections  A second  larger group of more experienced politicians have argued to accept the results  because the challenge is actually benefiting Mr  Imamoglu by elevating his stature Judging by Mr  Erdogan s statement this week  the hard liners may be carrying the day  though it may also be a way for the president   to manage the trauma    said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli  the Ankara director of German Marshall Fund ImageInitial results said that Ekrem Imamoglu  center  the candidate of the opposition Republican People s Party  had won the March 31 election CreditOzan Kose Agence France Presse   Getty Images  This looks like more to redefine the defeat in Istanbul as if it was actually won but stolen by illegitimate means    said Mr  Unluhisarcikli  who noted that a new election would actually be quite risky for the president as the economy continues to deteriorate  I do not believe that Erdogan actually wants to renew the elections    Mr  Unluhisarcikli said    The economic realities do not allow this  It would be a huge gamble   The result in Istanbul carries enormous weight  however  and there are clear incentives for the president and his party to fight a loss With 15 million people  most of them on the European side of the Bosporus  Istanbul is the most populous city on the Continent and Turkey s economic capital  It is also Mr  Erdogan s hometown and has long been a base of support for him Just as important  the opposition and some analysts say  the city has become a vital source of wealth in a network of cronyism and nepotism that has benefited from the awarding of municipal contracts and the distribution of city funds to charitable foundations with links to the president s family Even before he has been officially declared the winner  Mr  Imamoglu  who ran for the opposition Republican People s Party  has vowed to open the books of the city  which Mr  Erdogan and his party have controlled since 2002  to expose long simmering accusations of corruption  The result of this election is clear    Mr  Imamoglu said at a televised news conference on Tuesday  when he repeated his desire to take office and start working immediately    The streets accepted the result  You can work hard  and win five years later  We have won  admit it  Last week  Mr  Imamoglu said that with its continuing challenges to the result of the election  Mr  Erdogan s party was stalling for time so that it could erase City Hall records from computers before independent auditors could carry out the review he promises Such allegations have taken on more weight with voters as the Turkish economy falters  undercutting the president s long record of nearly unbroken economic growth  Turkey entered recession this year  and the currency  the lira  has continued to slide amid increasing worry by investors and markets The opposition party also won a close mayoral election in Ankara  a result that the election council has finalized  The potential loss of Istanbul would place both the country s political and financial capitals in opposition hands Taken together with rest of the results from the March 31 elections  the balloting reflected increasing discontent among voters with Mr  Erdogan  who has concentrated executive powers  carried out a sweeping purge of opponents after a failed 2016 coup  and brought a once vibrant news media to heel The High Election Council must consider the request by Mr  Erdogan s party for a new election  but the opposition party insisted that the result was legitimate and clear  Both legally and conscientiously  there is no obstacle to giving Ekrem Imamoglu his mayoral certificate   Faik Oztrak  the opposition spokesman  said in televised remarks   Mr  Imamoglu is right now the elected mayor of Istanbul  as he was on the morning of April 1  He pointed out that Mr  Erdogan s A K P  party had won many districts in Istanbul as well as other towns across the country  results that were not being challenged  So when A K P  mayors are elected it is the national will  but when the votes go to Imamoglu  it is dubious    Mr  Oztrak said    Even crows laugh at that  They should leave the nation alone   

JAKARTA    Mama  just killed a man   sings Indonesian President Joko Widodo during a recent ride in a local YouTube celebrity s car while Queen s Bohemian Rhapsody plays in the background  The video  which also shows Widodo dressed in a red zip up jacket and jeans chatting about family life and the pressures of running the world s third largest democracy  was the brainchild of a backroom team that has become a vital part of his campaign for re election on April 17  The team  comprised mainly of people in their 20s  has a sleek  high rise office in central Jakarta  On a recent visit  Reuters saw the team s data of social media activity on the Indonesian presidential election displayed on LED screens covering one wall of a conference room Widodo s aides say the team uses the data to determine the pop culture references that the president will make in his next speech   he s done  Games of Thrones  and the  Avengers  already   or the sneakers he might wear to an event to appeal to young voters  Widodo s sons also sometimes advise him on outfits or speeches  according to one senior campaign aide Millennials   those aged 17 35   account for over one third of Indonesia s 193 million voters and both Widodo and his challenger  former general Prabowo Subianto  have ramped up efforts to appeal to them  Just because of the sheer size of that voter base  the millennials will play an important role in deciding the direction of the election   said Djayadi Hanan of pollster Saiful Mujani Research   Consulting  Most opinion polls show Widodo  57  holding a double digit lead over his opponent  A recent survey by pollster Roy Morgan showed around 60 percent of young voters favoring Widodo  but both campaigns say that wooing the country s largely apolitical youth is a challenge  A former furniture maker who grew up in a riverside slum and is the first national leader to come from outside the political and military elite  Widodo s everyman image resonated in 2014 with voters tired of the old guard  But since taking office  aides say  young supporters  no longer recognized  the president and he was advised to project a more relaxed image  Because he has had to become more stately  that  village boy  narrative was missing this time   said the senior campaign aide  who declined to be identified That s where the backroom team came in  We re able to see in real time what does well or what people react negatively to     We were very blunt in conveying that to the president   the aide said  adding that Widodo gets a summary of the social media data almost daily JEANS AND SNEAKERSWhere his rival often wears fitted suits and oxford shoes  Widodo sports a white shirt with rolled up sleeves  jeans  and brightly colored sneakers  In March  the president posted an animated comic strip on social media that showed him meeting his younger self and discussing the achievements of his government Taking a page from Indian Prime Minister s Narendra Modi s playbook  Widodo has started using a holographic projection of himself to address voters at campaign rallies  Analysts say Prabowo is less popular among young voters  in part because of a strongman image stemming from his time as special forces chief under authoritarian ruler Suharto  Aides have suggested softening the image of the 67 year old  so he now wears a khaki shirt and aviator sunglasses at campaign rallies   It was rare to see his lighter side and sense of humor  We have tried to expose that side of him   said campaign spokesman Dahnil Anzar Prabowo s team has also posted a photograph of him with his cat  which was popular online  The cat now has its own Instagram account Prabowo s running mate  businessman and amateur marathon runner Sandiaga Uno  was chosen in part for his

ANKARA   President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday Turkey s local elections were marred by  organized crime  at ballot boxes in Istanbul  raising the possibility of re running a March 31 vote that handed a slim majority to the main opposition party Erdogan s comments  his strongest challenge yet to the election process in Turkey s largest city  briefly drove the lira down and also weighed on Turkish stocks  Erdogan s AK Party has already lost the mayoralty in the capital Ankara to the main opposition Republican People s Party  CHP   and is has appealed several stages of the count in Istanbul which showed a narrow CHP victory The Islamist rooted AKP is reeling from the potential loss of both cities  which the party and its predecessors have governed for a quarter of a century  Erdogan himself rose to prominence as Istanbul mayor in the 1990s before emerging as national leader Erdogan said the scale of electoral irregularities his party had uncovered meant the margin of votes between Istanbul s top two candidates  less than 20 000 in a city of 10 million voters  was too narrow for the opposition to claim victory Speaking before departing for talks in Russia with President Vladimir Putin  Erdogan said voting in other countries  including the United States  was often re run if the margin of victory was below 1 percent   They believe that such tight margins do not give comfort to the public   he said He gave no example of an election re run in those circumstances The AKP has appealed to the High Election Board  YSK  for a full recount of votes cast in the election across all 39 districts of Istanbul  The YSK is looking into the AKP s challenges but has not commented on Erdogan s accusations  The citizens are telling us to protect their rights  they are complaining of organized crimes   Erdogan told a press conference in Istanbul   And we  as political parties  have determined such organized crimes  Ekrem Imamoglu  the CHP s Istanbul mayoral candidate  said on Monday he was still leading with a margin of some 15 500 votes   down from 25 000   after up to 95 percent of partial recounts had been completed Erdogan said he would only accept the Istanbul result when the YSK had processed all the appeals  Nobody has the right to get in an election victory mood in a city of 10 million voters with a margin of 13 000 14 000  When the appeals have been completed  we will accept the result  CALL FOR IMPARTIALITYKemal Kilicdaroglu  leader of the secularist CHP  warned that the security of the election was in danger and called on the election board to be impartial  He added that Erdogan s request for a full recount lacked a reasonable justification  Now the High Electoral Board has entered a process that damages the security of the ballot boxes  the security of the election  This is the real danger   Kilicdaroglu told reporters in Ankara The Turkish lira weakened to as far as 5 7120 against the dollar on Monday after Erdogan s remarks  before recovering to trade at 5 67 at 11 55 GMT  Istanbul s BIST 100 share index was down 1 4 percent  Will the Istanbul election be repeated  This question has sent the lira down   an Istanbul based banker said  A resumption of weekly repo auctions by the Central Bank had added to lira weakness  the banker added The AKP had also sought recounts across Ankara  where initial results showed CHP candidate Mansur Yavas winning by four percentage points  But the YSK upheld the result and on Monday Yavas formally received his mandate as new mayor   Additional reporting by Ali Kucukgocmen  Editing by Jonathan Spicer and Mark Heinrich

ISTANBUL ANKARA   Election officials expanded a vote recount in Istanbul late on Thursday  CNN Turk said  as the ruling party of President Tayyip Erdogan pushed its appeal against its shock defeat there in local elections Erdogan s AK Party said it would also demand a wider check on votes across the capital Ankara   which initial results suggested it also narrowly lost in Sunday s vote in a major blow to the establishment Those losses  if confirmed  would be particularly painful for Erdogan  whose party and its predecessor have dominated the two cities for 25 years  He launched his political career in Istanbul and served as the city s mayor in the 1990s On Wednesday  Turkey s High Election Board had ordered a full recount in three of Istanbul s 39 districts and a recount of just invalid ballots in 15 districts after an appeal from Erdogan s AKP Late on Thursday the board decided there would be a full recount in those 15 districts as well  CNN Turk said  Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul  Ekrem Imamoglu  told Reuters it looked like his lead had narrowed to around 19 500 votes from an earlier 25 000 as the recount progressed  but he was sure he would still become mayor  The results will not change  Time is passing and Istanbul is waiting for service  so we just want to get to our job as soon as possible   said Imamoglu of the Republican People s Party  CHP   The mathematics and numbers are clear   Imamoglu told Reuters   There is no need to think of a Plan B right now  Imamoglu later said on Twitter that recounts in Istanbul s 14 districts  where there were a total of 89 255 invalid votes  had been completed  and added that he was 18 871 votes ahead of his rival The AKP s representative on the election board  Recep Ozel  told broadcaster A Haber earlier on Thursday that the difference in Istanbul would keep falling and his candidate  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  would emerge the winner in Turkey s commercial hub Speaking at a news conference in Ankara  AKP spokesman Omer Celik said the steps taken for recounts were not extraordinary  All citizens should remain calm  Our democracy is showing its strength as it always has   Celik said   Let the law work and let s respect the outcome  RECESSION CHALLENGEAhead of the elections  the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival the alliance between the AKP and their nationalist MHP partners  They named joint candidates in certain cities  including Ankara and Istanbul In Ankara  opposition candidate Mansur Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes on Sunday to earn a nearly 4 percentage point victory over his AKP rival  former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki  The AKP also appealed against those results  prompting the election board to order a recount in 11 of the city s districts But AKP Secretary General Fatih Sahin said on Thursday that the results of the recount so far were  far from meeting our expectations  and the party would appeal for another recount across the city If the initial results are confirmed  the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32 6 billion liras   5 79 billion  for 2019 in Istanbul and Ankara Erdogan would likely also lose some oversight for municipal contracts in the two cities  possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession In another sign of public backlash  the AKP MHP alliance also lost control of the southern coastal cities of Antalya  Mersin and Adana  the central provinces of Bolu and Kirsehir  and the eastern cities of Artvin  Igdir and Ardahan The CHP has said that Kurdish votes coming from the pro Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party  HDP  had helped them win narrow victories in key provinces  after the HDP chose not to name candidates in some cities and back the opposition instead  Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics since coming to power 16 years ago and ruled his country with an ever tighter grip  campaigned relentlessly for two months ahead of Sunday s vote  which he described as a  matter of survival  for Turkey In some 100 rallies during his election campaign  Erdogan described the opposition as terrorist supporters and said his central government could not provide services if it wasn t in harmony with local administrations But the president s efforts came up against widespread anger about Turkey s recession  which has brought surging inflation and unemployment  and caused the lira to plunge Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to volatility in the currency  which sold off sharply nearly two weeks ago  reflecting waning confidence among both Turks and international investors  It closed at 5 63 to the dollar on Thursday   Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay in Ankara and Yesim Dikmen in Istanbul  Editing by Jonathan Spicer  Andrew Heavens and James Dalgleish

AYODHYA  India   Priyanka Gandhi Vadra became the latest member of India s storied Nehru Gandhi dynasty to enter politics in January  but the boost she brings the opposition campaign may not turn the tide against Prime Minister Narendra Modi  polls show After years of speculation  the charismatic Vadra joined Congress to help its leader  her brother Rahul  in general elections that begin next week  pitching the party and regional groups against Modi s Hindu nationalist led alliance Congress hopes the fourth generation siblings of a dynasty that ruled India for decades after independence from Britain in 1947 and is still revered by many will help energize its ranks and counter Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  In the run up to the election that starts on Thursday  the 47 year old Vadra has spent hours campaigning in cars  trucks and even a boat  to woo voters in northern Uttar Pradesh  which sends more lawmakers to parliament than any other Indian state Reuters followed her at two roadshows where she smiled  waved  and shook hands  occasionally wading into crowds as her security detail scrambled along  Her father and grandmother  both former prime ministers  were assassinated Thousands of people lined the streets for several kilometers  waving Congress flags and chanting her name   There is support for Congress because of Priyanka   said Mahesh Gupta  a shopkeeper in the temple town of Ayodhya  where she visited a shrine in late March Gupta  who referred to Vadra by her first name  as many Indians do  voted for Modi in the last election  but said he was considering Congress after seeing her campaign Ayodhya is at the heart of decades of tension between Hindus and minority Muslims  as Hindu groups led by the BJP have campaigned for a temple to the god king Rama to be built on the site of a mosque razed to the ground by Hindu zealots in 1992 Vadra  a marquee campaigner for Congress  chose Ayodhya as one of her first tours to take on the BJP in its own bastion Even so  in the face of the formidable political machine of the BJP which also rules the state  Congress may be unable to capitalize on her appeal  pollsters and some party leaders said Vadra s campaigning was getting attention for Congress it would not have got otherwise  but it did not look like the party was making gains  said Milan Vaishnav  an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  Many in Congress say the Priyanka play is more about building up the party for 2022 assembly elections and beyond   he said  referring to state elections in Uttar Pradesh Last month  polling agencies CVoter and CNX separately estimated Congress would win just 4 of the 80 seats up for grabs in the state  doubling its tally since the last general election in 2014 That year s sweep of 71 seats for the BJP paved the way for Modi s clear majority in India s 545 member lower house of parliament A broader poll published by the Hindu newspaper on Friday showed Modi s approval ratings across India were higher even than in 2014  when he was making a bid for power  The poll  by the Hindu CSDS Lokniti  showed 43 percent of respondents wanted Modi as the next prime minister  with 24 percent for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi VOTE WISELYFor years  Vadra helped manage elections for her brother and mother  former Congress president Sonia Gandhi  in their own constituencies  but was reluctant to get into politics herself  A mother of two  she is married to businessman Robert Vadra  and has long been seen as a natural politician with strong speaking skills and an ability to easily connect with people One afternoon last week  her 12 car convoy sped past lush fields and small settlements  kicking up a cloud of dust before stopping at the village of Atka in the Ayodhya district The saree clad Vadra jumped out of her car and settled down on the ground surrounded by a group of women  many veiled and others smiling   If someone doesn t work for you  how will you teach them a lesson   she asked  imploring them to vote wisely   Vote for those who want to work for you  CVoter  which has run a daily opinion poll since January  said Congress support in Uttar Pradesh has dropped off after jumping 10 percentage points in the days following the news that Vadra had taken a party post  Late in March  about 8 9 percent of state voters backed Congress  a far cry from the 43 4 percent supporting the BJP and the 44 percent behind an alliance of two major regional parties However  even with Vadra s hectic campaigning  Congress is struggling to get its message of welfare to voters  party officials said  Six voters in Uttar Pradesh said they had not heard of a Congress election promise for a program to give India s poorest families monthly handouts of 6 000 rupees  They brought her in at a very wrong time   said one Congress official  who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak formally to media  A better time would have been December  just days after Congress won power in three key states  giving her more time to prepare  he added  Others in the party have said it should have been years earlier The BJP has dismissed Vadra s formal entry into politics as inconsequential and Modi said it only showed that for some  the family is the party   Vadra s office did not respond to a request from Reuters for an interview  But Congress will seize on momentum building against the BJP  said Kamal Nath  a top Congress leader and chief minister of the central state of Madhya Pradesh   You have to time everything   he told Reuters   You don t want to peak out too fast    Additional reporting by Nidhi Verma  Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Clarence Fernandez

WASHINGTON   U S  House of Representatives Democrats on Tuesday canceled a planned floor vote on legislation to set federal spending levels for next year after the party s left wing demanded more money for domestic programs It was an awkward moment for Democrats  who won control of the House from Republicans in last November s congressional elections  but now appear unable to unify liberals and moderates around a budget plan  The House vote had been planned for Wednesday and would have been the first step in negotiations with the Republican led Senate over spending levels Republicans  when they led the House  had similar difficulties  Over the years  Congress has frequently failed to pass a budget blueprint  It was only the opening salvo in what could be a long running battle over spending levels and priorities  especially given Republican President Donald Trump s calls for deep spending cuts to non defense programs and differences over border security policy Such disagreements can sometimes lead to standoffs like the one that resulted in a 35 day partial government shutdown that ended earlier this year House liberals were unhappy because the pending Democratic legislation  based on a plan approved by the Budget Committee  had set spending caps for fiscal year 2020 with  664 billion in defense spending  higher than domestic discretionary spending at  631 billion The liberals sought  33 billion more for domestic spending  But if that were added in  there was a danger not enough moderate Democrats would back the legislation  aides and lawmakers said   We fundamentally disagree with leadership      It s the first time Democrats are back in control  that was our opportunity to put parity between defense and non defense   said Representative Mark Pocan  a Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus  Education  infrastructure and healthcare are really the issues that we ran on last November  and we re just trying to get the  Democratic  caucus to do that   Pocan said Democratic leaders said talks with the Senate could still go ahead and they inserted provisions in another measure that passed on Tuesday allowing House appropriators to start work on individual spending bills Democrats said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be meeting Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to try to reach a spending agreement  If we can do that  that s the best way to do it  because then the Senate will agree to it   said House Majority leader Steny Hoyer  adding that hopefully  McConnell could then get the White House to agree   Reporting by Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan  Editing by Peter Cooney

ROME   Italy s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday he would host a major rally of European nationalist and far right parties to promote a shared political vision ahead of May s EU parliamentary elections Salvini leads the ruling League party and hopes to put together a bloc of like minded  anti immigration parties in the European parliament to challenge the traditionally predominant and mainstream center left and center right groups However he has so far struggled to create a broad  sovereignist front in the 28 nation European Union  with a matrix of conflicting national interests hindering his progress With time running out  he announced this week he would kick off his campaign for the May 26 vote in Milan on Monday with representatives of just three  relatively small far right European parties  But speaking after talks with his longtime French ally Marine Le Pen  Salvini told reporters he planned a much more ambitious election rally next month  We re preparing a major event for the Europe of the next 30 years in May in Italy  where we ll invite all the European movements that are alternatives to the rule of the Socialists and the European People s Party of recent years   Salvini said  referring to the EU s big leftist and conservative groups  It will be the first time an event drawing together at least 15 or 20 European countries will take place in Italy   he told reporters in Paris Salvini did not say what other parties had signed up to the initiative  which the League hopes to hold in Rome s ancient chariot racing stadium Circus Maximus DIVERGENCEEuropean parties have created multiple  pan national groups in the EU parliament  with the League a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom  ENF   which includes Le Pen s National Rally and Austria s Freedom Party of Austria  Salvini wants to embrace other far right or nationalist leaders whose parties are in different groups  such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski  the head of Poland s ruling PiS party Kaczynski met Salvini in January  but PiS  which is highly suspicious of the close ties Le Pen and Salvini have forged with Moscow  said on Friday it would not join the May rally  We met  Salvini  a few weeks ago and we spelt out our conditions when it comes to the European parliament  We do not envisage any further contact until after the election   said Tomasz Poreba  PiS s EU ballot campaign chief Making clear its preferences  PiS this week welcomed Salvini s old ally  the Brothers of Italy  into its EU group    the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe  We are the real sovereignists  They are populists   Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni told La Stampa newspaper on Thursday  referring to the League   I don t think Salvini s project is very clear about what it wants with Europe  Salvini said the three groups that would be joining him on Monday were the anti euro Alternative for Germany  AfD  party  the conservative Finns Party and the Danish People s Party AfD co leader Joerg Meuthen told La Stampa newspaper on Friday that although he and Salvini had similar  anti immigrant views  they had different positions on key economic questions  like the need to respect EU fiscal rules  We cannot agree on everything  We will talk about it and find compromises   he was quoted as saying   Additional reporting by Gavin Jones in Rome  Michel Rose and Simon Carraud in Paris and Pawel Florkiewicz in Warsaw  Editing by William Maclean  

JERUSALEM   Frustrated over their choices in the Israeli election  and at Arab politicians whom they describe as ineffective  some Palestinian citizens of Israel have been gathering popular support for a boycott of Tuesday s ballot But a well known Palestinian hip hop artist released a powerful new video on Thursday pushing back on the boycott  urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes   and expressing hope that a strong turnout on Tuesday could help send Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu packing  or even  to prison  Tamer Must Vote    <U+062A><U+0627><U+0645><U+0631>

Arabic language video  which spread widely on social media and has sparked a robust online debate  the rapper  Tamer Nafar of Lod  Israel  argues with himself over whether to vote or stay home  then comes down strongly in favor of voting   dramatizing what Mr  Nafar said had been his own internal dialogue over the past few weeks  It s our land  but their state   the voice of the pro boycott Mr  Nafar says in the video  which is titled  Tamer Must Vote  in English  adding of the Israeli Parliament   The Knesset s not for me  ImageIsraeli border police officers standing guard next to posters depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditOded Balilty Associated PressBut the Mr  Nafar who favors voting retorts that even the shekel is Israeli  What then   throw away our money  and drop out of the economy  since the taxes paid by Arab citizens fund the army   Plant tea leaves at home so we won t fund missiles on Gaza   They re using us to look liberal   the pro boycotter says  echoing a frequent argument of Palestinian citizens who say that participating in Israeli democracy provides a veneer of equality in Western eyes  Yeah  baby  democracy is so  80s   the pro voter says sarcastically His vote wouldn t change anything  the pro boycotter responds  It s like stepping  into a missile war when all I got is a knife   or fighting a tank  when all I got is a stone  The pro voter hits back by acknowledging  it doesn t mean that we ll liberate Palestine   but says  dropping the mic  that  if our vote will erase Lieberman  imprison Bibi  then we re ready   referring to the former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman Indeed  one of the richest ironies that could emerge from Tuesday s election would be if strong Arab turnout raised the minimum vote threshold for political parties to gain entry into Parliament so high that Mr  Lieberman failed to clear it  His party  Yisrael Beiteinu  is struggling in the polls  Read about how Prime Minister Netanyahu s anti Arab provocations may backfire this time around  though they may have helped him in the past  It was Mr  Lieberman who pushed a change in the election law that raised the voting percentage threshold in 2015  as a way of banning Arab parties from the Knesset  The Arab parties responded at the time by joining forces  and their Joint List won a record 13 seats in the Knesset that year Some polls this year indicated turnout among Palestinian citizens would be even higher  given widespread anger at Mr  Netanyahu  who has been running an exceptionally anti Arab campaign  But the boycott movement is having the reverse effect  exasperating Arab leaders as well as many Jewish Israeli opponents of Mr  Netanyahu who hoped that Arab voters could play a decisive role in defeating him In an interview  Mr  Nafar said he was still hoping for such a result  which he said would be  poetic justice   Read our guide to the Israeli elections  He said that he was not enamored of Benny Gantz  the former army chief who is neck and neck with Mr  Netanyahu in the polls  but that Mr  Gantz would be preferable to Mr  Netanyahu  And although Mr  Netanyahu is facing indictment only on corruption charges  Mr  Nafar said   he would prefer it be for  war crimes     At least it s something   he added ImageBenny Gantz  leader of the Blue and White party  during an election campaign event in Ashkelon on Wednesday CreditAmir Cohen Reuters I guess I m watching too much  Game of Thrones    he said Mr  Nafar  39  began his hip hop career in the late 1990s  and his lyrics took a strong political turn with the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada  in 2000  The son of Palestinian refugees and a father of two  he was the star of a celebrated autobiographical film   Junction 48   in 2016  The Israeli culture minister  Miri Regev  walked out on his performance at the country s movie awards ceremony that year and has tried to have his performances canceled  I m not saying that being in the Knesset is the best medicine  but if I want to let go of it I should do that dose by dose   he said  explaining his decision to vote   not all at once  with nothing in its place In the video  Mr  Nafar s pro boycott persona has little use for Arab politicians   Did they deal with poverty  Did they bring us schools and jobs   he asks   We only see them out there during elections   He adds that he voted for the Joint List the last time  but infighting broke it apart   For me  this ship has sunk   he says Yet Mr  Nafar s pro vote voice says that rather than the Titanic  he sees Arab politicians as the Mavi Marmara   the protest ship that tried to defy the Israeli blockade of Gaza in 2010  gaining international attention for the Palestinian cause   It doesn t make sense for me to give up a tool  when I hardly have any tools  so I m going to vote   he says The alternative  Mr  Nafar said in the interview  would be to allow Israeli leaders to do whatever they wanted to Palestinian citizens   even if  as some extremist right wing politicians would like  that meant transferring Arab citizens out of Israel Voting  Mr  Nafar s alter ego says in the video  was at least one thing he has the power to do to ensure  that I can sing to the boycotters  rather than talk to them in the transfer trucks   

VALLDEMOSSA  Spain   Majorca has long been a haven for the Spanish royals  Juan Carlos  the former king  and his family have their vacation palace on the island  and local business dignitaries even once bought the monarch a luxury yacht So it might seem odd that residents of the island town of Valldemossa  population 2 000   where Juan Carlos holds the title of honorary mayor   were asked to vote in a straw poll last Sunday on whether Spain should retain the monarchy or become a republic The nonbinding poll  sponsored by a local political party  was held without an official census and at a makeshift polling station next to the food and handicraft stalls of Valldemossa s weekend market  The removal of the monarchy was approved by 97 votes to 25  with one person casting a blank vote ImageTourists mostly visit Valldemossa to see its medieval monastery  in which the composer Frdric Chopin and the writer George Sand spent a winter in the 1830s CreditSamuel Aranda for The New York TimesEven if the vote was only symbolic  the organizers said it was important to include the monarchy in a broader debate over whether and how to reform the country ahead of national elections this month  called by the Socialist government after its national budget was rejected  At the same time  Spain is struggling with a secessionist challenge in the northeastern region of Catalonia  What really matters is that we re now finally able to discuss openly the role of the monarchy   said Ddac Alcal i Villa  who represents the organizing party  known as  The Valldemossa We Want  and who is in charge of the town s education and culture  Similar votes were scheduled for Sunday in several other towns on the island  following Valldemossa s lead The Spanish royal family returned to the throne in 1975 when Juan Carlos became king two days after the death of Gen  Francisco Franco ended a long period of dictatorship  But two years earlier  the authorities in Majorca  knowing of Juan Carlos s fondness for sailing and their island  offered to convert a palace called Marivent into his vacation home  even though the property s former owner had bequeathed it to become a museum

monarchy have conducted their own polls  with   perhaps unsurprisingly   differing outcomes A survey published last October by the leftist Podemos  the third largest party in Spain  found that more

Times I respect different opinions  but not when the only goal is to divide our society   Ms  Mayol said   We ve seen in Catalonia how these things develop  You plant a seed in the minds of people and then end up with a huge conflict  Mr  Alcal i Villa acknowledged that he had been inspired by straw polls on independence that were held across Catalonia  long before separatist political leaders held a referendum on secession in October 2017 even though it had been declared unconstitutional  Former Catalan separatist leaders are now on trial before the Spanish Supreme Court  accused of staging a rebellion in their effort to declare independence The fight over independence has split Catalan society down the middle  and in Majorca and the rest of the Balearic archipelago  where the Catalan language is also spoken  nationalist parties have been gaining votes  Even if our situation isn t comparable to that of Catalonia  it could become so in a few years if we don t put a brake on this   said Xavier Pericay  a regional lawmaker who helped found Ciudadanos  a centrist party that has led the fight against Catalan secessionism   The republicans and the separatists might appear to focus on different issues  but they are pursuing the same goal  which is to scrap anything that represents the power of the state   he added Separatists and anti royal militants also found common ground after Felipe stepped into the Catalan conflict in October 2017  accusing the region s separatist leaders of  inadmissible disloyalty  after holding the referendum  which took place amid clashes between the Spanish police and voters   The king made a decisive intervention in Catalonia  but that of course helped bring together those who agitate against the monarchy and those who have pushed for an independence referendum   Mr  Pericay said Some voters in Valldemossa said they wanted to remove the monarchy as an outdated institution  but had no desire for Majorca to split from Spain  They also noted that people had already taken to the streets across the country in 2014 to demand a referendum on the monarchy after King Juan Carlos announced his abdication  Removing the monarchy is about having a modern state   said Mr  Alcal i Villa  calling it a broader issue  over which there is more consensus than any territorial question   

TOKYO   Nissan Motor Co shareholders ousted Carlos Ghosn as a director on Monday  severing his last tie with the Japanese automaker he rescued from near bankruptcy two decades ago and from which he is now accused of siphoning funds Days after Ghosn s latest arrest in Tokyo  shareholders gathered for an extraordinary meeting  expressing bafflement and disquiet about growing allegations of financial misconduct laid out before them   while seeking more clarity on how Nissan plans to recover from the scandal Meeting shareholders for the first time since Ghosn s initial arrest in November  Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa and Jean Dominique Senard  the chairman of its alliance partner Renault  said they needed to focus on collaboration and improving governance at the Japanese company  But they offered few concrete details about the way forward  I can t comprehend how this could have happened  despite having auditors   said Setsuko Shibata  a retired homemaker who said her family had held Nissan shares for decades   I can t say I feel better about the situation after today s explanation  Ghosn has denied all the allegations against him and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup Proceedings were at times interrupted by some hecklers on the floor of the meeting  which was attended by a near record high 4 100 shareholders The shareholders voted to remove both Ghosn and co accused Greg Kelly from Nissan s board of directors  Kelly has also denied the charges against him They also voted in Senard as a director  a move that was widely seen as an attempt to assuage concern about the future of the Nissan Renault automaking alliance engineered by Ghosn ALLEGATIONSProsecutors last week took the highly unusual step of re arresting Ghosn   who had been out on  9 million bail   returning him to the Tokyo detention center where he had previously spent more than 100 days Under the latest allegations  he is suspected of trying to enrich himself to the tune of  5 million at the automaker s expense Ghosn s lawyers called the arrest an attempt to muzzle him  He was due to speak at a news conference this week  but instead a video statement from him will be shown on Tuesday at the Foreign Correspondents  Club of Japan  FCCJ   the FCCJ said on its website   Ghosn has been charged with under reporting his Nissan salary for a decade  and of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan s books  However  the new allegation is potentially more serious  as it could show he used company funds for his own purposes  SHAREHOLDERS BAFFLEDBoth Saikawa and Senard talked about the need to focus more on unity and respect among executives and workers  although neither offered details on the outlook for their complex capital structure  in which smaller Renault owns a bigger share of Nissan  I will constantly suggest the best possible evolutions in the framework of the alliance   Senard said after voters approved his appointment to Nissan s board   We want to secure the right future for Nissan   he said  without elaborating The fall of one of the world s most feted executives appeared to have left some Nissan shareholders nonplussed  I was hoping to hear more details about the path forward  I wanted to know what sort of role a Japanese company can play in an international alliance like this   said a shareholder who declined to be identified for personal privacy issues  The situation seems to go deeper than it looks based on the information   said 68 year old shareholder Roberto Montoya   I m very suspicious of the situation  and most people are  Saikawa said Nissan may claim damages against Ghosn and that he did not want to pay severance to the former chair  He also said he would work to stabilize the company before standing down as chief executive  This is not an issue we can fix overnight   Saikawa told shareholders   We need to fulfill the task  of improving governance  and prepare the company for our next steps  and then pass the leadership baton    Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu  Additional reporting by Maki Shiraki  Writing by Chris Gallagher  Naomi Tajitsu and David Dolan  Editing by Christopher Cushing  

ATHENS   Greece s potential next prime minister  Kyriakos Mitsotakis  says he plans to unblock privatizations  cut taxes and enact meaningful reforms to attract investment  increase state efficiency and make the pension system viable  With opinion polls putting him more than 10 points ahead of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras  the conservative leader is confident an EU election next month will prove to be a springboard to winning a national vote expected by the autumn  We ll be implementing them  reforms  not because they are part of a program but because we truly believe that they are necessary to make the Greek economy more competitive   Mitsotakis told Reuters from the headquarters of New Democracy  Greece s main opposition party  By implementing reforms  he says Greece can persuade its lenders  who still monitor the economy even after it officially exited its 280 billion euro financial crisis bailouts  to lower their targets and convince investors that it is out of the woods The 51 year old scion of a powerful family of politicians considers Greece s post bailout primary surplus targets  too high   but says that they must be respected  at least in the short term   Greece tapped international bond markets with a 10 year bond earlier this year  its first such issue in a decade  But at 18 percent the unemployment rate remains the highest in the euro zone and so is its debt  standing at 180 percent of output  The economy is not the only issue for a future Greek leader to grapple with Mitsotakis maintains deep reservations at the deal brokered by the leftist government recognizing the neighboring state with the name North Macedonia  Skopje should not expect an automatic entry pass into the European Union now the name dispute is resolved  Mitsotakis said With many Greeks still struggling with the effects of creditor mandated austerity though  the upcoming elections will undoubtedly become a referendum on how firebrand leftist Tsipras  elected in 2015  handled the crisis Mitsotakis camp is already on a war footing ahead of the EU parliamentary vote on May 26  People come and go from his office  adorned with paintings  pictures of his family and his late father   a former prime minister   books  a model ship named  Leadership  and a stuffed toy lion People who know him say an unflappable demeanor denotes an attention to detail  a workaholic who came in as an outsider to win the party leadership in 2016  Greece emerged from the third bailout nine months ago  But Mitsotakis says it has not turned a corner   it is just comparatively better than 2015  when he says bungled negotiation tactics by Tsipras s government almost got it thrown out of the euro zone  Tsipras says he had no other option but to accept it   VICIOUS CIRCLE The economic monitoring framework includes meeting an annual primary budget surplus   excluding debt servicing costs   of 3 5 percent of GDP until 2022   Once we deliver the reforms  I think that would be the right time to discuss the primary surpluses   he said  Apart from pushing hard on  emblematic investments   such as a real estate project at the former Athens airport and a Chinese investment at Greece s largest port in Piraeus  his gameplan includes cutting corporate tax to 20 percent from 28 percent and tax on dividends to 5 from 10 percent within two years The middle class is overtaxed  he said   They ve taken more money out of people s pockets than it was necessary so I plan to return some of it back to people and to the corporations   Greece sees growth at 2 5 percent this year  But Mitsotakis said the country needed at least 4 percent economic growth  to convince everyone that it has broken out of the vicious circle   At the end of the day what is going to make our debt sustainable is if Greece is going to move to a different growth trajectory   he said Mitsotakis s party stridently opposed the deal recognizing the ex Yugoslav Republic as North Macedonia  a view shared by many believing the name claimed by the northern state is an appropriation of Greek culture and heritage  Although we don t like the agreement we ll respect it   the leader said   But we ll work to improve aspects or consequences of the agreement that are currently not in our interest  For years  the wrangle has stopped the small state from joining NATO and the EU  North Macedonia is expected to join the alliance in 2020  But joining the EU  which includes each member state approving a candidate s compliance in various policy areas  is a longer process  I don t think anyone should expect Greece to agree to open and close chapters when there are still outstanding issues which have not been addressed by the agreement   Mitsotakis said   Of course we fully retain the right to block this process if we think that our national interests are not met    Reporting by Renee Maltezou and Michele Kambas  Editing by Alison Williams

election the country has had in decades  with important things at stake  the probity of government  relations with the Diaspora  the limits of the settlement enterprise  the possibility of peace There are things that matter more  Keeping faith with the fallen and bereaved is one of them Anyone who has lived in Israel gets this  It s a young and improvising state resting atop an ancient and profound civilization  At the heart of the civilization is common memory  Elections come and go  memory accretes  It is to everyday life what geology is to flora and fauna  grounding  shaping  slow moving  still growing  Memory is the true land of Israel The Israeli government spent 37 years tracking Baumel s remains to Syria and negotiating their recovery through Russia  The country will expend similar efforts to bring home other fallen soldiers held in enemy hands  It s the core of the Jewish state s social contract  It may not be able to keep its people safe  much less make them rich  But it will never forget or forsake them That s something to consider when it comes to the election  too  In Washington last month I interviewed Benny Gantz  the former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces who now leads the Blue and White party  the principal challenger to Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud Gantz doesn t communicate a political agenda so much as he does a character and an attitude  He s an Israeli of the old school  confident  to the point  unassuming   a man who tries  but doesn t quite succeed  in hiding his warmth  In our interview he described himself as a security hawk and a  moderate capitalist   but otherwise his ideology is mainly about not having one The interview itself was unremarkable  Gantz had a slight lead in the polls at the time  he s now in a dead heat  though the outcome of the election will depend on how smaller  coalition making parties fare   and he seemed to be taking care to say nothing that would get him into trouble  Here  condensed for clarity  is what stood out ImageIsraeli soldiers carring the coffin of Sergeant Zachary Baumel during a military funeral at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem CreditAbir Sultan EPA  via ShutterstockOn Netanyahu   Very smart  a good manager  a good politician  He s what so many Israelis would like to see  in a prime minister   In the last four or five years  something happened to this guy  I don t know what happened  It s unexplainable  On Palestinian statehood   Israel needs to stay a Zionist country with a Jewish majority in a democratic system  Eventually  Palestinians should have some kind of independency  On egalitarian prayer spaces   The Western Wall is long enough to accommodate everyone  On Israel s security needs vis  vis Palestinians   We should maintain security for a perimeter outside  Palestinian areas   Conduct security inside  If we don t  it will endanger Palestinians themselves  The economies should eventually be merged  On relations with the U S    We share the same values and moral standards and we share the same interests  And it stands for both sides of the aisle  On whether he would serve in a coalition with Netanyahu  either over or under him   No  On what distinguishes his party from Netanyahu s   We have left and right  religious and secular  Druse  ultra Orthodox women  Unity is very important  We cannot agree on everything but we must agree on the framework    Netanyahu currently lives off this separation  between various Israeli groups   I m talking about my priorities  but I m talking to everyone  He s appealing to his base  That last observation is the essential point  In many ways  Israel has defied expectations and done remarkably well over the past decade  Much of this has been Netanyahu s doing But it has come at the cost of increasing divisions between Israeli and American Jews  And intense divisions between Orthodox and non Orthodox Jews  And embittering divisions between Jewish and non Jewish Israelis  And between the hard right and everyone it deems a sellout   an ever growing group when one practices the politics of loyalists versus traitors  as opposed to the politics of friends and potential friends None of these quarrels are about Israel s enemies  who are real  deadly and growing in number  But the quarrels have become enemies in themselves  Israel is powerful enough to defeat any of its regional adversaries  in almost any combination  It can survive the challenge of the Palestinians and binationalism  too  Whether it can survive its own descent into sectarian and ideological tribalism is another matter Which is why the return of Baumel s remains seems so propitiously timed  Israeli pundits think it will help Netanyahu s re election chances  on the view that it makes him seem more capable and statesmanlike I wouldn t be so sure  Baumel s short life  tragic death and hard fought homecoming are potent reminders of all the ties that still unite the Jewish state  for all the differences  They are what commends Gantz s candidacy  whether he wins this time or not The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think

President Trump earlier this year asked Senator Mitch McConnell  the majority leader  to prioritize a confirmation vote for his nominee to be the chief counsel of the Internal Revenue Service  indicating that it was a higher priority than voting on the nomination of William P  Barr as attorney general  a person familiar with the conversation said White House aides insisted for months that the confirmation of the nominee  Michael J  Desmond  a tax lawyer from Santa Barbara  Calif   was a top priority after passage of the tax bill in 2017 But the request by Mr  Trump  made to Mr  McConnell on Feb  5  raised questions about whether the president had other motivations  For months  the president has seethed over vows by congressional Democrats that they would move to obtain his tax returns from the I R S  And this week  the House Ways and Means Committee chairman  Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  formally asked the I R S  for six years of the returns  using an obscure provision in the tax code to do so On Thursday  asked if he would direct the I R S  not to disclose his tax returns  Mr  Trump said Democrats would have to talk to his lawyers  They ll speak to my lawyers   Mr  Trump said during remarks at the Oval Office   They ll speak to the attorney general  In July  when Mr  Desmond was first being considered by the Senate Finance Committee  Bloomberg reported that he had briefly advised the Trump Organization on tax issues before Mr  Trump took office  James Wilkinson  a spokesman for Mr  Desmond  told Bloomberg that Mr  Desmond had helped with  a discrete reporting matter for a subsidiary company that was resolved with no tax impact  In private practice  Mr  Desmond worked for a time alongside William Nelson and Sheri Dillon  who currently serve as tax counsels to the Trump Organization The I R S  chief counsel advises the agency director on  all matters pertaining to the interpretation  administration and enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code  as well as all other legal matters   according to a description on the agency s website  The chief counsel reports jointly to the director of the I R S  and the Treasury Department s general counsel The Senate did not immediately act on Mr  Trump s request  It first moved ahead with Mr  Barr s nomination  Mr  Desmond was confirmed two weeks later  on Feb  27 Mr  Trump and his team have been warily anticipating the probing demands of House investigators since Democrats won control in November  The message to Mr  McConnell came around the time that Mr  Trump  eyeing a torrent of new House investigations led by Democrats  told reporters that he was unfairly under fire He appeared to take particular umbrage at an inquiry by the House Intelligence Committee focused on potential ties to Russia  as well as accusations of potential money laundering by Mr  Trump s businesses and his associates  It s called presidential harassment   he said   And it s unfortunate  And it really does hurt our country  The president directly relayed his concern about the prompt confirmation of Mr  Desmond to Mr  McConnell around the time that Mr  Trump was preparing to deliver his State of the Union address  the person said Hogan Gidley  a White House deputy press secretary  declined to discuss the specifics of the conversation between Mr  Trump and Mr  McConnell  Democrats have obstructed and delayed a record number of President Trump s well qualified nominees  so it shouldn t be surprising to anyone that he regularly communicates with Majority Leader McConnell about how to increase confirmations in the face of Democrats  ridiculous behavior   Mr  Gidley said David Popp  a spokesman for Mr  McConnell  also declined to comment But according to a person familiar with what took place  Mr  Trump told Mr  McConnell that Mr  Desmond was growing frustrated with the holdup and was contemplating withdrawing from the process Democrats in the House are relying on a little known provision of the federal tax code to try to view Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns  The provision  added in the 1920s  gives the chairmen of Congress s tax writing committees   including the Democrat led Ways and Means Committee in the House   authorities to request information on any filer to review privately The text of the law does not give the Trump administration clear grounds to deny a request from Mr  Neal  saying only that when requested  the Treasury secretary  shall  furnish the information  But Treasury Department officials are making preparations to challenge any requests coming from Mr  Neal  They would most likely argue that his action is politically motivated  not related to real matters of policy and therefore illegitimate Mr  Trump  asked on Wednesday about the request by reporters during an Oval Office event  maintained that he was still being audited  a claim he has made for years to defend not releasing his tax returns  as previous presidents have done  

WASHINGTON   The House passed legislation on Wednesday that would guarantee broadband internet users equal access to online content  in a crucial step toward bringing back so called net neutrality regulations overturned at the start of the Trump administration In a 232 to 190 vote  divided along party lines  the Democratic majority made good on a promise that became a rallying cry in many progressive circles during the 2018 election  It is also expected to be held up as an issue by Democrats in 2020 But the legislation  the Save the Internet Act  faces long odds in the Republican led Senate  The Senate leader  Mitch McConnell  said this week that the legislation would be  dead on arrival   Earlier this week  the Office of Management and Budget advised the White House to veto the law if it reached the president s desk  The office said in a letter that since the law had been overturned  the broadband industry had thrived  a good sign of how deregulation helped the economy The legislation would prohibit blocking and throttling web traffic and would categorize broadband as a service open to heavy regulation  Supporters say the regulation would prevent companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of content like videos  Opponents say it would strap broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast with heavy handed restrictions  and could lead to price controls  We need a law that puts a cop on the beat who will enforce the laws  because we can t just rely on internet providers to say this will be a free and open internet   Representative Frank Pallone  Democrat of New Jersey  said in an interview   No one believes them  ImageAjit Pai  chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  rolled back net neutrality rules in 2017 CreditJacquelyn Martin Associated PressThe Federal Communications Commission rolled back the country s net neutrality rules in November 2017  Shortly after  internet companies and public interest groups sued to overturn the action  which was led by Ajit Pai  the agency s chairman In addition  more than two dozen states have raced to create their own net neutrality laws  The Justice Department and telecommunications companies have  in turn  sued to block the state efforts Net neutrality  a regulatory idea hatched by academics  has been a decade long battle pitting Silicon Valley and consumer groups against the telecommunications sector  Companies like Google  Mozilla and Facebook have argued that without rules  telecommunications companies can become gatekeepers of online content by choosing the quality of the delivery of web services in a way that could hurt rivals and consumers  The Obama administration sided with their argument  with the F C C  approving new regulations in 2015 Now  the companies are pushing for a law on the issue  A group of 120 start ups  including Stripe  Medium  and GitHub  wrote a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders in support of the bill  Net neutrality is fundamental to guaranteeing that every American has unencumbered access to the internet   the companies wrote   This access is also essential to a competitive  free market for the technology economy to thrive as well as entrepreneurship in this country  The biggest disagreement between Republicans and Democrats is whether broadband should be considered a utility like phone service  Republicans say that doing so could lead to the possible regulation of broadband rates  Democrats say the categorization is an important update that recognizes the importance of broadband to the economy  culture and education  Some in Congress are trying to give the government more control again  applying utility style regulations that would threaten the internet as we know it  We should reject these efforts   Senator Roger Wicker  Republican of Mississippi  said on the Senate floor last week  

JERUSALEM   Benjamin Netanyahu  Israel s conservative prime minister for the past decade  appeared poised to win a fourth consecutive term in office  and a fifth overall  according to preliminary results early on Wednesday Both Mr  Netanyahu and his chief rival  Benny Gantz  a centrist former military chief  declared victory after Tuesday s parliamentary election  appearing to win the same number of seats in the Israeli parliament  But a count of the broader blocs needed to form a coalition government appeared to give Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party a clear advantage over Mr  Gantz s Blue and White Mr  Netanyahu now seems all but sure to surpass the nation s founding leader  David Ben Gurion  as Israel s longest serving prime minister Victory would also provide Mr  Netanyahu  69  with a renewed mandate as he battles a looming indictment on charges of bribery and corruption A dominant global player who has built a strong economy  Mr  Netanyahu is widely credited with having kept the country secure and delivered a series of long sought diplomatic victories  many of them thanks to President Trump Regardless of the outcome  Mr  Gantz s strong performance was a remarkable achievement for a political newcomer and a brand new party  Mr  Gantz  a career soldier who retired as chief of staff in 2015  entered politics last year for the first time  joining forces with two other former army chiefs in an effort to blunt Mr  Netanyahu s claim that only he could keep Israel safe More than a million Israelis appeared to have voted for Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party  placing it in the position of being the main alternative to Israel s right wing  a spot once held by the Labor Party ImageSupporters of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesInitial exit polls had projected a muddled outcome  and many Israelis went to bed on Tuesday suspended in a post ballot twilight zone  The final tally may not be known until the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients are counted later this week The exit polls of the three main television channels were sufficiently disparate that both sides claimed victory  This is a night of tremendous victory   Mr  Netanyahu said after entering a jubilant campaign celebration around 2 a m  to cheers and chants of  Bibi  king of Israel   I believe that the Lord and history have given the people of Israel another opportunity  a golden opportunity to turn our country into a strong nation  among the strongest nations of the world   he said He said he expected to forge a new coalition with the right wing parties he called his  natural partners   but that he intended to be  the prime minister of all the citizens of Israel  Earlier  Mr  Gantz entered a packed election night headquarters in Tel Aviv to thunderous cheers  declaring   We are the winners   He promised to be  the prime minister of everyone and not just of those who voted for us   and argued  when early exit polls had him in the lead  that the largest party should be the one granted the mandate to form the next government By dawn  Likud and Blue and White appeared to have won at least 35 seats each in the 120 seat parliament  But the right wing and religious parties together commanded a potential majority of at least 65 seats  leaving the center left bloc trailing far behind with 55 President Reuven Rivlin is expected in the next few days to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority ImageSupporters of Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditLior Mizrahi Getty ImagesAs Mr  Netanyahu has drifted steadily to the right  the left has migrated to the center  after years of violence in the second Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s and the absence of a viable peace process since Mr  Netanyahu has benefited from strong support from President Trump  who in the past two years has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal  recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital and just two weeks ago recognized Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights The Trump administration weighed in again on Monday  declaring the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization  By Monday night in Israel  Mr  Netanyahu was boasting on Twitter in Hebrew   but not in English   that this was in fulfillment of  another important request of mine  But Mr  Netanyahu s pursuit of a fourth consecutive term came as he faces indictment for bribery and other corruption charges  The evidence in those cases  which was kept under wraps until after the election to avoid leaks that could tilt the contest against Mr  Netanyahu  are now to be turned over to lawyers in the case  meaning Mr  Netanyahu could be plagued by damaging reports while he tries to assemble a coalition And it could be difficult for him to remain in office once formal criminal charges are lodged against him  possibly as soon as late summer Mr  Netanyahu spent much of the past year undermining law enforcement officials and the gatekeepers of Israel s liberal democracy  railing against the police  the attorney general and what he called the  leftist  mainstream media  trying to delegitimize his critics and organizations working for Palestinian rights  His government has also worked to curb the powers of the Supreme Court Even as Mr  Netanyahu forged diplomatic ties and trading partnerships with new countries  he stymied any prospect of a resolution of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  aided by a weak  divided and at times recalcitrant Palestinian leadership  Veering farther to the right in the final days of the election campaign  he pledged to start annexing parts of the occupied West Bank if re elected  a move he had long resisted He was widely expected in his coalition negotiations to try to trade passage of annexation laws for retroactive immunity to prosecution in the corruption cases against him ImageA woman voting in Ramat Gan on Tuesday  If the vote remains close  it may come down to the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients counted later this week CreditOded Balilty Associated PressBut Israelis as a whole have lost faith in a two state solution  polls show  and the election seemed to bear that out For many Palestinians  the distinctions between Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz were inconsequential Saeb Erekat  the chief Palestinian negotiator  pointed to one exit poll showing that only 18 of the Parliament s members still supported a two state solution  calling this  a consequence of the culture of impunity granted to Israel   What the exit polls suggest is that Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo   he said   They have said  no  to peace and  yes  to the occupation  Early analysis showed a historically low turnout among Arab citizens of Israel  many of whom boycotted the vote out of disillusionment with Israeli politics and with their own politicians By nightfall Arab leaders were frantically trying to rally their supporters  mosques were broadcasting appeals from minaret loudspeakers  and a last minute surge of participation seemed to materialize in some predominantly Arab towns  though that was not captured in exit polls Despite the broad margin of support for a Netanyahu government  coalition negotiations may still prove difficult  with several small parties acting as kingmakers and Mr  Netanyahu vulnerable to political extortion  The question is whether people will climb down from their trees or not   said Abraham Diskin  a professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  referring to the lofty demands and conditions some party leaders have already placed on entering a coalition Mr  Gantz and his allies in the Blue and White alliance have pledged not to join a government with a prime minister facing indictment ImageLaborers hanging a campaign banner depicting Mr  Netanyahu  center  with other candidates of his Likud party  in Jerusalem last month CreditAmmar Awad ReutersLike most Israeli election campaigns  this one ripped open the fissures in Israeli society  With Mr  Netanyahu facing indictment and battling for his political survival against Mr  Gantz  the most credible challenger in a decade  many Israelis said it was the nastiest and most divisive race they could recall With three former army chiefs in Blue and White s top four slots  Mr  Netanyahu was unable to rely on his usual politics of fear  presenting himself as the only candidate able to provide Israelis with security Instead  his campaign focused largely on perceived enemies within Mr  Netanyahu fanned the flames of anti Arab sentiment  warning Israelis that Mr  Gantz would  hand over parts of the homeland to the Arabs   He also joined forces with a racist faction  one of whose members was ultimately barred from running in the election by the Supreme Court On Election Day  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling places in Arab towns in what they said was an effort to capture evidence of any irregularities  but Arab leaders called it a blatant attempt at voter intimidation The dwindling left  for its part  accused Blue and White of being right wing  saying that it was conspiring to join a Netanyahu government Mr  Netanyahu tried to cast the race as one between an experienced world leader and an unproven political novice  His party raised questions about Mr  Gantz s sexual propriety  his vulnerability to extortion by the Iranians after his cellphone was apparently breached  and even his mental stability Mr  Gantz s party said it wanted to put Israel back on course  It fought Mr  Netanyahu s polarization with promises of restoring a sense of unity  decency and democratic values The fate of smaller parties at both ends of the spectrum was unclear and could still prove significant  It s been a long night   Mr  Netanyahu said at his post midnight rally   And it will be a long day waiting for the true results

BEIRUT  Lebanon   Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on Wednesday to be on his way to a fifth term as prime minister of Israel  solidifying the sense across the Arab world that the dream of a Palestinian state is more remote than ever   as is the chance that the United States will help create it Throughout his campaign  Mr  Netanyahu appealed to right wing voters by making promises to them about issues long expected to be negotiated with Israel s Arab neighbors And through his close relationship with the Trump administration  he pushed for the United States to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Days before the election  he suggested he would annex at least some of the West Bank if he won The strategy helped ensure his grip on power  It closes all doors for any possible peace settlement and any chance for the Palestinians to have a state of their own   said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla  a political scientist from the United Arab Emirates  While that would cause frustration among the Arabs  there was little they could do about it  he said  The Arabs are at their weakest  The Palestinians are divided like never before  Israel is stronger than ever and Trump backs it  so Israel can do whatever it wants   he said For decades  support for the creation of a Palestinian state was a rare issue met with consensus across the Arab world  Israeli leaders faced limits on the kinds of unilateral actions they could take for fear of causing pushback from the Arabs or from the United States and other Western countries But that dynamic has faded as the peace process stalled for years and as the Palestinians remain divided among themselves  with different factions in charge of the West Bank and Gaza The Arab Spring uprisings and their violent aftermath left many Arab leaders more focused on staying in power than on standing up for the Palestinians  And Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have quietly warmed up to Israel  seeing it as a valuable partner in confronting their common enemy   Iran Arab investment in the peace process dwindled even further with the election of President Trump  whose administration has built warm relations with Mr  Netanyahu while isolating the Palestinians  Leaders of allied Arab states did not want to jeopardize their own relations with the new administration by pushing the Palestinian cause The shrinking horizon for a Palestinian state  is concerning  but are the Arab regimes concerned   asked Michael Young  a senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut  Lebanon   The Saudi and Emirati minds are on Iran  and they are not going to undermine their relationship with the United States and with Israel over these issues  ImageLaborers at a construction site in Beitar Illit  an Israeli settlement in the West Bank  Days before the election  Mr  Netanyahu suggested he would annex at least some of the West Bank if he won CreditRonen Zvulun ReutersSyria  which has long opposed Israel s existence  has been so badly weakened by years of civil war that it could muster no more than formulaic condemnations when Mr  Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Israel seized the territory from Syria in the 1967 war Iraq  too  has been ground down by years of battle to oust the Islamic State from a chunk of its territory Dealing with the issue is more complicated for United States allies that made peace with Israel  hoping their agreements would pave the way for a broader agreement with the Palestinians In Egypt  President Abdel Fattah el Sisi rarely speaks of the Palestinians and has embraced Mr  Trump as a rare American leader who does not criticize his human rights record Jordan  a close Arab ally of the United States  perhaps has the most to lose from Israel s rightward lurch  It shares a long border with Israel  has a large Palestinian population and remains invested in resolving the core issues of the conflict  such as the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian refugees  Now  with the new American approach  none of these positions will be respected   said Oraib al Rantawi  the director of the Al Quds Center for Political Studies   Jordan is not happy to see Netanyahu elected again as prime minister of Israel  and we fear that we are not headed toward more conflict between Israel and the Palestinians but between Israel and Jordan  But there was little Jordan could do other than reject proposed settlements that are not to its liking or that impose specific roles on Jordan  like absorbing Palestinian refugees Mr  Netanyahu s win could play into the hands of Arab militants  such as those in Hezbollah and Hamas who call for Israel s destruction  because it bolsters their argument that negotiating with Israel is a waste of time  Netanyahu will likely form a new  right wing Zionist government  and we are before a new stage of unprecedented cooperation between America and Israel represented in Netanyahu and Trump   Hezbollah s leader  Hassan Nasrallah  said in a speech on Wednesday It remains to be seen whether Mr  Netanyahu will make good on his election promises  Significant Israeli moves in the West Bank could result in new violence with the Palestinians  and many Arabs would automatically support their Arab brethren And cozying up to Israel too much could harm the standing of Arab leaders before their own people  The Palestinian situation has been written off so many times but it remains a big issue for many Arab citizens   said Mr  Young of the Carnegie center   We shouldn t underestimate how this could be a problem for some of these regimes in terms of their legitimacy   

If  at more than a year long  the race to elect the president of the United States is an ultramarathon  Australia s campaign season is a sprint Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia fired the proverbial starting pistol on Thursday  declaring a federal election for May 18 and kicking off a 38 day dash to the ballot box counting today and Election Day  There is so much at stake at this election   Mr  Morrison said at a news conference in Canberra  emphasizing his party s platform focused on economic issues and tax cuts  There is more to do   he added   and a lot has got done  It s still not clear exactly how many days of campaigning will be allowed  the Labor Party leader  Bill Shorten  has called for a campaigning ban on at least two holidays between now and Election Day But clearly  Australia s race will be quick  By contrast  the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States lasted 596 days  counting from the date of the first major candidate s official declaration to Election Day  The 2020 campaign  one of the longest in history  is set to last 1 194 days   the equivalent of more than 30 Australian election seasons The election comes at a critical time for Australia  an American ally  which is torn on important issues such as climate change and how to contend with China s rise On the surface  a shorter campaign period would seem to prevent voter fatigue and limit the extent to which questionable financial contributions can muddy the process  But experts say campaigns of even a few weeks are marred by many of the same problems seen in longer elections Ultimately  a shorter campaign has less to do with perfecting the process and more to do with simply speeding it up What determines a campaign s length The length of a campaign can be boiled down in most democracies to this question  Are you electing a president or a prime minister  Put another way  Are you voting for an individual who you need time to get to know  or are you voting for a legislating party that is headed by a leader with whom you re already familiar Because the parties in the parliamentary system choose their candidates for prime minister   in the case of Australia s main parties  Scott Morrison of the Liberal Party and Bill Shorten of Labor   there is no need for months of vetting  debates or primaries ImagePrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia  center  had to call an election before June CreditSam Mooy EPA  via ShutterstockA 2015 study  analyzing more than 26 000 polls in 45 countries since 1942  found that voters  preferences take much longer to form in a presidential election than a parliamentary one because presidential voters need more time to assess the candidates Parliamentary systems also differ from presidential republics in the frequency with which elections can be called  In a presidential system  the term of office is fixed  and campaigning for the next election effectively starts when the last election ends But in a parliamentary system  general elections can be called more regularly and with less notice  To avoid lengthy gaps without a government  many countries have laws limiting the duration of a campaign How does Australia stack up Australian campaigns last between 33 and 68 days  That s short by American standards but an eternity compared to Singapore  a country that has been governed by the same party for five decades  and which gives voters just nine days to choose a candidate Campaigns in Japan run for 12 days  In France  campaigning before the first round of voting can last no more than two weeks  The campaign period in Canada lasts about 36 days  in Britain five to six weeks and in Israel 101 days Like Australia  those counties all have legally fixed campaign periods According to John Keane  a professor of politics at the University of Sydney and author of  The Life and Death of Democracy   the writers of Australia s Constitution had good reason to limit the length of campaigns The writers feared  that since the House of Representatives would usually not last three years from the time of its first meeting  and since sitting governments and politicians in search of victory might be tempted to string out election campaigns  good government would suffer   Professor Keane said They also worried  he added  that  abuse of power and political discontinuity would get the upper hand  Hence the need to place strict time limits on election campaigns  Why now Members of Australia s lower house of Parliament  the House of Representatives  have to face voters every three years  and the last general election was held in 2016  To meet the time frame  Mr  Morrison had to declare an election before June Mr  Morrison has been in power since August  but this is the first time he will face voters as the head of the Liberal Party  He took office after a party putsch  known as a leadership spill  that ousted his predecessor  Malcolm Turnbull By law  the election cannot coincide with state elections or holidays  and has to take place on a Saturday ImageLawmakers at Parliament House in Canberra in November CreditTracey Nearmy Getty ImagesDoes compulsory voting result in less partisanship Saturday elections and a contracted campaign period are Australian traditions meant to increase voter engagement and turnout  Similarly  Australians are required by law to vote and are fined if they do not Compulsory voting clearly increases participation  but the data is mixed on whether it entrenches partisanship  One 2012 study found that  compulsory voting boosts the likelihood that one will identify with a party and  in turn  the strength of party attachments  But in her book  From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage  How Australia Got Compulsory Voting   Judith Brett  an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University in Melbourne  Australia  argues that voters are increasingly disenchanted with the major political parties More than ever  Professor Brett writes  Australians are splitting their votes between parties in House and Senate elections  Without compulsory voting   she writes   many disillusioned voters would turn away from politics altogether and stop voting  Does a shorter campaign make it harder to buy influence American candidates cannot sustain the lengthy campaign season   or afford costly ads   without raising large amounts of cash  In 2016  Hillary Clinton raised  1 4 billion and Donald Trump raised  957 million It is easy to believe that a shorter campaign would limit the amount of money that candidates need to run  thereby decreasing their opportunities to exploit financing loopholes But  according to Professor Keane   time limits on election campaigns have little to do with the need to dampen financial fraud   If anything   he added   the short election campaigns do the opposite  As in practically every democracy  our elections are awash in dark money  The government provides public financing for the parties  which in theory should limit the impact of moneyed interests  But there are loopholes that allow the parties to accept corporate and private donations with little oversight A study by the Grattan Institute  an independent Australian think tank  found there was no way to account for more than 60 million Australian dollars  or about  42 7 million  donated to political parties in the 2016 17 financial year In the prior fiscal year  which included the 2016 federal election  Grattan found that at least 40 percent of party contributions   154 million Australian dollars   could not be traced to their donors  

Israel s parliamentary election on Tuesday brings an end to a neck and neck campaign that saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  the veteran politician of the Israeli right and one of the country s longest serving leaders  facing the strongest challenge in years  Mr  Netanyahu s tenure has been marked by a collapse of peace talks with the Palestinians  confrontation with Iran  armed conflict

White alliance  a coalition named for the colors of the Israeli flag  slightly ahead of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  a dominant force on the Israeli right for decades Their policy stances are similar  a reflection of how Israeli politics have moved increasingly to the right under Mr  Netanyahu  But while Mr  Gantz has sought allies from across the spectrum  Mr  Netanyahu has reached out to the far right to strengthen his prospects for a parliamentary majority  He even has promised to begin extending sovereignty over the occupied West Bank  which the Palestinians want for a future state  if he is re elected The Blue and White leaders are drawing on their military backgrounds to counter Mr  Netanyahu s contention that only he can protect Israel  Mr  Gantz and his colleagues have also focused on the corruption accusations against Mr  Netanyahu  his biggest vulnerability  to press their case that new leadership is needed They have attracted backing from smaller centrist parties  And what remains of the left leaning opposition has thrown its support behind Mr  Gantz for prime minister  The Labor Party would be likely to recommend Mr  Gantz for the premiership after the election What makes this election different Mr  Netanyahu could be indicted  Israel s attorney general announced last month that he planned to bring charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  A final decision on charges is likely by year s end  Under the current law  Mr  Netanyahu  if re elected  would not have to resign until a final conviction  although new legislation or public pressure could force him to step down  Mr  Netanyahu has described the charges as a baseless partisan witch hunt  But with a first sitting prime minister to be charged  Israel would be entering uncharted legal and political terrain The uncertainty has worked against Mr  Netanyahu in the prelude to the vote   The attorney general s report has done something that has never happened in Israel s 70 year history  and that is that a prime minister is under a legal cloud   said David Makovsky  an expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  The election also is the first time that three former heads of the army  the Israel Defense Forces  have united to run for office  The Blue and White alliance is led by Mr  Gantz and two other veteran generals  Gabi Ashkenazi and Moshe Yaalon They have teamed up with a well known centrist party  Yesh Atid  led by Yair Lapid  a former journalist  television host and finance minister  Mr  Gantz has agreed to hand off the prime minister position to Mr  Lapid after two and a half years if their parties win  While Mr  Netanyahu has a strong record of defending Israel  the Blue and White alliance s military credentials have made it more difficult for him to attack Mr  Gantz and his colleagues as weak on security   The question is  will it neutralize the advantage that Netanyahu has accrued over his previous four terms of being  Mr  Security    Mr  Makovsky said   He s said the words Israelis want to hear   I ll keep you safe    How does the voting work Voters cast ballots for parties  not individual candidates  to fill seats in the 120 member Knesset  or Parliament  The seats are divided proportionally based on the percentage of the vote each party receives  Any party that wins 3 25 percent or more of the vote gets at least one seat  If parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes won t be counted  That will raise the share of seats given to the other parties  If one party were to win at least 61 seats  it would be entitled to form a government  But this has never happened in Israeli politics  So once the seats have been apportioned  parties try to cobble together coalitions that control a majority of seats  ImageAn election billboard for the New Right party  with which Likud is expected to align CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat might those alliances look like Polls have suggested that Likud and Blue and White will each get about 30 seats   meaning both will be seeking alliances with smaller parties  Likud is expected to align with a  right wing party known as the New Right  and with an extreme right alliance known as the Union of Right Wing Parties  which includes Jewish Power  widely criticized as an extremist  anti Arab racist party  Potential Blue and White coalition partners include the Labor Party and the leftist Meretz Party  among others  Read about the Palestinian rapper who is  urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes by boycotting the elections  Will the outcome of the vote be clear immediately Probably not  The president  Reuven Rivlin  has the discretion to give the party leader with the best chance of forming a majority coalition the first opportunity  Typically  but not always  that opportunity goes to the leader of the party with the most votes  who then has 42 days to try  If that party leader fails  the president turns to another to attempt to create a coalition  So it could take a few months It also is possible that the Likud and the Blue and White coalition would join forces and create a national unity government  In theory  Mr  Rivlin could offer both Mr  Gantz and Mr  Netanyahu this opportunity and they could take turns as prime minister Mr  Gantz has rejected that idea  vowing that he will not sit on a government with Mr  Netanyahu  though a leaked recording suggested that he might  ImageAyman Odeh  a leading Arab politician  in Nazareth last month  CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat about  Arab citizens of Israel They represent nearly a fifth of the country s 5 8 million eligible voters  which could give the four Israeli Arab parties a potential kingmaker role  But these parties have never joined a governing coalition in Israel  And some Israeli Arab voters have vowed to boycott the election  partly in protest of a new law pushed by Mr  Netanyahu declaring Israel as the  nation state of the Jewish people   Critics have called the law racist and undemocratic What about Palestinians in occupied territory They are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote in the election  About 4 75 million Palestinians fall into this category  according to the Institute for Middle East Understanding  an American nonprofit educational group that promotes Palestinian viewpoints Could the election affect a potential peace plan Still steeped in secrecy  President Trump s long anticipated plan to resolve the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is not much of an issue in the election  Nevertheless  it could be affected Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law  who has been leading the administration s efforts to draft the plan  said it would not be made public until after the election Many Palestinians already have dismissed the plan   whatever it may contain   because they see Mr  Trump as siding with Israel  But the plan also faces a threat from the parties of the Israeli extreme right  which see any concessions to the Palestinians as unacceptable  If Mr  Netanyahu needs those parties to form a coalition  Mr  Trump s peace plan may be doomed However  if Blue and White wins or forms a national unity government with Likud  that could make way for possible cooperation with the Trump administration on a plan  David M  Halbfinger  Isabel Kershner and Herbert Buchsbaum

PHILADELPHIA   Since her book  Lead From the Outside  came out in paperback last month  Stacey Abrams has been showing up in places befitting a woman whose razor thin loss in the 2018 Georgia governor s race turned her into a national political star On  Morning Joe   she parried questions about a possible presidential run  On  The Late Show   Stephen Colbert surprised her by reading from one of the romance novels she has published under a pseudonym But last Friday  Ms  Abrams dropped in on a much quieter venue  the Library Company of Philadelphia  founded in 1731 by Ben Franklin  which bills itself as the oldest cultural institution in the United States It wasn t a stop on Ms  Abrams s book tour  Instead  she was there to participate in an intimate two hour conversation about the history of voter suppression with four leading scholars  It will be published next year by the University of Georgia Press as part of a new series called History in the Headlines  which aims to bring historical expertise to bear on today s most hotly debated issues The Trump era has been a red alert moment for many historians  who have mobilized in the classroom  on op ed pages and on social media to combat what they see as the erosion of democratic norms and an attack on truth itself For the conversation  the moderator  Jim Downs  a professor at Connecticut College  had recruited what he called a  dream team   Carol Anderson  the author of  One Person  No Vote   Heather Cox Richardson  an expert in the history of the Republican Party  Heather Ann Thompson  the author of a Pulitzer Prize winning account of the Attica prison revolt  and Kevin M  Kruse  who has become famous for his epic Twitter threads smiting the dubious historical claims of pundits and politicians Before the event  they seemed galvanized at the prospect of talking with someone who has  as Dr  Kruse put it  skin in the game  When the email went out saying she was coming  I was like     Dr  Anderson  a professor at Emory University  said  clutching her heart  A few minutes later  Ms  Abrams approached  I just thank you for what you do   Dr  Anderson said  introducing herself   You just bring it  in whatever forum  You bring it  ImageThe conversation  to be published next year as part of the book series History in the Headlines  also included Heather Cox Richardson and Kevin Kruse  at left  and Heather Ann Thompson CreditMichelle Gustafson for The New York TimesAsked why she wanted to take time out from her public schedule to participate  Ms  Abrams   a Democrat who has called her loss  fully attributable to voter suppression    said she welcomed the context historians brought to what she has made a signature issue  I m a little bit of living history for some of this   said Ms  Abrams  who  had she prevailed  would have been the first black woman elected governor of any state  But mostly  she said   I m here to listen  The Library Company dcor is old school patrician  think early American furniture and dead white guy oil portraits   but in recent years it has emphasized its rich holdings in African American history  Before the event  library staff members had laid out some items relating to the 15th Amendment  which gave black men the right to vote in 1870 After the group arrived  the archival items were cleared off the table  and replaced by a bowl of Philly soft pretzels  Mr  Downs started out on a  relatively  light note  asking participants for their own early memories of voting Dr  Kruse  who teaches at Princeton  recalled voting for Gerald Ford in a preschool election  mostly because like his dad  Ford played golf  Dr  Richardson offered a rueful college memory of not bothering to vote in the 1980 presidential election Ms  Abrams  45  flashed back to that same election  and what she said was the only  physical altercation  she ever had in school  with a classmate who called Jimmy Carter a Communist  I got into my first fight  Democrat versus Republican  in second grade   she said  She paused   I won  ImageThe Library Company  founded in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin  houses a substantial collection of material relating to African American history  like this 1870 lithograph commemorating the 15th amendment  which gave the vote to black men CreditMichelle Gustafson for The New York TimesThe nearly two hour conversation  which was not open to the public  pinged back and forth between past and present  To the group  the Supreme Court s 2013 decision in Shelby County v  Holder  which invalidated portions of the Voting Rights Act and freed nine states  mostly in the South  from federal oversight of elections  was reminiscent of the rollback of African American political rights after Reconstruction What is different about voter suppression today  they agreed  is that it has been accomplished by bureaucratic maneuvering that makes it harder to see There was discussion of the battles over the so called Motor Voter Act of 1993  which gave rise to increasing Republican claims of widespread voter fraud  After 1993  Republicans started asserting that Democrats  are only winning because there are illegitimate voters   Dr  Richardson  who teaches at Boston College  said Dr  Kruse brought up the rise of  colorblind conservatism   and pulled out his phone to check a quote from Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia  who  during oral arguments in Shelby  called extending the Voting Rights Act  a perpetuation of racial entitlement   So the Voting Rights Act isn t about equality  it s about giving African Americans an unfair advantage   he said   Which is a bizarre reading of history  Some of the questions felt like fact gathering for future histories  Mr  Downs asked Ms  Abrams how she had reached the decision to make her fiery speech  10 days after the Georgia election  announcing that she was ending her campaign but  pointedly  not conceding She said voter suppression was too often abetted by the  complicity  of political candidates  including the losers  Part of the reason voter suppression works is we ve created this culture that says you don t challenge the outcome of elections  unless the act is so egregious as to be absolutely clear on its face   she said   Fair Fight Action  a group allied with Ms  Abrams  has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Georgia s election procedures and accusing her opponent  Brian Kemp  who  as Georgia secretary of state  oversaw the election  of systematically disenfranchising poor and minority voters  The scholars offered correctives to some popular narratives  starting with the argument  invoked often by Ms  Abrams s critics  that Richard Nixon had graciously conceded the 1960 presidential election  for the good of the country  rather than challenge rumored fraudulent votes for John F  Kennedy At least that s the way Mr  Nixon told the story in his book  Six Crises   Dr  Kruse said  But in fact  he noted  the Republican Party had begun challenges in 11 states  before dropping them Near the end of the conversation  when Mr  Downs invited questions from the small group of observers  one person addressed what she called the  unspoken  political consensus in the room  raising the counterargument that focus on voter suppression was just a strategy for getting more Democrats elected Dr  Thompson  who teaches at the University of Michigan  warned against  fetishization  of the Democratic Party   At every step along this historical path  Democrats    and not just Dixiecrats    have many times been intensely interested in disenfranchising poor urban black voters too   she said Ms  Abrams noted that she had appeared in a Fair Fight Action commercial aired in Georgia during the Super Bowl alongside a Republican county commissioner  Voter suppression  she said   can eviscerate democracy for everyone  If there was palpable admiration in the room for Ms  Abrams  she beamed it right back  Politicians  she told the group   need your help   We tell the same myths over and over again until they sound like truth   she said   Where I think historians can help preserve and actually restore democracy is to remind us of how we got it   

The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau  Sign up to get it by email    Australians will go to the polls next month to elect a new government  and because elections take place as soon as 33 days after they re officially called  the country s politicians will have to move quickly to solidify votes Whoever takes the helm will have to contend with a set of challenges that mirror those of other democracies around the world Here s a look at some of the key domestic and international issues that we ll be watching and that Australia s leaders will be confronting Election MeddlingIn February  Australia became the latest Western nation whose institutions had most likely been tampered with after the government acknowledged that Parliament s computer network had been hacked by a foreign government No country has been named as being behind the cyberattack  but security experts say China  Russia  and possibly Iran and North Korea are among the suspects Officials said the three major political parties were among those affected  but wouldn t say to what extent  because they hadn t seen anything like this breach before  Even as he said a  sophisticated state actor  was behind the attack  Prime Minister Scott Morrison insisted there was  no evidence of any electoral interference  Australian elections are quick  they are compulsory and the majority of voters will cast their ballots on paper  However  during the last federal election  some areas used electronic lists to check voters  names off electoral rolls  It s not yet known if those electronic lists will be used in light of the recent hack ChinaThe Australia that will go to the polls in May is markedly different to the one that voted in 2016  particularly when it comes to China  Then  the Australian economy was on fire  Chinese investment had surged to a new high  and while the government blocked some Chinese bids for infrastructure projects  it was a record setting year for deals with Chinese companies For years  the Australian government had been able to successfully navigate its economic ties with its largest trading partner  China  and its strategic relationship with its greatest ally  the United States  without having to compromise on either But a slew of events have redefined Canberra s relationship with Beijing  In 2017  a prominent Australian senator  Sam Dastyari  resigned over accusations of lobbying for Beijing and taking money from Chinese born political donors  The government passed a foreign interference law  requiring lobbyists for other countries to register and disclose their activities   one of many efforts to push the Chinese government s soft power campaign out of the shadows And in August  Australia banned Huawei  the Chinese technology giant  from participating in the building of a fifth generation telecommunications network Politicians have been reluctant to explicitly discuss the China challenge up till now  but pressure will continue to build no matter who wins the election The EnvironmentIt was ostensibly energy policy that led to Malcolm Turnbull becoming the third prime minister in 10 years to lose the job   a dispute about addressing climate change prompted the change But the public is far less divided  A recent poll found that 59 percent of Australians are concerned about climate change and frustrated at the lack of initiative from Canberra to address it Several independent candidates are running in key electorates   including the former head of a clean energy corporation who is campaigning for the seat won last time by Josh Frydenberg  the treasurer Even so  the two main political parties have staked out vastly different positions on climate change  The Labor Party has said that there will be no new coal powered plants if it wins  but the Coalition has not ruled them out  Labor also supports a 45 percent emissions target by 2030  while the Liberal Party said that it is committed to 26 percent by 2030  Labor has also promised rebates for households installing solar batteries and wants 50 percent of new car sales to be electric vehicles by 2030 Mr  Morrison says he will spend billions of dollars on a hydroelectricity project to help alleviate rising power bills and offset carbon emissions  He has criticized the opposition s policies  arguing that higher emissions targets would  crash the economy  ImmigrationAs President Trump calls for funding to build a wall on the Mexico border  Mr  Morrison continues to boast of his role in stopping boats full of asylum seekers heading to Australia  and now wants to limit the number of skilled migrants who come to the country legally each year The move to reduce the current cap on immigration by nearly 30 000 people is seen as a step back by many  The country has relied on immigrant labor to fuel its economic boom as its population has grown to 25 million  The move also represents a reversal for Mr  Morrison  who pushed back against cutting the cap before he became prime minister The Labor Party  on the other hand  wants to increase the annual refugee intake from 16 250 to 27 000 by 2025 and said it would stick to the current migration cap should it win But the issue of immigration has created a heated debate in Australia  as voters and politicians ask  How much of the opposition to immigration comes from concerns over strained infrastructure in cities  and how much comes from racism  Islamophobia and fear A senator recently made global headlines when he blamed Muslim immigration for the mass shooting in Christchurch  New Zealand Mr  Morrison has had to deflect criticism of his party as anti immigrant and anti Muslim  When asked if the Coalition had a problem with Islamophobia  he said   As leader  my job is to set the right tone  And the tone I have set  you can see from my experience  My example has been to work with the Muslim community very deeply  So what s the most important issue for you

party officials Steve Dickson  left  and James Ashby tried last Tuesday to explain comments recorded by a reporter undercover for Al Jazeera CreditDave Hunt EPA  via ShutterstockMany of you weighed in on our examination last week of Al Jazeera s undercover investigation on the National Rifle Association and whether it was ethical  Thanks to all who wrote in or shared in our Facebook group  Here s a few of your responses  I am all for journalists using deception if it is the only way to expose something as serious as the activities of the gun lobby and One Nation  We heard them say to put nothing in a recordable form that can be investigated in any accepted way  including by law enforcement  so if they are being so deceptive  deceptive journalism is the only way to find the truth     Helen O Dea One assumes that the job of journalists is to uncover the truth  If you ask people  particularly One Nation people  questions  they will lie to you  This method worked a lot better as a means to expose what One Nation really stand for  I like it  Would I like it if some of my political allies were shown up as a bit grubby  Well not as much  but its still a legitimate technique     John Brookes Your ethics guide is right  The last thing you want is to be accused of deception in pursuit of a story as that diminishes the validity of said story  The issue of what  and who makes the determination  is in the public interest is equally as important  The case of the N R A  and One Nation is a clear cut case of foreign intervention in our democratic process  That is a concern and definitely in the public interest  But there are cases  no doubt  that are less clear  which begs the question  how does the NYT decide what is in the public interest  Sticky area     Ian Baxter

LONDON   British lawmakers endorsed Prime Minister Theresa May s request to the European Union to delay Brexit until June 30 at a vote in parliament on Tuesday  adding weight to the pitch she will make to EU leaders in Brussels  The majority of May s Conservative Party voted alongside the opposition Labour Party to back the prime minister s approach by 420 votes to 110  The main rebellion came from pro Brexit Conservatives who want Brexit to happen sooner   We should all be very clear what this extension would be for   it is all about making sure we leave the EU in a timely and orderly way and that means leaving with a deal   government Solicitor General Robert Buckland said ahead of the vote The debate came as May traveled to Berlin and Paris to drum up support for her request for more time to try and find a new plan for Britain s EU exit that can command the support of her political opponents at home  The vote itself was the culmination of an unprecedented power grab in parliament by lawmakers who this week passed a law against the government s wishes  seeking guarantees that May would not let Britain leave the EU without a deal on April 12  But because May has already requested a delay  and with no alternative dates chosen to be voted on by lawmakers on Tuesday  the vote was not a major flashpoint in the country s long running political crisis over how to deliver Brexit Nevertheless  the process of passing a law to trigger Tuesday s debate has further undermined May s political authority  proving parliament is able and willing to circumvent the government if they disagree with her choices on Brexit Labour Party junior Brexit spokesman Matthew Pennycook said his party supported May s extension plan  but warned the extra time must be used to try and find a compromise with Labour and not to pass her own thrice rejected deal at a fourth attempt   The public will not forgive the government if an extension is sought and agreed under the pretence of efforts to secure cross party compromise   he said   Additional reporting by Elizabeth Piper  Kate Holton and Alistair Smout  editing by Stephen Addison

BANGKOK   Thailand s military junta is targeting a popular new pro democracy party  accusing its leader of causing disorder that could lead to rebellion even as the seat allotments from last week s parliamentary elections are being calculated The billionaire leader of the Future Forward Party  Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  was ordered on Wednesday to submit to the police for questioning in the case  which initially opened four years ago  He is accused of helping protesters flee arrest at a demonstration and faces up to seven years in prison Mr  Thanathorn  who has built a large following partly through social media  posted the summons on Facebook and Twitter and wrote   When the dark power won t leave Future Forward alone   It s clear now that the old school political game won t end after the election  but is only getting more intense  because they re afraid of Future Forward   he added  The party came in third in the balloting last week The summons came Wednesday  a day after Thailand s Army chief  Gen  Apirat Kongsompong  warned that the military would not tolerate threats against the country s constitutional monarchy  in which the king is deemed head of state  Some considered his comments to be directed at Future Forward  The army does the army s duty  which is to protect  maintain  and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy   the general told reporters The interventions are the latest indications that the Thai junta is clinging to every advantage it can to gain an edge through the election  And the junta gave itself many of those advantages  as it put in place a new Constitution and electoral system after seizing power in a 2014 coup Those changes gave the generals sweeping influence over Parliament itself  and over an Election Commission with great power to bar candidates and target lawmakers for ejection ImageRepresentatives of the Pheu Thai and the Future Forward parties during a meeting after the election last month  The opposition coalition  including Pheu Thai and Future Forward  claimed on Wednesday that it would have a razor thin majority in the House CreditGemunu Amarasinghe Associated PressThe first electoral test for that new system came last week when Thailand finally held its long delayed parliamentary election  And though the results are not yet official  it is already clear that the regime s system is doing what it was designed to do  splintering the pro democracy opposition  and entrenching the junta s authority  Thailand is headed to a military guided  authoritarian system   said Purawich Watanasukh  a research fellow at the independent King Prajadhipok s Institute in Bangkok According to the Election Commission s preliminary results  the leading vote getter was the military backed party  Palang Pracharat  with about 24 percent  But that is less than half the popular vote received by the next three parties  which all campaigned for a return to democracy  In total  they received 51 percent of the vote  according to the early count  Palang Pracharat ran on the idea of maintaining stability and continuity and the others ran on the basis of restoring democracy   said Verapat Pariyawong  a visiting scholar at SOAS School of Law at the University of London   The majority of Thai voters went for the idea that we need to restore democracy  In parliament s lower house  the House of Representatives  the likely result will be a sharply divided body and a weak coalition government  The commission has until May 9 to announce the official results Calling itself the National Council for Peace and Order after it seized power  the junta drafted a new Constitution  the country s 20th  which was ratified in a 2016 referendum  For that vote  the junta blocked opponents from campaigning and barred election monitors Voters approved a separate measure allowing the military to appoint all 250 members of the Senate  who will join the 500 member lower house in selecting the next prime minister Critics contend that the entire system is rigged in the military s favor  That is partly through its influence over the powerful Election Commission  which came under fire for numerous irregularities during the balloting  delays in announcing the vote count  and an unexpected surge in the number of votes reported At one news conference  the commission s president  Ittiporn Boonpracong  told reporters that he could not work out the party list percentages because he did not have a calculator with him ImageDozens of protesters gathered in Bangkok on Sunday to protest the Election Commission s handling of the vote and what they termed cheating CreditLauren Decicca Getty ImagesAt another  the commission released 208 pages of election data and told reporters to figure out the seat allocations themselves Initial delays prompted the United States State Department to call for transparency  We stand with the Thai people in calling for the expeditious announcement of voting results and a fair and transparent investigation of any reported irregularities   a State Department spokesman  Robert Palladino  said last week More than 5 6 percent of the votes cast were invalidated  including some for not being marked properly  If they had gone to a single party  that party would have finished sixth over all Another 24 percent of the votes were spread among more than 70 other parties  fulfilling the military s goal of fragmenting the vote In the 2011 parliamentary election  more than three quarters of the vote went to two parties  Pheu Thai and the Democrat Party  which finished second and fourth in last week s election   An election held in 2014 was ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court  The military has another edge  as well  the timing of the coronation of a new monarch  King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun  expected May 4 to 6 That is only a few days before the election results become official  And the effect  in a country with strict laws against criticizing the monarchy  has been to make pro democracy leaders reluctant to stage any major protests before the coronation Dozens of protesters did gather on Sunday afternoon to protest the Election Commission s handling of the vote and what they termed cheating Still  the military may have to use even more tactics to fully secure a win Under complex rules that do not necessarily reward winning the most votes  Palang Pracharat will hold about 118 seats in the House while the opposition Pheu Thai Party is likely to get about 137  according to unofficial projections ImageCasting votes in Bangkok on election day  The Election Commission has until May 9 to announce the official results CreditWason Wanichakorn Associated PressThe opposition coalition  including Pheu Thai and Future Forward  claimed on Wednesday that it would have a razor thin majority in the House But under the country s new Constitution  and an accompanying body of law that followed it  the deck is stacked against them Since the next prime minister will be chosen by a combined vote of the House and the military appointed Senate  it is likely that the junta leader and current prime minister  Prayuth Chan ocha  will be named to head the new government And whatever the outcome of the vote  the Constitution gives the military the authority to shape Parliament s membership in the months and years ahead The Election Commission can seek to remove members for election misconduct and call new elections in those seats  in some circumstances barring the previous winner from running again  More than 180 such complaints have been filed  They have the whole year to disqualify people   said Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee  a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok   So the number can be changed the whole time  In addition  Mr  Verapat  the University of London visiting scholar  pointed out that the Constitution gives military appointed officials the power to remove members of Parliament any time for violating broad  ethical standards  The standards include adhering to democracy with the king as the head of state  pursuing the public interest over private interests and conducting oneself in an honest manner Government officials and courts will have wide discretion under the law to decide what violates the ethics standards  he said  Even if the so called democratic coalition was able to form a government   Mr  Verapat added   they would face a tough road ahead   

NEW YORK   John Murante  a conservative Nebraska senator  last year introduced a bill to prevent non citizens from being counted when the state redraws its voting maps He said the effort aimed to ensure each election district contained similar numbers of voters  but opponents argued it intended to undermine the political power of immigrant communities Murante s bill died after its critics pointed out a lack of granular data on where the state s non citizens live  That data may soon be available The Trump administration believes its proposed question about citizenship on the 2020 Census will help states that want to draw citizens only voting districts in the next round of redistricting by providing the first comprehensive data on non citizens in about 70 years  according to a Reuters review of court and federal register documents and interviews with more than a dozen state lawmakers Such a change would provide a new opportunity for Republican controlled states   those most likely to adopt citizens only redistricting   to redraw their voting maps in a way that could help their party win more state level elections Currently  state and federal voting districts are drawn to be roughly equal in population  regardless of how many residents can legally vote  That means tallies for district drawing purposes include non citizens  such as green card holders and undocumented immigrants Democrats and immigrant rights activists say this system ensures elected leaders represent everyone in their district who depends on public services such as schools and trash pickup  regardless of voting eligibility Republicans argue that districts should be the same size so each vote carries the same weight  If one district has far fewer eligible voters than another  each vote there has more influence on election outcomes  That s a problem for Republicans because the eligible voters in immigrant heavy districts tend to support Democrats Trump administration officials have been considering the merits of citizens only redistricting since 2017   well before announcing their intention in March 2018 to add the citizenship question to the decennial survey  according to court documents filed as part of litigation over the citizenship question And in December  the Census Bureau issued a notice in the Federal Register saying that if any states  indicate a need for     citizenship data  to use in redistricting  it would  make a design change  to provide it Republican lawmakers in Texas  Arizona  Missouri and Nebraska told Reuters they would consider making use of the citizenship data if it became available The tactic is prohibited at the federal level by past U S  Supreme Court decisions that have interpreted the U S  constitution as requiring that U S  House districts be based on total population  But the court  in a 2016 case known as Evenwel v  Abbott  left the door open for state level districts to use other metrics The Commerce Department  which includes the Census Bureau  declined to comment on whether redistricting was part of the motivation for proposing the citizenship question  James Whitehorne  the chief of the Census Bureau s Redistricting   Voting Rights Office  called the federal register notice routine   We re supposed to provide states with what they identify as needing   he said U S  voting districts are drawn at the state level  most often by state legislators  giving the party in power control over how the lines are redrawn  While both Republicans and Democrats frame the debate over citizen only districts around fairness  demographic experts point out that both sides have a lot at stake politically Data from the nonpartisan APM Research Lab showed that 95 of the 100 U S  congressional districts with the highest foreign born populations are represented by Democrats  Similar data for state level seats was not available Redrawing such districts with citizen only populations would give Republicans a better shot by expanding the districts into more conservative areas  said Albert Kauffman  a professor at St  Mary s School of Law in San Antonio who has studied redistricting and opposes excluding non citizens  In Texas  a citizens only map could strip Latino voters of majorities in two or three state senate seats and six or seven state representative seats  Kauffman said  pointing out that Hispanic voters traditionally lean left   Democrats know they would probably lose seats at every level   Kauffman said SUPREME CHALLENGEImmigrant rights activists and Democratic led cities and states have sued the Trump administration to prevent it from asking census respondents about their citizenship  and the Supreme Court will decide by June if the question can remain Opponents argue the administration aims to use the question to intimidate immigrants out of responding to the census  which would cost their communities political representation and a share of about  800 billion in annual federal aid allocated based on population The administration disputes that  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his decision to add the question was aimed at getting the Justice Department the comprehensive citizenship data it needs to better enforce Voting Rights Act provisions that protect minorities from discrimination  Ross has not publicly commented on how citizenship data might be used in redistricting  But Census records  as well as emails released during the litigation over the citizenship question  showed he was thinking about citizens only redistricting well before he announced plans to add the question In April of 2017  at the behest of former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon  Ross spoke with former Kansas Secretary of State and noted immigration hawk Kris Kobach  according to the emails  One topic of discussion was  the problem that aliens     are still counted for congressional apportionment   according to a subsequent email from Kobach to Ross describing their conversation  The following month  Ross asked Commerce Senior Policy Advisor David Langdon to look into whether non citizens  including illegal immigrants  are included in voting maps  according to Langdon s deposition in the litigation over the citizenship question  Kobach and Langdon did not respond to requests for comment  ATTRACTING INTERESTA handful of states will likely request the census data on citizenship if the question survives its legal challenges  state lawmakers and a Republican strategist told Reuters  Lawmakers and state officials from Arizona  Missouri  Nebraska and Texas said in interviews they are considering citizen only districts  Republicans in Tennessee also voiced support for citizens only redistricting in court papers filed in the Evenwel Supreme Court case  Reuters reached out to several of the Tennessee lawmakers who signed the court brief  but all declined to comment Missouri Representative Dean Plocher  a Republican who sponsored unsuccessful legislation last year to base Missouri s voting districts on citizen population  said the effort is aimed solely at equalizing the power of all votes in the state  He said he hadn t considered how such changes might affect his party s chances in elections Nebraska s Murante   the former senator behind his state s failed citizens only redistricting bill and now the state s treasurer   said he supports citizens only maps because the state s constitution requires that  aliens  be excluded from voting districts Immigrant rights activists counter that citizens only districts could be forced to expand in ways that weaken the political influence of immigrant communities The effect could be particularly pronounced in places such as south Texas  where immigrants make up more than a quarter of the population  said Juan Hinojosa  a Democratic state senator  Hinojosa s district includes areas known as colonias   informal communities of poor  largely Hispanic families  Citizen only redistricting would make it more likely that anti immigration Republicans would win elections in the border region  Hinojosa said The question of how to count non citizens in voting districts may end up at the Supreme Court  said Kel Seliger  a Republican Texas state senator  who told Reuters that lawmakers there would explore citizen only maps  You ve got be careful   he

BANGKOK   Thailand s first general election since a 2014 army coup has been touted by the ruling military junta as a return to democratic rule  but two weeks after the vote  results are still unclear and allegations of manipulation are mounting Since the March 24 vote  figures linked to a  democratic front  of opposition parties say they have come under increasing pressure from police and the military The Election Commission has also indicated it would use a complex allocation formula for 150  party seats  in the House of Representatives in a way that would likely dilute the opposition alliance s seats in the 500 seat lower house The Election Commission has said it won t announce even provisional winners of the 150 party seats until May 9  saying it needs time to order by elections and vote recounts as well as to disqualify candidates who broke election laws But critics say the time gap allows the military royalist establishment to manipulate results and disqualify opponents of the pro army Palang Pracharat party that seeks to keep junta leader Prayuth Chan ocha in power as an elected prime minister  The leading opposition Pheu Thai party  made up of loyalists to army ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  sees the delays and legal actions as an attempt to deny the  democratic front  enough seats in the House needed to block the main junta linked party from unrestrained lawmaking power  After the election     the majority of the people feels a sense of hopelessness and distrust for the election process   said Pheu Thai s secretary general  Phumtham Wechayachai  People are talking about the Election Commission s part in supporting the extension of power by the National Council for Peace and Order   he said  using the junta s formal name The Election Commission s secretary general  Jaroongwit Phumma  told Reuters the body is not helping the pro military party  The election commission is neutral and adheres to the law  We don t take sides or help one particular party   Jaroongwit said Palang Pracharat said it does not gain any advantages over opposition parties   It s completely false to say that the election commission is helping Palang Pracharat  This is an attempt to discredit us   the party s deputy spokesman Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana told Reuters  SEDITION CHARGEHowever  opposition figures say they are being targeted Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  the leader of the youth oriented Future Forward Party which did surprisingly well in the vote  was charged on Saturday with sedition on a junta complaint dating back to 2015   a case that could see his party disbanded  Online campaigns have also cast Thanathorn as anti monarchy  a serious crime in Thailand  where the monarchy is revered without question  Thanathorn denies being against the monarchy and all charges against him  It s the establishment s desire to stir hatred  fear  and mistrust among the people  creating legitimacy for the military to take over and stay on   Thanathorn said last week Winthai Suvaree  a spokesman for the junta  said the charges against Thanathorn were not aimed at weakening the opposition and were  entirely unrelated to current political events   ABNORMAL ELECTION  The rules of the election were written in the 2017 junta backed constitution  which critics said were aimed at ensuring military influence in Thai politics Among the new provisions is that the Senate  the 250 seat upper house of parliament appointed by the junta  must approve the prime minister in a combined vote with the House  which previously solely voted on the premier That means the junta backed party and its allies have to gain only 126 seats in the House to install Prayuth as prime minister  while the opposition would need 376 votes for their potential candidate Still  days after the March 24 vote  the  democratic front  claimed through its own calculations that it would gain at least 255 House seats   not be enough to form a government but potentially allowing it to block the military backed party from having free rein Last week  however  the election commission indicated the complex formula to calculate allocation of the 150  party list  seats will round up decimals to give seats to 11 small parties although their popular votes did not meet a previously described threshhold required to earn even one seat  This is an irregularity that reflects an effort to block the democratic front from forming the next government   said Pheu Thai s spokeswoman Ladawan Wongsriwong  Widening the list would cut seats from top popular vote getters and could reduce seats for Future Forward from around 87 to 80  potentially hurting the democratic front s claim of House majority   It s an abnormal election from the outset  It s a game where the junta wrote the rules and appointed the referee  who is also acting abnormally   said Yingcheep Atchanont  project manager at legal monitoring group iLaw  Palang Pracharat has

by his late father on the need to put  good people  in power and to prevent  bad people from     creating chaos   Six days later  the king revoked royal decorations that had been awarded to Thaksin  citing his 2008 corruption conviction and for fleeing the country to escape prison  The military also stripped Thaksin of a pre cadet school s achievement award as well as deleting his name from the

LONDON   Twenty five lawmakers in Britain s opposition Labour Party have urged their leader  Jeremy Corbyn  to go the  extra step  if there is a chance of agreeing a Brexit deal in talks with Prime Minister Theresa May May  whose deal to leave the European Union has been rejected in parliament three times  has turned to Corbyn in a last ditch bid to get the support of his Labour Party for an agreement she signed with the bloc s leaders in November Corbyn has welcomed the talks  but the invitation poses a threat for his divided Labour Party   some members and lawmakers are demanding a second referendum on any deal while others fear being blamed for helping pass May s much criticized agreement  The 25 lawmakers  almost all from areas which voted to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum  said the talks  represent a real opportunity  for Corbyn  a way to get a deal which would meet Labour s demands for a Brexit that protected workers  rights They reminded him in the letter that he had told May Labour would support a  sensible deal  that included  a customs union and no hard border in Ireland   protected jobs and workers  environmental and consumer standards   We believe you are close to achieving that in the coming days   said the letter whose signatories include Labour s schools spokesman Mike Kane and three lawmakers who last week voted in favor of May s deal  Rosie Cooper  Caroline Flint and Kevin Barron  At the general election  we were clear about respecting the 2016 vote  and about securing those Labour goals  Therefore  we feel if compromise is necessary to achieve this deal and avoid fighting the European elections  we should go the extra step to secure this   Corbyn  a long standing critic of the EU  has long said he wants Britain to leave the bloc with a deal  respecting the 2016 referendum when 52 percent of voters backed leaving the bloc in Britain s biggest shift in policy since World War Two But the opposition leader has been content to watch the governing Conservative Party take on Brexit  a move that has not only divided the country  but has all but redrawn the political landscape by widening rifts in the main parties In a last gamble  May announced she would bring Corbyn into talks to try to find a way to break the deadlock in parliament  which has voted against leaving the bloc without an agreement  Corbyn is pressing his desire for a  permanent customs union  and alignment with the EU s single market in the talks   red lines for a prime minister who had made controlling immigration one of the key stones of her Brexit policy But the Labour leader is under growing pressure to make any agreement with May conditional on holding a confirmatory referendum on the deal  or asking the public to back it in another vote The 25 lawmakers said such a vote was not part of Labour policy  Our policy  agreed by members  accepts that the public voted to leave the EU and seeks a deal that secure jobs and rights at work  It does not require a confirmatory ballot on any deal that meets those conditions   the letter said  Delaying for many months in the hope of a second referendum will simply divide the country further and add uncertainty for business  A second referendum would be exploited by the far right  damage the trust of many core Labour voters and reduce our chances of winning a general election    Reporting by Elizabeth Piper  editing by Guy Faulconbridge  

HAIFA  Israel   Some of Israel s young Arab citizens are calling for a boycott of Tuesday s parliamentary election  dismayed by a recent law which they say reduces them to second class citizens The pro boycott activists  many of whom identify as Palestinian  have tried in the past to persuade others among Israel s Arab minority not to vote But this time  they say  they are tapping into anger over the 2018 law that declares only Jews have a right to self determination in the  nation state  of the Jewish people Leaders of Israel s main Arab parties are pushing for their voters to turn out  fearing a boycott would weaken the 21 percent Arab minority s representation in parliament  and boost Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s election chances Ignoring the party leaders  dozens of activists from the  Popular Campaign to Boycott the Zionist Knesset Elections  have been handing out leaflets in the northern Israeli port city of Haifa  which has a mixed Jewish and Arab population  and in smaller Arab towns and villages  This is an attempt to boycott the body that actively tries to erase our Palestinian identity   said Joul Elias  a student from Haifa who turned up to distribute flyers in Wadi Nisnas  a majority Arab neighbourhood in the city Israel s Arab minority comprises mainly descendants of the Palestinians who remained in their communities or were internally displaced after the 1948 war that surrounded Israel s creation According to figures released by Israel s Central Bureau of Statistics  there were 1 9 million Arabs in Israel s roughly 9 million population at the start of 2019  Most were Muslims  Christians or Druze  Jews made up 74 3 percent of the population WAKE UP CALLDespite holding Israeli citizenship  many Arabs say their communities  from the fertile Galilee in the north to the Negev desert in the south  face discrimination in areas such as health  education and housing Netanyahu s ruling Likud party counters that its 15 billion shekel  3 billion pounds  investment plan for the Arab sector  is the largest such commitment in Israel s history   according to Eli Hazan  Likud s foreign affairs director But Netanyahu rekindled Arab resentment in March when he wrote on Instagram that  Israel is not a state of all its citizens   It was a reference  he said  to the new law  and the country being the homeland of the Jewish people Many in the Arab community saw the Instagram post as an echo of divisive comments he made in the 2015 election  Hours before the polls closed on election day that year  Netanyahu said that Arabs were flocking  in droves  to cast ballots  This was an attempt to prod any complacent right wing supporters to get out and vote for him  The nation state law was like a wake up call for many people  making them realise this country will never be a country for all its citizens   said Muhannad Abu Ghosh  42  a pro boycott activist from Haifa But Ayman Odeh  an Arab legislator who heads the Hadash party  says that engagement is key to bringing about political changes that will benefit the Arab minority  Our challenge  number one through five  is to increase the number of people who vote   he said He said some Arabs would  as they have in the past  vote for non Arab centr e   or left wing parties  but that even those votes  play a significant role in fighting right wing extremism in Israel  ARAB LEGISLATORSArabs have served in Israel s parliament since the country s founding  but low turnout and other factors have typically left them under represented in the 120 seat body No Arab party has served in a governing coalition  meaning they have little say in shaping Israeli policies In the 2015 election  Israel s four Arab dominated political parties united to form a  Joint List  that won 13 seats   their biggest representation yet  But this time around they are divided  which is likely to further deter an already dismayed electorate from voting  say political analysts Arab voter turnout is expected to be just 51 percent  down from 64 percent in 2015  according to a recent poll from the Konrad Adenauer Programme for Jewish Arab Cooperation at Tel Aviv University  The poll projects nationwide turnout of 70 percent  The majority of Palestinians in Israel consider the Knesset election as a practical tool  If it helps them  they will go and vote   said As ad Ghanem  a professor of political science at the University of Haifa  This time  with the collapse of the Joint List and frustration with discriminatory practices  voter turnout will be low   Ahmad Tibi  a veteran Arab legislator whose Ta al party has forged an alliance with Odeh  says Arab parties are likely to lose two Knesset seats in this election  But he doesn t see the nation state law or political division as a reason to boycott the vote   You can be a critic  you can have reservations  you can be angry at Arab parties or Arab  ministers    Tibi said   But to be nonchalant and to sit aside is not the solution  Still  the boycott movement s members  many of whom voted in previous elections  believe that grassroots activism is a more effective agent of change than voting Rula Nasr Mazzawi  43  a former activist with the Arab party Balad  says she left the faction and joined the boycott out of frustration with Arab parties  divisions in the face of what she described as Israel s  racist policies   The parties stopped working for the people  They are just clinging onto their own seats and their own power   she said   Additional reporting by Rawan Sheikh Ahmad  Editing by Timothy

WASHINGTON   The House on Thursday rebuffed a furious lobbying campaign by the National Rifle Association and approved a revamped Violence Against Women Act that would expand law enforcement s ability to restrict gun purchases by convicted domestic abusers The legislation passed easily  263 to 158  but the divided vote came on what was once a broadly bipartisan measure first passed in 1994  In recent years  partisan rancor over efforts to expand the protections of the legislation have clouded efforts to renew it  and this year  the divide was over gun control The provisions would close the so called boyfriend loophole and bar those under a restraining order or who were convicted of abusing  assaulting or stalking a domestic partner from buying guns  The N R A  seized on the new measures and warned Congress that it would track and publish how lawmakers voted  hoping to intimidate Republicans and Democrats in Republican leaning districts  Do not let the N R A  bully you   Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  urged her colleagues before the vote  noting that her recently deceased husband  former Representative John Dingell Jr   also a Democrat  was a member of the organization Thirty three Republicans bucked the threat and voted with the Democratic majority in favor of the legislation   among them  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania  the sole Republican sponsor of the reauthorization  Representative Jeff Fortenberry  Republican of Nebraska  voted present Democrats  including all of the freshman members who won in districts swept by Donald J  Trump in 2016  stood up to the gun lobby  with only one   Representative Collin C  Peterson of Minnesota   voting no Many in the new majority campaigned on tightening access to guns  and they appeared to embrace condemnation from the gun lobby as a badge of honor  Lawmakers should be reading the tea leaves   said Shannon Watts  the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  a group that supports restricting gun laws   In the midterm elections  it was gun safety that got people to the polls  Other supporters of the legislation argued that the gun provisions made up only a fraction of the protections offered by the bill  and included invaluable resources for survivors  This wasn t a gun bill   this is a bill to protect women   said Lisette Johnson  a member of the Everytown Survivor Network and a survivor of domestic abuse   This passing today is really a huge support for women and keeping them safer  Republicans had advocated a clean one year extension of the current law  which expired in February  arguing that new elements of the legislation were controversial and overreached   in particular  the gun restrictions and language offering additional protections to transgender people  Can we stop playing political games at the expense of vulnerable women   asked Representative Elise Stefanik  Republican of New York  before the vote  arguing that the bill put forward by Democrats would  collect dust in the Senate    Democrats  who booed vigorously during her speech  rejected her motion  The vote highlighted the stark contrasts between the new Democratic majority  with its historic number of women  and the Republican minority  which has struggled to attract female voters and to increase the number of conservative women holding office on Capitol Hill  Democrats framed opposition to the legislation s renewal as a denial of protections for survivors of abuse  efforts to prevent domestic violence and support for law enforcement Representative Sharice Davids  Democrat of Kansas and one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress in November  presided over the final vote on the measure  which contains a number of protections for women on tribal lands   including a new provision that would allow tribal courts to prosecute nonnative people accused of domestic crimes or dating violence on tribal lands A number of Democrats  including Ms  Dingell and Representative Katie Porter of California  offered passionate defenses of the legislation  repeatedly drawing on their own experiences as survivors of domestic abuse  I know that fear  I know that terror and I just want to try to save another family from going through that terror   Ms  Dingell said at a news conference on Wednesday  recalling being afraid as a child that her father  who had mental illness and owned a gun  would harm her mother or her siblings   Why would you not close that loophole  Republicans  beyond objecting to what they said was an infringement on gun ownership  argued that the measure contained other proposals that were too broad for a law intended to protect survivors of assault  In previous hearings and speeches  they had singled out provisions that would expand protections for transgender people and require the Bureau of Prisons to consider the safety and protection of transgender prisoners when giving housing assignments  We find ourselves debating a VAWA reauthorization act that is literally a Christmas tree of progressive liberal policy objectives  rather than an honest approach to reforming and updating such an important law   said Representative Debbie Lesko  Republican of Arizona  who is a survivor of domestic abuse The legislation heads to the Senate  where Senators Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  and Joni Ernst  Republican of Iowa  have said they will lead efforts to pass a version  It is unclear how many of the new gun provisions in the House legislation will prevail in the Republican controlled Senate  There are a number of improvements in the House bill that I think should be in our version  including preserving improvements already made in the 2013 reauthorization   Ms  Feinstein said in a statement after the vote   I hope the Senate will move quickly  This is an important law and one the Senate should take very seriously and act upon expeditiously   

LITTLE ROCK  Ark    A proposal to prohibit Arkansas cities from refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities failed before a House committee on Monday after the state s Republican governor said he wanted the legislation changed to ensure it wouldn t open the door to racial profiling The Senate backed bill to prohibit  sanctuary  cities and cut off their funding failed before the House City  County and Local Affairs Committee on a 9 4 vote  two votes shy of the 11 needed to advance to the full House for a vote  With lawmakers hoping to wrap up this year s session by Wednesday  the sponsor of the measure said it s dead The Arkansas Municipal League  which opposed the measure  has said it doesn t know of any sanctuary cities in the state or any cities moving toward adopting such policies  The Republican proponents of the bill said the measure was needed to ensure cities comply with federal law  This is not a solution looking for a problem   Republican Sen  Gary Stubblefield  the bill s sponsor  told the panel before the vote   This is to ward off what is happening all over our country  Republicans in several states have enacted bans on sanctuary cities  which have been targeted by President Donald Trump  Virginia s Democratic governor last month vetoed a similar bill  and another bill is pending before Florida lawmakers Under Arkansas  bill  a city would have been ineligible for discretionary funds administered by the state if the attorney general found it was a sanctuary city  The bill also would have prohibited cities from preventing local law enforcement from asking people about their citizenship or immigration status Gov  Asa Hutchinson said earlier Monday he was generally supportive of the measure and opposed sanctuary cities  But Hutchinson said he d asked the bill s sponsor to amend the measure to require probable cause before law enforcement asked about citizenship or immigration status  Without this amendment  there is too much opportunity for racial profiling   Hutchinson said in a statement released by his office Advocates in Arkansas said the defeated bill would have created mistrust between the immigrant community and law enforcement  Laws like this  because they are broad  they are vague and they are not clear  only exposes us to lawsuits  only exposes us to continued stereotypes of Arkansas being racist and only is going to hurt what really could be an opportunity for Arkansas to achieve a greater potential   Mireya Reith  founding executive director of Arkansas United  an immigrant advocacy group  told the panel before the vote     

Many Americans are critical of the Electoral College  an attitude that seems to have intensified since Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election despite losing the popular vote  These critics often make two arguments  first  that electing the president by direct popular vote would be preferable in a democracy  and second  that the Electoral College has disreputable origins  having been put into the Constitution to protect the institution of slavery Defenders of the Electoral College often counter that it was designed not to help maintain slavery but for other reasons  many of them still relevant  such as to balance the power of big states against that of small states   Even some critics of the Electoral College have made this argument  Both sides are misguided  There are legitimate reasons to keep the Electoral College system  odd and creaky though it may be  but we must accept the fact that it does have deep roots in efforts by the founders to accommodate slavery The Electoral College was not mainly designed to balance big states against small states  It certainly did not have that effect  Eight of the first nine presidential elections were won by candidates who were plantation owners from Virginia  then America s biggest state  Only three candidates from small states have ever been elected president  Zachary Taylor  Franklin Pierce and Bill Clinton As James Madison made clear at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 in Philadelphia  the big political divide in America was not between big and small states  it was between North and South and was all about slavery  So  too  was the Electoral College at the founding  both in its original incarnation in 1787 and in the version later created by the 12th Amendment  which was adopted in 1804 Behind closed doors at the Constitutional Convention  when the idea of direct presidential election was proposed by the Northerner James Wilson  the Southerner James Madison explained why this was a political nonstarter  Slaves couldn t vote  so the slaveholding South would basically lose every time in a national direct vote  But if slaves could somehow be counted in an indirect system  maybe at a discount  say  three fifths   well  that might sell in the South  Thus were planted the early seeds of an Electoral College system Some have argued that direct election was doomed because the Philadelphia delegates disdained democracy  Behind closed doors these elites did indeed bad mouth the masses  as do elites today   But look at what the framers of the Constitution did  rather than what they said  They put the Constitution itself to a far more democratic vote than had been seen before  They provided for a directly elected House of Representatives  which the earlier Articles of Confederation did not do   They omitted all property qualifications for leading federal positions  unlike almost every state constitution then on the books So why didn t they go even further  providing direct presidential election  Because of Madison s political calculation  Direct election would have been a dealbreaker for the South  For a while  having members of Congress elect the president emerged as a possible alternative  but this idea  too  would have been pro slavery for the same reason  Thanks to the three fifths clause  slave states got extra votes in the House  just as in the Electoral College system that was finally adopted When George Washington left the political stage in the mid 1790s  America witnessed its first two contested presidential elections  Twice  most Southerners backed a Southerner  Thomas Jefferson  and most Northerners backed a Northerner  John Adams   Without the extra electoral votes generated by its enormous slave population  the South would have lost the election of 1800  which Jefferson won It is true  as some have noted  that some Northerners manipulated the vote in that election to their advantage  but that does not erase the ugly fact that the South had extra seats in the Electoral College because of its slaves  When the Constitution was amended to modify the Electoral College after 1800  all America had seen the pro slavery tilt of the system  but Jefferson s Southern allies steamrollered over Northern congressmen who explicitly proposed eliminating the system s pro slavery bias As a result  every president until Abraham Lincoln was either a Southerner or a Northerner who was willing  while president  to accommodate the slaveholding South  The dominant political figure in antebellum America was the pro slavery Andrew Jackson  who in 1829 proposed eliminating electors while retaining pro slavery apportionment rules rooted in the three fifths clause   in effect creating a system of pro slavery electoral vote counts without the need for electors themselves Today  of course  slavery no longer skews and stains our system   and maybe the Electoral College system should remain intact  The best argument in its favor is simply inertia  Any reforms might backfire  with unforeseen and adverse consequences  The Electoral College is the devil we know But we should not kid ourselves  This devil does indeed have devilish origins RelatedOpinion   Sean WilentzThe Electoral College Was Not a Pro Slavery PloyThere is a lot wrong with how we choose the president  But the framers did not put it into the

ANKARA   Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul s municipal election said on Friday he remained ahead of his rival after a recount of invalid votes in nearly half of the city s districts demanded by President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party The AKP  hurt by a slowing economy  is reeling from its apparent loss of Istanbul  Turkey s commercial hub  and the capital Ankara  in Sunday s local elections  In power nationally since 2002  the AKP and its Islamist predecessors have dominated Turkey s two biggest cities for a quarter of a century The mayoral candidate of the opposition Republican People s Party  CHP   Ekrem Imamoglu  said he was 18 742 votes ahead of his AKP rival  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  after a recount of invalid votes in 17 of Istanbul s 39 districts and said that gap would not change much after the recount had ended  From what I see  it should end this weekend  It will fall into a 18 000 20 000 range  that s what all the simulations show  These are very tight numbers   Imamoglu told Turkey s Fox TV  adding both parties had been awarded votes in the recount The AKP s Yildirim told reporters on Friday that the margin between him and Imamoglu was falling  adding that the outcome of the recount by the High Election Board  YSK  would be different once all recounts were completed The AKP has said there are more than 300 000 invalid votes in Istanbul and just under 110 000 in Ankara It was unclear how many districts of Istanbul   a city of 15 million people   would ultimately see recounts  The AKP has requested them in all 39 Istanbul districts and all 25 districts in Ankara  where the secularist CHP has secured an apparently insurmountable lead of nearly 4 percentage points Both the AKP and CHP had claimed victory in Istanbul on Sunday night  but the next day they said that Imamoglu held a 25 000 vote lead over Yildirim In Ankara  the AKP ruling party said on Friday it had submitted an appeal to recount all votes in the capital after an initial partial recount was  far from meeting our expectations  PAINFUL FOR ERDOGANAhead of the elections  the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival the alliance between the AKP and their nationalist MHP allies  The two alliances nominated joint candidates in some cities  including Ankara and Istanbul The losses in Ankara and Istanbul  if confirmed  would be especially painful for Erdogan  who campaigned relentlessly for the local elections  He launched his political career in Istanbul and served as the city s mayor in the 1990s Speaking for the first time since Sunday  Erdogan said his alliance had won the majority of seats in Ankara and Istanbul and warned the opposition that  if they won  they would be unable to run the municipalities as they pleased  Where will the decisions on local matters  real estate and budgets go through  Through the council  You can t go and say  I m the mayor  I ll form the council as I wish    Erdogan told reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul  If a mayor doesn t have a majority  they can t form the  municipal  commissions and budgets as they please   he said  adding that the YSK s decision on the elections would be final The AKP presided over more than a decade of strong economic growth in Turkey but a currency crisis last year saw the lira lose 30 percent of its value  and inflation and unemployment have risen sharply  Critics also accuse Erdogan of becoming more authoritarian  especially after a failed 2016 military coup  In the Aegean coastal province of Izmir  a CHP stronghold  authorities launched an investigation into the new mayor of the Torbali district  Ismail Uygur  for allegedly insulting Erdogan during a speech  Uygur has denied the accusation  The AKP doesn t know how to lose  Democracy means knowing how to lose   CHP Deputy Chairman Ozgur Ozel said on Twitter Imamoglu criticized the AKP s repeated appeals for recounts  How much longer can we recount  There are recounts in some places now  but is the logic to recount until I lose    Writing by Daren Butler and Tuvan Gumrukcu  Editing by Gareth Jones and Jon Boyle  

I used to favor amending the Electoral College  in part because I believed the framers put it into the Constitution to protect slavery  I said as much in a book I published in September  But I ve decided I was wrong  That s why a merciful God invented second editions Like many historians  I thought the evidence clearly showed the Electoral College arose from a calculated power play by the slaveholders  By the time the delegates at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 debated how the president ought to be chosen  they had already approved the three fifths clause   the notorious provision that counted slaves as three fifths of a person to inflate the slave states  apportionment in the new House of Representatives The Electoral College  as approved by the convention in its final form  in effect enshrined the three fifths clause in the selection of the president  Instead of election by direct popular vote  each state would name electors  chosen however each state legislature approved   who would actually do the electing  The number of each state s electoral votes would be the same as its combined representation in the House and the Senate By including the number of senators  two from each state  the formula leaned to making the apportionment fairer to the smaller states  Including the number of House members leaned in favor of the larger states  But the framers gave the slaveholding states the greatest reward  The more slaves they owned  the more representatives they got  and the more votes each would enjoy in choosing the president The framers  own damning words seem to cinch the case that the Electoral College was a pro slavery ploy  Above all  the Virginia slaveholder James Madison   the most influential delegate at the convention   insisted that while direct popular election of the president was the  fittest  system  it would hurt the South  whose population included nonvoting slaves  The slaveholding states  he said   could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes   Instead  the framers  led by Madison  concocted the Electoral College to give extra power to the slaveholders If you stop at this point in the record  as I once did  there would be no two ways about it  On further and closer inspection  however  the case against the framers begins to unravel  First  the slaveholders did not need to invent the Electoral College to fend off direct popular election of the president  Direct election did have some influential supporters  including Gouverneur Morris of New York  author of the Constitution s preamble  But the convention  deeply suspicious of what one Virginian in another context called  the fury of democracy   crushed the proposal on two separate occasions How  then  would the president be elected  if not directly by the people at large  Some delegates had proposed that Congress have the privilege  a serious proposal that died out of concern the executive branch would be too subservient to the legislative  Other delegates floated making the state governors the electors  Still others favored the state legislatures The alternative  and winning  plan  which became known as the Electoral College only some years later  certainly gave the slaveholding states the advantage of the three fifths clause  But the connection was incidental  and no more of an advantage than if Congress had been named the electors Most important  once the possibility of direct popular election of the president was defeated  how much did the slaveholding states rush to support the concept of presidential electors  Not at all  In the initial vote over having electors select the president  the only states voting  nay  were North Carolina  South Carolina and Georgia   the three most ardently proslavery states in the convention Southerners didn t embrace the idea of electors because it might enlarge slavery s power  they feared  as the North Carolinian Hugh Williamson  who was not a slaveholder  remarked  that the men chosen as electors would be corruptible  persons not occupied in the high offices of government   Pro elite concerns were on their minds   just as  ironically  elite supporters of the Electoral College hoped the body would insulate presidential politics from popular passions When it first took shape at the convention  the Electoral College would not have significantly helped the slaveowning states  Under the initial apportionment of the House approved by the framers  the slaveholding states would have held 39 out of 92 electoral votes  or about 42 percent  Based on the 1790 census  about 41 percent of the nation s total white population lived in those same states  a minuscule difference  Moreover  the convention did not arrive at the formula of combining each state s House and Senate numbers until very late in its proceedings  and there is no evidence to suggest that slavery had anything to do with it But didn t the college  whatever the framers  intentions  eventually become a bulwark for what Northerners would later call the illegitimate slave power  Not really  Some historians have revived an old partisan canard that the slaveholding states  extra electoral votes unfairly handed Thomas Jefferson the presidency in 1800 01  They ignore anti Jefferson manipulation of the electoral vote in heavily pro Jefferson Pennsylvania that offset the Southerners  electoral advantage  Take away that manipulation  and Jefferson would have won with or without the extra Southern votes The early president most helped by the Constitution s rejection of direct popular election was John Quincy Adams  later an antislavery hero  who won the White House in 1824 25 despite losing both the popular and electoral votes to Andrew Jackson   The House decided that election   As president  the slaveholder Jackson became one of American history s most prominent critics of the Electoral College  which he blasted for disallowing the people  to express their own will   The Electoral College system made no difference in deciding the presidency during the 36 years before the Civil War There are ample grounds for criticizing the Constitution s provisions for electing the president  That the system enabled the election in 2016 of precisely the kind of demagogic figure the framers designed the system to block suggests the framework may need serious repair  But the myth that the Electoral College began as a slaveholders  instrument needs debunking   which I hope to help with in my book s revised paperback Read

Is Israel ready for a changing of the guard The outcome of Tuesday s parliamentary election will determine whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party will continue to lead the country  Mr  Netanyahu  who has been embroiled by corruption allegations  continues to be seen by many Israeli Jews as critical to their country s future security  But he s facing a strong challenge from the newly formed Blue and White party  led by the former military chief Benny Gantz  Israel uses a parliamentary system in which many parties jockey for votes  Even if Mr  Netanyahu s Likud wins fewer seats than Mr  Gantz s party  he may be better positioned to form a governing coalition by working with conservative parties  Read more about Israel s political parties and the election process here  We asked Israeli citizens how they plan to vote and which issues matter most to them  Though we sought feedback from citizens of all backgrounds  and reached out in English and Arabic  our 200 responses were overwhelmingly from Jews  perhaps because many of Israel s nearly two million Arab citizens plan to boycott the election  Many said they had chosen Likud or Blue and White  and listed the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians among their chief concerns  Others said they were more focused on the economy and social issues such as L G B T  rights  saying they would vote for parties like the New Right  the center right party Kulanu or the left wing secular party Meretz  Below are some of their responses  which have been condensed and edited If you re an Israeli citizen

Palestinians has remained elusive during Mr  Netanyahu s time as prime minister  Violence has surged in the West Bank at times  there were wars with Islamic militants in Gaza in 2012 and 2014  and recent clashes between Israel and Hamas along the Gaza border have been deadly  Palestinians in the West Bank  Gaza and East Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote on Tuesday  Chana Selmon  JerusalemI am voting for the New Right  Naftali Bennett s party  because I am in favor of the annexation of the territories Judea and Samaria and the West Bank so as to apply Israeli law to all who live there  I am a Jew of Arab and European descent who moved to Israel almost seven years ago  Although I do not live in the territories  I work there  I m looking forward to fewer checkpoints  the application of environmental regulations  the burning garbage  pollution and contamination there are horrific  and better relations among different demographic populations  Alec Siegel  Tel AvivGantz takes a more sober  realistic approach to the conflict with the Palestinians  His background as the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff certainly helps  but he seems to grasp the more diplomatic aspects of being a head of state as well He advocates smaller steps that could improve lives on all sides while keeping in mind the ultimate goal of two states  without simply paying lip service to a lofty ideal Seraj Assi  WashingtonI m boycotting the election  As a Palestinian citizen of Israel  I have no reason to be optimistic about my future in the country  If by simply exercising my basic democratic right to vote  I am posing a threat to Israel s political order  as Netanyahu has constantly hinted  then I can only imagine where my struggle for equal rights stands right now  What s more  Arabs will have no say in the new government  regardless of who wins  All major party  Jewish  leaders said they will not invite Arab parties to join a government coalition  That explains why many Arabs are boycotting  with reasons ranging from racism and discrimination to lack of faith in both Arab parties and Israel s democracy  Hanan Cohen  Beit ShemeshI am Jewish  The Arab citizens in

and support Likud  Besides their foreign relations successes  Likud and Netanyahu have led impressive growth in the economy that has benefited my family  along with most families in Israel The allegations against Netanyahu are serious but have been way overblown by the media  Likud has a deep bench of experienced leaders who can certainly hold the reins if Netanyahu is sidelined Jonathan Mosery  ModiinI plan on voting for Benny Gantz Netanyahu has been in power too long  He has done great work and will undoubtedly be remembered as one of Israel s top prime ministers and central to Israel s emergence as an economic powerhouse and regional power  but power corrupts  Whether or not the allegations about Netanyahu are true  he has held the reins too long and become obsessed with holding on as long as possible  rather than putting the country s needs first Stav Cohen  RehovotNetanyahu cares so deeply about Israel  In a time where we feel like the world despises our every move  we need him to remain in office I obviously don t approve of his scandals  but I love him as our prime minister The EconomyIsrael s economy and tech sector have grown steadily under Mr  Netanyahu  and in a poll of likely voters taken a month before the election  almost half said economic issues were most important to them Leora Danzig Leeder  JerusalemI plan on voting  Not Netanyahu   He has had four rounds  and with each passing year it becomes clear that his main interest is lining his pockets I am primarily concerned about the financial and social issues that affect my family  The cost of living is too high  especially in Jerusalem  and one day I would like to be able to afford to buy rather than rent  As a single mother  it is sometimes difficult to imagine thriving financially  rather than just surviving Shimon Zlotnick  ModiinI will be voting for Kulanu because its focus is not only on security  but more important on issues that face Israel every day  such as rising costs and breaking monopolies L G B T  RightsWhile gay rights have garnered wide support in Israel  the ultra Orthodox  who are part of Mr  Netanyahu s governing coalition  have resisted laws protecting

wholeheartedly against the continued occupation and fights for human rights and the L G B T  cause  Out of three siblings  two of us are L G B T  and we fear the ultra right wing party s rise to power

perhaps Kulanu or even Meretz  and no religious parties If Netanyahu becomes the prime minister and forms a coalition with the secular parties  then this is the best scenario  We can expect some

JERUSALEM   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re election on Wednesday  with religious rightist parties set to hand him a parliamentary majority and his main challenger conceding defeat With more than 99 percent of votes counted   ballots cast by soldiers at military bases will be tallied over the next two days   Netanyahu s conservative Likud party looked likely to muster enough support to control 65 of the Knesset s 120 seats and be named to head the next coalition government It would be Netanyahu s record fifth term as premier In a televised statement  Yair Lapid  number two in the centrist Blue and White party led by former general Benny Gantz  said   We didn t win in this round  We will make Likud s life hell in the opposition  U S  President Donald Trump  who Netanyahu featured on campaign billboards to highlight their close relationship  phoned to congratulate him on his re election  the Israeli leader said  adding that he thanked his American ally for  tremendous support for Israel  Netanyahu tweeted that Trump had called him from Air Force One  The president was on a flight to Texas Trump told reporters at the White House that Netanyahu s re election improved the chances of peace between Israel and the Palestinians   He s been a great ally and he s a friend  I d like to congratulate him on a well thought out race  A team led by Trump s adviser and son in law Jared Kushner has been working on an Israeli Palestinian peace plan  but it has not disclosed details  Palestinians  angered by what they see as Trump s pro Israel bias  have called it a non starter Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said on Twitter he would begin meeting next week with political parties that won parliamentary seats to hear who they support for prime minister At the sessions  which Rivlin said would be broadcast live  to ensure transparency   he will then pick a party leader to try to form a coalition  giving the candidate 28 days to do so  with a two week extension if needed The close and often vitriolic contest was widely seen in Israel as a referendum on Netanyahu s character and record in the face of corruption allegations  He faces possible indictment in three graft cases  and has denied wrongdoing in all of them Despite that  Netanyahu gained four seats compared to his outgoing coalition government  according to a spreadsheet published by the Central Elections Committee of parties that garnered enough votes to enter the next parliament   It is a night of colossal victory   the 69 year old Netanyahu told cheering supporters in a late night speech at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv after Tuesday s vote   He s a magician   the crowd chanted as fireworks flared and Netanyahu kissed his wife Sara  Earlier that night  Gantz had claimed

Netanyahu can be expected to argue he should be spared in the national interest  Some analysts predict he may try to pass a law granting himself immunity  as a sitting leader  from trial During the campaign  the rival parties accused each other of corruption  fostering bigotry and being soft on security Israel s 21 percent Arab minority saw its parties lose seats  Voters blamed divisions between

their vote will have an impact   he said During the campaign  Netanyahu sought to tap into Trump s popularity among Israelis  who delighted in his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital in 2017 and transfer of the U S  Embassy to the holy city last May from Tel Aviv  Two weeks before the election  Trump signed a proclamation  with Netanyahu at his side at the White House  recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war In a rare turn during the race toward the Israeli Palestinian conflict  Netanyahu further alarmed Palestinians by pledging to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re elected  Palestinians seek a state there and in the Gaza Strip  with East Jerusalem as its capital This pre election promise from Netanyahu was widely seen as an attempt to draw right wing votes rather than a change of policy  But with Trump s moves on Jerusalem and the Golan  the prime minister may feel emboldened to advocate annexation  Commenting on the election  Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said   Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo  They have said no to peace and yes to the occupation  The last round of U S  brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014  Trump is expected to release his administration s Middle East peace plan after the election  If it includes Israeli concessions to the Palestinians  Netanyahu s probable far right coalition allies will probably object    Additional reporting by Dan Williams  Ron Bousso and Maayan

FLOOKBURGH SANDS  England   The thing about an old rusty tractor  said cockle picker Tony McClure  is that even in the sea air  it will start  His was parked out on the tidal flats of Flookburgh sands in Morecambe Bay in northwest England  braving the salty shallows of an unusually warm February dawn  He was comparing old mechanical tractors to the more modern electronic kind  and I was well aware of what he was talking about  The tide here comes in fast  If you re not careful  it can swamp a vehicle  So you want be certain to get off that seabed McClure 39  was one of the first people I met on a February March assignment around England s coastline  where I was photographing and talking to people who had voted to leave the European Union Like most of the 50 or so people I met and spoke to while traveling from Morecambe to St  Agnes in Cornwall  McClure wants Britain to get out of the EU  Most spoke as if they felt tricked by Brussels and trapped in a world that was turning against them

tight  51 89 percent voted Leave versus 48 11 percent Remain   but on the coast  the Leave vote had been particularly strong   Leave won a majority in more than 100 of about 120 parliamentary constituencies with a coastline  I wanted to know more about the people who delivered that result  The trip was a revelation  First  people were often surprised to be asked their views  saying they felt they weren t important enough for anyone in London to ask  People plied me with tea  biscuits and sandwiches  took me on tractor rides and to the bingo and made a few jokey marriage proposals  Most said they still wanted to get out of Europe Their reasons were more individual and varied than I expected  Some wanted to revive a nostalgic rosy past or keep immigrants out  Some thought they were taking back control  some wanted an end to the EU bureaucracy that they saw hurting their livelihoods and some   like a cockle picker in Flookburgh   thought it was time London paid attention to smaller voices But others had more concrete goals  A grandmother in Skegness hoped that the decline of her town   designated the  most deprived seaside area in Britain  in a study by the Office for National Statistics in 2013   might be slowed down if taxpayers  funds stopped heading to Europe  And people like fisherwoman Margaret Owen wanted better leaders  We need to stand on our own two feet  we re a capable country   she said   The people that we trusted in and that we voted for  and that we thought could carry our hopes and dreams through  have let the whole country down  Among the few

LONDON   The United Kingdom has lost  6 6 billion in economic activity every quarter since it voted to leave the European Union  according to S P Global Ratings  the latest company to estimate the damage from Brexit In a report published on Thursday  the ratings agency s senior economist  Boris Glass  said the world s fifth biggest economy would have been about 3 percent larger by the end of 2018 if the country had not voted in a June 2016 referendum to leave the EU Quarterly growth rates would have averaged about 0 7 percent  rather than 0 43 percent  he said  Immediately after the referendum  the pound fell by about 18 percent  This was the single most pertinent indicator of the impact of the vote and the drag it created  via inflation  has been spreading through the economy   he said As imports became more expensive  inflation started to rise  curbing household spending  S P estimated inflation was 1 8 percent higher than it would otherwise have been by the third quarter 2017 The estimate is slightly lower than an assessment by Goldman Sachs earlier this week  which pegged the cost to the economy at about 600 million pounds per week  That equates to 7 8 billion pounds a quarter  according to Reuters calculations  The S P report was based on the Doppelganger approach  an econometric technique that used a synthetic UK economy based on the performance of other economies to estimate how the UK would have performed had it not decided to leave the EU The other countries included the United States  Canada  Japan  Ireland  Denmark  Portugal and Hungary   Reporting by Josephine Mason  editing by Gareth Jones  Larry King  

IOWA CITY  Iowa   It was hard to miss Cheri Pichone s excitement about Bernie Sanders  second presidential run  She showed up to a recent Iowa rally decked out in Sanders gear  complete with a figurine of the Vermont senator and progressive icon But underneath her exuberance  the 36 year old was still mad about the last Democratic primary  when Sanders  bid for the presidency fell short to Hillary Clinton  They cheated   she said  directing much of her anger at the Democratic National Committee  The party establishment  she lamented  was  actively working against us  Pichone voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein in 2016 and said she may vote for a third party again if Sanders doesn t clinch the nomination She s emblematic of a persistent group of Sanders supporters who won t let go of the slights   real and perceived   from the last campaign  The frustration is notable now that Sanders is a 2020 front runner  raking in  18 2 million in the first quarter  downplaying concerns about DNC bias and highlighting his success in bringing the party around on liberal policies it once resisted Some establishment aligned Democrats worry the party could lose in 2020 if lingering concerns about the last primary aren t put to bed  It has the potential to escalate  and it has the potential to help re elect Donald Trump   said Mo Elleithee  a former spokesman for Clinton and the DNC The acrimony stems from a fiercely fought campaign and a sense among Sanders loyalists that party leaders privately favored Clinton  DNC leaders at the time scheduled fewer debates than Republicans and sometimes slated them for nights with low television viewership  Often opaque delegate allocation rules also contributed to a belief among some Sanders supporters that the primary was essentially rigged According to data from the Pew Research Center  the tension took a toll  About 81  of people who consistently supported Sanders during the primary season and were confirmed to have voted in the general election said they ultimately voted for Clinton  while 11  said they supported Stein or Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson  and 3  supported Trump In a closely contested election  those moves away from Clinton may have factored into the results Since the election  party leaders have sought to smooth things over with Sanders and his supporters  DNC Chairman Tom Perez is planning a robust debate schedule  The rules governing superdelegates   party insiders who overwhelmingly backed Clinton   have changed Sanders has publicly expressed confidence in the process this time around  but in terms that suggest he won t soon forget 2016  In 2016  I think I will not shock anybody to suggest that the DNC was not quite evenhanded   he said during a CNN town hall in February   I think we have come a long way since then  and I fully expect to be treated quite as well as anybody else  In an interview Friday  Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir echoed that optimism  If you re talking to anyone at the Democratic National Committee who s there now  I m sure they will tell you that their relationship with the Bernie Sanders campaign is great and that we are operating in good faith and we are talking to each other on an almost daily basis   he said   Anyone suggesting that there s any kind of friction there is living in the past  They are living with some grudges that they are holding onto from a bygone time  Still  the campaign has made some moves that raise questions about whether resentments from 2016 will linger  Briahna Joy Gray  formerly a liberal journalist who voted for Stein  is Sanders  national press secretary  Nina Turner  who called the DNC  dictatorial and pompous  in 2017  is one of his national campaign chairs And some of Sanders  most loyal supporters in the crucial early voting states say they re not ready to fully move on Nicholas Shaw  a 39 year old from Concord  New Hampshire  spent his recent birthday watching Sanders speak  Like Pichone  he said he wouldn t support the Democratic nominee if it s anyone other than Sanders  If they steal it from him again  I ll go independent or something other than that   he said   The Democratic Party s on their last edge of me if they kind of try to screw him again  Even in South Carolina  where Sanders lost momentum after a 47 point drubbing from Clinton  some supporters are still smarting over a process they believe was rigged  Lost might be a stretch   said Tom Amon  of Summerville  when asked how he felt about Sanders  ability to perform better in South Carolina than he did in the 2016 primary   It was stolen from him     Woodall reported from Manchester  New Hampshire  and Kinnard reported from North Charleston  South Carolina  Associated Press writer Juana Summers in Davenport  Iowa  contributed to this report    This story has been corrected to reflect that Sanders  campaign manager is Faiz Shakir  not Fiaz Shakir

FRANKFURT   One of Bayer s largest shareholders tore into the company s management on Wednesday for underestimating the legal risks of its takeover of Monsanto  setting the stage for a fiery annual general meeting after a 30 percent plunge in the shares  Bayer has seen about 30 billion euros   34 billion  wiped off its market value since August  when a U S  jury found Bayer liable because Monsanto had not warned of weedkiller Roundup s alleged cancer risks  It suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month  It s quite drastic when a takeover triggers such value destruction and reputational damage so quickly  There can be no talk of a successful takeover any more   Ingo Speich  the head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment  told Reuters  He will be among the shareholders to speak at the April 26 annual general meeting  AGM   What s startling is that things have effectively moved beyond management s control because we re now at a point where the decisions over future development are made in court rooms   he said  adding Bayer had clearly underestimated the risks  With a holding of about 1 percent  Deka says it is Bayer s 10th largest shareholder overall  and the second largest German one after DWS Major shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services  ISS  and Glass Lewis last week recommended investors not to give the executive board their seal of approval at the AGM  Glass Lewis also advised against a vote of approval for the non executive supervisory board  A shareholder vote to ratify boards  actions features prominently at every German AGM  Though largely symbolic  as it has no bearing on management liability  it is seen as a key gauge of shareholder sentiment Among shareholders that have vowed to deny top Bayer executives their vote of confidence is the former head of DWS  Christian Strenger  Deka s Speich declined to disclose how Deka would vote Company filings showed this week that Bayer s supervisory board sought law firm Linklaters  expert opinion for reassurance that the management board had complied with its duties when acquiring Monsanto for  63 billion last year The supervisory board in Germany s two tier corporate board system has to sign off on larger transactions  Bayer s non executive Chairman Werner Wenning was a driving force of the Monsanto deal  according to sources familiar with the matter Bayer is appealing  or has vowed to appeal  the two jury verdicts  but more than 11 000 plaintiffs are seeking damages The U S  Environmental Protection Agency  the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators across the globe have found that glyphosate  the active ingredient in Roundup  is not likely carcinogenic to humans However  the World Health Organization s cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion  classifying glyphosate as  probably carcinogenic to humans  Speich said Bayer could now be vulnerable to attacks from activist shareholders who might seek to break it up  although the  bitter pill  of litigation risks might deter them for now  Such risks could also distract management  he added  when it  should be fully absorbed by the integration of Monsanto   Speich said    Reporting by Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss  Editing by Edward Taylor and Mark Potter  

Israel s parliamentary election on Tuesday brings an end to a neck and neck campaign that saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  the veteran politician of the Israeli right and one of the country s longest serving leaders  facing the strongest challenge in years  Mr  Netanyahu s tenure has been marked by a collapse of peace talks with the Palestinians  confrontation with Iran  armed conflict with Hamas  and hostility toward what he views as plots to isolate and delegitimize the Jewish state But Mr  Netanyahu has also overseen an era of healthy economic growth and stability  thawed relations with Sunni Arab leaders and expanded Israeli trade ties in Africa  Latin America and Asia   Read more on Mr  Netanyahu s ties with President Trump that have emboldened him to take policy risks  The prime minister is entangled in corruption scandals that could lead to his indictment  And he faces stiff competition from a new rival  Benny Gantz  the leader of a trio of former generals who could end Mr  Netanyahu s 10 uninterrupted years as prime minister But Israeli elections are complicated and unpredictable  with many parties vying for votes and at times forming opportunistic alliances to secure a parliamentary majority ImageThe Blue and White alliance is led by Benny Gantz  center  and two other veteran generals  They have teamed up with a centrist party led by Yair Lapid  left  a former television host and finance minister CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWho are the main challengers to Netanyahu Final pre election polls showed Mr  Gantz s centrist Blue and White alliance  a coalition named for the colors of the Israeli flag  slightly ahead of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  a dominant force on the Israeli right for decades Their policy stances are similar  a reflection of how Israeli politics have moved increasingly to the right under Mr  Netanyahu  But while Mr  Gantz has sought allies from across the spectrum  Mr  Netanyahu has reached out to the far right to strengthen his prospects for a parliamentary majority  He even has promised to begin extending sovereignty over the occupied West Bank  which the Palestinians want for a future state  if he is re elected The Blue and White leaders are drawing on their military backgrounds to counter Mr  Netanyahu s contention that only he can protect Israel  Mr  Gantz and his colleagues have also focused on the corruption accusations against Mr  Netanyahu  his biggest vulnerability  to press their case that new leadership is needed They have attracted backing from smaller centrist parties  And what remains of the left leaning opposition has thrown its support behind Mr  Gantz for prime minister  The Labor Party would be likely to recommend Mr  Gantz for the premiership after the election What makes this election different Mr  Netanyahu could be indicted  Israel s attorney general announced last month that he planned to bring charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  A final decision on charges is likely by year s end  Under the current law  Mr  Netanyahu  if re elected  would not have to resign until a final conviction  although new legislation or public pressure could force him to step down  Mr  Netanyahu has described the charges as a baseless partisan witch hunt  But with a first sitting prime minister to be charged  Israel would be entering uncharted legal and political terrain The uncertainty has worked against Mr  Netanyahu in the prelude to the vote   The attorney general s report has done something that has never happened in Israel s 70 year history  and that is that a prime minister is under a legal cloud   said David Makovsky  an expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  The election also is the first time that three former heads of the army  the Israel Defense Forces  have united to run for office  The Blue and White alliance is led by Mr  Gantz and two other veteran generals  Gabi Ashkenazi and Moshe Yaalon They have teamed up with a well known centrist party  Yesh Atid  led by Yair Lapid  a former journalist  television host and finance minister  Mr  Gantz has agreed to hand off the prime minister position to Mr  Lapid after two and a half years if their parties win  While Mr  Netanyahu has a strong record of defending Israel  the Blue and White alliance s military credentials have made it more difficult for him to attack Mr  Gantz and his colleagues as weak on security   The question is  will it neutralize the advantage that Netanyahu has accrued over his previous four terms of being  Mr  Security    Mr  Makovsky said   He s said the words Israelis want to hear   I ll keep you safe    How does the voting work Voters cast ballots for parties  not individual candidates  to fill seats in the 120 member Knesset  or Parliament  The seats are divided proportionally based on the percentage of the vote each party receives  Any party that wins 3 25 percent or more of the vote gets at least one seat  If parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes won t be counted  That will raise the share of seats given to the other parties  If one party were to win at least 61 seats  it would be entitled to form a government  But this has never happened in Israeli politics  So once the seats have been apportioned  parties try to cobble together coalitions that control a majority of seats  ImageAn election billboard for the New Right party  with which Likud is expected to align CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat might those alliances look like Polls have suggested that Likud and Blue and White will each get about 30 seats   meaning both will be seeking alliances with smaller parties  Likud is expected to align with a  right wing party known as the New Right  and with an extreme right alliance known as the Union of Right Wing Parties  which includes Jewish Power  widely criticized as an extremist  anti Arab racist party  Potential Blue and White coalition partners include the Labor Party and the leftist Meretz Party  among others  Read about the Palestinian rapper who is  urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes by boycotting the elections  Will the outcome of the vote be clear immediately Probably not  The president  Reuven Rivlin  has the discretion to give the party leader with the best chance of forming a majority coalition the first opportunity  Typically  but not always  that opportunity goes to the leader of the party with the most votes  who then has 42 days to try  If that party leader fails  the president turns to another to attempt to create a coalition  So it could take a few months It also is possible that the Likud and the Blue and White coalition would join forces and create a national unity government  In theory  Mr  Rivlin could offer both Mr  Gantz and Mr  Netanyahu this opportunity and they could take turns as prime minister Mr  Gantz has rejected that idea  vowing that he will not sit on a government with Mr  Netanyahu  though a leaked recording suggested that he might  ImageAyman Odeh  a leading Arab politician  in Nazareth last month  CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat about  Arab citizens of Israel They represent nearly a fifth of the country s 5 8 million eligible voters  which could give the four Israeli Arab parties a potential kingmaker role  But these parties have never joined a governing coalition in Israel  And some Israeli Arab voters have vowed to boycott the election  partly in protest of a new law pushed by Mr  Netanyahu declaring Israel as the  nation state of the Jewish people   Critics have called the law racist and undemocratic What about Palestinians in occupied territory They are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote in the election  About 4 75 million Palestinians fall into this category  according to the Institute for Middle East Understanding  an American nonprofit educational group that promotes Palestinian viewpoints Could the election affect a potential peace plan Still steeped in secrecy  President Trump s long anticipated plan to resolve the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is not much of an issue in the election  Nevertheless  it could be affected Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law  who has been leading the administration s efforts to draft the plan  said it would not be made public until after the election Many Palestinians already have dismissed the plan   whatever it may contain   because they see Mr  Trump as siding with Israel  But the plan also faces a threat from the parties of the Israeli extreme right  which see any concessions to the Palestinians as unacceptable  If Mr  Netanyahu needs those parties to form a coalition  Mr  Trump s peace plan may be doomed However  if Blue and White wins or forms a national unity government with Likud  that could make way for possible cooperation with the Trump administration on a plan  David M  Halbfinger  Isabel Kershner and Herbert Buchsbaum

We ve ended this live briefing for the night  We will have another one on Wednesday  Here s what happened today   Exit polls show a dead heat in the race between Benjamin Netanyahu  the polarizing  right wing prime minister  and his main rival  Benny Gantz  a newcomer to electoral politics who is seen as a centrist  Both men claimed victory  Who is Benny Gantz    Official results may not come until early morning Israel time  late tonight in the U S  It will then be up to President Reuven Rivlin to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority   Regardless of who becomes the next prime minister  the election has already proven to be a humbling setback for Mr  Netanyahu  69  who has built a strong economy  kept the country safe and has been promoted by President Trump  It has also placed Mr  Gantz s new Blue and White party in the position of the main alternative to the right wing  a spot once held by the Labor party   While Mr  Netanyahu appealed primarily to the right  Mr  Gantz  59  a retired lieutenant general and former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces  reached out for allies across the political spectrum  He sought to make Mr  Netanyahu s expected indictment on corruption charges the main issue ImageBenny Gantz  the leader of the Blue and White alliance  speaking on Tuesday night at headquarters in Tel Aviv CreditCorinna Kern ReutersExit polls show Netanyahu and Gantz in dead heat  both claim victoryMr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz emerged in a dead heat in Tuesday s parliamentary election  according to preliminary exit polls The muddled projected outcome left Israel teetering at a critical juncture between an ever sharper turn to the right or a more moderate reset of the political order The exit polls of the three main television channels were sufficiently disparate that both sides claimed victory In a head to head matchup  two of the polls showed Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party ahead and a third showed him in a draw with Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  But including the broader blocs supporting each party  two polls showed the Likud bloc ahead and the third was a draw Just after midnight  Mr  Gantz made a triumphant entrance at his party headquarters to the cheers and chants of supporters  and gave a victory speech even though victory was not assured Calling it  a historic day   Mr  Gantz declared   We are the winners   and thanked Mr  Netanyahu for his years of service Mr  Netanyahu  for his part  claimed a  definite victory  for the right wing bloc in Parliament   I thank the citizens of Israel for their trust   he wrote on Twitter   I will start by assembling a right wing government with our natural partners tonight  ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel with his wife  Sara  speaking to supporters at his Likud party headquarters on Tuesday night CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesStill  Mr  Gantz s strong performance against the long dominant Mr  Netanyahu was a remarkable achievement for a political newcomer  and the mood at Likud headquarters was grim  We need to wait for the most important poll  the real election   Amir Ohana  a member of Parliament  said at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv The results may become clearer as vote counting progresses in the coming hours  It is also possible that the result could still be tipped by the final count  including the votes of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients  later this week Smaller parties could prove decisiveThe fate of smaller parties at both ends of the spectrum was unclear and could prove decisive The pro settler New Right party  led by Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked  failed to cross the threshold to be seated in Parliament  according to two of the three television networks  exit polls But the third survey showed it with four seats  We passed a three month marathon and the marathon is still going on   Mr  Bennett told supporters  urging them to keep their spirits up and look to the counting of military ballots   We have patience  great faith and nerves of steel  We take care of the soldiers  and the soldiers will take care of us  At the far left  Raam Balad  the weaker of two Arab dominated parties  failed to cross the threshold in two exit polls  but won six seats in the third survey If one or both of those parties is able to win seats in the Parliament when all the votes are counted  those extra seats could swing the determination of the winning coalition and thus the next prime minister When will we get official results ImageSupporters of the Blue and White political alliance watching exit poll results at party headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditLior Mizrahi Getty ImagesThe manual ballot counting was expected to continue until at least 3 a m  Israel time  8 p m  Eastern   and possibly hours later  By Wednesday morning  the Central Elections Committee should release close to final results based on some 99 percent of the polls The action will then shift to the official residence of President Reuven Rivlin  He will receive a parade of party representatives over the next few days who will lobby for their choices for the next prime minister  Mr  Rivlin will then ask the candidate he thinks has the best chance of forming a government to do so That candidate will have 42 days to try to forge a coalition with the support of at least 61 seats in the 120 seat Parliament In most cases  the party with the largest number of seats is given first crack at forming a government  In 2009  Tzipi Livni s Kadima party won the most votes but failed to build a viable coalition  Mr  Netanyahu  whose Likud party came in second  was tasked with forming the government Mr  Netanyahu was already busy on Tuesday night trying to secure recommendations and support from his so called  natural partners  among the right wing and religious parties A caveat on exit pollsThe final outcome was likely to be swayed by several small parties that were teetering just above or below the electoral threshold  according to the exit polls  Avigdor Lieberman  the leader of one such party  the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu  said it was  too early to draw conclusions  The exit polls of the 2015 election serve as a cautionary tale  They anticipated a tie between Likud and the center left Zionist Union  with most projecting 27 seats for each  In the final count  Likud prevailed with 30 seats and the Zionist Union won only 24 In another variable on Tuesday  the exit polls may not have fully accounted for what appeared to be a late surge in the number of Arab voters The Arab vote headed for historic lowImageTurnout in Arab areas of Israel appeared to be headed for a historic low CreditAtef Safadi EPA  via ShutterstockPolitical analysts said the turnout in Arab areas of Israel  where citizens have become disillusioned with Israeli politics and with their own politicians  appeared to be headed for a historic low With turnout lagging and the fate of the election potentially swinging on one or two seats in a coalition  every party was pleading with its voters to race to the polls before it was too late But among Arab voters  where a boycott movement appeared to be having a strong effect  the haranguing was especially intense  The right is planning to crush the Arab parties  it wants to erase us off the political arena   Mtanes Shehadeh  a spokesman for the struggling Ram Balad party  wrote in a WhatsApp message to supporters   This is Netanyahu s dream  Palestinian groups were critical of the early results  Saeb Erekat  the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its chief negotiator  said exit polls suggested that  Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo  they have said  no  to peace and  yes  to the occupation  Just days ago  Mr  Netanyahu unexpectedly promised to begin extending Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank if re elected  The move would probably doom a two state solution and appeared to be a last ditch effort to rally his right wing base Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party has come out against the idea of annexing West Bank settlements  but it has been vague about allowing a Palestinian state alongside Israel Netanyahu s party places hidden cameras at Arab pollsA boycott campaign wasn t the only reason for poor turnout among Arab voters  Early Tuesday  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling places in Arab towns At least some of the Likud observers concealed the cameras  as online videos showed  Likud said the move was aimed at capturing evidence of any irregularities According to Israeli news reports  the Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint  calling it voter intimidation  the police confiscated dozens of the cameras  and the Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said filming in polling stations was prohibited Just before 9 p m   the left wing party Meretz  which was counting on Arab support to clear the threshold to be seated in Parliament  appealed to elections officials to keep the polls open in Arab villages an extra hour to allow in any voters who had initially been scared off by the cameras How it worksVoters cast ballots for parties  not candidates  Thirty nine parties are participating  The percentage of the vote determines a party s number of seats in the Knesset  or Parliament  Any party needs at least 3 25 percent of the vote for a seat Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and Mr  Gantz s Blue and White alliance are expected to gain more seats than any other group  But each will fall far short of achieving a 61 seat majority on its own  meaning that a new government will almost certainly be formed by a multiparty coalition  See our guide to the Israeli elections  Possible outcomesImageA poster of the Blue and White party leaders in Tel Aviv  depicting from left  Moshe Yaalon  Benny Gantz  Yair Lapid and Gabi Ashkenazi CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesLikud wins the most seats  Mr  Netanyahu s party might be able to reach a majority with the help of smaller right wing parties Blue and White wins the most seats  Mr  Gantz and his partners might be able to reach a majority with a combination of smaller parties on the left and right Unity government of Likud plus Blue and White  While Mr  Gantz has vowed never to serve in a government led by Mr  Netanyahu  there has been speculation that their parties might negotiate to form a unity government if neither can attain the sufficient number of seats  Such a possibility would increase if some smaller parties needed by Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz fail to make the 3 25 percent threshold Any party that wins at least 3 25 percent of the vote gets at least three seats in Parliament  but if parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes are discarded

dozens of others whom Reuters met on a 14 day tour along England s coastline said they felt increasingly let down by politicians  In line with recent opinion polls nationwide  few had changed their minds about backing Brexit  In these coastal areas  the majority still wanted to leave Europe  Get us out of there and get us our own nation back  That s what I say   said Ovington    I m  just fed up with all the money that they give to the EU when we can spend it here  I want out  Britain as a whole voted by a narrow margin to leave the European Union  But around England s coastline  dislike of EU was and is much more marked  A tally of the results as estimated by Chris Hanretty  a professor of politics at Royal Holloway  University of London  shows more than 100 of the 120 or so English parliamentary constituencies that have a coastline voted to leave  Reuters visited 10 of them  eight where most people voted to leave  and two where a majority chose to stay  From Skegness on the east coast to Morecambe Bay in the west  dozens of people said they were still convinced their fortunes could only improve outside the EU The main exception was Brighton  a southern town nicknamed  London on Sea   partly for its appeal to those with jobs in the capital who have an hour long commute to work  In this cosmopolitan  affluent university town  a clear majority voted to remain in the European community  which the UK joined in 1973 The overall results reflect a wider trend  Across Europe  economic and industrial decline are driving anti EU sentiment  according to a European Commission study from December 2018  The paper   The Geography of EU Discontent   found that areas with lower employment or a less educated workforce are more likely to vote anti EU In England s case  Brexit also highlights a new layer in the political divide  which Prime Minister May alluded to in 2016 when she pledged to help those  left behind  by globalisation  Big cities are becoming younger  more ethnically diverse  more educated and more socially liberal  while smaller towns are ageing  are less diverse  more nostalgic and more socially conservative  studies by political geographers show All around the coastline  whether people voted Leave or Remain  they expressed nostalgic regret for a time when there was more opportunity   and kindness   I think we used to take care of our communities a bit more   said Brighton based web designer and massage therapist Chris Baker  adding it was easy to be too romantic about the past   I think  you know  we had more manners  we were nicer to people on the street  For Ovington  the problem is very real  She worries that her granddaughter s 18th birthday brings nearer the moment when Dana Marie  like other young people in the region  will move away to university and work Ovington hopes Brexit means the local council can claim funds that in her view are currently being mis directed into Europe  and invest them in a future for local young people   At the moment there is no future for them  there s nothing   she said   So out of Brexit  they ll get more funding  help the kids more  SKEGNESS  LINCOLNSHIRECoastal regions were targeted in the run up to the referendum by the anti EU United Kingdom Independence Party  UKIP   While UKIP has since lost ground  the frustrations it tapped remain Populations on the coast are typically older  whiter  less well educated and poorer than the average  In 2013  Skegness was designated the  most deprived seaside area in Britain  in a study by the Office for National Statistics  ONS   And in 2016 the constituency returned the biggest  Leave  vote in the country  at more than 75 percent  according to Hanretty Skegness was the site of the first Butlin s holiday camp for workers in the 1930s  and is still a popular seaside destination in the summer  But it sits in a poor farming region and has yet to attract year round visitors The mean age of just over 44 in Skegness is older than the English average of just over 39  census data from 2011 shows  More than 93 percent of people in the area said they were white and of English or British nationalities  compared with just under 80 percent in England on average  Around 40 percent of people in the Skegness area said they had no qualifications  It s been going downhill for a long time   said Dana Marie of the town  adding she would have voted to leave the EU if she had been old enough  She is studying biology  sociology and health and social care at school  and works part time in a Burger King   Obviously it s seasonal  so during the summer it s really really good  but during the winter it s terrible  In 2010  average hourly pay for people living in the Skegness area was about three quarters of the British average  By 2018  it had fallen further behind  The national average was 14 36 pounds an hour  according to the ONS  But people living in and around Skegness were making just over 10 pounds an hour On a Sunday night in a pub in Wainfleet near Skegness  father and son John and Andrew Eldin were almost the only customers  John  77  said that to stay in Europe would be to be  ruled by a load of boneheads  I voted out  Because I remembered how good it was before we went in  Eldin and his son  a heavy goods driver and mechanic  spoke heatedly about how there has been diminishing care for old farm hands in the region who have been afflicted by arthritis after years harvesting cabbages  Now  they said  locals are undermined in the jobs market by immigrants from eastern Europe who have freedom of access  and also compete for schools and healthcare REDCAR  NORTH YORKSHIREA militant mood is mounting in Redcar  a small town devastated in 2015 by the closure of its steelworks with the loss of around 3 000 jobs  In January  local media reported  demonstrators marched in yellow vests with the slogan  leave means leave  to urge their member of parliament  who backed the Remain campaign  to quit  The politician did not step down and tensions still run high  Life s gonna change after this because of the politicians  who run the country  said Kevin Calvey  an unemployed 64 year old   Everything s gonna be contested from now on  He thinks London is absorbing investment that the rest of the country needs  A new rail link across the capital is costing some  22 billion  The government s refusal to grant a loan to the Redcar steelworks forced the plant to close  Redcar is a relatively young town  but more than a quarter of residents have no qualifications  Relative pay has declined since 2010  London just needs feeding all the time  to the detriment of the rest of the country   said Calvey  He said he voted to leave the EU  because I didn t want the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels telling us what to do   Fish and chip shop owner and Leave voter Mark Scorer works in Redcar because businesses in his home town of Sunderland were too expensive to take on  he said   I just think Britain s been on the decline since the 80s   he said   There s not much out there for people  sometimes people have got to move away to get jobs  They go to university to get these degrees and then they move to London     which is a shame  Further up the coast  a postcard on sale in the former fishing town of Whitby depicted the shuttered hulk of Redcar s steelworks above a banner   dystopia on sea  WHITBY  NORTH YORKSHIREIn Whitby harbor  kipper smoker Derek Brown said his family has been in the business for 146 years  For the past 30 or so  he says  the fish he has been smoking has had to be imported from Norway and Iceland because herring can no longer be found off the coast  The reasons for this include overfishing and climate change  but he felt London and Brussels have not helped When Britain joined the then European Economic Community  the country opened its fishing waters to other states  which today catch more in UK waters than do UK boats   I want change   Brown said   Hopefully we ll get our fishing grounds back  Pay in the Whitby area has picked up since 2010  but still lags the British average  A higher than average share of people say they have no qualifications  and in the 2011 census  97 percent gave their nationalities as white English or British variants Guest house and tea shop owner Alice Raven  27  said she didn t vote in the referendum but she sees more opportunities for England outside the EU  Her gothic themed cafe plays on Whitby s appeal as the site where the 19th century novelist Bram Stoker brought his villain  Count Dracula  into England  I think leaving would be the best option   she said  sitting next to a skeleton outside her tea rooms   I don t think you can trust any of the government at the moment  MORECAMBE  LANCASHIREOn the northwest coast  fisherwoman Margaret Owen  just back from delivering a batch of sprats to feed the seals in Blackpool Zoo  was boiling over at the politicians  ignorance  She said it was preventing her from earning a living In the summer months Owen  66  uses a haaf net  an ancient technique dating back to the Vikings to catch salmon and sea trout as they head upriver  The job is dangerous  Users manipulate a device like a cutdown soccer goal post while standing in deep  fast running water  Owen has until recently been licensed to fish in this traditional way  But now salmon are an endangered species  and from this year she has been told that EU regulations mean she must discard any salmon she catches This  she says  is unrealistic  not least because she sometimes fishes at night  I stand in the water up to my chest   she said   It can be pitch black  turbulent  raining  sand s going from under your feet  You get it  the fish  in the net  it goes right to the back of the net  You ve got to catch it  kill it  and put it on your belt and let me tell you  I haven t got time to say   Are you a sea trout or a salmon   Owen said she originally wanted out of the EU   We were hoping for a change for everybody   But now  she says she has changed her mind  because talks so far don t look like delivering what the fishing industry hoped Other fishermen in Morecambe Bay gather shellfish  such as cockles and mussels  for export  mainly to southern Europe  Leaving could restrict their access to European markets  but two of them said they still wanted out  even though they worried about the potential impact on their business  UK cockle fisheries made over four million pounds in 2017 The EU was originally set up for fair trading  said one of these fishermen  Michael Wilson  but it hasn t worked out like that   We ve countries joining with no money and we were providing money  so it was time to get out or go independent  I think  BRIGHTON  EAST SUSSEXThe Leave vote cuts little ice in Brighton on the south coast  one of the few coastal towns with a clear majority in favor of remaining in Europe  In the wealthier part of town  almost three quarters of voters wanted to stay in Europe  I believe that the Leave campaign was based entirely on lies and there was no way I was going to vote in support of that   said Ruby McMahon  a 22 year old literature graduate who works in a clothing store  She came to Brighton in 2015 to go to university  and said she stayed because she had been raised  in a very conservative backwards town  Brighton s demographic profile is almost the mirror image of Skegness  People who live in the town  which houses the UK headquarters of American Express  earn more than the British average   almost 10 percent more in Brighton Pavilion  the richer part of town  The mean age  at 37  is younger than average  according to the 2011 census  Almost 40 percent are educated to the highest level  and around 20 percent of residents say their ethnicity is not white English or British McMahon   like the Ovingtons in Skegness   said her vote was partly driven by her aspirations for the future But where the Ovingtons want more opportunities at home  McMahon worries that Brexit will damage her chances of living and working outside England  Once outside the European Union  Britons may no longer enjoy freedom of movement  I m scared of how badly handled it s been   she said   Ledwith reported from London  Additional reporting by Michael Holden  Edited by Janet McBride and Richard Woods

Over the last decade  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has repeatedly quashed rivals on the left and the right  defying the odds   and the polls   to hold onto power  He has increasingly relied on right wing partners to do so Yet in nationwide elections Tuesday  he faces an unexpectedly strong challenger  Benny Gantz  a former army chief who has tirelessly reminded voters that Mr  Netanyahu may soon face corruption charges   a planned indictment that would make him the first sitting prime minister in Israel to face criminal prosecution Mr  Netanyahu s future   and his legacy   are not the only things at stake in the election  A potential reshuffling of Israel s chaotic political landscape could have far reaching consequences  Here s a guide to our coverage of the players  issues and possible ramifications of the election The headliners  Mr  Netanyahu  69  has framed himself as Israel s Indispensable Man  the tough ex soldier who has aggressively defended Israel s interests  raising the country s prominence on the world stage  His relentless self promotion and potent politics of division   pitting right against left  Jew against Arab  religious against secular   have helped him dodge past allegations of corruption and build his current coalition  consisting of his Likud party and pro settlement and ultra Orthodox factions ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel visiting the market in Jerusalem while campaigning on Monday CreditDan Balilty for The New York Times  Mr  Gantz  59  is a three star general who fought two wars in Gaza  giving him credentials to challenge Mr  Netanyahu s  Mr  Security  persona  In campaign ads  Mr  Gantz both boasted about  terrorists killed  over his military career and suggested he could be a peacemaker  He teamed up with two other former army chiefs and another centrist  Yair Lapid  to try to court voters in the middle of the ideological spectrum Kingmakers and a political brawl  Under Israel s chaotic and confusing parliamentary system  a panoply of small parties could tip the balance of power  The unlikeliest kingmaker is an iconoclastic politician  Moshe Feiglin  last seen pushing a far right agenda of annexing the entire West Bank  He is now calling for the legalization of marijuana and has put out proposals aimed at reducing the cost of living  a flat tax  privatization of hospitals  an end to import tariffs  and land reform to lower housing costs   The Arab vote is also a wild card   especially as  on the eve of the election  Mr  Netanyahu pledged to begin annexing parts of the West Bank  a potentially fatal blow to the prospects for a peace agreement with Palestinians  A strong turnout among Palestinian citizens of Israel  who make up 20 percent of the population  could raise the number of votes needed to make it into Parliament  jeopardizing smaller parties on the right and the left  Yet Arab voters have seemed even less enthusiastic about voting than Jews  and a boycott the vote campaign has gained strength in the past month   Whoever wins in the electoral contest will have to cobble together a coalition in Parliament  where no party has ever won a 61 seat majority outright  Here s our guide to the factions and system   In the turbulent run up to the vote  parties collapsed  former allies turned on one another and younger Likud leaders prepared for life after Bibi  Election ads reflected the ugly  anything goes tenor of the race  and neither of the front runners said much about policy ImageCampaign posters showing leaders of the Blue and White party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditDan Balilty for The New York Times  A series of unforced errors by Mr  Gantz gave Mr  Netanyahu opportunities to call his fitness for office into question  as did a report on Israeli television that Mr  Gantz s cellphone had been hacked by Iranian intelligence  Mr  Netanyahu also played up President Trump s recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli territory  and his relationship with Mr  Trump   Mr  Gantz  meanwhile  hammered on the allegations of corruption around the prime minister  An Israeli watchdog group found a network of hundreds of social media accounts  many of them fake  were being used to smear Mr  Netanyahu s opponents  Both men seized on Menachem Begin  the former prime minister and militant Zionist  as a campaign prop   27 years after his death The indictment  In February  Israel s attorney general announced his intention to indict Mr  Netanyahu on charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  Mr  Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing  and is entitled to a hearing before an indictment is formally issued   Read more here about the cases against him  the culmination of a two year investigation into his dealings with wealthy businessmen  including a Hollywood movie producer and Israeli newspaper publishers   Mr  Netanyahu is also facing a new scandal  He is accused of secretly approving the sale of advanced submarines to Egypt without the approval of top military officials  and is accused of self dealing  through an undisclosed and enormously profitable financial stake in a company that supplied the German builder of both the Egyptian subs and several new Israeli warships  

ZURICH   Sunrise Communications  top shareholder on Wednesday blocked plans to extend the company s right to issue fresh capital to 2021  complicating its bid to buy Liberty Global s Swiss UPC cable business for  6 3 billion The rejection by Freenet at the Swiss telecoms firm s annual shareholder meeting does not scupper the takeover  which was announced in February A separate meeting will decide on the  4 1 billion capital increase needed to push that through But the thumbs down from German telecoms company Freenet  which holds a 24 5 percent stake  denied Sunrise the required two thirds majority to extend capacity for authorized capital until 2021  The measure got only 59 3 percent support  Together with Freenet we could have agreed it makes sense by pushing forward a  further potential  capital increase to take pressure off the large capital increase   Sunrise finance chief Andre Krause told Reuters  Now we can t do that  Freenet robbed us of optionality  Freenet had already said it would not take part in the main capital hike  saying it was disturbed by how the transaction was structured  It has not yet decided how to vote at the extraordinary shareholder meeting that will be convened to approve that  Freenet lawyer Alexander Borgwardt told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual meeting The date for that meeting   where only a simple majority is needed   has yet to be set pending regulatory approval for the deal Authorizing fresh capital now could have helped contribute some of the money needed for the deal  Borgwardt said  adding   We think this should be voted on at the end  when the entire transaction will be discussed  Sunrise Chairman Peter Kurer said a two thirds majority for the capital increase could be needed should Liberty Global in the meantime buy shares in Sunrise  In that case  it would be easier for Freenet with its nearly one quarter stake to block the capital increase because not all shareholders attend meetings  The turnout on Wednesday  for instance  was 62 percent of the voting capital There was no evidence at this stage that Liberty planned such a move  Krause said Kurer had earlier expressed optimism that Sunrise would win backing to raise the money needed to complete the UPC takeover Sunrise officials have met more than 170 large shareholders and potential investors in recent weeks to outline the deal   After these talks they view the transaction significantly more positively   he said Kurer said he anticipated regulatory approval  adding a rival could well buy UPC should Sunrise fail   Writing by Michael Shields

KIEV   As a comedian  TV host and actor  Volodymyr Zelenskiy knows how to start a show with a bang  He proved that by beating all comers in the first round of Ukraine s presidential election  As he plans for the grand finale  a runoff against President Petro Poroshenko on April 21  aides say he is sticking to an unorthodox campaign routine that has torn up the play book Appearing to turn the tables on Poroshenko  Zelenskiy on Wednesday evening accepted his challenge to take part in a policy debate  In a slick video with pumping music  he set his own conditions and gave his rival 24 hours to respond Poroshenko s campaign team had hinted Zelenskiy would duck out because the comedian  who plays a fictional president in a popular TV series  would risk showing himself up Within 45 minutes of Zelenskiy s video being posted on Facebook  it had been seen 141 000 times  shared more than 22 000 times and attracted 3 300 comments  It left a live countdown for Poroshenko to respond  You called me for a debate  dreaming that I would run away  duck out  hide  No  I m not you in 2014   said Zelenskiy  in a reference to Poroshenko not holding a debate during the previous election five years ago Poroshenko responded with a much more sober video in which he accepted Zelenskiy s condition of holding the debate in a huge soccer stadium  But he cautioned   Debate is not a show     This is no time to joke around  Being a president and commander in chief is not a game   Zelenskiy s response to Poroshenko offered a snapshot of how he has upstaged his more experienced rivals  winning nearly twice as many votes as Poroshenko in the first round of the election on March 31 Shunning traditional campaign tactics such as mass rallies or erecting tents in the street to distribute leaflets  he has relied heavily on social media and comedy gigs where he pokes fun at rivals  presenting himself as an everyman who stands up to corrupt elites    a man to whom Ukrainians can relate At stake is the leadership of a country on the frontline of the West s standoff with Russia following the 2014 annexation of the Crimea peninsula and war in eastern Ukraine against Russia backed separatists in which 13 000 people have been killed  NOT AFRAID TO BE CREATIVE Part of Zelenskiy s campaign team works in a large house in an upscale area of the capital  Kiev  Inside  the offices have glass walls with messages scrawled on them and are filled with volunteers in their twenties bent over laptops  All that we do is to not be like everyone else   said 28 year old Michael Fedorov  whose team manages various Facebook  YouTube and Instagram pages   We do not want to write typical posts  We do not want to speak the words that all politicians use  We want to get away from this as much as possible  He said Zelenskiy had from the start opposed traditional ways of doing things   As a result  we have one platform only   that s the internet   he said Zelenskiy invites suggestions from Facebook followers on tackling problems such as high utility bills or their choice of prime minister Dmytro Razumkov  Zelenskiy s political adviser  said the comedian would not hold mass rallies before the second vote because the focus was on ensuring he comes across as authentic and transparent  This is a person who is not a weather vane and does not change his position depending on whether it is more comfortable for a voter or less comfortable  You have to run for president  honestly stating your position and what will you do   he said One challenge is attracting voters who are not internet savvy    bridging the gap between online and offline  Oleksandr Korniyenko  another senior member of Zelenskiy s team  said one technique to get around this was emailing voters with campaign messages and encouraging them to print out the email and distribute it  Another was encouraging Zelenskiy s many young supporters to show his social media videos to older voters such as parents  he said Hoping a high turnout will favor Zelenskiy  his team is trying to ensure younger voters cast their ballots in email messages with headlines likely to make them click and read  Our emails are not the typical  You joined such and such a political party   Instead we might have a crazy headline   Fedorov said  In the first round  an email was sent out by Zelenskiy s team with the subject line  You ve been left out   The message itself said  everyone has already voted except you  and urged those who had voted to encourage others to vote  Fedorov said  We are not afraid to be creative   he said  NOT A JOKE Zelenskiy has 3 3 million followers on Instagram  more than French President Emmanuel Macron  German Chancellor Angela Merkel  British Prime Minister Theresa May and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte combined  Poroshenko has 234 000 The comedian s posts offer snapshots of his life such as working out in the gym or going for a run  and allow him to poke fun at his rivals  expense  When former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko  who was eliminated in the first round of voting  posted a video of herself eating a hot dog at a popular gas station chain to show her common touch  Zelenskiy posted a picture of himself and his team eating a hotdog at the same chain  In order to not be considered as just a joke  we decided to be serious like everyone else   he wrote underneath  Zelenskiy is likely to come under more scrutiny over policy before the runoff  including in the debate  He is wealthy and the image of the fictional president he plays  humble and scrupulously honest  is likely to be challenged by Poroshenko  Zelenskiy has been accused during the campaign of being the puppet of a rich businessman whose TV channel airs his shows  Zelenskiy and

MADRID   The demographic shift in Britain three years after its decision to leave the European Union could tip the scales in favor of remaining should a second referendum be held  Spain s Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said on Wednesday  Britain voted by a narrow margin in June 2016 to leave the EU but parliament has been unable to agree on how this will be managed  prompting calls for a second referendum  Spain is particularly affected as nearly 300 000 British people live in Spain  many of whom are pensioners living in coastal regions  while the Spanish economy depends heavily on tourism with Britons being the most numerous foreign visitors  Borrell said another referendum did not guarantee a different outcome  But a rise in the number of eligible young voters  who tended to vote remain  and a fall in the number of older voters  more likely to choose Brexit  could tip the balance  he said  It s true that  with young people in favor of remaining and older people leaving  just through the passing of these three years  with the demographic dynamics as they are  I m sure the result would be different   Borrell told Telecinco TV  European Union leaders are expected to grant Prime Minister Theresa May a second delay to Brexit at an emergency meeting on Wednesday ahead of the latest deadline of Friday  with EU diplomats saying a year long extension was likely   Reporting by Paul Day  Editing by Angus MacSwan  

  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in position to win a fourth consecutive term on Wednesday  with nearly all of the votes counted  By Wednesday evening  the rival Blue and White alliance led by Benny Gantz had conceded the race  though ballots were still being counted   After the final tally  it will be up to President Reuven Rivlin to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority  But Mr  Netanyahu s Likud bloc had a strong numerical advantage in being able to form a governing coalition   Regardless of the final result  the election illustrated the deep divisions under Mr  Netanyahu  69  who has led Israel for a decade of relative security and prosperity  More than a million Israelis voted for Blue and White  a record for a new party  placing it in the position of being the main alternative to Israel s right wing  a spot held for decades by the Labor Party  See Mr  Netanyahu s road through Israeli history in photos

alliance  the political centrists that had posed the greatest threat to Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  conceded the election on Wednesday evening  acknowledging that it did not have the votes to take control of the government  We didn t win on this round   Yair Lapid  one of the alliance leaders  said Mr  Gantz  who had once been seen as a viable contender for prime minister  speaking to a crowd in Tel Aviv a short time earlier  said he would respect the decision of the president to choose the party leader he saw fit but vowed to fight on  in any way I can   At the moment  with the blocs  this is the reality   he said   The war is not over  He said he and his Blue and White party remained committed to serve the people of Israel  We re all democrats   he said   We respect the decision of the people  of the president  We will serve them from any position that we will be in the future  Mr  Gantz  a retired lieutenant general and former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces  had reached out for allies across the political spectrum and sought to make Mr  Netanyahu s expected indictment on corruption charges the main issue in the race The ballots are still being counted   a final tally is not expected until tomorrow   and after that  President Rivlin will choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority to head the government

cameras at polls and boasts of low turnoutA public relations firm has claimed credit for placing cameras in Arab polling stations in support of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  boasting that the effort helped lower voter turnout  according to posts on the company s Facebook page The company  Kaizler Inbar  in a public Facebook post wrote   Thanks to us placing observers in every polling station we managed to lower the voter turnout to under 50 percent  the lowest in recent years   according to a translation in the Israeli news outlet Haaretz The company said it worked with Likud to distribute the cameras  The company is headed by Sagi Kaizler  a former leader of a West Bank settler group  who confirmed to Haaretz that his company was behind the Likud funded effort A photo of staff members standing alongside Mr  Netanyahu and his wife  Sara  was posted with the note On Election Day  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling stations in predominantly Arab towns  Some of the cameras were concealed  as seen in videos online  Likud said the cameras were deployed to record evidence of potential voter fraud The Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint on Tuesday over the cameras  calling the tactic voter intimidation  The police confiscated dozens of the cameras  and the Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said filming in polling stations was prohibited   MEGAN SPECIAImageAn event in Jerusalem this month for Shas  an ultra Orthodox party  Shas has pledged to support Benjamin Netanyahu in a governing coalition CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesParties on the right line up behind NetanyahuFour right wing and religious parties had publicly pledged by Wednesday morning to support Mr  Netanyahu in his bid to form Israel s next governing coalition  Those commitments  if they hold  leave him just one seat short of a parliamentary majority and a fourth consecutive term in office The four parties   Kulanu  the Union of Right Wing Parties  and the ultra Orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism   are projected to win a combined 25 seats  Together with the 35 seats that Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party is projected to win  such a coalition would have 60 seats in the 120 seat Parliament Also among what Mr  Netanyahu terms his  natural partners  is the hard line Yisrael Beiteinu party  led by Avigdor Lieberman  which is projected to take five seats The party has joined coalition governments led by Mr  Netanyahu in the past  but Mr  Lieberman was holding out on Wednesday  saying he was waiting for the final tally of votes  including the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients that are to be counted later this week Mr  Lieberman served as foreign affairs minister and then defense minister under Mr  Netanyahu  but resigned from the government in November  complaining of a soft policy toward Hamas  the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza A spokesman for Yisrael Beiteinu  Aryeh Vishenski  reiterated the party s campaign message that it would only join a coalition that would allow a proper  fight against terrorism in the south   enact a

next steps depend on Israel s president  a Netanyahu foePresident Reuven Rivlin will decide whether to invite Mr  Netanyahu to form a governing coalition  though the two men have made little secret over the years of their mutual loathing  The president s office said Wednesday that he would begin consulting party heads next week to gauge their choices for prime minister In what the office described as a  historic and pioneering decision   it plans to broadcast those meetings live  in the name of transparency   That move may offer Mr  Rivlin protection from possible barbs from Mr  Netanyahu if the process does not go as the prime minister would like  Here is a guide to The New York Times s coverage of the Israeli election  The origins of the animosity between the president and prime minister are unclear  but it burst into the open when Mr  Rivlin  a veteran of Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party and a former speaker of Parliament  was running for the presidency in 2014 So determined was Mr  Netanyahu to thwart Mr  Rivlin s candidacy that he tried to recruit Elie Wiesel  a Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate  for the job   even though Mr  Wiesel  who has since died  was not an Israeli citizen at the time  When that failed  Mr  Netanyahu floated the idea of abolishing the largely ceremonial office Mr  Rivlin  79  has spoken out forcefully against the government s attempts to curb the independence of the courts and the media  and what he called a lack of  statesmanship  under Mr  Netanyahu    ISABEL KERSHNERImageThe settlement of Beitar Illit  Making an appeal

peace and yes to the occupation  Palestinians and independent analysts say Israeli encroachment into the occupied territory has dimmed hopes for creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel  And in Israeli politics  there is little remaining support for a  two state solution     RICHARD PREZ PEAImageThe Israeli justice minister  Ayelet Shaked  was met by demonstrators as she left a pre

Shaked and Naftali Bennett of the New Right party  which apparently failed to clear the threshold for any seats in Parliament Mr  Bennett said on Wednesday that he hoped that New Right would gain enough votes to keep him in Parliament once the ballots of tens of thousands of soldiers   along with those of hospital patients  prison inmates and merchant seamen   are counted on Friday  I was always a soldier of the state   he wrote on Twitter  whether in the military  in business or in government  where he was a cabinet minister during the 2014 Gaza conflict   Now the soldiers will decide where I will continue to fight for them  In November  Mr  Bennett sought to be named defense minister  but the prime minister turned him down The New Right broke away from a more established right wing party  aiming to free itself of the influence of ultra Orthodox rabbis and more extremist elements in the pro settler community  But it defined itself by what it was not  rather than what it was  and its election ads were widely seen as sophomoric  They were rising stars with a solid base of support  which they abandoned   said Tal Shalev  a political reporter for Walla  a news site Mr  Bennett and Ms  Shaked had expected to compete with Mr  Gantz for support from the center right  Instead  those voters appeared to turn to other parties on the right  believing Mr  Netanyahu s dire warnings that a Gantz victory would mean a return to left wing government Ms  Shaked  the justice minister  is highly popular among Likud activists  many of whom see her as a future prime minister  but Mr  Bennett is less so  meaning their paths are likely to diverge if they do not return to Parliament    DAVID M  HALBFINGERImagePresident Donald Trump takes questions from the press before

outside the White House   Everyone said you can t have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians  I think we have a chance  and I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won  Mr  Trump has reversed generations of United States policy  moving the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv  and recognizing Israel s authority over the Golan Heights  which much of the world has condemned Those moves  urged by the Israeli leader  bolstered Mr  Netanyahu s political standing at home  particularly on the right  Days before the election  he said he would annex parts of the occupied West Bank   another goal of the Israeli right  despite international and Palestinian objections that such a move could doom the prospects for a peace agreement Mr  Trump has promised to

OTTAWA   Canada is expecting foreign interference in its national election in October  and is considering stronger regulation of social media companies to ensure they block meddling in the voting  the minister responsible for election integrity said on Monday The minister spoke after the release of an updated report by Canada s electronic eavesdropping and security agency on online interference by other countries in the Canadian election  We judge it very likely that Canadian voters will encounter some form of foreign cyber interference related to the 2019 federal election   the report said   However  at this time  it is improbable that this foreign cyber interference will be of the scale of Russian activity against the 2016 United States presidential election   Canada is a target of choice for those who seek to undermine our democracy   said the minister  Karina Gould  at a news conference in Ottawa The report does not indicate what countries are likely to attack Canada  and both Harjit Sajjan  the defense minister  and Shelly Bruce  who heads the electronic security agency  declined to elaborate Ms  Gould also criticized Google  Twitter and Facebook for not providing the Canadian government with the same degree of information they have offered Europe about their efforts to mitigate possible election interference  We have not really seen that much progress with them   she said  adding that the major social media platforms have declined to give the government regular updates about what they are observing and what they are doing to prevent any misbehavior  There s a lot left to be desired in terms of how seriously they re taking these issues   she said Kevin Chan  the head of public policy for Facebook Canada  said the company plans to introduce new rules for paid political advertising in Canada and is making efforts to block foreign meddling in elections  We take the protection of election integrity on our platform extremely seriously at Facebook  and we want to be a force for good in Canadian democracy   he said in a statement ImageKarina Gould was sworn in as the Canadian minister responsible for election integrity in 2017 CreditSean Kilpatrick The Canadian Press  via Associated PressColin McKay  head of government policy at Google Canada  said the company had met several times with several branches of the Canadian government to discuss  transparency  cybersecurity and information  The company is also working with Canada s Canadian Center for Cyber Security  a government agency  on preventing malicious attacks  Twitter declined to comment  We have every intention of continuing our close work with government to protect Canada s democratic institutions and election activities   Mr  McKay said in a statement The company did not address Ms  Gould s call for formal regulation Ms  Gould said Canada was reviewing its laws to see how they can be used to force action by online companies  and also considering new legislation It is also reviewing steps by other countries  including Britain s proposal on Monday to set up a social media regulator  and recent changes to Australia s laws that  among other things  could lead to the jailing of  executives from social media companies if they do not  expeditiously  remove content with graphic violence on their platforms  We are having active conversations with our partners and allies around the world as to what this would look like in the Canadian context   Ms  Gould said She added   The platforms have been able to avoid being held to account for what takes place on their platforms for too long  Separately on Monday  Facebook banned several Canadians and groups that promote white supremacy In a statement  the company said it was shutting down accounts held by Faith Goldy  a far right former mayoral candidate in Toronto  and several groups including the Soldiers of Odin and the Canadian Nationalist Front The report was issued by the Communications Security Establishment  which is a branch of the military and headed by Ms  Bruce  It issued a similar report in 2017 Earlier this year  the government set up a committee with representatives from the civil service  the security service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to look for signs of interference in this year s vote The report found that any interference is likely to be limited to the spread of misinformation during the campaign  It concluded that any interference in voting results was highly unlikely because Canada still uses paper ballots in national votes  

ISTANBUL ANKARA   It was midnight on election night when Turkey s main opposition party finally believed it had overturned a decade and a half of failure at the polls and delivered a stinging defeat to the country s master campaigner  President Tayyip Erdogan The candidate of the secularist Republican People s Party  CHP  for mayor of Ankara was comfortably ahead in the capital  but in Istanbul   the biggest prize in Sunday s local elections   Erdogan s ruling AK Party candidate had declared victory CHP politicians and supporters  who had endured more than a dozen election and referendum losses at the hands of Erdogan s Islamist rooted AKP since 2002  were well accustomed to crushing disappointment once the ballots were counted This time was different  At around 12 a m  we realized that we were clearly the winners of the election  that we had won   said Suleyman Celebi  an aide to CHP Istanbul candidate Ekrem Imamoglu The party s own data  he said  showed they had defeated Erdogan s close ally and former prime minister Binali Yildirim  despite an exhaustive and bitter two month campaign waged by the president and backed by an overwhelmingly pro government media Once they saw the numbers  Imamoglu and his team refused to back down   We believed after that that there was no turning back  and that we would win   Celebi told Reuters That newfound confidence  supported by initial results the next morning showing Imamoglu had narrowly beaten Yildirim  was forged in an opposition campaign that contrasted sharply with Erdogan s high profile  confrontational election strategy The softly spoken Imamoglu  spurning the kind of mass rallies which Erdogan addressed daily  sought to win over a broad spectrum of voters with a positive message  meeting many of them face to face in a campaign which even his opponents acknowledged struck a chord with the electorate Celebi said Turks  tiring of  divisive and polarizing language  from their leaders  warmed to a new style of politics   This time we saw an open will to vote for Ekrem Imamoglu across all parts of society   he said The CHP made a formal alliance with the breakaway nationalist Iyi  Good  Party and also won votes in Istanbul from supporters of the pro Kurdish HDP party  which chose not to field a mayoral candidate there to boost Imamoglu s chances  DENTED AURAConfirmation of defeat in Istanbul   a city of 15 million people   and Ankara would not reduce Erdogan s sweeping presidential powers  but would seriously dent the aura of invincibility he has built up during 16 years of ever tighter control over the country  His AKP  which has challenged results in both Ankara and Istanbul  still won 51 6 percent of the national vote together with its nationalist MHP alliance partner  down from 53 7 percent in parliamentary elections last year Three party sources who spoke to Reuters all said there were flaws in a campaign which struck a relentlessly belligerent tone  linking Erdogan s opponents to terrorists and painting the vote bleakly as a  matter of survival  for Turkey  Maybe we should have given another message instead of  survival    said one source at AKP headquarters in Ankara who described it as ill suited for voters worried about living standards and local services  As early as January  AKP officials were sounding the alarm over falling public support amid high inflation and rising unemployment Authorities responded to soaring food prices by setting up stalls in Ankara and Istanbul selling subsidized vegetables That too may have backfired  the same source said  as TV footage of people queueing for food revived images of  old Turkey  and the chronic inflation of the 1990s   Long lines being formed disrupted the perception of the AK Party   he said Another party source said the AKP was still missing former campaign manager Erol Olcok  a close friend of Erdogan who masterminded AKP election victories before he was killed on an Istanbul bridge during a failed military coup in 2016 In recent elections  the AKP could not  find its groove   he said Praising the CHP s strategy of focusing on  direct contact with the people   a third source said   If we had paid attention to the messages from the start and then taken necessary steps  the results could have been different today  For Imamoglu  now preparing to take over Turkey s largest city and govern 15 million people with a projected expenditure of 24 billion lira   4 3 billion   the campaign is over but the battle not yet won The AKP has appealed results of all 39 districts in Istanbul  A party official said on Thursday that once the recount was complete  the AKP s candidate would emerge on top Imamoglu says the electoral board  must do its job  and declare him victor but  in keeping with the tone of his campaign  he has stressed consensus over confrontation  We really need to help each other   he said a day after the vote  as it became clear the close result could trigger a bitter dispute   I would like to remind you that we walk side by side on the same path  that we are in the same boat    1   5 5907 liras   Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay

MILWAUKEE   With their recent selection of Milwaukee for their party s 2020 convention  Democrats left little doubt that they believe their path to the White House runs through the Midwest in general and Wisconsin in particular Their optimism spiked in November  when Democrats defeated Scott Walker  the state s two term conservative governor  And they were energized and optimistic again this week for an intensely politicized State Supreme Court election they hoped would show Wisconsin trending steadily blue Then reality hit  A conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory on Tuesday  underscoring instead how competitive Wisconsin politics remain For Democrats  an intense effort to rebuild their Midwestern  blue wall  for 2020 is showing gains in Michigan and Pennsylvania  both of which President Trump captured in 2016  On Tuesday  Democrats flipped a key Pennsylvania State Senate seat that Republicans had long held outside Pittsburgh  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  But in Wisconsin  the apparent loss of the State Supreme Court race   Judge Hagedorn leads by nearly 6 000 votes and a recount is possible   underscored what strategists in both parties said in interviews this week  The state is a tossup in 2020 and its political identity is very much in flux  Republicans know they need this state and are going to fight like hell to keep it in President Trump s column   said Joe Zepecki  a Democratic strategist in Wisconsin  He said that Mr  Walker s loss in November may have fired up the conservative base just as Hillary Clinton s 2016 loss did for Democrats last November  They re coming with everything they ve got   he said of Republicans   That means we have work to do  Wisconsin s reputation as a battleground state is well earned  In the three closest presidential elections of recent times   2000  2004 and 2016   Wisconsin was decided by the narrowest average margin of any other state  less than one percentage point in each election Mr  Walker lost his re election bid for governor by less than one percentage point  after warning all year of a coming blue wave  Over the weekend  Mr  Walker offered a pep talk to Republican activists in Milwaukee about the stakes in electing Judge Hagedorn  a former lead counsel to his administration  who defended contentious election issues such as a voter ID law  Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field  Democrats wanted to defeat Judge Hagedorn and gain a liberal Supreme Court majority  Mr  Walker warned  so they could seize control of redistricting after 2020 and  get rid of one  maybe two seats that we currently have in the House of Representatives  Democrats  haven t forgotten about how close the election was  in 2016  Mr  Walker told party activists gathered for breakfast at the American Serb Hall in Milwaukee   They re not going to make that mistake again  ImageA conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory for the State Supreme Court on Tuesday  underscoring how competitive Wisconsin politics remain CreditRick Wood Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  via Associated PressMark Jefferson  executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party  said Judge Hagedorn s apparent victory showed the power of the party s engaged conservative base  The grass roots took offense to the attacks on Hagedorn s Christian faith   he said  referring to news accounts that the judge founded a Christian school that allows firing teachers in same sex relationships But others say Mr  Walker s midterm loss is probably a more relevant bellwether for 2020 than the Supreme Court race  because turnout was more than twice as high  and Mr  Walker is a polarizing  partisan figure in Wisconsin  much like the president Barry White  a lawyer who voted for Mr  Walker in 2010 but snubbed him in 2018 in favor of his Democratic opponent  Tony Evers  said he had wanted to make a bigger point  His ballot was  a repudiation of Trump and Republicans that insist on carrying his water   Mr  White said   It was the only message I could send  Mr  White lives in the Milwaukee suburbs  the state s most populous Republican region  Mr  Evers s gains there last year were a key to his narrow victory  In an interview  Mr  Walker said that should be a lesson to Mr  Trump   To win  he s going to have to improve his numbers in the suburbs   he said   With the passion the opposition is going to have  he s going to have to make some inroads  Last fall  Mr  Walker matched his vote totals from 2014 in the three suburban counties outside Milwaukee  But a surge of Democratic votes in the demographically changing suburbs meant his vote share dropped in 2018 by 12 percentage points in Waukesha County and by 16 points in Ozaukee County  It s the paradox of Trump s strategy of appealing to his base constantly   said Charles Franklin  director of the Marquette Law School Poll of the state   It also helps gin up the feelings of your opposition  I think that it s a gift to Democrats that keeps on giving  One of those voters is Tiffany Duncan  a 26 year old employee of a printing company  who skipped the 2016 election because she didn t like either major party candidate  But she definitely plans to vote in 2020   for whichever Democrat takes on Mr  Trump   I didn t think Trump was this crazy   she said as she walked to Caf Bavaria in Wauwatosa Village Still  Mr  Franklin said  the state is so evenly divided  its chances of determining an Electoral College majority for either party  puts us at ground zero  In a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than Mr  Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president  meaning his path to a second victory in the state is both uphill and narrow Many of today s uncertain voters   who are Republicans or Republican leaning independents   may come home to the party  especially once there is a Democratic nominee to contrast with the president John Carlson  a 59 year old engineer in Milwaukee  is one of those gettable voters for both parties  He went for Mr  Trump in 2016 but is uncertain if he will do so again  Democrats could win him over  he said    if the Democrats came up with somebody reasonable  which I m not expecting them to do  Republicans are framing the Milwaukee convention as an opportunity to motivate their own base  expecting Democrats to showcase a parade of far left figures and policies  National Republicans have already begun a coordinated effort to paint Democrats as wild eyed radicals steering the country toward socialism ImageIn a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than President Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times Democrats were energized in 2018  like any party is out of power during the first midterm  but then decided to go off the rails once they seized control of the House   said Rick Wiley  a former political director of the Republican National Committee  whose roots are in Wisconsin  The president energizes base Republicans and has had great success with working class voters   he said in an email   Those same working class voters won t check the box on a progressive socialist nominee  Mr  Jefferson of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he was upbeat about Mr  Trump despite public polling  I expect to see the same thing this cycle as 2016  where all polling suggests it s an uphill battle and on Election Day things look a lot different   he said   I think the Democrats are once again overplaying their hand and a little too confident  When Mr  Trump holds rallies aimed at Wisconsinites  he visits media markets across northern and western regions  largely agricultural and rural  where in 2016 he outperformed earlier Republican nominees In the Supreme Court race  Judge Hagedorn  the conservative  got a major boost in the Green Bay and Wausau markets  enough to overcome a deep deficit in Dane County  which includes Madison  the state s bluest stronghold In the 18 counties in the Green Bay media market  where TV ads linked Judge Hagedorn to Mr  Trump  voters swung by 18 points toward the conservative compared with a State Supreme Court election last year won by a liberal judge  according to an analysis by Craig Gilbert of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel The Saturday before Election Day  there was no shortage of avid Trump supporters at Roar Off the Shore  a tasting of craft beers and cheeses east of Green Bay in Kewaunee County  which is on the thumb of the Wisconsin mitten Though the county s populace is small  Mr  Trump s ability to run up the score in such places was repeated all across rural America in 2016  He won Kewaunee County  a dairy region  by 28 points compared with Mitt Romney s six point margin as the 2012 Republican nominee  I m tired of politicians  he s not a politician   said Randy Boor  57  who works in a factory that makes commercial cookware  He judged Mr  Trump s chances of carrying the state in 2020 as even better than in 2016  We ve got a guy there that s delivering   he said   He wants to do the frickin  job  You know how much could get done if he wasn t being opposed by all these idiots  Another beer taster  Dave Soborowicz  a 47 year old plumber  had driven across the state from Eau Claire to attend the event with his brother  who wore a Trump hat  But Mr  Soborowicz was less enamored of the president and unsure if he would vote for him the next time   He s so bloated in his head that he thinks he s still going to get his frickin  wall  when he s been defeated   he said Mr  Soborowicz said business was good for him as a plumber but he wasn t ready to give Republicans and the president credit   All I know is it was a bad winter   he said   so we were very busy

WASHINGTON   Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it s time to kick off bipartisan talks on a new budget pact to fund federal agencies over the next two years The Kentucky Republican told reporters that he spoke with President Donald Trump last week and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday morning  and that both support trying to reach an agreement on a new spending pact for both the Pentagon and domestic programs  We ve agreed to put together  at the staff level  a group to begin discussing the possibility of reaching a two year  spending  caps deal so we can move ahead hopefully with some kind of regular appropriations process   McConnell told reporters A new funding agreement is needed to prevent the return of spending cuts under the remnants of a failed 2011 budget and debt agreement  Trump has only reluctantly signed spending bills during his two years in office  and his acting chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  is a budget hawk who s signaling that the White House is taking a harder line this time around Trump s budget  submitted last month  would give a sharp increase to the Pentagon but would cut back domestic programs  a nonstarter for Democrats controlling the House  Any bipartisan agreement would renounce Trump s budget  which drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans when it was unveiled last month The administration gave a chilly reaction to the developments  Democrats aren t even writing a budget and are pushing for a reckless  caps deal  that would cost taxpayers over  2 trillion and explode deficits   said a senior administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions have been private   We ve made clear to Congress that type of a wasteful spending is unacceptable  Meanwhile  a revolt by liberal Democrats against a separate budget measure backed by Pelosi  D Calif   and other House party leaders led the leadership to cancel a vote on it that had been tentatively scheduled for Wednesday  That proposal would have increased spending for both the Pentagon and domestic agencies  The increases would ease the way for this year s round of annual congressional spending bills this spring Progressives said the leadership backed plan didn t contain enough money for liberal priorities  They re pushing for significantly higher spending for domestic programs  saying the Pentagon budget is bloated while domestic programs are being shortchanged  For me the big issue is freezing defense spending   said Rep  Ro Khanna  D Calif   I don t think this is an issue of divided government  This is an issue of a divided Democratic caucus on issues of defense spending  Let s go on the record and vote on whether we should be increasing defense spending or not  The guns vs  butter debate has split the Democratic caucus  pitting progressives from solidly Democratic districts against more moderate Democrats from more marginal political turf  The moderates say liberals  demands are politically unrealistic and would add too much to the deficit Even as the leadership proposal foundered  the House on Tuesday quietly adopted a resolution that would permit the chamber to begin voting on the annual spending measures  though it didn t pick winners and losers between the defense and nondefense sides of the federal ledger

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump may feel he is  stuck  with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell  whom he has blasted for engineering four interest rate hikes since Trump appointed him  but none of Trump s other Fed appointees has stood in the way of the tightening campaign and at least one has said even higher rates may be necessary The voting records and public statements of Trump s Fed appointees  who now form a solid majority of the Fed s Washington based board of governors  show not only consensus around the recent increases  but no support so far for the rate cuts Trump has demanded  A possible upcoming nominee to the Fed  economic commentator Stephen Moore  has said he agrees with Trump that rates should be cut and had earlier called for Powell s ouster  Trump has mulled whether he could fire Powell  but in a March 8 phone call  reported by the Wall Street Journal  acknowledged he was  stuck  with the Fed chair for Powell s full four year term that runs to February 2022  If Moore does take a seat alongside Trump s appointees at the Fed  at this point he would be the outlier  I am comfortable with the current stance of our policy   Trump s newest appointee  Fed Governor Michelle Bowman  said in February in her only comments about monetary policy to date  Bowman joined the Fed in November  when the administration was growing agitated about rising volatility in financial markets  She voted for the December rate increase that has become a particular target of Trump s ire and point of blame for  in his view  holding back the economy  The White House on Tuesday announced Bowman would be renominated for a full 14 year term to follow the end next January of the short  partial term she was appointed to fill Trump s hand picked vice chair  Richard Clarida  voted for the December increase and the one before it in September  which was approved shortly after he joined the Fed board Randal Quarles  who was the first appointment Trump made to the Fed as his presidency took shape in 2017  voted for five rates hikes from December of that year to December 2018  and his most recent comments show the wide and sometimes paradoxical gap between the president s view of what the Fed should be doing  and those of the people he has chosen to oversee the central bank In what amounted to a bullish defense of where the economy is heading  Quarles last week said in fact that rates may need to move higher precisely because Trump s tax cuts and policies may produce a  persistent  boost to productivity and growth   Further increases in the policy rate may be necessary at some point  a stance I believe is consistent with my optimistic view of the economy s growth potential and momentum   Quarles said in remarks at the Manhattan Institute last week For now the Fed intends to hold rates steady  a position it reached both as Trump publicly called for a halt to rate increases  but also   and what Fed officials say mattered to them   as economic and financial data globally indicated a broad slowdown from the faster than expected growth of 2018 Trump blames the weaker data on what he called in a tweet on Thursday the Fed s  destructive  rate hikes  Others see a number of causes  including Trump s trade policies  and feel growth is likely to continue though at a tepid pace  We had this synchronized acceleration of growth a couple of years ago  Now it is synchronized deceleration and a slowing momentum across the spectrum   International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in Washington on Tuesday   Nobody wins a trade war   RULE BY CONSENSUSUnanimity among Fed board members is largely the norm  The Fed strives to be a consensus driven organization  led  but not dictated to  by a chair whose job is to canvas and shape opinion among as many as 18 other policymakers split between the seven member board based in Washington and 12 regional bank heads The regional bankers  five of whom each year have a formal vote on interest rates even as all 12 participate in Fed debates  are part of a now century old system meant precisely to guard against too much power residing with the board and the chair in Washington There are currently two open board seats Even as Fed officials have begun to speak more frequently and openly in public  formal dissents against any given policy action have in general declined since the 1970s  The last one by a board member was in 2005 by then Governor Mark Olson against a rate increase But that doesn t necessarily mean conformity inside the room when the Federal Open Market Committee meets every six weeks  Opposition to some of the extraordinary policies put in place to fight the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis  for example  led former Governor Kevin Warsh to resign even though he never dissented  maintaining a unified face for the Fed during a treacherous time Yet with the current group of appointees there is little sense of the sort of behind the scenes warfare that occurred  for example  when a group of governors tried to revolt against the recession inducing steps pushed by 1980s era Fed Chairman Paul Volcker to curb runaway inflation Transcripts of recent Fed meetings won t be released for five years  but the summary minutes of sessions last fall show the central bank sifting through data  coming to grips with developing risks  and shifting their stance as a result By January   all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to maintain  the existing interest rate  the minutes stated  Several  said continued growth might warrant higher rates eventually There was no mention of support for a rate cut   Reporting by Howard Schneider  Editing by Dan Burns and Andrea Ricci  

HONG KONG   A political party led by the president of the Maldives appeared to have won decisively in parliamentary elections over the weekend  a result that may help him restore political freedoms in a strategically important country with an authoritarian past The president  Ibrahim Mohamed Solih  had won a resounding victory in presidential elections last September  But parts of his party s agenda have been stymied because some of its allies in a governing coalition are aligned with a former strongman leader  Abdulla Yameen  who has been widely accused of corruption and repression The Maldives  a chain of islands southwest of India  has traditionally fallen within New Delhi s sphere of influence  Yet it also stretches across maritime routes that are crucial to China  and Beijing has recently spent hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure projects in the Maldives Critics have warned of the Maldives falling prey to  debt trap diplomacy   meaning that it could be pressured to offer security concessions to China as repayment for large loans  Some politicians  as well as Western and Indian diplomats  have warned that a growing dependence on China could be a threat to the country s sovereignty Some political analysts saw the victory last year for Mr  Solih  who has been skeptical of China s influence  as good news for India s interests  On Sunday  a news article in The Economic Times  an Indian newspaper  described the parliamentary rout by Mr  Solih s Maldivian Democratic Party as a  shot in arm  for New Delhi in its  neighborhood  Still  Constantino Xavier  a foreign policy fellow at Brookings India in New Delhi  said the  lure of cheap and easy money  made it likely that the Maldives s relationship with China would deepen   despite everything that leaders will say in public   In the long term  the natural tendency of any leader in the Maldives will be to increase ties with China   he said   China has that financial power to deliver quickly and effectively  Preliminary results from the vote on Saturday showed that the Maldivian Democratic Party was on track to win more than two thirds of the 87 seats in the country s parliament  the local news media reported on Sunday  It needs just 44 seats to become the first party to secure a parliamentary majority since the Maldives held its first free election in 2008 Other parties won fewer than seven seats each on Saturday  according to The Maldives Independent  a local news site Past elections in the Maldives have been marred by accusations of widespread irregularities  Mr  Yameen was accused of rigging the presidential election last year by forcing employees of state owned companies to vote for his party  stacking the election commission with loyalists  locking up opposition leaders and canceling voter registrations But Transparency Maldives  an election watchdog  said in a statement on Sunday that the previous day s vote had been  transparent and generally well administered  Mr  Solih said in a statement over the weekend that the country s people were the election s  biggest winners   That our campaign was issue oriented and not based on hatred and narrow divisions is a win for our young democracy   he said   That our government did not hinder those candidates with whom we did not agree is a big win for the country  The Maldives made international headlines last winter when Mr  Yameen  the president at the time  set off a political crisis by declaring a state of emergency and sending troops to surround the Supreme Court  The move came the week after the court overturned criminal convictions against nine of Mr  Yameen s opponents One of them was a former president  Mohamed Nasheed  a member of the Maldivian Democratic Party who was then living in exile in London  Mr  Nasheed  who returned to the Maldives in late 2018  was ineligible to run in the September election because he had been sentenced to prison under the Yameen government Mr  Solih ran for president in Mr  Nasheed s place On the campaign trail last year  Mr  Solih pledged to restore democratic freedoms if he won  including rolling back an anti defamation law that Mr  Yameen had introduced as a tool for locking up opponents The anti defamation act was repealed two months later  But Mr  Solih s party has struggled in recent months to carry out other parts of its agenda For example  even though Mr  Solih has promised to investigate the 2014 disappearance of Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla  a prominent journalist critical of Mr  Yameen  a party in the Maldivian Democratic Party s governing coalition refused in February to call a vote on a bill about recovering stolen assets and investigating unresolved murders Mr  Yameen  the former strongman president  was recently imprisoned over a graft scandal involving the country s tourism board  He denies the accusations and was released on bail in late March  days before the parliamentary elections  

SAN SALVADOR   El Salvador s incoming president Nayib Bukele said on Tuesday he would not be inviting the leaders of Honduras  Nicaragua and Venezuela to his June 1 inauguration after criticizing them as illegitimate rulers In a Twitter post  the 37 year old Bukele confirmed news reports that invitations were not being extended to Juan Orlando Hernandez  president of neighboring Honduras  Daniel Ortega  president of Nicaragua  or Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro Bukele  who won an election in February  did not say why the presidents would not be asked  but he has previously criticized all three as men who did not deserve to be in power due to controversies that have clouded their administrations The 2017 re election of Hernandez  a conservative ally of the United States  has been questioned by many  including Bukele  due to a disputed vote count that took weeks to resolve Hernandez appeared to be on track to suffer a shock loss in the election before the official vote count came to a sudden halt  When it restarted more than a day later  the count turned in his favor and he was ultimately declared the winner Ortega  a former Marxist guerrilla and Cold War antagonist of Washington  has faced international condemnation for Nicaragua s a heavy handed crackdown on months of protests that he has described as part of a plot to oust him Maduro  who has presided over an economic and political crisis in Venezuela  has been under pressure to step down amid accusations he has abused his power to suppress the opposition Bukele is one of a host of political figures that have given their support to Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido  who in January declared himself the rightful president Venezuela has rejected criticism of the Maduro government as hostile propaganda and as attempts to set the stage for an intervention by foreign powers in the country   Reporting by Nelson Renteria  Editing by Dave Graham  Editing by Simon Cameron Moore  

Senate Republicans this week adopted rule changes that could make the august upper chamber something like a miniature version of the raucous and deeply partisan House In a bid to speed confirmation of President Trump s nominees  Republicans voted Wednesday to cut the debate time for lower level judicial and administration picks from 30 hours to two  Ordinarily  such a rule change requires the backing of a two thirds supermajority  But the Republican leader  Mitch McConnell  detonated the so called nuclear option  lowering the threshold for passage to a simple majority   a move Mr  Trump had been clamoring for  Only two Republicans joined with Democrats to oppose this latest erosion of the minority party s ability to  advise and consent  This may sound like parliamentary arcana  but the impact should be clear to anyone unnerved by the Senate s newish practice of ramming through Supreme Court picks with a bare majority   another Trump era innovation by Mr  McConnell The Democratic leader  Chuck Schumer  charged that the move  risks turning this body into a colosseum of zero sum infighting  a place where the brute power of the majority rules  with little or no regard to the concerns of the minority party  and where  longstanding rules have little or no meaning  Mr  McConnell contends that he was forced into this by Democrats   mindless  undiscriminating obstruction for the sake of obstruction   This claim will strike many as ludicrous  Well before the name Merrick Garland became synonymous with partisan stonewalling  Mr  McConnell was widely regarded as a master of obstruction  even by members of his own party Even so  it was not the Republican leader who started the Senate down this path  That distinction goes to the former Democratic leader Harry Reid  who  in November 2013  went nuclear to dismantle the filibuster for most judicial and executive nominees  Irked by the Republican minority s bottling up of President Barack Obama s picks  Democrats overwhelmingly backed the measure  which passed by a four vote margin At the time  Mr  Reid blamed Republican obstructionism   They have done everything they can to deny the fact that Obama has been elected and then re elected   he said Like today s Democrats  Republicans then warned of enduring damage to the institution   Breaking the rules to change the rules is un American   said Mr  McConnell  then the minority leader   I just hope the majority leader thinks about his legacy  the future of his party  and  most importantly  the future of our country before he acts  Republicans also vowed that Mr  Reid s team would live to regret crossing this line   Democrats won t be in power in perpetuity   Senator Richard Shelby told reporters   This is a mistake   a big one for the long run  Not six years later  here we are  For all his complaints about Democratic obstructionism  Mr  McConnell has pushed through a record number of Mr  Trump s judicial picks  In addition to killing the filibuster of Supreme Court nominees  Mr  McConnell ended the  blue slip  practice  a tradition that effectively gave senators veto power over nominees from their home state  Now he has done away with extended debate on most nominees Someone needs to stop the spiral  There is much about Senate processes that should be reformed  But razing the body s deliberative culture for partisan gain serves no one well  whichever side does it  Each line crossed makes the next one that much less daunting  This latest power grab has prompted concern about when the Senate will end the legislative filibuster  Such defanging of the minority would likely be a tough sell among lawmakers  But  as with confirmations  the 60 vote requirement on legislation would most likely end in stages  starting with baby steps like requiring only a simple majority to open debate Democratic presidential hopefuls are being asked about the issue  None seem eager to wade in  Yet  But as 2020 approaches  the issue will become more charged  and with every perceived Republican affront  the Democratic base will grow more impatient for its team to play hardball  If Democrats retake the White House and Senate  the pressure to deal with Republican obstructionism will intensify as progressives push bold plans    Medicare for all   the Green New Deal  gun safety measures  and so on   impossible to realize under the current system without a Senate supermajority  But if the rules were changed to allow passage with just 51 votes  who knows what could be achieved  This would make moving legislation through the often infuriating upper chamber easier  more like in the House  which provides few protections against the tyranny of the majority  No doubt this would strike some as a great victory   until the next time their team lost power More on the Senate  nuclear option Senate Republicans Go  Nuclear  to Speed Up Trump ConfirmationsApril 3  2019G O P  Ready to  Nuke  Senate Democrats Again Over Nominee

AUSTIN  Tex    After decades of lawsuits and mass protests failed to radically reform the troubled Police Department  we tried a new tactic a few years ago  Targeting one of the most problematic police union contracts in the country  As a result  Austin went from having a retrograde contract to one that offers transparency and accountability  Others cities can follow this route as well  For years  the Austin Police Department s contract limited civilian oversight  allowed police misconduct records to basically vanish and kept certain important internal affairs files under seal  This lack of oversight  accountability and transparency was linked to the over policing of Austin s black community In Austin  black people represent only 8 percent of the population yet are subjected to 14 percent of stops  26 percent of searches  24 percent of arrests and 31 percent of officer involved shootings  For us  the tipping point came in 2016  after a police officer killed David Joseph  an unarmed  naked black teenager  Around then  a video circulated showing Breaion King  a slim  young black schoolteacher  being violently and needlessly arrested at a traffic stop  When she tried to file a complaint about a year later  a statute of limitations on misconduct negotiated in the police contract prevented the police officers from being disciplined  Mr  Joseph s death was a severe blow to the black community  as were the injustices Ms  King suffered  So we decided that the police contract was the best path forward for reforms  We knew it was going to be a fierce fight  This labor agreement essentially prevented people from being able to make complaints against police officers and was notoriously hard to influence from the outside   For 18 months  our group  the Austin Justice Coalition  led a major grass roots organizing campaign  We demanded a seat at the bargaining table with the City Council and the police union and pressed for reforms with teeth  And we won  In 2017  the City Council voted down the police union contract because of concerns over accountability  not for the usual reasons like salary or benefits   reportedly the first time a City Council has ever done this A year later  it approved a contract with real reforms  Short suspensions are no longer automatically downgraded to confidential written reprimands after a few years  Complaints that suggest police officers may have committed crimes now have a longer investigative period  And people can file complaints online  The City Council also passed an ordinance creating an independent oversight office  which for years had been baked into the contract itself and wrongly used as a bargaining chip  As a result  it was ineffective  Now the oversight office is now accessible to the entire community  It can accept anonymous complaints  file them of its own accord and publicize the findings  In addition  it can provide information on verified complaints for major incidents like deadly officer involved shootings  publicize disciplinary decisions on certain minor incidents and audit footage from body and dashboard cameras  We didn t get everything we wanted  But we set out to make Austin safe for ourselves  livable  where our hyper visibility wouldn t endanger us and make us susceptible to the biases and vagaries of unchecked policing  And these reforms are a major step towards that goal  Here s how we did it  We began our campaign during the city s 2016 budget session so that our demands would interrupt the flow of money into the department  We organized our members to participate in a rare public hearing at city hall on the police contract  and almost every week in 2017  our coalition attended meetings between the city and the police association  We packed chairs around the periphery of the room  took detailed notes and then cross referenced every change to the previous contract  Then we d return to the offices of council members and city negotiators to urge them to support our reforms  Negotiators from the city told us that our presence changed the dynamics of the bargaining by compelling real dialogue between the city and the association  In previous years  the union had railroaded the city for exorbitant pay increases and stipends in exchange for negligible improvements in oversight  The police association resisted our reforms and the city s attempt to include them in their bargaining terms  As the vote drew closer  the union claimed that hundreds of officers would retire en masse if the council rejected the contract   a threat local news stations and our daily paper reported as fact  At that point we had secured only one reform and the narrowest and least visible of them all   the ability to make online complaints  In response  our coalition launched a public information campaign that included community forms in each council member s district  On Dec  13  2017  dozens of people from every district and all walks of life appeared at the City Council meeting to oppose the contract because it did not include meaningful reforms to accountability  transparency or oversight  By midnight  an exhausted council voted that the parties return to the negotiation table to incorporate our reforms  The union backed out of the negotiation  And then the sky didn t fall  Only about 33 police officers retired after the contract was voted down  the total number of retirees that year was about the same as the previous two years  Over the next several months  however  the association was under pressure to negotiate a contract since its

LONDON   British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Saturday that the longer it takes to find a compromise with the opposition Labour Party to secure a parliamentary majority for a Brexit deal  the less likely it is that Britain will leave the European Union May has so far failed to secure backing for her negotiated agreement with Brussels as some Conservative lawmakers and Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party  which props up her minority government  have voted it down  She has since turned to the opposition Labour Party in a bid to secure a majority for an orderly Brexit  although its leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Saturday he was waiting for May to move her Brexit red lines  The fact is that on Brexit there are areas where the two main parties agree  we both want to end free movement  we both want to leave with a good deal  and we both want to protect jobs   May said in comments released by her Downing Street office   That is the basis for a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament and winning that majority is the only way to deliver Brexit    The longer this takes  the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all   she said  May has a plan to enshrine in law a customs arrangement with the EU to win over the Labour Party  and her aides have discussed offering the opposition a place in the British delegation to Wednesday s EU summit  The Sunday Times newspaper reported The prime minister has asked EU leaders to postpone Britain s exit from the bloc until June 30  The EU  which gave her a two week extension the last time she asked  insists she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her thrice rejected divorce deal in the British parliament It is the latest twist in a saga which leaves Britain  the world s fifth biggest economy  struggling to find a way to honor a 2016 referendum vote to take the country out of the globe s largest trading bloc  PRESSURES ON BOTH PARTIES May reiterated on Saturday her hope that lawmakers would approve a deal to allow Britain to leave the bloc as quickly as possible   My intention is to reach an agreement with my fellow EU leaders that will mean if we can agree a deal here at home we can leave the EU in just six weeks   she said  One of the most senior Brexiteers in her government  the leader of the lower house of parliament Andrea Leadsom  also said there was a risk of Brexit slipping further from grasp  The vision we had of Brexit is fading away   and we are running out of time to save it   she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper  Some of May s lawmakers are warning they will try to oust her if Britain participates in EU parliamentary elections next month and is forced to extend membership of the bloc beyond June  The Observer newspaper reported The Sunday Telegraph said ministers are discussing whether to resign if a Brexit delay means Britain must field candidates  In a further sign of the ever heavier strains on the Conservatives  more than 100 candidates for upcoming local elections wrote to May warning of the growing anger at the grassroots level and among the public  Our party and our government have completely lost touch with voters   the candidates said  according to The Sunday Telegraph   Let s be clear  more fudge and a further dilution of Brexit is not the answer   Opposition leader Corbyn also faces pressure as more than 80 of his lawmakers warned that another vote on Brexit must be a red line in Labour s talks with the government  The Independent newspaper said   This story has been refiled to fix typo in first paragraph   Reporting by Costas Pitas  Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Daniel Wallis

WASHINGTON   U S  Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday a Democratic bid to restore the 2015 net neutrality rules is  dead on arrival in the Senate  The U S  House of Representatives on Tuesday debated a Democratic plan to reinstate the Obama era rules and overturn a December 2017 decision by the Federal Communications Commission to reverse the rules and hand sweeping authority to internet providers to recast how Americans access information Late Tuesday  the House opted to delay a vote on the measure and a series of amendments until Wednesday because of an unrelated issue over a separate budget measure The net neutrality bill mirrors an effort last year to reverse the FCC s order  approved on a 3 2 vote  that repealed rules barring providers from blocking or slowing internet content or offering paid  fast lanes  The reversal of net neutrality rules was a win for internet providers such as Comcast Corp  AT T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc  but was opposed by companies like Facebook Inc  Amazon com Inc and Alphabet Inc On Monday  the White House told Congress that if the bill were approved  President Donald Trump s advisers would recommend he veto it  The White House  strongly opposes  the measure that would  return to the heavy handed regulatory approach of the previous administration   it said in a statement The bill would repeal the order introduced by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  bar the FCC from reinstating it or a substantially similar order and reinstate the 2015 net neutrality order  The House will also consider a series of amendments Representative Mike Doyle  a Democrat  said Tuesday the bill  puts a cop on the beat to make sure our internet service providers aren t acting in an unjust  unreasonable or discriminatory way  Republicans called a bid to restore internet protections akin to a  government takeover of the internet  and said it would open the door to the FCC eventually setting internet rates or imposing new taxes on internet service similar to levies on cable or telephone service  Democrats say polls show Americans overwhelmingly back net neutrality and want protections that providers will not interfere with their internet access   Reporting by David Shepardson  Additional reporting by Amanda Becker  Editing by Dan Grebler and Lisa Shumaker  

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main challenger Benny Gantz both claimed victory in Israel s election on Tuesday  Israeli TV exit polls produced differing results about who will emerge as the leader of the largest single party  and the polls have been wrong in the past So both sides still have all to play for  However  there are indications that Netanyahu has a clearer path to forming a coalition government with other right wing  far right and religious parties Here s a quick guide to what happens next HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE THE RESULTS TO COME IN  Final results are expected by Friday  but partial results are published by the Knesset as the vote counting proceeds  so a clearer picture will begin to emerge before the final tally  HOW ARE RESULTS CALCULATED AND WHY DOES IT TAKE TIME Israel has a parliamentary system  which means voters choose from party lists of candidates to serve in the 120 seat Knesset  No party has won a majority since Israel s first election  in 1949  In the 2019 election  about 6 million Israelis are eligible to vote  To enter parliament  a party must pass a threshold of at least 3 25 percent of the national vote  equivalent to 4 Knesset seats With 40 parties running  of which at least 12 have a real chance of passing the threshold  the calculations take time  WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE PUBLISHED  Israel s president will consult with the leaders of every party that won seats about their preference for prime minister  and will then choose the legislator who he believes has the best chance of putting together a coalition The nominee  who does not necessarily have to be the head of the largest party  has up to 42 days to form a government  If he or she fails  the president asks another politician to try  The leading candidates usually have a good idea whether they have majority support before they meet with the president  but things can often change in the process of deal making  WHAT SORT OF COALITION COULD BE FORMED Netanyahu will likely seek a coalition similar to his current government  with ultranationalist and Jewish Orthodox parties  Gantz  who heads the centrist Blue and White Party  will likely have the support of the left wing parties  But early exit polls predict that even with that he would fall short of a governing majority  HOW LONG UNTIL A GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE Past coalition negotiations have often dragged on  Whoever is asked to form the next government will have to accommodate numerous parties  unless Netanyahu and Gantz choose to join forces and form a unity government  WHAT OTHER FACTORS ARE THERE Netanyahu s corruption cases  The prime minister is facing possible indictment in three graft cases  and may learn later this year if he will be formally charged  That could weaken his hand in negotiations with potential coalition partners who may condition their support  should he be indicted  on Netanyahu meeting their demands for cabinet posts and policy concessions The attorney general is expected to hand down his decision by the end of 2019  If Netanyahu is charged  his political allies will have to decide whether to continue supporting him  There is no guarantee that they will Netanyahu denies wrongdoing in all three cases and has the opportunity to convince the attorney general not to charge him in a pre trial hearing  which is expected in July Another factor to watch is that U S  President Donald Trump is expected to release his long awaited Middle East peace plan some time after the election  So far he has been a close ally of Netanyahu  but if he asks Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians  especially anything involving ceding land  some of Netanyahu s far right allies will be furious  Gantz has vowed to pursue peace but has stopped short of endorsing Palestinian statehood   Reporting by Maayan Lubell  Editing by Stephen Farrell and Sonya Hepinstall  

LONDON   Talks on a compromise Brexit plan between Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and the opposition Labour leader  Jeremy Corbyn  hit a snag on Friday  just as Mrs  May sought a nearly two month delay in the deadline for leaving the European Union Labour leaders said Mrs  May had so far refused to budge from her original plan  but the government said it was still prepared to propose changes The developments illustrated the challenges confronting the leaders in reaching an agreement for Britain s withdrawal  with both Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn facing difficulties within their parties if they compromise News of the deadlock came on the same day Mrs  May asked for a second extension of the deadline for departure  to June 30  The original March 29 deadline had been extended once  to April 12   one week away Commenting on the negotiations so far between Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn  Keir Starmer  Labour s lead lawmaker on Brexit  said the government was so far not allowing  any changes to the actual wording of the political declaration   the part of Mrs  May s deal that outlines Britain s future relationship with Europe and that would be the centerpiece of any compromise He said talks would continue only if the government changed its position  So far  the government isn t proposing any changes to the deal   Mr  Starmer told reporters on Friday   We want the talks to continue and we ve written in those terms to the government  but we do need change if we re going to compromise  What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union A minister in Mrs  May s government  Rory Stewart  said the government was prepared to compromise on the political declaration  saying the negotiations with Labour had run into problems but were not dead  In truth  the positions of the two parties are very  very close and where there s good will it should be possible to get this done and get it done relatively quickly   Mr  Stewart said in an interview on BBC Radio 4 In a statement  Downing Street said   We have made serious proposals in talks this week  and are prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides  No further talks were scheduled  a Labour official said  but the party was willing to reopen negotiations if the government s position changed After seeing her Brexit deal rejected three times by Parliament  Mrs  May earlier this week sought to break months of deadlock by meeting with Mr  Corbyn Mrs  May s plan was to eventually take Britain out of Europe s main economic structures but give it control over immigration from continental Europe Mr  Corbyn has been reluctant to be pinned down on a single alternate plan  but Labour s policy is to keep Britain more closely tied to European regulations and leave the door open to a second public vote on Brexit ImagePro Brexit protesters outside the Parliament in London CreditHenry Nicholls ReutersOne of the compromise plans that has been most popular in Parliament is Britain s agreeing to remain in the European customs union  meaning it would not charge tariffs on European products But Mrs  May would risk a rebellion of hard line  pro Brexit lawmakers in her Conservative Party if she accepts a compromise that keeps Britain tied closely to Europe Meanwhile  a compromise would force Mr  Corbyn to face the wrath of pro European lawmakers in Labour  who want nothing less than another public vote that could reverse Brexit altogether Mrs  May already seemed to be contemplating difficulties in talks when she wrote on Friday morning to Donald Tusk  the president of the European Council  asking to again delay Britain s departure from the bloc She said in the letter that if talks with Mr  Corbyn did not produce a compromise  she would hold a series of votes in Parliament on alternative paths  in the hopes that lawmakers would settle on one Parliament has already tested support among lawmakers for various plans  only for none to win a majority  But the government is expected to try to use a somewhat different voting process  were it to try again  This impasse cannot be allowed to continue   Mrs  May wrote   In the U K  it is creating uncertainty and doing damage to faith in politics  while the European Union has a legitimate desire to move on to decisions about its own future  ImageDonald Tusk  center left  president of the European Council  and Jean Claude Juncker  center right  president of the European Commission  in Brussels last month CreditJohn Thys Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMrs  May also conceded in the letter that Britain was preparing to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May Analysts said Brussels would probably reject her proposed date of June 30 for a Brexit postponement   and some countries said they had yet to see a sufficient reason to support any extension Britain was originally scheduled to leave the bloc on March 29  but European leaders granted a short extension to give Parliament more time to approve a withdrawal deal Mr  Tusk was pushing European leaders to offer Mrs  May a one year extension for Brexit while leaving the door open to an earlier withdrawal if Britain ratifies a deal  according to a senior European Union official familiar with his thinking  The official spoke on condition of anonymity  in keeping with standard practice That plan  described as a  flextension   would eliminate the need for European leaders to repeatedly consider British requests for a delay  And in allowing Britain to leave sooner if an agreement is reached  Mr  Tusk appears to be trying to make it clear that Brussels is not trying to trap Britain in the bloc Mr  Tusk s plan would still need the backing of European Union member states  and there were some signs of resistance from France  which typically takes the hardest line in these matters  as well as Austria and the Netherlands  The French president has made very clear that if we want to grant an extension  What for   the French finance minister  Bruno Le Maire  said before a meeting of European finance ministers in Bucharest  Romania  on Friday  He added   It is up to the British government to give an answer to that key question  ImageIn a Twitter post  Jacob Rees Mogg  center  recommended that  if  stuck  in the European Parliament over the next year  Britain should be  as difficult as possible  CreditFacundo Arrizabalaga EPA  via ShutterstockThe cross party talks had been cited by some as reason enough for the bloc to offer an extension  Further difficulties in the talks throw that into question  and any new extension may depend on what Parliament manages to accomplish next week The Netherlands has generally been more sympathetic to Britain  but Mark Rutte  the Dutch prime minister  expressed exasperation with the British negotiating approach   I keep being amazed at how the fifth economy of the world handles its interests   he said In asking for an extension until June 30  Mrs  May was bowing to pressure from within her Conservative Party not to be seen as forcing the country into a longer delay But she was also laying the ground for a more protracted extension by agreeing that Britain was prepared to participate in European elections in May  That was seen in Brussels as a condition for another Brexit postponement Those moves have not gone over well with hard line Brexit supporters  That rancor was reflected in a Twitter post on Wednesday by the lawmaker Jacob Rees Mogg  who recommended that  if  stuck  in the European Parliament over the next year that Britain be  as difficult as possible  The Labour Party received a glimmer of good news in a by election in South Wales  retaining a traditional Labour seat in an area that had backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum But amid low turnout  the margin was relatively slim  with the winner  Ruth Jones  receiving 39 5 percent of the vote  compared with 31 percent for the Conservatives and 9 percent for the rejuvenated far right U K  Independence Party

LITTLE ROCK  Ark    Arkansas Gov  Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday he ll sign legislation cutting off funding to  sanctuary cities  that don t cooperate with federal immigration authorities despite the Republican s objections that the measure could open the door to racial profiling The governor announced he would sign the measure   which would also prevent cities from blocking local law enforcement from asking about a person s citizenship or immigration status  Any cities found to be in violation would be ineligible to receive discretionary funds administered by the state Hutchinson  a former federal Homeland Security official during the George W  Bush presidency who oversaw border security efforts  had asked the bill s sponsors to require probable cause before law enforcement asked about citizenship and immigration status  He said that without the change there would be too much opportunity for racial profiling  Lawmakers rebuffed the request  but Hutchinson said the sponsor assured him he was willing to change the law in a special or regular session to include that language The governor said he opposes sanctuary cities and generally supports prohibiting such policies  Hutchinson  however  repeated his concern that the bill doesn t allow cities to give law enforcement guidance and would leave it up to officers about when to ask for proof of citizenship  This would lead to profiling and indiscriminate questioning of citizens of the United States based solely on the officer s determination that the citizen looks different than what the officer thinks a U S  citizen should look like   Hutchinson wrote   This is contrary to the fundamentals of our Constitution  Hutchinson told reporters that concern wasn t enough to veto the bill since there aren t any sanctuary cities in Arkansas as defined by the bill  I don t see any change in policy going forward that would be disruptive to our society   he said The bill s opponents said the measure opens the state and cities to lawsuits and that officials need to reassure the immigrant community that they re welcome  Our immigrant community is afraid  and they are so confused  They don t even know if they can come out of their houses right now   Mireya Reith  founding executive director of Arkansas United  an immigrant advocacy group The majority Republican House earlier approved the bill by a 71 24 vote and sent it to Hutchinson s desk  Supporters have called it a preventive measure  This is not about racial profiling  This is about following the law   House Majority Leader Marcus Richmond  who voted for the bill  said on the floor Several Republican states have enacted measures prohibiting sanctuary policies  which have also been targeted by President Donald Trump Opponents have said the proposal would damage law enforcement s relationships with the immigrant community  Another opponent made a religious appeal to colleagues as she urged them to vote against the bill  We in this room are lawmakers and if we are lawmakers who claim Christ we can and should do the work of making just and fair laws that also embody the compassion of Christ and his command to welcome the stranger into our communities   Democratic Rep  Megan Godfrey said Under the bill  the state s attorney general would investigate complaints that a city had illegal sanctuary policies  If the city was found to be in violation  it would be ineligible for discretionary funds administered by the state Hutchinson announced his decision after signing two bills cheered by the immigrant community  including one that allows public colleges and universities to charge in state tuition to certain students currently paying higher  out of state rates  That includes students in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program  a program implemented during former President Barack Obama s administration allowing young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children to remain in the U S  Another bill Hutchinson signed would allow DACA recipients to get nursing licenses  We re a welcoming state and we want to be able to continue that   Hutchinson said at the bill signing ceremony   I don t want anything to overshadow the good news by these two bills and that we ll continue to be a nation of law  but also a nation of compassion      

SAN LORENZO DE EL ESCORIAL  Spain   The Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid seems peaceful enough on a sunny spring day but  with national elections just around the corner  its distinction as the burial place of Francisco Franco has turned it into a political battleground The outgoing Socialist government passed legislation to exhume Spain s former dictator and turn the site into a memorial to the victims of the brutal 1936 39 Civil War that marked the start of his fascist regime But newcomer Vox  which the April 28 ballot will usher in as the first far right party to sit in parliament since the 1970s  has challenged that decision Forty four years after his death  Franco s legacy remains a source of deep divisions in Spanish society It has also become an element of Vox s election campaign as the party seeks to grab votes from the traditional center right PP  adding a further complication to what promises to be one of Spain s most unpredictable and bitterly fought elections in decades  Well  I thought to myself  over my dead body   said Pilar Gutierrez   whose father was a minister under Franco   in reference to the exhumation  She heads a group campaigning to keep his body where it is and she has no doubt who she ll be voting for   Vox is the only party that can stop it  the exhumation    she said  speaking next to the mausoleum  hewn into the rock of the pine forested valley and dominated by a 152 metre  500 foot  cross  They have principles  Conventional parties don t have principles  Franco s regime killed or imprisoned tens of thousands to stamp out dissent  and up to 500 000 combatants and civilians died in the war between his forces and leftist Republicans On the other side of the political divide sits Francisco Mendieta  who exhumed his grandfather Timoteo from a mass Franco era grave in 2017 to give him a proper burial  He  Franco  is a man who has no reason to be there  in the Valley of the Fallen    Mendieta said    He  was a dictator who signed off on death sentences  In a democracy I see it as an aberration  Franco never showed any mercy  so if his exhumation upsets anybody  then they deserve it   he added While mostly focusing on specific Spanish issues Vox has  like similar parties in neighboring countries  also benefited from a public reaction against immigration that has seeped into European politics In a major poll published on Tuesday  it was seen winning up to 37 seats on April 28 The same poll also showed that the Socialists and their far left allies Podemos could win a majority  But that was a best case scenario and several other coalitions  either left  or right led  are also possible APPEALING TO THE LEFTThe Socialists have also leveraged Franco to appeal to their voter base They set the date for his exhumation last month after the election was announced  with Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo saying that  only the mortal remains of people who died as a result of the Spanish Civil War  would lie in the Valley of the Fallen Franco s descendents have also challenged the exhumation  approved by parliament in September  but the government has said his remains will be dug up on June 10 unless the Supreme Court blocks it  Both the PP and the centrist Ciudadanos abstained from the parliamentary vote  arguing the exhumation was not an urgent issue In public at least  Vox leader Santiago Abascal is still confident it will not take place   I am taking it for granted that it won t happen  it is just government propaganda   he has said Vox says it does not endorse Franco politically  though its election candidates include four former generals  two of whom signed a pro Franco petition last year Antonio Barroso  managing director of political consultancy Teneo  said that  while Vox s position on Spanish  cultural  issues like Franco and separatism   which it opposes   was clear  little was known about its stance on broader policy matters  It is impossible to know   how much support Vox will get in the election  said Barroso   One thing we do know is that right wing voters are more undecided  And they  Vox  are a new disruptive element    Writing by Axel Bugge  Additional reporting by Belen Carreno  Editing by Ingrid Melander and John Stonestreet  

WASHINGTON   Democrats in the House of Representatives are gearing up to issue subpoenas to try to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election and President Donald Trump s actions related to the inquiry The question is  how successful will they be Attorney General William Barr  who has broad authority under Justice Department regulations to decide how much of Mueller s report to release  sent lawmakers a four page letter on March 24 explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  and has promised to release the nearly 400 page report by the middle of this month  with some parts blacked out  or  redacted  That has not satisfied Democrats  who control the House  The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over the complete report  without redactions  as well as underlying evidence Here is an explanation of the legal hurdles Democrats must clear in their subpoena effort  important judicial precedents and Barr s rationale for keeping parts of the report confidential CAN CONGRESS SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH Yes  Committees of the House and Senate possess the power to issues subpoenas for documents held by the executive branch or other subjects in investigations  Under the U S  Constitution  Congress is a co equal branch of the federal government alongside the executive branch and judiciary If Barr refuses to comply with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to obtain the full report and underlying investigative material  the House could vote to hold him  in contempt  and turn to the courts to enforce the subpoena  Legal experts said that process could take years  Barr s  principal conclusions  letter said Mueller s inquiry did not establish that Trump s campaign team conspired with Russia  Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the Republican president committed obstruction of justice but also did not exonerate him  Barr subsequently concluded that Trump had not engaged in criminal obstruction The letter provided scant details of the findings  though Trump immediately claimed  complete and total exoneration   The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over Trump s presidency  House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into Trump  who is seeking re election in 2020 A situation analogous to the current subpoena fight unfolded during the presidency of Trump s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama  In 2012  the House  then controlled by Republicans  subpoenaed internal Justice Department documents related to a failed federal law enforcement operation to track illegal gun sales  dubbed  Fast and Furious   Obama s attorney general  Eric Holder  refused to comply  The House voted to hold him in contempt  marking the first time in U S  history that Congress took such action against a sitting member of a president s Cabinet The Justice Department later turned over thousands of pages of documents but the matter was not resolved until after Obama left office  with a settlement reached in 2018 WHY DID BARR NOT SIMPLY RELEASE THE WHOLE REPORT Barr told lawmakers in a March 29 letter that he was making  redactions that are required  before releasing the Mueller report  He cited four reasons for redactions  protecting secret grand jury proceedings  safeguarding intelligence gathering sources and methods  shielding material that could affect ongoing investigations  and protecting information that would unduly infringe on personal privacy and reputations Grand juries are groups of citizens who meet in secret and decide whether to authorize criminal indictments or demands for evidence sought by prosecutors  U S  law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret  though there are exceptions that let Congress  and even the general public  see it Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege  which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government WHAT LAWS AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS APPLY Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight Under U S  law  grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret  But if a grand jury matter involves  grave hostile acts of a foreign power  or other intelligence information  the information can be shared with appropriate government officials  The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr  Leon Jaworski  a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal  produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings H R  Haldeman  who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff  sought to block that information from Congress  citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr  The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington  which ruled 5 1 against Haldeman  The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation  and noted that the Democratic led House Judiciary committee had taken  elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials   The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office  Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment  If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material  a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play  Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski  citing executive privilege  The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court  saying the president s interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary s need for evidence   Reporting by Jan Wolfe  Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder

LONDON   With the clock ticking down toward last minute talks in Brussels on Britain s withdrawal from the European Union  Prime Minister Theresa May this weekend took another step away from hard line anti Europe lawmakers in her Conservative Party and sought to portray herself as committed to compromise talks that stalled last week But opposition Labour leaders on Sunday maintained that Mrs  May had not yet bent to any of their demands on the withdrawal  known as Brexit  And whatever overtures she makes to Labour  analysts said  she will struggle to guarantee that her successor as prime minister or a future Parliament will not rip up any compromise deal   a major sticking point in the cross party talks Mrs  May this week was expected to seek another delay to Britain s departure from European leaders who have expressed anger at her reluctance to change strategy only days before they were to meet to consider her request  She is also trying to pressure Labour lawmakers who may be searching for an excuse to back a deal to avoid being seen as thwarting Brexit Let me explain what s happening with Brexit pic twitter com gjGkvFk8fT  Theresa May   theresa may  April 7  2019 But while Mrs  May appeared to soften her tone in a statement late Saturday  any compromise talks face an extremely challenging road ahead  Presumably  there is some aspect of trying to convince the E U  of her good faith in those talks   said Tim Bale  a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London  But he said the European leaders  now schooled in the stubborn realities of domestic British politics  were likely to see that a compromise between Mrs  May and Labour s leader  Jeremy Corbyn  remained very far off ImageMrs  May in the House of Commons in London on Wednesday  On Saturday  she suggested a compromise could be worked out around a more limited goal  regaining control over immigration from continental Europe CreditMark Duffy UK Parliament The other game she s playing   Professor Bale said   is to try to prove to everybody outside the country and inside the country that she s genuinely tried  and therefore the only solution is to back her original deal  That would most likely take the form of government efforts to allow Parliament to vote on a series of different Brexit plans  from her deal to softer proposals preferred by Labour lawmakers  Parliament has tried that before  only to find itself unable to give any plan a majority of votes  But Mrs  May has suggested she may try to restart the process and put the government s weight behind whichever plan had the most support Mrs  May had vowed for months that she would back only a Brexit plan that eventually took Britain out of Europe s main economic structures  but on Saturday night she suggested that a compromise could be worked out around a more limited goal  regaining control over immigration from continental Europe That would open the door to a plan that met some of Labour s demands  namely for Britain to remain in a European customs union  Britain would not charge tariffs on European products under such a plan  preventing the country from striking trade deals with other countries but also preserving reasonably frictionless trade with the bloc  Britain s biggest trading partner But government officials said on Sunday that any suggestions of openness to a customs union compromise were speculative  And while Labour leaders stressed that talks had been cordial and that both sides remained interested in seeking a compromise  they said the prime minister had not yet budged on substantive pieces of her deal ImageTrucks at the Port of Dover in February  The prospect of high tariffs on European goods is one of the worries about a so called hard Brexit CreditToby Melville Reuters The sad thing is at the moment we haven t seen overall any real changes to the deal   Rebecca Long Bailey  a senior Labour official who has been involved in the negotiations  said in a televised interview   But we re hopeful that that will change in coming days  and we re willing to continue the talks  as we know the government are  Cross party talks between Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn stalled on Friday  and despite both sides saying they were willing to return to the table  neither the government nor Labour officials gave any indication on Sunday of a concrete schedule for further talks British news media reports said Mrs  May had argued in talks with Labour that her original plan  while it did not explicitly keep Britain in the customs union  achieved the same goal by other means  Her plan has been voted down three times in Parliament Mrs  May s statement on Saturday appeared to be an effort to signal new openness to those talks  suggesting that a deal could be worked out so long as it ended free movement  the right of Europeans to work and travel throughout the bloc  Labour also formally supports ending free movement  though it has lately also supported plans that would preserve it  The fact is that on Brexit there are areas where the two main parties agree   Mrs  May said   We both want to end free movement  we both want to leave with a good deal  and we both want to protect jobs  ImageDonald Tusk  the president of the European Council  center left  last month with Jean Claude Juncker  the president of the European Commission  Mr  Tusk supports a one year delay on Brexit CreditSean Gallup Getty ImagesMrs  May conceded that months of trying to convert hard line anti Europe Conservative lawmakers to her deal had failed Mr  Corbyn is facing a swell of pressure from within his party to reject any compromise that does not include giving Britons a second public vote on leaving Europe with a deal or canceling Brexit altogether That goes well beyond what Mrs  May said on Saturday that she was willing to consider What awaits Mrs  May if she agrees to a compromise deal is perhaps an even bigger tremor in the Conservative Party  Some Conservative lawmakers have threatened new attempts to oust her if she allows Brexit to be delayed long enough that Britons are asked to vote in European Parliament elections in May   Their options for how to remove her  though  are limited after an earlier attempt failed  Reports in the British news media on Sunday said that Mrs  May was offering legal guarantees to protect Labour lawmakers from their biggest fear   that a staunch pro Brexit successor to Mrs  May would rip up the parties  compromise plan and embark on a much more complete split with Europe  The move was described in The Sunday Times  a British newspaper  as the  Boris lock   a nod to Boris Johnson  the extreme anti Europe lawmaker who is angling to follow Mrs  May as prime minister and may be inclined to upend her plan  ImageA pro Brexit supporter in London last week  Mrs  May has conceded that efforts to convert hard line anti Europe Conservative lawmakers to her Brexit deal have failed CreditDylan Martinez ReutersBut the outlines of Britain s future relationship with Europe  including a possible customs union  would be made in a nonbinding part of Mrs  May s exit deal  making it difficult to protect from future attempts to derail it Professor Bale  of Queen Mary University  said that while she might be trying to provide cover for Labour lawmakers already inclined to back her deal  there was little of substance she could offer them  Any guarantees given to Labour on that score would not be worth the paper they re written on   he said In the backdrop of Mrs  May s efforts to temper her approach is a chorus of European leaders accusing Mrs  May of having so far failed to come up with a fresh plan to break months of Parliamentary stalemate French officials went so far as to say that if Mrs  May failed to outline a new plan with  credible political backing   they would treat it as a decision to greenlight a no deal exit  a possibility that experts say would be disastrous for Britain s economy European leaders will meet on Wednesday to consider Mrs  May s request for another delay to Brexit  The Irish prime minister  Leo Varadkar  whose country stands to be badly affected by a no deal exit  said he expected European leaders to postpone Brexit to avert that outcome  however angry they might be about Britain s conduct Donald Tusk  the president of the European Council  was pushing European leaders to offer Mrs  May a one year extension for Brexit while keeping open the possibility of an earlier withdrawal if Britain ratifies a deal

LONDON BUCHAREST   Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to move the  red lines  that have blocked a deal for Britain to leave the EU  opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Saturday  after May launched talks with him in a last ditch bid to save Brexit With Britain due to leave the bloc on April 12 and no sign of her minority government being able to pass a deal through parliament on its own  May turned to Labour Party leader Corbyn in recent days in the hope of securing a bi partisan agreement A deal with Corbyn could be May s last chance to deliver Brexit without either a long delay or leaving with no deal at all  But Corbyn said the prime minister had yet to show the flexibility that Labour would need to say yes  I m waiting to see the red lines move   he told the BBC   I hope we can reach a decision in parliament this week which will prevent a crashing out   No talks have been arranged yet between the two sides for this weekend  a Labour source told Reuters May s decision to seek an agreement with Corbyn was an astounding reversal after months of saying her plan for Brexit was the only possible course  It reflects weeks of high drama in parliament that saw May s deal rejected by a historic majority but no agreement emerge on an alternative plan While both major parties have said they are committed to carrying out the results of Britain s 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU  Labour has long demanded a softer break than May has been willing to consider In particular  Labour seeks a customs union with the EU after Britain leaves  which would cross one of the  red lines  May set out at the start of negotiations by preventing Britain from setting its own trade tariffs Many Labour lawmakers also want a second referendum on the terms of Brexit  which May says would be a fundamental threat to Britain s democracy after the vote to leave  Her decision to open talks with Labour infuriated Brexit supporters in May s Conservative party and divided her cabinet With time running out  May has asked EU leaders to postpone Britain s exit from the bloc until June 30  The EU  which gave her a two week extension the last time she asked  insists she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her thrice rejected divorce deal in the British parliament EU leaders have also indicated they would be more likely to offer a longer extension of up to a year  to avoid setting a firm new deadline in a few months  time that would cause yet another cliff edge crisis  HAMMOND OPTIMISTICFinance minister Philip Hammond told reporters in Bucharest on Saturday he was  optimistic  of reaching some form of agreement with Labour and that the government had no red lines in the talks Hammond said he expected more exchanges of documents on Saturday between the government and Labour in a bid to reach a deal  He also signaled optimism about next Wednesday s EU summit  saying most EU states agreed on a need to delay Brexit   Most of the colleagues that I am talking to accept we will need longer to complete this process   he said on the sidelines of a meeting of European Union finance ministers Britons voted in 2016 by a 52 to 48 percent margin for Brexit  The two main parties  parliament and the nation at large remain profoundly split over the terms for departure  or even over whether to leave at all A delay in Brexit of more than a few months would require Britain to participate in May 23 elections to the European parliament  It is a prospect May and many in her Conservative party are anxious to avoid  fearing a backlash from voters  Going to the EU elections for the Conservative Party  or indeed for the Labour Party  and telling our constituents why we haven t been able to deliver Brexit I think would be an existential threat   junior education minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC radio on Saturday   I would go further and say   it would be the suicide note of the Conservative Party    Editing by Peter Graff

Some Israeli commentators saw the right wing leader s pledge on Saturday  as Tuesday s national ballot approaches  as mainly a bid to siphon votes from ultranationalist rivals long advocating annexation But after years of resisting far right calls to formally put West Bank land captured in the 1967 Middle East war under permanent Israeli hold  Netanyahu could be counting on support for a dramatic shift from his close ally  U S  President Donald Trump  Who says that we won t do it  We are on the way and we are discussing it   Netanyahu  asked why he had not extended Israeli sovereignty to large West Bank settlements  told Israel s Channel 12 News In March  Trump broke with decades of international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  territory Israel captured from Syria  That followed his December 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel  and the U S  embassy s move to the holy city last May Asked in an interview on Friday on Israel s Channel 13 why he wasn t pressing Trump now to approve a West Bank settlement status change  Netanyahu replied   Wait until the next term  Taking Netanyahu at his word  Palestinians seeking statehood in the West Bank  Gaza and East Jerusalem called his settlement annexation remarks a violation of international law regarding occupied territory  His declaration is not just in the heat of     electioneering campaigns   said Hanan Ashrawi  a Palestine Liberation Organization official   This is the end of any chances of peace  A spokesman for Hamas  the Islamist militant group that runs the Gaza Strip  said  the response to  Israeli  crimes and foolishness will be met by popular resistance  armed resistance and by all our might  But Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett  head of the New Right party and author of a plan to annex parts of the West Bank  suggested Netanyahu was simply trawling for votes  For the past 10 years  Netanyahu has blocked applying Israeli law to even a centimeter of land   Bennett tweeted In the settlement of Karnei Shomron  spice shop owner Yehezkel Shaul said he believed Netanyahu s annexation pledge  calling him  the most reliable and honest person  At the local high school  Harel Levi  18  was not so sure  It s an election promise and he ll find some excuse later   Levi said HEATED ISSUESettlements  which Israel s B Tselem rights group said cover about 10 percent of the West Bank  are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart peace talks  frozen since 2014 After decades of settlement building  more than 400 000 Israelis now live in the territory  according to Israeli figures  The West Bank is home to some 2 9 million Palestinians  the Palestinian Statistics Bureau says A further 212 000 Israeli settlers live in East Jerusalem  according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs The Palestinians and many countries consider settlements to be illegal under the Geneva conventions  which ban settling on territory occupied in war  Israel disputes this  arguing that the status of the West Bank is still disputed  But unilateral annexation would be far harder to justify  even among allies Trump s predecessors as president publicly discouraged the expansion of settlements  arguing that they made it harder to negotiate a viable Palestinian state  viewed by administrations from both U S  parties as Israel s likeliest route to peace Palestinians argue that Washington did not do enough in practice to press for settlements to be curbed Most peace plan scenarios foresee Israel negotiating to keep some settlements in return for giving other land to the Palestinians  Annexation could take that off the table Netanyahu s annexation promise was met with scepticism by Shaqued Morag  director of Peace Now  an Israeli anti settlements group that closely monitors their expansion  So we must ask  why has Netanyahu said this now   Morag said  The answer  she told Reuters  was that Netanyahu feared for his political survival and  the times dictate he makes these extreme declarations that he has no intention to follow through on  Israel Katz  the acting foreign minister and a member of Netanyahu s Likud party  said its  great fear  was a split in the right wing vote that would result in a second place finish behind the centrist Blue and White faction Katz said Likud had to ensure it emerges as the biggest party  to put Netanyahu in the best position to get the nod from Israel s president to try to put together a governing coalition  No one party has ever won a ruling parliamentary majority on its own in an Israeli election   Additional reporting by Ron Bousso in Karnei Shomron  West Bank  Ali Sawafta in Ramallah  West Bank and Maayan Lubell and Stephen Farrell in

KIEV   The two remaining candidates in Ukraine s presidential race underwent televised drug and alcohol tests on Friday  capping a week in which they traded jibes in tit for tat social media videos and goaded each other to agree to a live policy debate  President Petro Poroshenko is facing Volodymyr Zelenskiy  a comedian with no political experience who plays a fictional president in a TV series  in a run off on April 21 after neither obtained a majority of votes in the first round last Sunday Zelenskiy won nearly twice as many votes as Poroshenko  but the incumbent is fighting back by painting his rival as a lightweight who would put Ukraine s security at risk The comedian had demanded they both be tested for drugs after he accepted Poroshenko s challenge for a policy debate in an apparent attempt to up the ante in their rivalry Early on Friday  Zelenskiy  41  was shown in a livestream on his Facebook page undergoing a blood test at a private laboratory   I took a blood test  They pumped all sorts of blood out of me  But thank God  I have enough of it  Young blood   he told reporters afterwards  An hour later  several television channels broadcast live footage of Poroshenko  53  having his blood drawn by a medic in red scrubs in a room inside Kiev s main football stadium Poroshenko  53  submitted blood  hair and urine samples to four different laboratories  said Volodymyr Yary  the chief doctor at a Kiev state hospital  He announced that the preliminary results from Poroshenko s test showed that  no psychoactive substance was found   Poroshenko goaded Zelenskiy for not accepting his invitation to have the tests done at the stadium alongside him  I m at the stadium today   Poroshenko told reporters   Volodymyr Oleksandrovych  as I understand it  was not  I came  but you didn t  No matter  I am sure that he will pick up the courage and come here and the debate will happen   On Wednesday  Zelenskiy accepted Poroshenko s challenge to take part in a policy debate but set his own conditions  including that it be held at the football stadium Poroshenko released another video overnight accusing Zelenskiy of setting many preconditions as a way of avoiding the debate altogether  Asked after Friday s drugs tests why he had not accepted Poroshenko s request to take the test at the stadium  Zelenskiy said   There is no laboratory there  It was a very strange invitation  He also said he would receive his results in three days  We will show you the results  Everything is done officially   he said  No date has been set for the debate between the two candidates  In the video posted online overnight  Poroshenko told his rival   Man up  come to the debates  We agreed on the stadium  I am waiting    Writing by Matthias Williams  Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky  

LONDON   British Prime Minister Theresa May has formally asked for another delay to the country s exit from the European Union  buying time to thrash out an alternative Brexit plan with her political opponents Britain is due to formally leave the EU on April 12  and the government does not yet have an agreed plan to avoid a disorderly exit  The clock is ticking for May to find a workable exit strategy that has majority support at home  and then persuade Brussels to give her more time to implement it  May has asked the EU to delay Brexit to June 30 Below is what the next few days may hold   Talks with the opposition Labour Party on agreeing a cross party plan for the type of Brexit the country wants are likely to continue over the coming days If they are unable to reach a deal  the government will have to arrange for a series of Brexit alternatives to be voted upon in parliament  The timing and format of these votes is not yet clear   MONDAYBritain s upper house of parliament  the House of Lords  is expected to approve a law which will force May to consult parliament on the length of delay she is seeking from the EU The law is unprecedented because it has been introduced against the government s wishes  overturning one of the fundamental principles of British politics   that the government has ultimate control over the process of making new laws The legislation is likely to encounter attempts to delay and block its approval by those who fear it is a route to stopping Brexit  and also sets a dangerous constitutional precedent   TUESDAYIf the law is formally approved on Monday  it will require May to present her plan for a Brexit delay to parliament  This creates another flashpoint amongst a deeply divided body of lawmakers that could undermine May s attempts to persuade Brussels she can pass a deal if they give her more time   WEDNESDAYMay is due to travel to Brussels for a special EU summit  where her request for a delay to June 30 will be discussed among EU leaders  The summit is expect to take place in the evening The EU has so far said they will only grant a delay if May presents them with a clear plan on how the country intends to move forward with Brexit Donald Tusk  president of the European Council  is likely to offer Britain a flexible extension of the date of its departure from the EU of up to one year  with the possibility of leaving sooner   THURSDAYMay would normally make a statement to parliament at the earliest opportunity following an EU council  meaning she could stand up and speak to lawmakers on Thursday to update them on how the meeting went   FRIDAYUnless a further delay is agreed  Britain is due to leave the EU at 2200 GMT    Reporting by William James  editing by Guy Faulconbridge  

WASHINGTON   The House on Thursday gave final passage to a bipartisan resolution forcing an end to United States military involvement in Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen  sending President Trump a pointed rebuke over his continued defense of the kingdom after the killing of a dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi The 247 to 176 vote  with 16 Republicans joining all House Democrats  invoked the rarely used War Powers Act to curb the president s executive power to wage war without congressional approval  It most likely sets up the second veto of Mr  Trump s presidency  this time to publicly defend a four year conflict that the United Nations has deemed the world s worst humanitarian crisis  with thousands of civilians killed and millions suffering from  famine The Senate passed the resolution in March  54 to 46  The vote in the Senate and in the House makes it clear that the United States will not continue to follow the despotic  anti democratic leadership coming out of Saudi Arabia   said Senator Bernie Sanders  independent of Vermont and one of the lead sponsors of the resolution   The United States should not be led into a war by a despotic  undemocratic  murderous regime  Supporters of the Yemen resolution have faced a grueling road in recent months to get the legislation onto the president s desk  The Senate   led by the resolution s authors  Senators Mike Lee  Republican of Utah  Christopher S  Murphy  Democrat of Connecticut  and Mr  Sanders   first passed the measure 56 to 41 in December  but Paul D  Ryan  the House speaker at the time  refused to take it up His successor  Speaker Nancy Pelosi  did  and the House easily passed it in February  But House Democrats inadvertently derailed the process by supporting a surprise procedural motion offered by Republicans to declare the chamber s opposition to anti Semitism  By attaching an unrelated amendment to the Yemen resolution  the House ended its  privileged  status  which would have forced the Senate to quickly take it up and send it to Mr  Trump The Senate then had to start from scratch The vote on Thursday amounted to a do over  Republicans again tried to derail the resolution with a last minute procedural maneuver to attach an amendment to condemn the movement to boycott  divest from and sanction Israel  a provision that put Democrats in a difficult position But this time  intent on ensuring the legislation would not be knocked off course again  Democratic leaders rallied their rank and file to oppose Republicans  efforts  Representative Ted Deutch  a Florida Democrat and one of the strongest pro Israel voices in the House  stood to condemn the Republican maneuver  This is about politics   he said   This is about trying to drive a wedge into this caucus where it does not belong  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the No  2 Democrat  accused Republicans of  using Israel as a partisan cudgel  and urged his colleagues to oppose the measure  Its intention is not to unite but to divide  Its intention is not to support our ally but to kill this bill through a cynical and dishonest tactic   Mr  Hoyer said as Democrats stood and applauded   Let s stop playing games with this very important and serious issue  To persuade the president to support the legislation  a bipartisan group of lawmakers   including Representatives Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and one of the lead sponsors of the resolution  and Matt Gaetz  Republican of Florida and one of the president s staunchest allies   requested to meet with the president  appealing to his desire  to achieve our shared interest in responsibly drawing down needless conflicts throughout the world  The House resolution employs the 1973 War Powers Act  which gave Congress the ability to compel the removal of military forces absent a formal declaration of war  Those powers  created in the wake of the Vietnam War  have almost never been used  as lawmakers have demurred from intervening in politically sensitive matters of war  peace and support for the troops  When we started talking with folks about doing this  they basically laughed it off   said Stephen Miles  the director of Win Without War  an advocacy coalition that lobbied for the resolution   They said it wouldn t happen  Congress doesn t ever invoke the War Powers Act  It was a really long arduous process of education  In its justification for opposing the resolution  the White House argued that the use of the act  is flawed  because the Pentagon has provided  limited support to member countries of the Saudi led coalition  in Yemen  That argument may have been more resonant years ago   repeated bipartisan attempts in 2016 to rebuke the American role in the Saudi led intervention stalled in both the House and the Senate  beginning with efforts to block the sale of munitions to the Saudis But after the killing of Mr  Khashoggi  a Virginia based columnist for The Washington Post  lawmakers on both sides of the aisle  livid at the administration s equivocal response  signaled a new willingness to reconsider the relationship with Riyadh  Lawmakers have grown increasingly vocal about reasserting their oversight on foreign policy  We are clawing back our constitutional responsibilities   said Representative Jim McGovern  Democrat of Massachusetts And the public has become more aware of the crisis in Yemen  where an estimated 80 percent of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance or protection and millions are without access to clean drinking water  according to the United Nations

BUCHAREST LONDON   The British government is optimistic about reaching some form of deal with the opposition Labour Party to end a deadlock on Brexit as work on a compromise continues  Britain s finance minister Philip Hammond said on Saturday  But Labour said the governing Conservatives needed to be more flexible and had not shown any movement on a political declaration of intent on the future relationship between London and Brussels once Britain has left the European Union No talks have been arranged yet between the two sides for this weekend  a Labour source told Reuters  Prime Minister Theresa May has asked EU leaders to postpone Britain s exit from the bloc next Friday until June 30 but the EU insists she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her thrice rejected divorce deal in the British parliament  It is the latest twist in a saga which leaves Britain  the world s fifth biggest economy  struggling to find a way to honor a 2016 referendum vote to take the country out of the globe s largest trading bloc  Hammond  however  told reporters on Saturday he was upbeat about breaking the impasse   I am optimistic that we will reach some form of agreement with Labour   he said on the sidelines of a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Bucharest  adding he expected the exchange of  some more texts today  The government had no red lines in the talks  he said  But Labour s home affairs spokeswoman said the Conservatives needed to show a willingness to compromise on Prime Minister Theresa May s red lines  which include no more membership of the EU s customs union or single market  My understanding is that there has been no movement from the government on the actual concept of the political declaration and that is key   Diane Abbott told BBC radio on Saturday   The government perhaps has to show a little more flexibility than it seems to have done so far  Hammond  who is one of the most pro European members of May s government  also signaled optimism about next Wednesday s EU summit on Brexit  saying most EU states agreed there was a need to delay Brexit   Most of the colleagues that I am talking to accept we will need longer to complete this process  Britons voted in 2016 by a 52 to 48 percent margin for Brexit and the two main parties  parliament and the nation at large remain profoundly split over the terms for departure as well as over whether to leave at all Many within the Conservative Party are increasingly worried that any delay obliging Britain to again take part in elections for the European parliament on May 23 26 would be deeply divisive  Going to the EU elections for the Conservative Party  or indeed for the Labour Party  and telling our constituents why we haven t been able to deliver Brexit I think would be an existential threat   junior education minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC radio on Saturday   I would go further and say   it would be the suicide note of the Conservative Party    Reporting by Francesco Guarascio  Editing by Mark Heinrich  

MUMBAI BENGALURU   Early this year  a dozen of Bollywood s biggest names took a private jet from India s film capital of Mumbai to New Delhi for a private audience with Prime Minister Narendra Modi Subsequently  actor Ranveer Singh  who has nearly 22 million followers on Instagram  posted a smiling picture of himself hugging Modi  with a caption expressing his  joy  at the encounter  drawing more than 3 million likes  Bollywood is playing a lead role in Modi s campaign for a second term  endorsing him on screen and off  in both subtle and obvious ways  in a marked shift from the more transactional relationship Indian film stars previously had with politicians Modi asked filmmakers and stars to  talk about patriotism  and Indian culture and values   in their films  said film producer Mahaveer Jain  who organized the Jan  10 meeting  He recognizes the soft power of Bollywood  and the impact it can have  As people younger than 35 form nearly two thirds of India s population of about 1 3 billion  with more than 15 million voting for the first time in general elections that begin on Thursday  approval from the leading stars could be key Modi swept to victory in 2014  but this time  rural distress and concern about a lack of jobs threaten to make it tougher for his party to triumph in elections spread over a month  with counting set for May 23 In recent months  Modi has met privately at least four times with several of Bollywood s biggest personalities  most of whom have posted selfies with him on social media  accompanied by glowing captions  Together we would love to inspire and ignite positive changes toward a transformative India   read a caption on director Karan Johar s Instagram post of a star studded group selfie with Modi that won more than 1 million likes  He thanked the government for cutting taxes on movie tickets   There is perhaps no politician in the history of Indian politics who has been able to create a celebrity outreach program like Narendra Modi   said Joyojeet Pal  a University of Michigan professor who has analyzed Modi s social media feed since 2009 A BJP spokesman did not respond to Reuters  repeated requests for comment Bollywood s move to largely embrace Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party contrasts with the United States  where Hollywood has typically taken up liberal left causes and backed the Democrats  more lately lampooning President Donald Trump and the right wing Republican Party BIGGEST HITBeyond social media  Bollywood has released three movies with lead actors in prime ministerial roles this year  One   Uri   The Surgical Strike  proved the year s biggest hit  pulling in a gross of more than  35 million at the Indian box office In speeches  Modi and his ministers have repeatedly evoked the film  which indirectly lauds the prime minister and his national security adviser for planning a 2016 attack that India says hit terrorist camps in Pakistan administered Kashmir But it has no political leanings  says director Aditya Dhar   My film is a dedication to the Indian Army   Dhar told Reuters in January https   in reuters com article interview aditya dhar uri qa aditya dhar on uri the surgical strike idINKCN1P50J3   It is about the sacrifices they make for their countrymen   The film released the same weekend as  The Accidental Prime Minister   based on an unauthorized biography of Modi s predecessor  Manmohan Singh That film  which did not succeed at the box office  projected open contempt for Singh  painting him as ineffective and forced to bow to the whims of the Gandhi family  which heads India s main opposition party  the Indian National Congress  You can clearly say some of these films are propaganda films   said influential film critic Rajeev Masand   There is no confusion on the agenda there   The election panel has blocked the release of a biopic titled  PM Narendra Modi   initially set for the first voting day on Thursday  as a violation of election rules  A web series on Modi s life continues to be streamed online  HUGE INFLUENCER Not everyone is jumping on the Modi bandwagon More than 800 theater artists  actors and film makers urged voters not to back Modi last week  but barring a few  most were independent and documentary film makers lacking the reach of Bollywood s A listers  The man portrayed as the savior of the nation five years ago has destroyed the livelihoods of millions through his policies   they said on the website Artists Unite  We appeal to our fellow citizens to vote for love and compassion  for equality and social justice  and to defeat the forces of darkness and barbarism   The main opposition Congress party has also sought to woo Bollywood and a separate source said filmmakers were invited to meet its leader  Rahul Gandhi The agenda for that meeting is unknown and Gandhi s office did not respond to calls seeking comment  My Name is RaGa   a less publicized movie about Gandhi  is also set for release this month  Traditionally  Bollywood stars functioned as crowd pullers at the odd election rally  often for remuneration  Though many later took the plunge into politics  no political party has deployed them as subliminal brand ambassadors before  This is alarming because Indian cinema is a huge influencer   said Sandeep Chatterjee  professor of direction and screenplay at the Film and Television Institute of India  One can say people have a right to decide what they watch  but you cannot discount the influence Indian cinema has on people at large  especially young people

LONDON   Sterling will rally 3 percent if the Brexit gridlock is resolved and Britain looks likely to leave the European Union with a deal but the currency will tumble 5 percent if negotiations fail  a Reuters poll found The pound tanked after the June 2016 referendum result    as predicted by Reuters polls beforehand    and was trading at around  1 31 on Thursday  far weaker than it was ahead of the vote Since the decision to leave  the pound has gyrated wildly on any Brexit news and largely shrugged off economic data  including recent private surveys which suggested Britain s economy is likely to shrink in coming months On Tuesday  British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would seek another Brexit delay to agree an EU divorce deal with the opposition Labour Party leader  a last ditch gambit to break an impasse over Britain s departure Nearly three years since the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU in a shock referendum result  it is still unclear how  when or even if it will ever quit the European club it joined in 1973 May secured a Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in November but has failed to get the support of British lawmakers  leaving the country s road out of the EU unclear If that road is smooth and Britain leaves with a deal  sterling will gain around 3 percent  the April 1 4 poll predicted  If the road is blocked and no deal is made  the pound will fall 5 percent  Looser fiscal policy and a Brexit deal could lead to higher interest rates and push up the pound   said Thomas Pugh at Capital Economics Another option is that Britain asks for a long delay to Brexit which would prolong the uncertainty  But if it looks like the road out will be extended  the pound will edge up around 1 75 percent  according to the poll  Political clouds could be darkening the skies over the outlook for GBP for a long time yet   said Jane Foley at Rabobank  Foley was the most accurate forecaster for major currencies in Reuters polls last year  The wider poll of nearly 70 foreign exchange strategists said the pound would be trading at  1 32 in a month   1 35 in six months and have strengthened to  1 38 in a year  indicating respondents do not expect a disorderly Brexit But highlighting the uncertainty  the 12 month forecast range was wide  going from  1 27 to  1 56 A Reuters poll of economists last month found the vast majority of them saying the two sides would settle eventually on a free trade deal  as they have in all Reuters polls since late 2016 That poll also predicted the Bank of England would raise borrowing costs towards the end of this year and then again in the latter half of 2020 In contrast  the European Central Bank will not be raising interest rates until at least July next year  another Reuters poll predicted  but that differential won t give the pound any support against the common currency Across all four touch points in the forecast horizon    one  three  six and 12 months    one euro was predicted to be worth 85 0 pence  It was valued at around 85 3p on Thursday   Reporting by Jonathan Cable  Polling by Indradip Ghosh and Mumal Rathore  Editing by Catherine Evans  

WASHINGTON   U S  congressional Democrats on Wednesday authorized a powerful committee chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 election  moving closer to a legal clash with President Donald Trump s administration The Democratic led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to enable its chairman  Jerrold Nadler  to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller s unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides including political strategist Steve Bannon Nadler has not yet exercised that authority  with the timing of any such move uncertain  The committee vote was 24 17 along party lines  with Democrats in favor and Trump s fellow Republicans opposed Attorney General William Barr  a Trump appointee  issued a four page summary of Mueller s main conclusions last month including that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400 page report by mid April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence gathering sources and methods In addition to Bannon  the committee authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn  former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson They are among 81 people  agencies and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates Nadler s panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would ignore a Democratic demand turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline  Democrats have expressed concern Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign Nadler said he would work with Barr  for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials  and will go to court to get permission to obtain the grand jury material  But if that doesn t work out in a very short order  we will issue the subpoenas   Nadler added       The committee must see everything   The potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government s third branch   the judiciary Representative Doug Collins  the committee s top Republican  said Democrats are  desperate for dirt on this president   This is reckless  It s irresponsible  And it s disingenuous   Collins said   It s also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing  making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy  It was not clear how likely the Justice Department would be to hand over subpoenaed documents  It could ignore a subpoena  running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress  and prepare for a potentially lengthy court battle INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACTIONIn another development  the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic led House Intelligence Committee  led by Trump critic Adam Schiff  is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump s inaugural committee Citing people familiar with the request  the Journal reported that the effort signaled that Congress is expanding its probe of how the inaugural committee raised and spent more than  100 million  The report could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters Barr s March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice  Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller s inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump  Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice  Moscow denied election interference  Mueller and U S  intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U S  Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report  If the department still refuses  then it should be up to a judge   not the president or his political appointee   to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record   Nadler said  Trump ally Lindsey Graham  Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  wrote on Twitter that the House panel s demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was  dangerous and ridiculous  The Justice Department declined comment  Priebus declined to comment  A lawyer for Priebus  Bannon and McGahn  as well as a Bannon spokeswoman  did not immediately respond to requests for comment Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries  Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge s permission to get access to Mueller s grand jury material  which is protected under federal law  Nadler said Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far  Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well  noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report s release to Congress   Reporting by David Morgan  Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld  Sarah N  Lynch  Steve Holland and Mark Hosenball  Editing by

MINNEAPOLIS   This Final Four is the fifth anniversary of one of the most effective  if inadvertent  instances of athlete activism in college sports This was when the Connecticut star Shabazz Napier  speaking to the news media shortly before the 2014 national championship game  said that he sometimes did not have enough to eat  There are hungry nights that I go to bed and I m starving   he said Within weeks  the N C A A  s board of directors for Division I voted to lift restrictions on how much teams could feed their players  No longer would there be bizarre hairsplitting over what was and was not a meal  notoriously  serving peanuts did not count  while serving peanut butter did   Now teams can and do routinely give athletes feasts This common sense reform had been in the works and probably would have occurred eventually  But the stark comments by a high profile player at the N C A A  s signature event ensured the nearly immediate change and boatloads of attention on the N C A A  s power over college athletes It is fruitful to remember the efficacy of Napier s comments  because we are at a moment when it appears that further reform to college sports  much maligned policy of amateurism will come only from within  The players will have the foremost and maybe even exclusive power to agitate for change What would have happened if Zion Williamson had said  after his Nike shoe exploded  jeopardizing his career  that enough was enough  that he no longer would wear a shoe for nothing while his coach was at least indirectly paid millions by Nike  And that no other player should put up with this hypocrisy  either  The power is with labor and the players   said Kain Colter  the former Northwestern quarterback who led a unionization drive among his teammates several years ago This was most obviously displayed in 2015  when Missouri football players threatened to sit out a game unless the university president stepped down or was fired  He stepped down  That the boycott concerned the campus s racial climate rather than the players  compensation ought not conceal the reality of what happened  The players   unpaid  un unionized   flexed their muscles  and the system gave in Vesting power in athletes to reform sports is not historically aberrant  From Jackie Robinson withstanding taunts  threats and worse to break Major League Baseball s color line  to baseball players striking in the 1970s and  80s to gain and keep full fledged free agency  to the track standout Edwin Moses devising benefits for Olympic athletes  athletes have often been the ones bringing about change  Their leverage is unmatched  They are the ones the fans pay to see  and therefore the ones who ultimately have the power over profit And they are the only ones with a steady interest in  well  their own interest Consider what else has happened since Napier s comments Colter s unionization effort  which a National Labor Relations Board regional director endorsed weeks before Napier s Final Four  was squashed by the overall board The antitrust lawsuit that might have allowed players to profit off the use of their likenesses in video games and other media ended in an extremely limited victory for players Last month  a second antitrust suit  which sought to explode the N C A A  s ban on compensation  concluded at the district court level with a technical victory for players that looked as much like a victory for the establishment  A federal judge ruled that the N C A A  could continue to limit payments to players that were not directly related to education  The courts are not a forum where you re going to get relief   said Don Yee  a sports lawyer and players rights advocate ImageBefore helping UConn beat Kentucky in the championship game in 2014  Shabazz Napier said that he sometimes didn t have enough to eat  That led the N C A A  to lift restrictions on how much teams could feed players CreditRonald Martinez Getty ImagesFor Yee  who also happens to be Tom Brady s agent  the solution is  private entrepreneurialism   He is planning a small professional football league that would field players not yet eligible for the N F L   which generally requires players to be three years removed from high school   It would be developmental  like college football  but unlike college football  average pay would be  50 000 A planned summer basketball league  the Historical Basketball League  would pay scholarships for its college level players while enabling them to sell their names  images and likenesses to sponsors  The N B A  s development league plans to offer higher salaries  The probable dissolution of the one and done rule in the next few years will again permit the most talented high school graduates to jump straight to the N B A  instead of having to spend at least a year in college A few states  notably North Carolina and California  have bills floating around that would allow athletes to be paid if  say  a video game uses their names and likenesses All these efforts are well intentioned  But if past is prologue  the system will not be successfully reformed in such patchwork fashion Nor is the college sports establishment likely to change its mind of its own volition At a news conference in Minneapolis last week  the N C A A  president  Mark Emmert  said that he had sought to increase athlete participation in college sports  governance  I m a lifelong academic   he said   I grew up with that tradition  and I never worked at a school that didn t have students on their board  and they were full voting board members  They voted on my contract  and I think that s just perfectly appropriate  There are athletes serving on several important councils  but there is not one on the N C A A  Board of Governors  No athletes vote on Emmert s contract  which was extended late last year through 2023 Tim Nevius  a onetime N C A A  investigator whose experiences led him to turn on the system  believes the answer lies with player activism  Last month  he announced a new organization  the College Athlete Advocacy Initiative  that plans to pair his business representing athletes before the N C A A  with trying to advocate for broader reform in coordination with players He acknowledged in an interview the challenges  including the relatively short time spans that college athletes actually are college athletes  as well as their current lack of formal bargaining power  But he insisted that player action was the surest avenue to change  There are powers here that the athletes have   he said   and we have to simply have them realize it and help them take the power into their own hands  Ros Gold Unwude  a Turner Sports analyst and former Stanford basketball player  said last month that she expected to hear more from college athletes about how they felt about their position in the pecking order  That s the way our culture is  where we all are telling our stories on social media platforms   she said  If you re really struggling or hungry   she added   that experience will come out  Apathy will come out as well  though  Beyond the structural obstacles to athletes deciding the system is unfair and determining to act to change it  a player could validly decide that he is happy receiving what he currently gets Napier  who is now a reserve on the Nets and who through a spokesman declined to comment for this article  said more during his  hungry nights  speech heard  round the world  even though it received less publicity He noted that there were other wrongs  Players  jerseys were sold to fans  and the players did not receive a cut  More basically  he said  the players were not paid It was  he suggested  wrong  Probably  Something can change  something should change   Napier said five years ago   But if it doesn t  at the end of the day  we ve been doing this for so long   

JERUSALEM   Israelis vote in a national election on Tuesday  Polls show that veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  seeking a fifth term in office  is best positioned in the tight race to win and head the next government  His decade long dominance of Israeli politics has been the biggest issue of the campaign  WHAT ARE THE POLLS SHOWING Recent polls have shown that the right wing bloc led by Netanyahu will win a majority in the Knesset  But they also show a new centrist party headed by a popular former general emerging as the largest faction in parliament  Surveys detect many undecided voters who could swing the election either way HOW DOES THE ISRAELI ELECTION WORK The 120 Knesset seats are allocated by proportional representation to party lists  In order to win seats in the Knesset  a party must pass a threshold of at least 3 25 percent of the national vote  equivalent to 4 seats  No single party has ever won an outright majority in the Knesset  making coalition governments the norm  After the election and consultations with party leaders  Israel s president ask the candidate whom he judges has the best chance of forming a coalition to try and put together a government  That is usually the person heading the largest party  but not necessarily  That candidate has 28 days to form a government  with a possible 14 day extension  If he or she fails then the president tasks a different candidate with the job In the 2019 election  about 5 8 million Israelis are eligible to vote  according to the Israeli statistics bureau  WHAT PARTIES HAVE BEST CHANCE OF

occupied West Bank if he wins another term  In the run up to the vote  Likud has rallied around Netanyahu  who is facing possible indictment in three corruption cases in which he has denied any wrongdoing  BLUE AND WHITE  HEADED BY FORMER MILITARY CHIEF BENNY GANTZGantz has emerged as a serious rival to Netanyahu  His party is forecast to win 31 seats  Gantz is a popular former armed forces

party  Gantz has called for pursuing peace with the Palestinians while maintaining Israeli security interests  He has signaled he would make territorial concessions toward the Palestinians but has also sidestepped the question of Palestinian statehood  Gantz has vowed clean government  while at the same time giving mixed signals over whether he would join a Netanyahu led coalition  LABOUR  HEADED BY AVI GABBAYOpinion polls have shown left wing Labour  which governed Israel for decades  plummeting to 10 seats in the election from its current 18  Its campaign has stressed social and

idea of a Palestinian state and stresses Israel s biblical and religious connections to land Palestinians seek for a state  The union includes Jewish Power  an ultra nationalist religious party that

counted on the support of immigrants from the former Soviet Union  has been teetering on the electoral threshold in recent polls  Moldovan born Lieberman is a former defense minister whose policies include trading Arab towns in Israel to any future Palestinian state for territory in the West Bank where Jewish settlements have been built  He also wants to make loyalty to the state a condition for citizenship  UNITED TORAH JUDAISM  UTJ   HEADED BY DEPUTY HEALTH MINISTER YAKOV LITZMAN UTJ represents ultra Orthodox Jews  or Haredim  of European origin and is seen winning about 6 7 seats in the

FRANKFURT   Europe is facing yet another make or break week  With an emergency EU summit over Brexit and an ECB policy meeting on the agenda  officials will be under pressure to take decisive steps to soothe concerns ahead of a set piece gathering of the global financial elite in Washington  But the temptation will be great to stick with the bloc s rich tradition of just kicking the can down the road  The deadline for Britain to leave the EU  seen as set in stone just days ago  is again in flux as both sides are openly discussing an extension  even if that means Britain must cross another red line by participating in May s European elections The apparent softening of British Prime Minister Theresa May s position suggests the end game is far from imminent Another EU summit muddle would  however  keep economic uncertainty at fever pitch  weighing on sentiment that is already dragging down growth across Europe and raising recession fears  A long extension   and taking part in EU elections   also carries the risk of a Conservative Party mutiny  which could force an already weakened May out  Such leadership changes are always unpredictable and  in this instance could be brutal  with more centrist elements of the party struggling against a membership whose views on Brexit are increasingly hardline   JP Morgan economic Malcolm Barr said  But blurring the red lines suggests Britain is keen to avoid the most damaging of all outcomes   a hard Brexit For the EU  a longer extension also carries the benefit that Britain s departure would not occur during the crucial month of the election campaign  which will determine who leads both the EU and  after Mario Draghi s term ends this autumn  the European Central Bank Taking a hard Brexit off the table would also allow British officials to put on a brave face at the IMF s spring meeting in Washington starting on Friday  letting the gathering focus on broader trade issues NARROW PATHStill  the delay solves little in itself  Any concession by May to win votes on a deal from Britain s opposition Labour Party is likely to lose her Conservative MPs That suggests the path to any majority outcome is quite narrow  keeping the chance of an eventual no deal Brexit uncomfortably high   Despite the switch to a cross party approach  the risk of an election remains high because the path toward a successful  meaningful vote  is treacherous  due to the deep divisionswithin both parties   Andrew Goodwin at Oxford Economics said  The cost of the Brexit saga is already tangible for the EU Global trade tensions are weighing even more heavily  and the steady flow of bad news is keeping investment and business sentiment in a negative spiral  depressing growth for the third straight quarter The ECB  the bloc s first port of call in case of growth weakness  has already eased policy  exhausting much of its firepower during years of crisis fighting  More generally  central banks lack potent tools to offset imported economic troubles Having already delayed a rate hike  the ECB will sit on the sidelines for now  while economists expect more easing later in the year  Since the main refinancing rate is already at zero percent  such easing is likely to amount to further unconventional measures   Commerzbank said  We therefore expect the ECB to decide in the autumn    to promise unchanged key rates    until the end of 2020   it added   Reporting by Balazs Koranyi  editing by John Stonestreet  

In the current election cycle  bets on moderation have few takers  Leading Democratic candidates are supporting bold progressive policy initiatives that are supported by liberal primary voters but may prove to be a tough sell to the general electorate  President Trump and his Republican allies will certainly try to use these initiatives against their Democratic rivals  They have in fact already begun to do so A number of Democratic presidential candidates  for example  are calling for the elimination of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and they have declared themselves in favor of such multibillion dollar programs as Medicare for all and a Green New Deal  Growing numbers are supportive of reparations to compensate black Americans for the costs of slavery and segregation Why are these candidates willing to buck political tradition and heighten the risk of defeat on Nov  3  2020 Here is one answer  from Julie Wronski  a political scientist at the University of Mississippi Democrats contain much more heterogeneity across social groups than the more homogeneous white  Christian conservative Republican Party  To the extent the Democratic Party needs to entice and accommodate African Americans  Latinos  environmentalists  etc  as voters  their candidates need to start embracing boutique policies for these groups that may not align with a general election  median voter  model of espousing moderate national policies The issue of reparations illuminates the heterogeneity of the Democratic electorate  There are two surveys on reparations  a May 2016 Marist Poll and a July 2018 poll by the liberal group Data for Progress  Both produced similar results The Marist survey found overwhelming opposition among whites in response to the question As a way to make up for the harm caused by slavery and other forms of racial discrimination  do you think the United States should or should not pay reparations  that is  should or should not pay money to African Americans who are descendants of slaves Whites were opposed 81 15  Latinos were split  with 46 percent in support and 47 percent opposed  African American voters support reparations  58 35 The Data for Progress survey found sharp partisan divisions on the issue of reparations  Democrats supported reparations across the board  whites 37 8 to 30 5 percent  blacks 58 5 to 15 0 percent  Hispanics  49 9 to 18 3 percent  Independents were opposed  41 0 to 22 8 percent  Republicans were decisively in opposition  77 1 to 8 9 percent Among all voters  opposition to reparations was nearly twice as large as support  47 1 to 26 4 percent For the Democrats running for president  African American backing is crucial both in the primaries and in the general election Nationally  black voters in 2016 cast about one of every four ballots in Democratic primaries  In four states  African Americans cast the majority of votes  71 percent in Mississippi  61 percent in South Carolina  54 percent in Alabama and 51 percent in Georgia ImageSenator Elizabeth Warren posing for photos with diners at The Senator s Place  a restaurant in Cleveland  Miss  CreditAndrea Morales for The New York TimesLet s look at another progressive initiative  In August 2018  AP NORC asked voters if they support or oppose  abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement  known as ICE   41 percent opposed abolition and 24 percent supported it Medicare for all and the Green New Deal pose a subtler dilemma for Democratic candidates  In the abstract  voters are supportive  the problems arise when the same voters are told key details  including costs The best example of this is Medicare for all  In March  a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that a majority supported  a national health plan or Medicare for all plan   56 39  but support vacillates in both directions depending on how the program is portrayed If  for example  Democrats posit that Medicare for all would eliminate health care premiums and reduce out of pocket costs  support rises to 67 percent with 30 percent opposed Conversely  if Republicans succeed in portraying the program as leading to delays in getting medical treatment  or to the elimination of current private coverage  or to higher taxes  support collapses to the mid 20s and mid 30s  with opposition shooting up to the 60 to 70 percent range Bold progressive stands may be risky in general elections  but recent research suggests that policy radicalism pays off in primaries In a forthcoming paper   Policy Over Party  Comparing the effects of candidate ideology and party on affective polarization   Yphtach Lelkes  a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania  reports that voters in primary elections prefer candidates who are willing to take more extreme positions  Partisans are reacting most favorably toward ideological extremists   Lelkes wrote in an email In fact  moderates are punished for the policies  Extreme politicians in the vein of Mike Lee and Elizabeth Warren  are rated roughly 20 25 points higher  on a 0 to 100 scale  by party identifiers than ideologically moderate politicians in the vein of Susan Collins and Joe Manchin  These effects are even larger among ideologically extreme respondents   the kind that vote in primary elections Lelkes conducted experiments that asked participants to rate a number of hypothetical candidates  including a moderate Democrat  an  ideologically extreme  liberal Democrat  a moderate Republican and an  ideologically extreme  conservative Republican He found that the most ideologically committed voters   who are disproportionately represented in primaries and caucuses   strongly preferred more extreme candidates The impact of policy cues was particularly strong among respondents who themselves held strong policy positions  If a respondent was told that candidate held extreme in party views  ideologically extreme respondents registered feeling thermometer ratings 35 89 points warmer than ideologically neutral respondents Lelkes s conclusion If we are to decrease affective polarization in the United States  we need politicians that are politically moderate  Unfortunately  voters prefer politicians of their own party that are politically extreme  This incentivizes extreme political candidates  which will only exacerbate current tensions There are dangers for both parties is these trends  Lelkes argues  citing a 2015 study of House elections   What Happens When Extremists Win Primaries   by Andrew Hall  a political scientist at Stanford Hall found that when a more extreme candidate beats a moderate in the primarythe party s general election vote share decreases on average by approximately 9 13 percentage points  and the probability that the party wins the seat decreases by 35 54 percentage points Gallup data shows the steady ascendance within Democratic ranks of self identified ideological liberals and a parallel decline in the share of Democrats who say they are moderate or conservative  From 1973 to 2018  as I have noted before  the percentage of Democrats who say they are liberal has grown from 25 to 51 percent  while the share of moderates has fallen from 48 to 31 percent  and the share of conservatives has dropped from 25 to 13 percent A 2014 Pew study showed a steady process of ideological consolidation among both Republicans and Democrats since 1994  although consolidation accelerated most rapidly on the left The share of Democrats who are liberal on all or most value dimensions has nearly doubled from just 30 percent in 1994 to 56 percent today  The share who are consistently liberal has quadrupled from just 5 percent to 23 percent over the past 20 years In a reflection of their importance in primaries   consistently liberal  Democrats turned out in elections at a 70 percent rate  compared with 47 percent for  mostly liberal  Democrats and 41 percent for Democrats with  mixed views   according to Pew data These and other trends  according to Lee Drutman  a senior fellow at the liberal New America think tank  represent the changing the mind set of the Democratic electorate  In an email  Drutman wrote Two related dynamics are operative  One  Democratic voters have moved to the left in response to Trump  and are eager for policies that signal transformative change  not just incrementalism  There is no return to normalcy  because the past is now seen as more flawed This dynamic has intensified because the most engaged Democrats  Drutman writes have bought into an argument that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 because she was too incrementalist  and had she gone a little bolder and promised something more exciting than her competence and experience  she might have won The second dynamic  Drutman continued  is thatin a crowded field  candidates are seeking to distinguish themselves with grass roots energy  A very effective way of generating grass roots energy is attaching to transformative changes these policies signal  Incrementalism and moderation doesn t generate much excitement among the activists or in coverage from journalists who are responsible for driving candidate buzz in these early stages In a similar analysis  John Sides  a political scientist at George Washington University  argues thatOn race and immigration in particular  I think Trump is pushing Democrats to the left  To be clear  Hillary Clinton was already to Obama s left even in 2016  But I think Trump s rhetoric and agenda has made conservative positions on race and immigration even more anathema to Democrats Sides also pointed out that the incentives for Democratic candidates have shifted It used to be the case that Democratic candidates had to moderate on racial issues to maintain a Democratic coalition that included both blacks and some racially conservative whites  But the Democratic coalition has changed  it is increasingly made up of not only nonwhites but whites who espouse racially liberal attitudes In an argument elaborating on a point made by Drutman  Edward Carmines  a political scientist at Indiana University  made the case that the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton fostered the shift to the left If a moderate policy agenda cannot guarantee electoral victory why downplay your leftward policy orientations in the unlikely event that it will jeopardize your electoral success Carmines added Trump s success has reinforced this perspective  He won with a very right wing policy agenda  Perhaps a left wing set of proposals can lead Democrats to similar success Carmines believes that  both of these premises are mistaken and could very well lead Democrats to electoral defeat when victory is within sight  Leonie Huddy  a political scientist at Stony Brook University  argues that the liberal tilt of the Democratic candidates is  in fact  a rational political strategy   There is real change afoot with the most recent generations   she wrote  citing a Pew study released in January Young Republicans are especially different from older Republicans and the Democratic Party is likely to regard such findings as an invitation to poach more liberal young Republicans Strong partisans  however  Huddy writes   are unlikely to defect from the party in 2020 regardless of its issue agenda   and political independentsare younger  on average  than partisans  Appealing to young voters thus makes political sense when it comes to the general 2020 presidential election ImageSenator Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally in North Charleston  S C CreditTravis Dove for The New York TimesGary Jacobson  a political scientist at the University of California San Diego  has a somewhat different take on the changing character of the Democratic electorate and the party s presidential candidates The candidates  Jacobson wrote by email   are playing to their activist base whose enthusiasm helped produce their House victory in 2018  He warned  however  that  leaning left does carry risks  there are not enough liberals  or progressives  if you prefer  to form a majority nationally or in the Electoral College  In contemporary presidential campaigns  according to Jacobson the tricky thing is that in an era of extremely high party line voting  turnout becomes enormously important  Trump has proven to be a great mobilizer of Democrats  but they still have to consider how enthusiastic ordinary Democrats will be about their nominee Trump  Jacobson noted  willtry to mobilize his base by ranting about  socialism  and of course some potential Democratic candidates will be more vulnerable to that charge than others The strategic choices facing prospective Democratic nominees are  in the view of Lynn Vavreck  a political scientist at U C L A   even more complex and subtle than those described by Jacobson Taking very liberal stands on contested issues  she wrote me might not pose  significant risks  if you think your minimum winning coalition of voters is made up of people who either share your preferences on these things  or for whom these policies are not pivotal in their vote decision She elaborated There are people for whom these issues are important  but for whom there s no position a Democrat could take that would make them decide not to vote for that Democrat  There are other people  presumably  for whom these issues are so important and their preferences so intense  that any Democrat who takes a position far from their own is a Democrat for whom they won t vote  It depends which type of people you think are in your winning coalition as to whether you stake out positions on these things Matthew Nisbet  a professor of communication  public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern and editor in chief of the journal Environmental Communication  addressed only the support for a Green New Deal by some Democratic candidates  His view is pessimistic In an email  he wrote The Green New Deal has done damage to the Democratic Party s chances heading into the 2020 elections  while hurting efforts to build momentum on behalf of climate and energy policy options capable of passing during an era of enduring divided government In an article in the spring edition of Issues in Science and Technology  Nisbet contends that the goal of Green New Dealersis not to broker cross alliances between the center right  center left  and left wing  drawing on the best ideas that those factions can offer  but rather to build progressive power In an interesting development  the momentum behind the more radical Democratic agenda has turned both Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi into defenders of the party s old guard Pelosi  who has been trying with mixed success to tamp down the left wing of the House Democratic caucus  recently described her views on Medicare for all in an interview with The Washington Post At first she said   I m agnostic  Show me how you think you can get there   But then she cautioned So we ll have hearings  again  let s see what it is  Right now it s a  30 trillion price tag  What do people get for that in terms of care  and what do they pay for that along the way Implicit in her comment is the belief that  30 trillion is not acceptable to the American public Obama  speaking at a town hall in Germany earlier this month  warned of the dangers of uncompromising ideology for the progressive wing of his party One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States   maybe it s true here as well   is a certain kind of rigidity where we say   Uh  I m sorry  this is how it s going to be   and then we start sometimes creating what s called a  circular firing squad   where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues  And when that happens  typically the overall effort and movement weakens For the moment  both Obama and Pelosi are having minimal influence as far as the leftward thrust of the Democratic presidential nomination goes Three years ago  Trump threw out conventional wisdom and went on to win the nomination and the presidency  Maybe  this time around  Democrats can gamble successfully on a similar strategy and win  Or maybe not  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you

PHOLA  South Africa   President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa assumed power promising a  new dawn   But just over a year later  he can t keep the nation s lights on A month before a national election  the worst rolling blackouts in years are regularly plunging South Africans into the dark  With annoying frequency  warnings of  load shedding  pop up on cellphones  referring to the power cuts imposed to prevent a collapse of the national electricity grid Takeout dinners by candlelight are hastily arranged in the cities  Meals are prepared over coal braziers instead of electricity in places like Phola  a township in a region dotted with power plants  about 75 miles east of Johannesburg  South Africa s biggest city  You wake up and there s no hot water  You can t bathe  you can t iron   said Victoria Nkosi  48  a longtime resident of a government built house in Phola   Why is there load shedding when we re surrounded by power plants  The short answer is that the blackouts are the result of years of mismanagement and corruption in the state owned utility  Eskom  They are also evidence of how difficult it is for Mr  Ramaphosa to reform the nation s state enterprises and secure stable electricity for South Africa  sub Saharan Africa s most advanced economy ImageFrieda Madalane  who sells fried bread out of her home in Phola  lost everything in her refrigerator after a recent blackout CreditJoao Silva The New York TimesThe blackouts are contributing to another year of lackluster economic growth in South Africa  a deeply unequal society that desperately needs strong  sustained expansion to create the foundations of a post apartheid economy Every sector of the economy  from the mining giants and car dealers to big retailers and informal entrepreneurs  has been hit badly by the blackouts  Eskom  the state utility that produces about 95 percent of the nation s power  is now regarded as the biggest risk to South Africa s economy  according to the National Treasury and outside financial experts In Phola  Frieda Madalane  who is 54  wakes up just after midnight to start cooking fried dough bread  called vetkoek  Starting before dawn  she sells the bread outside her home to neighbors going to work  making about  20 a day But her profits are now reduced by the amount she spends for kerosene to fuel the lamp she uses during load shedding  And one time  there was load shedding for one full day and I lost everything in my refrigerator   Ms  Madalane said ImagePresident Cyril Ramaphosa  who promised a  new dawn   faces an election just as blackouts are battering the economy CreditKim Ludbrook EPA  via ShutterstockOn May 8  South Africans are scheduled to cast ballots in the sixth general election since the end of apartheid in 1994  The long governing African National Congress is expected to garner the most votes  but its margin of victory remains the biggest uncertainty A strong showing could give Mr  Ramaphosa a mandate to carry out reforms in his party and in government  his allies say  But a poor performance could lead to a continuing standoff between Mr  Ramaphosa and his party rivals  or even fuel an outright challenge  party officials and political analysts say Weeks after becoming party leader in late 2017  Mr  Ramaphosa forced out of power Jacob Zuma  who had more than a year left in his second term as South Africa s president  Mr  Ramaphosa  who had served as Mr  Zuma s deputy for four years  promised to root out corruption  particularly in state owned enterprises Mr  Ramaphosa quickly shook up Eskom s board and eventually appointed a highly respected minister to overhaul Eskom and other state enterprises As the nation s biggest state enterprise  Eskom was the biggest target for corrupt A N C  politicians  their business allies and civil servants during the Zuma years  according to ongoing public inquiries into state corruption ImageThe blackouts have hit every sector of South Africa s economy  the most advanced in sub Saharan Africa CreditSiphiwe Sibeko ReutersEskom was  the main theater where corruption  state capture was taking place   Jabu Mabuza  the chairman of Eskom s board  said during recent testimony at a government corruption inquiry South Africa was plunged back into darkness late last year  as Eskom began imposing load shedding for the first time in three years And the situation has become far more critical than in the Zuma years  So short of energy is Eskom that it has been forced to cut power at the height of summer in the southern hemisphere  and even on weekends when demand is lower because many companies are closed  The crisis peaked in recent weeks as Eskom imposed several consecutive days of  stage 4  load shedding   the highest level   and even talked of the need to create higher stages of cuts A main cause of the recent blackouts  experts say  is two new but underperforming coal fired megaplants  Years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget  the two plants had been expected to relieve stress from South Africa s aging power infrastructure But the plants  which have yet to be completed  are only partially operational because of frequent breakdowns   the result of shoddy construction  experts say  One recent morning  at the Kusile plant   only about 12 miles northwest of Phola   giant construction cranes hovered above three of the six generating units ImageMembers of the main opposition party  Democratic Alliance  protesting against the state owned utility Eskom in Pretoria last week CreditPhill Magakoe Agence France Presse   Getty Images Eskom has gotten itself in a situation where the plants have started to come online  and they just don t work   said Jesse Burton  an expert on electricity policy and coal at the University of Cape Town s Energy Research Center Established in 1923  Eskom provided electricity in the last few years of apartheid to about a third of South African households  a small percentage of them black  Now 90 percent of households have electricity  a result of policies by the A N C   which promised access to power as part of democratization At the same time  Eskom became the source of jobs and contracts for the politically connected  Its bloated work force increased by half between 2003 and 2017 Mr  Ramaphosa recently proposed a partial breakup of Eskom   dividing the company into generation  transmission and distribution businesses under one holding company  The split would make each entity more competitive  he said The breakup  experts said  would also reduce the potential for corruption and ease South Africa s transition away from coal ImageGiant construction cranes hovering above three of the Kusile plant s six generating units CreditJoao Silva The New York TimesA monopoly like Eskom can fuel corruption  said Lauren Hermanus  the founder of an energy consultancy  Adapt  But if you have more players  who are acting in a more transparent way  then you can limit some of that stuff   she said Though still rudimentary  Mr  Ramaphosa s proposal has caused a fierce and immediate backlash from inside the A N C  and the party s traditional allies  including the South African

Ernest F  Hollings  a silver haired South Carolina Democrat who served 38 years in the United States Senate in an era of rising prosperity and often painful accommodation to racial tolerance in his state and across the South  died on Saturday at his home in Isle of Palms  S C  He was 97 His former press secretary  Andy Brack  confirmed his death Like his colleague Strom Thurmond  South Carolina s senior senator  Mr  Hollings became governor  ran for president and was a revered populist who took care of the military  business interests and the folks back home Together  they were the nation s longest serving Senate pair from one state  When Mr  Thurmond died in 2003 at 100  he had been the Senate s longest tenured member after 48 years in office  Moreover  Mr  Hollings was junior senator for 36 years  itself a record  and his tenure of 38 years and 55 days  including more than two years fulfilling the term of a senator who died in office  made him the eighth longest serving senator Mr  Thurmond  a Democrat who switched to the Republican Party  never relented in his opposition to full equality for black Americans  Mr  Hollings  while remaining a fiscal conservative  evolved into a social moderate  riding winds of change that swept the South as proponents of civil rights won court cases  staged protests and endured brutalities that shocked the nation s conscience Having grown up in segregated Charleston  attended a segregated college and served in a segregated army  Mr  Hollings had little contact with poor black people and initially opposed civil rights legislation  Guided by N A A C P  officials  he toured poor black and white areas of his state in 1968 and 1969  and what he saw shocked him  rat infested slums where families subsisted on grits and greens  children infected with worms  living in shacks without lights  heat or water  a mentally disabled mother of 10 who had never heard of food stamps  There is hunger in South Carolina   a solemn Mr  Hollings told a Senate committee   I know as a public servant I am late to the problem   adding   We ve got work to do in our own backyard  just as anybody who s candid knows he has work in his own backyard  and I d rather clean it up than cover it up  ImageMr  Hollings  right  with Senator John McCain of Arizona during a hearing of the Senate Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee CreditScott J  Ferrell CQ Roll Call  via Getty ImagesThe News and Courier of Charleston reported   Senators  members of the press corps and visitors packed in the hearing room watched and listened in disbelief as Hollings detailed dozens of tragically poignant scenes of human suffering in his state  Despite their differences  Mr  Hollings and Mr  Thurmond had a relatively good relationship  collaborating on legislation and projects to benefit education  employment  textiles  tourism and other industries and small businesses in South Carolina Tall and trim  with a military bearing and a Charleston Tidewater drawl  Mr  Hollings  who was known as Fritz  began his career in 1949 as a state legislator and an orthodox segregationist  flying the Confederate battle flag  defending school segregation and denouncing the N A A C P  as subversive  illegal and  against our way of life in the South  But by 1963  ending his governorship  he accepted integration at Clemson University   South Carolina is running out of courts   he told state legislators   This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina s choice  a government of laws rather than a government of men  This should be done with dignity   Weeks later  Harvey Gantt enrolled at Clemson without incident as its first black student By 1984  during a hopeless campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination  he called himself a centrist   strong on defense and liberal on social issues   He built his campaign around a spending freeze but endorsed racial amity  the fight against poverty and a shift away from the Reagan administration s use of military force and covert operations in Central America And by 2005  when he left the Senate  Mr  Hollings had established a long record of support for civil rights  He had also endorsed the Rev  Jesse Jackson for president in 1988  and had voted in 1991 to confirm Clarence Thomas as the second black justice of the Supreme Court ImageMr  Hollings with his wife  Patricia

Minutes  on CBS  that he had voted against the 1967 nomination of Thurgood Marshall as the first black Supreme Court justice  Mr  Hollings expressed regret  but offered an excuse   I couldn t get re elected   he said   That s the honest answer  If I had voted for him  I might as well withdraw from the race  It was political  Ernest Frederick Hollings was born in Charleston  S C   on Jan  1  1922  to Adolph G  and Wilhelmine  Meyer  Hollings  His family of paper mill proprietors went bankrupt in the Depression  He attended public schools  but was raised in an affluent neighborhood now on the National Register of Historic Places  He graduated in 1942 from The Citadel  the military college in Charleston  In World War II  he was an Army artillery combat officer in North Africa  France and Germany and was discharged a captain in 1945 In 1946  he married Patricia Salley  They had four children  Michael  Helen  Patricia and Ernest  and were divorced in 1970  His daughter Patricia died in

grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren He graduated from the University of South Carolina Law School in 1947  and after practicing law for a year  began a political career that would span a half century  He served three terms in the state House of Representatives  from 1949 to 1954  and was elected Speaker Pro Tempore in 1951 and 1953  He defended school segregation  but supported sales taxes to improve black schools He was elected lieutenant governor in 1954 and governor in 1958  The Confederate battle flag flew over the Statehouse in Columbia during his term  While public schools remained segregated  he sought to improve education  raising teachers  salaries and founding technical schools and an educational television network  He also promoted industry and jobs  and in 1960 campaigned for John F  Kennedy for president ImageMr  Hollings with other members of the Senate Commerce Committee in in 2002  The panel was conducting hearings into the collapse of the energy company Enron CreditScott J  Ferrell CQ Roll Call  via Getty ImagesConstitutionally limited to a single four year term as governor  from 1959 to 1963  Mr  Hollings ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 1962  But the incumbent winner  Senator Olin D  Johnston  died in 1965  and Mr  Hollings won a special election in 1966 to succeed him In the Senate  he opposed civil rights and welfare legislation  and won re election in 1968 to a full six year term  Later in his Senate career  he remained an advocate for military spending and balanced budgets He was also a critic of the oil and gas industries  proposing laws to repeal depletion allowances for major producers and opposing price deregulation  He opposed cuts in food stamps and legal services for the poor  and sided with liberals on tax relief for low income families  funding for day care centers and laws to ban ocean dumping and protect marine life Mr  Hollings s run for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination fizzled in the New Hampshire primary  in which he won 4 percent of the vote  The Democratic nominee  former Vice President Walter F  Mondale  lost the general election to President Ronald Reagan in a landslide Mr  Hollings remained popular in South Carolina  winning elections comfortably  In retirement  he wrote columns for South Carolina newspapers and HuffPost  taught at the Charleston School of Law  founded a scholarship program and established the Hollings Center for International Dialogue to foster understanding between America and nations with predominantly Muslim populations He was also the author of  The Case Against Hunger  A Demand for a National Policy   1970   and  Making Government Work   2008  with Kirk Victor   which answered  as he put it   the critics who reflexively disparage government   The book presented a case for righting the direction of a federal government  which he said had  gone off course   The greed of capitalism has reached compatibility with the greed of politics   Mr  Hollings wrote   The capitalist is divorced from country to seek profit  and the politician is divorced from country to seek contributions   But he insisted that  government has worked before  and we can make it work again

LONDON   British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday to argue for a Brexit delay while her ministers hold crisis talks with Labour to try to break the deadlock in London Britain s departure from the EU has already been delayed once but May is asking for yet more time as she courts veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn  whose opposition Labour Party wants to keep Britain more closely tied to the bloc after Brexit  The Prime Minister has not yet moved off her red lines so we can reach a compromise   Corbyn said ahead of further talks between his team and government ministers on Tuesday While May travels to Berlin and Paris ahead of an emergency EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday  British lawmakers will hold a 90 minute debate on her proposal to delay Britain s EU departure date to June 30 from April 12  The debate has been forced on the government by parliament passing a law on Monday which will give lawmakers the power to scrutinize and even make legally binding changes to May s request to extend the Article 50 negotiating period again  Labour s demands include keeping Britain in a customs union with the EU  something which is hard to reconcile with May s desire for Britain to have an independent trade policy The Telegraph reported Labour and the government were still discussing both a customs union and the idea of holding a confirmatory referendum on any deal they agree  Both ideas are anathema to many in May s party  whose rebels have helped trigger three parliamentary defeats of the withdrawal deal she negotiated with the EU last year   I ve said many times before  we can be more  much more ambitious in our future relationship with the UK   EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier told a news conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin on Monday BREXIT DELAY The 2016 referendum revealed a United Kingdom divided over much more than EU membership  and has sparked impassioned debate about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism  empire and what it means to be British Yet  more than a week after Britain was originally supposed to have left the EU  nothing is resolved as May  the weakest British leader in a generation  battles to get a divorce deal ratified by a profoundly divided parliament If Britain s exit is delayed beyond May 22  the EU has said it will have to take part in European Parliament elections  The British government on Monday took the legal steps necessary to take part in that vote  It does not make these elections inevitable  as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part   a government spokesman said EU leaders  fatigued by the serpentine Brexit crisis  must decide on Wednesday whether to grant May a further delay  The decision can be vetoed by any of the other 27 member states Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it was  crucial to know when and on what basis  the  UK will ratify the Withdrawal Agreement  as the EU considers May s request to delay Without an extension  Britain is due to leave the EU at 2200 GMT on Friday  without a deal to cushion the economic shock While the EU is not expected to trigger such a potentially disorderly no deal exit  diplomats said all options were on the table   from refusing a delay to granting May s request or pushing for a longer postponement But May is boxed in at home Brexiteers in her cabinet insisted on at most a short delay  while Mark Francois  deputy chief of the Conservatives  hardline eurosceptic faction in parliament  demanded she resign and called on the party to vote on forcing her out   even though there is no formal provision to do so before December   Editing by Guy Faulconbridge

WASHINGTON   They huddle together on the House floor  conferring over what to do on a tough vote  They exchange group texts to consult on legislation and plan for the  increasingly rare  after work drink  often with Bitmojis that capture their mood that day  They are frequently spotted walking together on Capitol Hill  huddled in what seems like an endless inside joke Among the 67 new Democrats in Congress  10 served in the military or intelligence agencies  which has shaped a tight and quite visible bond  All defeated Republicans in arduous races last year  many in the 31 districts carried by President Trump in the 2016 presidential election Their backgrounds in the military  where nonpartisanship is key  have also made them among the most moderate members of a caucus in which there is increasing pressure to slide firmly to the left on various policy issues  I don t know how I would be here without them   said Representative Chrissy Houlahan  Democrat of Pennsylvania and a former Air Force officer   Each of us has broken with the party for different reasons   she said  adding   It s nice to have a smaller group to talk to about what this all means  Often  they are among a handful of Democrats to vote with Republicans on politically charged  gotcha  measures that the majority had routinely rejected out of hand  in one crucial case helping pass a gun bill targeting undocumented immigrants Knowing that they were critical to delivering the House back to their party  the veterans seem unbowed  for now  to pressures from some Democrats to adhere to party lines  Many of them did not back Nancy Pelosi for House speaker  and she has repeatedly begged Democrats not to vote with Republicans on what she views as essentially nuisance measures  The speaker s office is inordinately powerful  and we have to work really hard to make this body egalitarian   said Representative Max Rose  Democrat of New York  who was a platoon leader in Afghanistan   The freshmen want to reduce seniority power  and the vets are leading that effort  Most had never run for office before  but said they were inspired by a sense of chaos in government and an erosion of faith in public institutions  While their transitions have been at times tense   the military notion of mission over ego as well as a preference for punctual meetings and clear lines of authority do not always translate well on Capitol Hill   these lawmakers are a cornerstone of the Democratic Party s strategy to maintain the House in 2020 ImageAmong the 67 new Democrats in Congress  10 served in the military or intelligence agencies CreditSarah Silbiger The New York Times There s no question those veterans and service members were central to our work to build a Democratic majority   said Cole Leiter  a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee   and their relentless focus on service has better prepared this Democratic caucus to work for their constituents  These members spent quite a bit of time getting to know one another during the campaign  largely through the Serve America PAC started by Representative Seth Moulton  Democrat of Massachusetts  who was among the first troops in Baghdad in 2003  When I ran in 2014 against a nine term incumbent  there was no member of Congress who would even speak with me   Mr  Moulton said   So I wanted to create that team for the amazing candidates who were running this time  What was important was building these relationships  They could call or text me at all hours of the night if they needed advice or something  We set up a Slack channel so that we could communicate more as a group  Once in Washington  the group immediately gravitated toward one another on bills and other legislative matters   It s the trust factor   said Elissa Slotkin  Democrat of Michigan and a former C I A  analyst who served three tours in Iraq   If Max Rose or Elaine Luria comes to me and says   I m doing this bill  Do you want to do it   they aren t going to twist the issue and play it for their own advantages   she said  referring to freshman veterans   We made the choice to focus on Congress and made Congress like a mission  During the government shutdown  Ms  Slotkin and Ms  Houlahan wrote a measure to protect federal workers in subsequent impasses  Representative Mikie Sherrill  Democrat of New Jersey and a former Navy helicopter pilot  seized on news coverage about problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs serving women and quickly got several veterans to sign on to a letter demanding the department secretary  Robert L  Wilkie  fix the system  The group has helped revive discussions about asserting the role of Congress in war authorization Veterans are also prone to seeking one another out across the aisle  Mr  Moulton  who served in the Marines  and Representative Brian Mast  a veteran and Republican from Florida  worked to bring together both parties on a conservation bill that pleased environmentalists and commercial fishermen alike They can often be seen sliding across the aisle to sit with Republican veterans on the House floor  like Representatives Jim Baird of Indiana and Will Hurd of Texas   We have a bias toward action because we all served in the trenches in an organization that is apolitical   Mr  Hurd said   We knew each other s ethos  The women  who have called themselves  the badass women   exchange group text messages and make special efforts to get together for dinner and talk during the week  Representative Abigail Spanberger  Democrat of Virginia and a former C I A  operations officer  had recently finished a tough town hall style meeting   among the more taxing  if vital  undertakings of lawmakers   and turned to the group for a lift   She was having a down moment   Ms  Slotkin said   So there was a text chain  and we all told her   You re awesome    and other messages of buoyancy  she said Ms  Spanberger said they also tried to keep a light tone on their group texts  endlessly razzing   about Ms  Sherrill s eternal obsession with the Gateway tunnel project in her home state  Mr  Rose s incandescent speeches on the floor  the way their hair looked in a photograph accompanying this article  They share funny travel anecdotes from the road and videos of their children singing   We had all come from places with really stressful environments   Ms  Spanberger said   so as stressful as the campaigns were  we had a perspective  In the difficult transition to Washington  they are often one another s lifeboat   It s just implicit that you have each other s back   said Representative Jason Crow  Democrat of Colorado who served as an Army captain   That s rare in this town   

WASHINGTON   Twenty eight hours isn t particularly long  but it was enough to provoke Republicans into making the latest transformation of the Senate  an institution that once revered minority rights but that is slowly but certainly turning into another chamber where the majority rules all Frustrated by a lack of Democratic cooperation on executive branch nominations  the Republican majority on Wednesday engineered the latest twist in the struggle over mind numbing Senate rules  They forced through a change that reduced to two hours  from 30  the maximum time allowed for debating most executive branch nominations after an initial vote to bring the matter to a close Suddenly that 28 hour difference seems momentous Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  persuaded his fellow Republicans to jam through the change in the interest of expediency  A 2013 rules revision   similarly strong armed through by Democrats   had already cleared the way for a Senate majority to confirm most presidential nominees on its own if it was simply willing to devote the time to clearing the procedural obstacles  The Democratic insistence on consuming all of that time before a preordained outcome had exhausted the patience of Mr  McConnell and his cohorts  What has been going on here is completely and totally unacceptable   Mr  McConnell said in scolding his Democratic counterparts for making the Senate routinely chew up the 30 hours of  post cloture  time on Federal District Court judges and subcabinet level nominees  He did not expound on the fact that he and his fellow Republicans deployed similar tactics against President Barack Obama when it came to many of his judicial nominees  culminating with their refusal in 2016 to even entertain the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B  Garland  a respected federal appeals court judge In a candid admission this week  Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and former Judiciary Committee chairman  acknowledged that Republicans dug in against Obama judicial nominees as payback for what Democrats did to some of the judicial choices of President George W  Bush  True to our promise to not live by two sets of rules  we began to follow the precedent established by the Democrats and blocked a proportional number of President Obama s judicial nominees   he said The Senate is always an arena for playing tit for tat  The larger problem is that once one side figures out an effective way to throw a wrench into the procedural works  the other side then adopts and escalates that approach the next chance it gets Democrats began filibustering federal appeals court nominees in 2003  Republicans followed suit in the Obama era and threw lower level district court nominees into the mix  Then they upped the ante considerably with their complete blockade of Judge Garland with nearly a year left in Mr  Obama s term After multiple Republican filibusters against Mr  Obama s nominees to fill vacancies on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  Democrats in November 2013 eliminated the 60 vote threshold for breaking a filibuster for nearly all nominees  In 2017  Republicans then extended that rule to Supreme Court nominees  allowing President Trump to install two   Neil M  Gorsuch and Brett M  Kavanaugh Republicans have also limited the so called blue slip privileges of Democrats when it comes to circuit court judges  denying them their previous ability to pocket veto nominees for home state courts if they did not approve of the administration s choice or were not consulted on the pick  They are still allowed a say over district court judges  but the majority could always revoke that right as well Angry at the increasing limits on their ability to influence judicial selection  Democrats have been forcing Republicans to run out the clock on all nominees and throwing up whatever barriers they can So Republicans reset the clock   from 30 hours to two The eventual outcome seems almost inevitable  Democrats are already under pressure from activist groups to abandon the filibuster altogether   the 60 vote threshold still applies for most legislation   if they get the opportunity after the 2020 election or at some point in the future  The Republican decision to push through another unilateral rules change will only fuel that campaign and make it easier for Democrats   or Republicans for that matter   to justify it Harry Reid  the former Democratic leader from Nevada who was the architect of the 2013 change to weaken filibusters against nominees  has predicted for years that the legislative filibuster was on its way out  Events seem to reinforce his view Senators on both sides of the aisle insist they would never eliminate the procedural weapon that empowers individual senators  But they also used to insist that they would never overhaul the rules in ways that would undermine the sacrosanct Senate rights of the minority The so called nuclear option   unilaterally changing Senate practices through parliamentary rulings   used to be so feared that senators would huddle in their offices for intense talks to avert what lawmakers predicted would be a catastrophe for the Senate  Now the option has become conventional   three times in six years   and most of the public doesn t see much significance in the reduction to two hours from 30  It is not hard to imagine more sweeping changes in store for the Senate in the not too distant future Both sides aired their decades of nomination grievances during the rules change debate  with Senator Tom Cotton  Republican of Arkansas  calling the Republican action  Miguel Estrada s revenge    a reference to the first appeals court nominee who was blocked in 2003 by a Democratic filibuster  Democrats reminded Republicans of their harsh treatment of Obama nominees and the obstruction of Judge Garland  They said Republicans were changing the rules in their rush to fill the federal courts with conservatives blessed by Mr  Trump and advocacy groups on the right  It is a partisan power grab   said Senator Patrick J  Leahy  Democrat of Vermont who formerly oversaw the Judiciary Committee   And it is motivated by the far right s desire to flood the federal judiciary with young  ideological nominees  many of whom  as we have seen time and again in the Judiciary Committee  are simply unqualified to serve on our nation s courts  The change  while seemingly minor  will help Republicans fill up vacancies by saving considerable floor time  About three dozen district court nominees were recently cleared for floor consideration and can now speed through  or at least speed through in Senate terms  Another vestige of minority power is going by the boards  That is not the Senate we want   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said Wednesday in denouncing the Republican move  But it increasingly seems it is the Senate we are going to get  

WASHINGTON   Playing migrants for laughs in a speech to lobbyists and donors  President Donald Trump characterized people trying to get into the U S  as a horde of beefy men who fake hard luck stories so softies in the immigration system will let them in His shtick caused plenty of amusement at the Republican Jewish Coalition event Saturday but it was a far cry from the reality of the masses at the border The speech capped a week of unreal political rhetoric as Trump retreated on two broad fronts  the border and health care  and offered tortured explanations for doing so  He also got his family history wrong and drew a link between wind power and cancer that has not been proved Here s a look back IMMIGRATION TRUMP  describing asylum seekers as  people that look like they should be fighting for the UFC  Ultimate Fighting Championship   They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place   coaching them to say  I am very fearful for my life  I am very worried that I will be accosted if I m sent back home   Trump then mimics U S  officials   Oh  give him asylum  He s afraid  He s afraid   And he adds   We don t love the fact that he s got tattoos on his face  That s not a good sign     speech Saturday to the lobbying group THE FACTS  Figures from his own administration tell a different story than Trump s mocking tale  Those coming are increasingly families and children  Among them are thousands who get a chance for a life in America because they make a compelling case that they risk persecution in their home countries Last month  Homeland Security s immigration statistics office released its latest annual report on the flow of asylum seekers and refugees  covering 2017  Among those who came from Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras and applied for asylum at the border  56 percent were unaccompanied children  The percentage was the same the year before and higher in 2015 Altogether  Homeland Security granted the asylum applications of more than 26 500 people in 2017  Almost one third were children  Nearly half were women  Close to two thirds were married Additionally  the Justice Department granted asylum to more than 10 500 people who were already in the country and made their case for refuge in their deportation hearings    TRUMP   If they put one foot on our territory  if they start climbing a fence and they re on the Mexico side  welcome to the United States  Think of it  It s the craziest thing     speech Saturday THE FACTS  It s not that simple  What is lost in Trump s rhetoric is that it is legal to come to the border and ask for asylum  As for those who sneak illegally into the U S  and get caught  they  too  are entitled to apply for asylum As the Homeland Security report states   Generally  any foreign national present in the United States or arriving at a POE  port of entry  may seek asylum regardless of immigration status  Whether they ask at the border or after sneaking into the U S   most don t get it    TRUMP  on why he is pulling back on sealing the U S  Mexico border   Because Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days  They re apprehending everybody  Yesterday they apprehended 1 400 people  The day before was 1 000  And if they apprehend people at their southern border where they don t have to walk through  that s a big home run  We can handle it from there  It s really good     remarks to reporters Friday TRUMP   Before that they never did anything     remarks to reporters Thursday THE FACTS  Trump is describing a Mexican crackdown on Central American migrants that has not materialized  He s also wrong in saying that Mexico did nothing about the problem until he threatened to close the border Mexico markedly tightened migration controls during the Obama administration  Mexico also detained more than 30 000 foreigners in the first three months of this year  before Trump accused Mexican officials of doing  NOTHING  Mexico reports that its interception and detention of migrants from the south are  about average  in recent months  Over the first three days of April  it apprehended 1 259 foreigners   not 1 000 or more a day  as Trump claimed  There is no very substantive change   said Mexico s foreign secretary  Marcelo Ebrard   I don t know what  Trump  was referring to  Ebrard said   What Mexico is doing as far as the review of the southern border   well  it s the same thing it has been doing     TRUMP   The Flores decision is a disaster  I have to tell you  Judge Flores  whoever you may be  that decision is a disaster for our country  a disaster     remarks at a meeting with local officials in Southern California on Friday THE FACTS  There s no Judge Flores involved  Jenny Flores was 15 year old native of El Salvador who was held in what her advocates said were substandard conditions in the 1980s  contending she was strip searched in custody and housed with male adults  They launched a class action lawsuit on behalf of migrant children in the country illegally  Her mother was a housekeeper in the U S  who feared deportation if she picked up her daughter The case worked its way to the Supreme Court  which sided with the government and against the girl s advocates  But the case gave rise to an agreement in 1997 setting conditions for the detention of migrant children and the codifying of those conditions in law a decade later  It generally bars the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days and guides how they are to be treated    HEALTH CARETRUMP   This will be a great campaign issue  I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported  as usual  in the  nytimes  but only after the Election when we take back the House etc     tweet Wednesday THE FACTS  That s misleading at best A week earlier  Trump stirred expectations of an ambitious health care effort when he said that if the Supreme Court strikes down  Obamacare     we will have a plan that s far better   He promised  the Republican Party will become the party of great health care  But Trump soon found that the party in Congress had no appetite for yet another attempt to replace President Barack Obama s health law in the near future   nor does it have a plan  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   told reporters Tuesday  describing their conversation a day earlier   He did say  as he later tweeted  that he accepted that and that he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign  So Trump backed down and postponed any replacement until after an election more than 18 months away McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Monday s private call between the two  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   according to that person  That night  Trump tweeted as much    TRUMP   Republicans will always support pre existing conditions     tweet Wednesday MICK MULVANEY  acting White House chief of staff   Every single plan that this White House has ever put forward since Donald Trump was elected covered pre existing conditions  Every single plan that Republicans in the House voted on in the previous Congress covered pre existing conditions  Every single plan considered by the Senate covers pre existing conditions  The debate about pre existing conditions is over  Both parties support them and anyone telling you anything different is lying to you for political gain     interview March 31 on ABC s  This Week  THE FACTS  Trump and his chief of staff s sweeping statements about the GOP commitment to protect people with pre existing medical conditions are misleading  The Republican health insurance proposals would not have protected those patients as broadly as the Obama era law and could have led to significantly higher rates or gaps in coverage for people with chronic illnesses The Obama health law requires insurers to take all applicants  regardless of medical history  and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones  It also requires standard benefits such as pregnancy  maternity and newborn care and mental health treatment  The trade off was that the law also mandated that everyone have insurance  including healthy people  whose premiums helped insurers cover the costs of the very sick The GOP health overhaul plans in Congress eliminated the mandate that everyone have insurance and sought to protect people with pre existing conditions to a degree  But the Republican legislation would have given states leeway to vary the premiums that insurers charge based on health and other factors  That might make coverage unaffordable for people with serious or pre existing health conditions For instance  the Republican plans would have allowed insurers to charge older people at a 5 to 1 ratio compared with young people  higher than the law s 3 to 1 ratio  and given states authority to allow insurers to use health status as a factor in setting premiums for people who have had a break in coverage and are trying to get a new individual policy The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found the GOP plans over time would raise premiums for people with health problems because healthy people would be more likely to take their chances going uninsured    WIND POWERTRUMP   If you have a windmill anywhere near your house  congratulations  Your house just went down 75  of value  And they say the noise causes cancer     remarks at Republican fundraising dinner Tuesday THE FACTS  The sound from wind farms has not been proved to cause cancer Trump has had it out for wind power since turbines were proposed off the coast of Scotland within sight of his golf resort near Aberdeen   He unsuccessfully fought the project  He has ascribed a variety of evils to wind power over the years  usually with scant evidence  while praising coal  a well documented cause of health problems  The American Cancer Society is unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer   the organization said after Trump s latest remarks While some recesses of the internet have long tried to sound alarms about  wind turbine syndrome   several studies have found no evidence of serious health issues Trump actually misidentified his target  Wind turbines produce energy  Windmills mill grain and flummox Don Quixote     PUERTO RICOTRUMP   Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane  more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before     tweet Tuesday HOGAN GIDLEY  White House spokesman   The fact is  they have received more money than any state or territory in history for a rebuild     interview Tuesday with MSNBC THE FACTS  The money Puerto Rico has received for hurricane relief is nowhere close to  91 billion  Nor is the amount provided greater than for any other hurricane that has struck the U S According to the White House  Trump s  91 billion estimate includes about  50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades  along with  41 billion already approved  But actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed more slowly from federal coffers  about  11 billion so far Even if the  91 billion figure eventually comes to fruition  it would not be the most ever provided for hurricane rebuilding efforts  Hurricane Katrina  which hit Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states in 2005  has cost the U S government more than  120 billion    TRUMP  on Puerto Rico   The pols are grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA     tweet Tuesday THE FACTS  Trump appears to suggest Puerto Rico is not part of the U S  as he criticizes its territorial government for taking  from USA   He does not criticize other Americans for taking  from USA  Gidley  speaking on MSNBC  called the notion that Trump was referring to Puerto Ricans as noncitizens  absolutely ridiculous   But in the same interview Gidley had referred to Puerto Rico as  that country   When pressed about his wording  Gidley said it was a mistake and he meant to say  territory  Puerto Ricans are Americans    TRUMP S FATHERTRUMP  arguing that Germany should spend more on its own military budget   I have great respect for Angela  and I have great respect for the country   he said  referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel   My father is German  right  was German  and born in a very wonderful place in Germany  and so I have a great feeling for Germany  but they re not paying what they should be paying     remarks Tuesday with NATO s secretary general THE FACTS  Trump is confusing his father and grandfather Trump s father  Fred  was born in New York City  The president s grandfather  Friedrich  was born in Germany Friedrich Trump immigrated to the U S  in 1885 at the age of 16  arriving in New York before moving to the western parts of the U S Trump has messed up his family history in this way several times  Last year  he said both his parents were born in what became the European Union  Only his Scottish mother was    VOTER TURNOUTDEMOCRAT BETO O ROURKE   The state saw young voter turnout up 500  over the last midterm election     various campaign events in recent weeks THE FACTS  Voter turnout by people under 30 did not jump nearly that much last year  Texas did see a large increase in those young voters  though More than 1 million young voters cast a ballot in the 2018 midterm election  a 234  increase from the 2014 midterm elections  according to voting data from the Texas secretary of state s office Initial reports suggested young voter turnout increased as much as 508  during early voting in Texas when compared with early voting in 2014  according to data released by a political consulting firm a week before the 2018 election O Rourke spokesman Chris Evans acknowledged his candidate used those figures without making the distinction that they represent an incomplete portion of early votes cast   not total turnout in the election Overall  voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election increased 77  in Texas over 2014 totals    CENSUSTRUMP   Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question  Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together     tweet Monday THE FACTS  Trump s disdain for conducting the once a decade census without a citizenship question is not shared by his own Census Bureau researchers  Nor is it consistent with the many operations of government and business that make billions of dollars in spending decisions as well as policy decisions based on the most accurate possible count of the U S  population According to January 2018 calculations by the Census Bureau  adding a citizenship question to the decennial census form would cause lower response rates among noncitizens  leading to an increased cost to the government of at least  27 5 million for additional phone calls  visits to the home and other follow up efforts to reach them  The Constitution requires a count every 10 years of  the whole number of persons in each state   long understood to include all residents of the U S The count goes to the heart of the U S  political system  It s used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House and how the electoral votes that decide presidential elections are distributed  Civil rights groups and states with higher shares of immigrant populations such as California and New York cite a significant harm to the political rights of minority groups if a citizenship question in the decennial census dissuades immigrants from participating  resulting in diminished representation in the U S  House The census also shapes how 300 federal programs distribute more than  800 billion a year to local communities  according to an analysis by the GW Institute of Public Policy at George Washington University  Communities and businesses depend on it  as well  in deciding where to build schools  hospitals  job training centers  grocery stores and more The GW institute s analysis of the effects of an undercount on five programs administered by the Health and Human Services Department  for instance  found that 37 states lost a median of  1 091 in the 2015 budget year for each person missed in the 2010 census    Associated Press writers Colleen Long  Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar  Michael Biesecker  Jill Colvin  Andrew Taylor and

SEATTLE   Employees at big tech companies have pushed back against their employers for working with the military and law enforcement offices  and demanded better treatment of women and minorities Now  thousands of them are also taking on climate change This week  more than 4 200 Amazon employees called on the company to rethink how it addresses and contributes to a warming planet  The action is the largest employee driven movement on climate change to take place in the influential tech industry The workers say the company needs to make firm commitments to reduce its carbon footprint across its vast operations  not make piecemeal or vague announcements  And they say that Amazon should stop offering custom cloud computing services that help the oil and gas industry find and extract more fossil fuels The goal for Amazon s leaders and employees is  that climate change is something they think about whenever a business decision is being made   said Rajit Iftikhar  a software engineer in Amazon s retail business   We want to make Amazon a better company  It is a natural extension of that  The letter adds support for a new tactic among activist tech workers  using the stock they receive as compensation to agitate for change  Like other shareholders  they can file a resolution urging a particular corporate change that investors vote on at a company s annual meeting  Historically  this approach has been used by outside activist investors  not employees The Amazon employees signing the letter  who made their names public  are pushing Amazon to approve a shareholder resolution that would force the company to develop a plan to address its carbon footprint  The resolution was filed by more than two dozen current and former employees late last year  and it could come up for a vote next month It is rare for tech employees  even some of the most activist ones  to attach their names to public criticism of their employers  While thousands walked out at Google over the company s handling of sexual harassment claims  for example  few names were connected to the effort  It s exactly what Amazon has taught me to be  bold  audacious  and tackle big problems   said Maren Costa  a principal user experience designer who has been with the company for almost 15 years Amazon has more than 65 000 corporate and tech employees in the United States  More people signed the letter than Amazon employs at any of its individual domestic offices outside Seattle and the Bay Area ImageAmazon s campus in Seattle  A shareholder resolution that would force the company to develop a plan to address its carbon footprint could come up for a vote next month CreditMatthew Ryan Williams for The New York TimesAn Amazon spokesman  Sam Kennedy  did not comment directly on the letter but said the company was addressing climate change in many ways  Earlier this year  we announced that we will share our companywide carbon footprint  along with related goals and programs   he said in a statement   We also announced Shipment Zero  our vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon  with 50 percent of all shipments net zero by 2030  More than its other tech peers  Amazon is particularly vulnerable to criticism about its carbon footprint  It ships millions of items large and small  The data centers that run its cloud operations need power to stay cool  and its cloud offerings and artificial intelligence put it in touch with customers in big businesses  including the energy industry Amazon in 2014 announced a  long term commitment to achieve 100 percent renewable energy usage  for its data centers  but it did not set a deadline  On Monday  it said it was planning three new wind farms  It was its first announcement of a new renewable energy project for its data centers in more than two years  even as its cloud business more than doubled in that time The workers are urging Amazon to adopt a much more ambitious effort  In late November and early December  16 current and former Amazon employees filed shareholder proposals  And once they went public with their campaign  a dozen more joined  including Chris Page  who used to run a part of Amazon s sustainability work In January  a group of the workers met with Amazon s sustainability team and investor relations officials to discuss their proposal  It was clear to me that we didn t have a companywide plan that could address climate change at the scale and urgency that we need   Ms  Costa said   That team didn t have the resources to do the job that I think they know they need to do  Mr  Kennedy  the company spokesman  said   In operations alone  we have over 200 scientists  engineers and product designers dedicated exclusively to inventing new ways to leverage our scale for the good of customers and the planet  The employees worked to build more internal support  In mid February  their email list grew from 600 to more than 1 200 in about a day  said Emily Cunningham  a designer who has worked at Amazon since 2013  We don t have a lot of culture of dissent at Amazon  but it resonated   she said A few days later  on Presidents  Day  Amazon announced the Shipment Zero initiative  Amazon also said in a blog post that it would disclose its companywide carbon footprint this year The next day  Amazon contacted the people behind the resolution to meet again  The company wanted to  ask about willingness to withdraw in light of the disclosures in the blog and those to come later this year   Mark Hoffman  a top lawyer at Amazon  wrote to them in an email Shipment Zero had been in the works for a while  But to the activists  the timing felt like a victory  It was a direct response to the pressure that this small group of people have been applying   Ms  Costa said   It gave me hope that we could make a difference  Then the activists saw an article in Gizmodo  a technology news site  that outlined how Amazon s cloud computing division was building special offerings for oil and gas companies  On its website  Amazon says its customers include BP and Royal Dutch Shell  and its products can  find oil faster    recover more oil  and  reduce the cost per barrel  In a second meeting with Amazon  the workers raised the oil industry connections with the company s sustainability team  its members did not seem to be aware of the business  according to several employees at the meeting  That really showed us Amazon is not taking climate change seriously if the highest levels of the sustainability team are not even aware that we have an oil and gas business   said Ms  Cunningham  who was at the meeting In mid March  Amazon informed the activists that the company s board would recommend that shareholders oppose the resolution  The board agrees that planning for potential disruptions posed by climate change and reducing companywide dependence on fossil fuels are important   the formal recommendation said   However  the board believes that Amazon is already doing this  So the employees put together the public letter  which outlines six principles they think should guide a plan  including  ending all custom solutions specifically designed for oil and gas extraction and exploration  They began sharing the letter in small circles on Monday  and then more broadly on Tuesday  By midafternoon  more than 2 000 employees had signed on  On Wednesday morning  they released the letter with more than 3 500 Amazon employees putting their name behind the cause  By the afternoon  that total had risen to over 4 200 Amazon typically sends out the proxy ballot for investors to vote on shareholder resolutions in mid April  

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today by email  In recent years  journalists and advocates have tried to capture the scope of the Bay Area s homelessness crisis   a problem that often feels unfathomable in its depth and complexity Still  much of the discussion has centered on San Francisco  or on the efforts of individual cities throughout the region  Read about a debate over a homeless services center proposed for a waterfront location in San Francisco  Today  the Bay Area Council Economic Institute  the think tank arm of a business group  is set to release a report that examines the issue through a regional lens  One of the things about the Bay Area is  it s a wonderful place  but it s very divided up   Jim Wunderman  the council s president and chief executive  told me   We have 101 cities in nine counties around this very large bay and there s no one city that dominates the landscape  But that isn t how programs aimed at moving people into housing have been implemented  he said  even as more people in smaller suburbs find themselves in tenuous housing situations  and more people live out of their cars  which means they re mobile The group wanted to explore ways to scale up successful programs and boost coordination among communities  To do that  Mr  Wunderman said  the group needed to better understand what was at stake The report found   Roughly 28 200 people were homeless across the Bay Area  according to point in time counts in 2017  That was the third largest population in the country  after New York  76 500  and Los Angeles  55 200   The next largest overall number was 11 600 in Seattle and King County   But the Bay Area has a relatively large percentage of homeless people without shelter  indicating there s a shortage of subsidized housing  short term shelters and transitional housing   That was 67 percent  That s compared with just 5 percent in New York and 47 percent in Seattle and King County  Once again  though  Los Angeles had the largest percentage of unsheltered homeless people  75 percent   The analysis found that spending on services for people experiencing homelessness or people who were at risk varied widely across the region  Part of that stems from the fact that the costs to build vary widely For instance  the report said  building new permanently supportive housing costs  730 560 on average per unit in San Francisco County  compared with  393 580 per unit on average in Solano County However  Mr  Wunderman said that particular finding shouldn t be taken as a sign that services  housing and emergency shelter should be concentrated in the least expensive parts of the Bay  We re going to continue to need to develop programs locally   he said   I think this is a burden that has to be shouldered by everyone  Mr  Wunderman suggested one way to persuade communities to do their part  Tie state money to initiatives  Here s what Californians said about our state s housing

LOS ANGELES   The ever evolving Los Angeles County Museum of Art has cleared its biggest hurdle to erecting a radical new building by the Swiss architect Peter Zumthor that represents one of the country s most ambitious museum transformations The county board of supervisors voted Tuesday to approve the current plan and release  117 5 million in taxpayer funding for it  despite last minute entreaties from some art and architecture critics who urged the board to vote against the project Michael Govan  the museum s director  in turn  took to the Opinion page of The Los Angeles Times to present his case  This is the big green light everybody has been waiting for   Mr  Govan said after the meeting  where leaders of neighboring museums and celebrities like Brad Pitt and Diane Keaton made short public comments of support   Now we can go ahead with construction drawings and go raise the rest of the funds with the assurance this is going forward  In the week running up to the vote  the  650 million project  which is mainly privately funded  received its sharpest criticisms yet  The independent architecture critic Joseph Giovannini and The Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight both described problems with the Zumthor design   a sweeping  one level structure perched on pavilions that will replace four ailing structures They both referred to the county s final environmental impact report  issued last month  which noted that the proposed building offers only 110 000 square feet for galleries   less space than previous designs   and 10 000 fewer square feet of gallery space than in the buildings slated for demolition   Mr  Giovannini  who said that he had hired an architect to analyze the original buildings  put the loss of gallery space at 53 000 square feet  Both critics also wrote that they feared the architecture would undermine the purpose of an encyclopedic museum like Lacma by integrating different collections   from Mesopotamian antiquities to contemporary art   in uniform galleries   Mr  Govan recently decided to merge American art and European painting and sculpture  two major departments  upsetting the critics  ImageA rendering of the interior of the new museum building  by the Swiss architect Peter Zumthor CreditAtelier Peter Zumthor   PartnerImageA conceptual image of the building  which rests on seven pavilions CreditAtelier Peter Zumthor   PartnerIn one column  Mr  Knight called the project  the incredible shrinking museum   noting that he  couldn t name another art museum anywhere that has ever raised hundreds of millions of dollars to spend on reducing its collection space  Including the county s contribution of  117 5 million  the museum has raised  560 million  The county plans to issue a  300 million bond to loan money to Lacma  which Mr  Govan explained would cover expenses until the pledges come in   The museum also receives about 25 percent of its operating costs from the county  Mr  Giovannini wrote that the museum would be assuming an  unprecedented and unconscionable  amount of debt  In his fourth article on the subject in the Los Angeles Review of Books  he notes that Lacma already carries  343 million in debt Addressing the question of how much debt is too much  Mr  Govan cited the institution s  A3 stable rating by Moody s   All big  ambitious architectural projects are controversial   Mr  Govan said in an interview   But the county has done its due diligence  This project has already been through the fire of scrutiny by so many experts and consultants  Responding to complaints about the future of permanent collection galleries  Mr  Govan confirmed that the Zumthor plan does not include  purpose built collection galleries  designed to showcase objects from a particular culture or period but rather seeks to create spaces that are  good for different kinds of art   Then  he said   we can move the art as needed over time as our collections and needs change   He called the decision a philosophical as well as a practical one   The categories museums and universities use for art are not sacred  they are conveniences and need re evaluation all the time  On the issue of shrinking square footage  he countered that he has expanded gallery space significantly with the addition of two exhibition halls designed by Renzo Piano  the Broad Contemporary Art Museum  known as BCAM  and the Resnick Pavilion  that were built on the campus during his tenure  He also cited recent measurements his staff made of the original four buildings that found the new plan decreases gallery space by only 4 000 square feet ImageAn aerial rendering of the footprint of the museum complex  which spans Wilshire Boulevard CreditAtelier Peter Zumthor   Partner   LACMANicolas Berggruen  a museum trustee  who is also building a research group known as the Berggruen Institute near the Getty Center  said focusing on square footage   which shifted over time  in part because of environmental concerns   missed the point  The truth is  something a bit bigger might be better  but it would be a shame not to go ahead with the building   he said   Stopping this project would be bad for the museum and bad for the civic fabric of L A   it would show that L A  can t get its act together in terms of its cultural future  One reason the stakes are so high is that Los Angeles has historically been home to few great examples of public architecture  Many of its most important innovations have been residential  including homes by Frank Lloyd Wright  Rudolph M  Schindler and Richard Neutra  Frank Gehry s Disney Hall  a widely celebrated building that gives Angelenos an image of their own city beyond the Hollywood sign  took over a decade to complete and almost wasn t built for lack of funding  And Rem Koolhaas s proposal to overhaul the Lacma campus  which won a 2001 design competition  failed because of funding challenges Diana Thater  an artist who has exhibited at the museum  said the Zumthor building  which bridges Wilshire Boulevard  could become a major tourist destination   I want L A  to have this building   she said   The city needs a beautiful  memorable museum that people will flock to visit   she added  praising the design for potentially unifying the campus  creating a more expansive  parklike setting and establishing  a horizontality where art from different cultures can be considered simultaneously  These days  when she brings her students from ArtCenter College of Design to visit  she said   I m always apologizing for the condition of things  I m sorry it s not beautiful like Bilbao or the Met  I m sorry the ceilings are cracking  ImageA 2016 plan for the Lacma construction and campus CreditMuseum Associates

the four buildings slated for demolition  three of which were designed by William Pereira in the 1960s  need to be replaced Mr  Zumthor  a Pritzker winning architect  earns accolades for the restrained quality of his buildings and his sensitivity to materials  But some say that his strengths could be a weakness at such a large scale and that he has not built in the United States before The architect has not spoken out much about the project  leaving Mr  Govan to play the advocacy role   He makes extremely beautiful buildings   the museum director said   People say that he doesn t know American building systems  but actually he does  And Skidmore Owings   Merrill  who we ve hired as the project architects  really know them  Demolition of the old buildings is set for early 2020  with the opening of the new building planned for 2024  

 Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio  who announced his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday  is less known than many other candidates in the race But he is hoping to carve out the lane Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio might have filled had Mr  Brown chosen to run  the left leaning populist who can speak simultaneously to an increasingly liberal Democratic base and to the Midwestern workers who voted for President Trump in 2016 Here s a brief look at where Mr  Ryan stands on some prominent issues Economic policyJob creation and the  dignity of work    a phrase Mr  Brown frequently uses and  on Thursday  encouraged Mr  Ryan to focus on   are almost certain to be the centerpiece of Mr  Ryan s campaign  In an interview a few hours after he announced his candidacy  Mr  Ryan said he wanted to address the  economic disorientation  caused by the decline of traditional manufacturing Mr  Ryan said he had decided to enter the race in part because of the recent closing of the General Motors plant in Lordstown  Ohio  which is in his district  In places like Ohio and Michigan  where the auto industry was long the cornerstone of the economy  he said he envisioned jobs in electric vehicle construction and other renewable energy industries Climate changeWith its focus on electric vehicles and renewable energy  Mr  Ryan s economic agenda ties in neatly with combating climate change  He said his policies would go well beyond that but has not yet outlined how He said on Thursday that he would recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement  which President Trump has vowed to abandon  but added that it was  not anywhere close to what we need to do  And while he supports the restoration of Obama era regulations that Mr  Trump is reversing  he added that he wanted to pursue consensus policies that would not be reversed or defunded if partisan control shifted  But it is far from clear what such policies would look like in a political reality in which many elected Republicans have denied the established science of climate change Health careMr  Ryan is generally aligned with the Democratic Party s progressive wing on health care  He is a co sponsor of Representative Pramila Jayapal s  Medicare for all  bill  though he has argued in the past against the term  single payer  health care because he doesn t believe most Americans understand what it means On Thursday  he criticized the United States  current health system as being  focused on disease  at the expense of preventive care  He also touched on mental health care  noting the prevalence of suicide among military veterans GunsA recreational hunter  Mr  Ryan used to have an A rating from the National Rifle Association  But his stance began to change after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 He broke fully from the N R A  after the Las Vegas massacre in 2017  taking the roughly  20 000 the organization s political action committee had given him over the years and donating it to organizations that promote stricter gun laws  He now supports universal background checks  raising the minimum age for certain gun purchases  barring people on terrorist watch lists from buying firearms  and ending the federal ban on funding for research on the causes of gun violence AbortionMr  Ryan used to oppose abortion rights but has since shifted  an evolution he explained in a 2015 op ed  He now has 100 percent scores on his voting record from Planned Parenthood and Naral Pro Choice America He noted on Thursday that he had grown up in an Irish Catholic community where  being pro life was just kind of in the culture   As a congressman  he spoke with many women who had had abortions and concluded that  there s so many complexities to pregnancy that federal laws cannot account for   he said   It needs to be between the woman and the doctor   

LONDON   Two weeks before Britain was originally scheduled to leave the European Union  Jeremy Corbyn  the leader of the opposition Labour Party  was asked on television whether Britain should stay or go  He refused to answer The question came again  and again  and again  and then one last time  He still refused to answer  I want us to have a serious relationship with the E U    he said  gliding past the in or out question that has consumed Britons for the better part of three years But now  with the Conservative government and Labour in talks to devise a deal they can both support  and with yet another deadline looming  Mr  Corbyn s tightrope walk may be near an end Until now  his studied ambiguity has largely held his party together while the Conservatives have crumbled  But having accepted Prime Minister Theresa May s offer to negotiate  he will likely face uncomfortable choices if Mrs  May softens her stance and tries to tempt him with a credible compromise  She s dipping Jeremy Corbyn s hands in the blood  if you like   said Alan Wager  a research associate at The U K  in a Changing Europe  a research organization   That s what Theresa May is aiming to do here  The talks broke off on Friday  with Labour leaders demanding that Mrs  May show greater flexibility  They resumed Monday evening  and Downing Street said the parties would meet again Tuesday But Mr  Corbyn had cautioned that to succeed the  talks have to mean a movement  and so far there s been no change in those red lines  The dilemma for Mr  Corbyn is evident To satisfy Labour members  any agreement he reaches with the prime minister on the terms of Britain s split from the European Union  or Brexit  will have to be accompanied by a public vote on the deal and an ironclad guarantee that it will not be altered by any successor to Mrs  May  Anything less would invite a tidal wave of anger from pro European members of his party ImageOpponents to Britain departing from the European Union demonstrating outside Parliament in London on Monday CreditDaniel Leal Olivas Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesYet  holding out for a second referendum would alienate a significant minority of Labour voters who support leaving the bloc   as well as Labour lawmakers who fear being seen as the party that thwarted Brexit  The much more challenging phase he s into now is making a positive decision in one direction or another and holding that coalition together as it moves from being against something to being in favor of something   said Tom Kibasi  the director of the Institute for Public Policy Research  a liberal research organization Whatever the outcome of cross party talks  Mr  Corbyn s apparent hope that Brexit would eventually fade away in favor of domestic issues looks increasingly misguided  Years of negotiation will follow even if a deal is reached  and there are already signs that voters who backed Labour in 2017 are defecting to smaller and more overtly anti Brexit parties Mrs  May made it more difficult to reach an agreement with Labour when she promised hard liners in her party that she will resign once a deal is reached  That would leave any plan in the hands of her successor and make Mr  Corbyn the only party leader defending a largely unloved compromise in a future general election That would be a difficult position for Mr  Corbyn  a left wing outsider who is known better as a campaigner on social and economic issues than as a political tactician  His official preference has been to negotiate a soft Brexit deal that keeps Britain tied to European economic structures  Corbynism depends on a moral claim to be above normal politics   Glen O Hara  a historian at Oxford Brookes University  said   As soon you get your hands dirty with normal compromise  Corbynism fails  The minimum requirement for a compromise would be Mrs  May agreeing to Labour s demand that Britain remain in a European customs union  Britain would not charge tariffs on European products under such a plan  preserving reasonably frictionless trade in goods with the bloc  Britain s biggest trading partner But any such plan would be enshrined in a nonbinding part of Mrs  May s Brexit deal  the so called political declaration  meaning a successor to Mrs  May could try to undo it in favor of a more complete split from Europe At the same time  Mrs  May faces a convulsion in her own party if she accedes to Labour s demands  with hard line pro Brexit Conservative lawmakers threatening new attempts to oust her ImageThe Labour Party leader  Jeremy Corbyn  speaking in the House of Commons last week CreditUK Parliamentary Recording Unit EPA  via ShutterstockParliament on Monday night passed a bill requiring Mrs  May to seek an extension of the next Brexit deadline  on Friday  to avoid a no deal exit  She had already asked European leaders for a delay until June 30  but lawmakers could try to force her to seek a longer postponement  Mrs  May planned to talk with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Tuesday and then to meet with President Emmanuel Macron of France to try to nail down their support for an extension For Mr  Corbyn  the outlook is not exactly rosy  His favorability ratings are historically low  and he has been buffeted by new accusations that his party allies have dithered when people complain about anti Semitic comments by Labour members Only two months ago several Labour members of Parliament  angered by Mr  Corbyn s equivocation over Brexit and his response to concerns about anti Semitism  broke off to start their own group That seemed to get Mr  Corbyn s attention  and for the first time he backed a second public vote on Brexit  in some circumstances  Some analysts said this was out of character for Mr  Corbyn  a leader who made his reputation as an inflexibly left wing backbench member of Parliament  but that it has paid dividends  He s been surprisingly flexible   Mr  O Hara  of Oxford Brookes University  said   His team has managed to stay so indistinct  and talk to both sides of the debate for so long  just to let the government fall apart  Why would you let your enemy off the hook instead of letting them blow themselves up  Since the Brexit referendum in 2016  Mr  Corbyn  a lifelong skeptic of the European Union  has attracted deep suspicion from those who want to remain in the bloc  who make up the majority of Labour s membership  But senior Labour officials have impressed upon Mr  Corbyn the political advantages of opposing Brexit and supporting a second public vote The party s pro European faction is becoming increasingly confident that he will commit   if he does finally support any compromise   to their position  I think what we re seeing now is the walls are closing in on Corbyn   said Lara Spirit  a founder of a campaign by young people for a second referendum   There is just nothing in it for Corbyn to facilitate a Tory Brexit  Mr  Kibasi  of the Institute for Public Policy Research  said Mr  Corbyn s Euroskepticism had proved to be a political boon  leaving him disentangled from the emotional attachments that might have led another party leader to step into the fray rather than let the Conservative party unravel  He s not clouded by affections for the E U  or its institutions  and in a sense that gives him the ability to think clearly about the best ways to destabilize the government   he said  

JERUSALEM   When will the  deal of the century   as President Trump has called his forthcoming plan for Israeli Palestinian peace  finally be unveiled Certainly not before April 9  when Israel holds its next election  But how soon after   In less than 20 years   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo noncommittally told a congressional committee recently In any case  American peace plans are nothing new  Does anyone recall  for instance  the Rogers Plans  named after Secretary of State William P  Rogers  who served under President Richard Nixon 50 years ago  When the second of his plans was discussed in the Knesset in 1970  one Israeli legislator confidently projected that  it won t be long   a year  a year and a half  two at most   before the thing called  the held territories  is no more  and the Israel Defense Force pulls back into Israel s borders  Needless to say  that  thing  is far from being  no more   While the Rogers Plans have since all but disappeared from memory  erased by a string of plans put forward by successive American presidents  reality in the occupied Palestinian territories didn t simply halt  Israel s occupation has deepened and evolved  Gaza has become the world s largest open air prison  bombed into submission every few years  East Jerusalem was formally annexed by Israel  the West Bank has become an archipelago of Palestinian Bantustans  surrounded by settlements  walls and checkpoints  subject to a mix of state and settler violence  Yet Israel s real feat has not only been achieving all of this but doing so with impunity  triggering minimal consequences from the rest of the world  all the while somehow holding on to its valuable public relations label as a  vibrant democracy  The history of these past 50 years is what we should recognize as the real deal  the one that is already in effect  the deal of the half century  In this deal  as long as Israel advances its occupation enterprise while applying a measure of brutality just below the level that would prompt international outrage  it is allowed to carry on  while still enjoying various international perks justified by grand  but obviously hollow  commitments to   as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently put it   the  shared values of liberty and democracy  ImageElectoral campaign posters bearing the portraits of Israel s prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  left

subjects denied that same right  Israeli settlers in the West Bank don t even need to drive to a polling station inside Israel to vote on their Palestinian neighbors  fate  Even settlers in the heart of Hebron can vote right there  with 285 registered voters  out of a total population of about 1 000 settlers   surrounded by some 200 000 Palestinian nonvoters  Or as Israel calls it   democracy

since the occupation began  and perhaps the one in which Palestinian lives are least discussed   except when tallying up their deaths and celebrating their destruction  Earlier this year  Gen  Benny Gantz  now leader of the new  centrist  party that poses the strongest challenge to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  published a video highlighting how many Palestinian  terrorists  were killed in Gaza in the summer of 2014  when Mr  Gantz was the Army s chief of staff   According to research carried out by the Israeli nonprofit B Tselem  most of those killed by the Israeli army that summer were civilians  among them more than 500 children   For his part  Mr  Netanyahu has promised that if he remains in office the occupation will continue   I will not divide Jerusalem  I will not evacuate any community and I will make sure we control the territory west of Jordan   he said in an interview over the weekend Instead of the rights and freedom of Palestinians  the campaign season has focused on Mr  Netanyahu s likely indictment on corruption charges  But does it really matter to the Palestinian family whose son will be killed with impunity or whose home will be bulldozed if the prime minister responsible for these policies is corrupt or squeaky clean At some point after April 9  we may finally get to see what  deal  the Trump administration has in mind  In fact  one cannot help wondering if it isn t already taking shape before our very eyes  Last May  the Trump administration moved the United States  embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  a few months later  it cut off aid to Palestinians and the United Nations agency serving Palestinian refugees  most recently  it extended recognition of Israel s sovereignty in the Golan Heights  a move celebrated by one Israeli official as a sign of things to come with regards to the future of the West Bank It s hard to see how the  deal of the century  will be anything other than an extension of the deal of the half century  David M  Friedman  the Trump administration s ambassador to Israel  more or less admitted this in an interview with The Washington Examiner  when he said that the administration would  like to see Palestinian autonomy improve significantly  as long as it doesn t come at the risk of Israeli security   But Palestinians deserve full freedom  not an American marketed improved autonomy  which suggests nothing more than prolonging Israel s occupation  That means a future based on neither justice nor on international law  but on more control  oppression and state violence Unless the international community takes the deal of the half century off the table  making Israel finally choose between further oppression of Palestinians and facing real consequences  the occupation will continue  The Trump administration  clearly  isn t up to this task  But the United Nations  including the Security Council  key member states of the European Union   Israel s largest trading partner   and international public opinion all have ample leverage  And Americans who sincerely believe in human rights and democracy  not just as empty slogans or bargaining chips but as genuine demands  need not wait until 2020 to flex their political power Together with the systemic overtaking of lands and the imposition of restrictions on freedom of movement  the denial of political rights was one of the cornerstones of apartheid South Africa  That country  too  considered itself a democracy Many Israelis will consider April 9 a celebration of democracy  It s not  This Election Day should be nothing more than a painful reminder of a deeply undemocratic reality  one that the Trump administration seems pleased to perpetuate   and which the rest of the international community will continue to allow until it finally stops looking the other way  We  the nearly 14 million human beings living on this land  need a future that is worth fighting for  one based on the common humanity of

WASHINGTON   The House will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump s declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border  Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday  the latest in a series of efforts to stop Mr  Trump from securing money that Congress refused to give him for his promised wall  The president s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds  an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority   Ms  Pelosi said in a statement  The House will once again defend our democracy and our Constitution  this time in the courts   she added   No one is above the law or the Constitution  not even the president  The Trump administration has argued that Mr  Trump s moves to spend more taxpayer dollars on border barriers than Congress had agreed to give him are lawful because he is invoking statutes that granted the president the power to move money around under urgent circumstances  Those statutes placed few limits on a president s authority to determine that such situations exist Mr  Trump and his defenders have also noted that presidents have declared national emergencies nearly 60 times since Congress passed the National Emergencies Act in 1976  although critics point out that in no previous such instance did a president invoke extraordinary powers as an end run around lawmakers after failing to win legislative approval for a proposal The lawsuit was authorized by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group  which consists of the top leaders of both parties in the House  Ms  Pelosi  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the majority leader  Representative James E  Clyburn of South Carolina  the majority whip  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader  and Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana  the minority whip The group met briefly on Thursday and voted along party lines to authorize the lawsuit  It is unclear when it will be filed Legal action has been an option for House lawmakers since Mr  Trump declared a national emergency at the southwestern border in February to activate the power to redirect military construction funds  effectively trying to go around Congress s refusal to fund a border wall at the level he had demanded  Both chambers passed legislation that would have ended the national emergency  but Mr  Trump vetoed the bill   the first veto of his presidency   and the House could not muster enough votes to override it On Thursday  a Pentagon spokesman said that final decisions about what military construction projects would have their funds repurposed for his declaration have not yet been made The House will be joining several other lawsuits already filed  Plaintiffs in another suit challenging Mr  Trump s border barrier plans sought on Thursday to expedite obtaining a judicial order to block the government from taking further steps toward building new border barriers   even as administration officials raced to spend what money they had as quickly as they could The plaintiffs   the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition  which are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union   filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would bar the administration from building new barriers near Yuma  Ariz   and El Paso until the litigation can be resolved on the merits  Last month  the Trump administration had identified those sectors as locations for new or replacement barrier projects  while redirecting  1 billion in excess military pay and pension funds for that purpose That part of Mr  Trump s plans relies not on his high profile invocation of emergency powers  but on another component that has received less attention  using the Pentagon s separate authority to redirect some of its annual budget in order to beef up its counternarcotics programs  which in turn can be tapped for blocking smuggling along the border  Because that money must be spent before the fiscal year ends on Sept  30  the administration is trying to move quickly to issue contracts But the A C L U  says that its clients are likely to prevail in their argument that it is unlawful for Mr  Trump to use such tactics to spend more on border barriers than Congress appropriated  Its motion maintains that freezing any further steps toward construction before a final ruling   even as the clock continues to tick toward the end of September   would be justified because any such construction would  among other things   disrupt these ecosystems and cause irreversible damage  That case is pending before a Federal District Court judge in Oakland  Calif   Haywood S  Gilliam Jr   who was appointed in 2014 by President Barack Obama  The plaintiffs have asked him to hold a hearing on the request on May 9

FRANKFURT   Brexit is a major uncertainty overhanging the euro zone economy  European Central Bank ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday  adding that he was  still hopeful  that major disruptions such as breaks in value chains could be averted More than a week after the United Kingdom was originally supposed to have left the EU  Prime Minister Theresa May is seeking a further delay  from April 12 to June 30 As she battles to get a divorce deal ratified by a divided British parliament  it remains unclear how  when or even if Brexit will happen  I think the consequences of Brexit are different whether it is a hard disorderly Brexit or whether it is properly managed with an adequate transition period   Draghi said   They are having votes every day  in the British parliament  so it would not be right to anticipate one thing or another  What is clear however    the whole discussion on Brexit  which has lasted now many years  really  is part and parcel of the overall uncertainty that is hanging over our continent and I think is hanging over the UK as well  The ECB and the Bank of England have so called  swap lines  in place to offer each other s currencies in banks in their respective jurisdictions if money markets freeze up While the relatively large size of the euro zone economy should limit the impact of Britain s break away from the EU  Draghi noted that some members are heavily exposed to the British economy  which could have serious consequences for them and  reverberate around the rest of the continent  He also warned that a break in value chains between Britain and the continent would have  lots of local and possibly serious effects   But again I am still hopeful   Draghi said   Reporting by Francesco Canepa  Editing by Jonathan Cable and Catherine Evans  

BOGOTA   Colombia s lower house on Monday rejected President Ivan Duque s suggested changes to a special tribunal tasked with trying former rebels and military officials for war crimes  the latest in a series of congressional defeats for Duque Duque had asked legislators to review six parts of the law that regulates the Special Jurisdiction for Peace  JEP  court  which was created as part of a 2016 peace deal between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  FARC  rebels But lawmakers defeated the proposal  with 110 voting to turn down the modifications and just 44 backing them  The changes had been widely expected to be defeated because the peace accord is now part of the country s constitution and changes to it require a two thirds majority in the legislature  Duque s coalition has less than half of the seats in the lower house and a slender majority in the Senate Duque was elected on a promise to modify the peace accord  arguing it is too easy on former guerrillas  He asked congress to back better clarification of extradition rules  FARC repayment of conflict victims and to toughen sentencing He also objected to the suspension of investigations by ordinary authorities into cases submitted to the JEP and asked lawmakers to exclude sexual crimes from the tribunal s remit The JEP is meant to investigate  hear prosecutions and sentence those judged responsible for massacres  sexual violence and other crimes during the five decade war between the FARC and the government Duque has struggled since his August inauguration to get legislation approved in a deeply divided congress  His business friendly tax reform proposal was diluted beyond recognition last year  while a justice bill was scrapped and a pension reform delayed until next year   Reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb  Editing by Lisa Shumaker

ATHENS   Greece s prime minister said on Thursday he was struggling to understand Britain s Brexit machinations and was surprised its political system could not find a way out of the crisis Alexis Tsipras   who led Greece when it almost crashed out of the euro zone at the height of its financial travails in 2015   said he had discussed Britain s divorce from the European Union with his visiting Danish counterpart  Of course  Brexit could not be missing from our discussion  I tried to make the Danish PM wiser and he tried to make me wiser on what s going on  I am not sure we managed to have the full picture   Tsipras told reporters  The truth is we are a little bit  err    how should I put it  we feel a bit surprised at the inability of the British political systems to reach a common position  Nearly three years since the United Kingdom shocked the world by voting 52 percent to 48 in a referendum to leave the bloc  it is still unclear how  when or even whether it will set out on its own  Denmark s Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told journalists at the same event that Britain s politicians needed to work together to find a solution   We must pay the necessary attention to avoid a so called hard Brexit   he added  referring to Britain leaving without a deal Greece held a referendum of its own in July 2015 that overwhelmingly rejected the terms of an economic rescue package offered by international lenders  Opposition groups and activists widely accused Tsipras of ignoring the results of that plebiscite when he agreed to even harsher austerity measures a month later   Reporting by Renee Maltezou and Karolina Tagaris  Editing by Andrew Heavens  

For a two hour stretch in a packed Times Square hotel ballroom on Friday morning  the full spectrum of the Democratic Party s stances on racism and racial justice was on display Kamala Harris  the California senator who is seeking to become the first black woman to be elected president  electrified the crowd by declaring that when   not if   she s elected president she would sign a bill to study reparations for black Americans  This is an inflection moment in the history of our country   Ms  Harris said   This is a moment of time where we must restore the significance of truth and justice in this country  John Hickenlooper  a former governor of Colorado  and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  said they would also support such a bill  Mr  Hickenlooper s backing showed how even the most moderate members of the Democratic Party have now adopted the explicit language of racial justice activists  and how the issue of reparations continues to roil the 2020 Democratic primary in ways that few could predict  Slavery is the nagging shame of America   Mr  Hickenlooper said   We must own our past and acknowledge the ongoing consequences of enslaving an entire race of people

founded by the Rev  Al Sharpton  which has become an essential event for Democrats seeking higher office  For the candidates  it was a prime opportunity to speak directly to an influential segment of the black voting bloc that will be a force in next year s presidential primaries  particularly in early voting states such as South Carolina In addition to Ms  Harris  Mr  Hickenlooper  Mr  Sanders and Ms  Warren  the early slate of the conference included speeches from Sherrod Brown  the Ohio senator who declined to run for president  and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  the freshman House member from New York who instantly made an impact on Capitol Hill  We can t sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behind   said Ms  Warren  who used her speech to back another progressive policy idea  the elimination of the Senate filibuster Ms  Warren has sought to boost a campaign that has struggled with fund raising by proposing an expansive policy agenda  On Friday she tried to position her ambitious filibuster position as essential  because Republicans would block most progressive legislation aimed at closing the racial wealth gap Image We can t sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behind   Senator Elizabeth Warren said CreditGabriella Angotti Jones for The New York Times We can t sit around for 100 years while climate change destroys our planet  while corruption pervades every nook and cranny of Washington  and while too much of a child s fate in life still rests on the color of their skin   Ms  Warren said   Enough with that  Ms  Harris  who enjoyed an assumed kinship with the audience because of her identity and historic candidacy  said she would double the size of the Justice Department s Civil Rights Division and focus on white nationalist domestic terrorism  The most liberal candidates  including Mr  Sanders and Ms  Warren  focused their speeches on structural injustices  and how a progressive president could use the power of the federal government to improve historically distressed communities The roster of candidates was a who s who of prominent Democrats  and similarly powerful figures were scheduled to speak later in the day  Presidential candidates from the Senate  including Cory Booker of New Jersey  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York  participated in an afternoon forum with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  Earlier in the week  Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Julin Castro and Beto O Rourke both of Texas also spoke to the largely black audience  Let s call it like it is    Mr  Booker said   Right now in America  we ve come to the distraught present that there are more black men under criminal supervision in our country than all the slaves of 1850  But it was Ms  Ocasio Cortez  the newly elected representative who has become a leader of the party s progressive faction and a favorite target of conservatives  who received a hero s welcome before her remarks  She framed the fight against racism as more than a byproduct of modern political polarization  but a struggle baked into the American story that must be prioritized  She invoked the anniversary on Thursday of the assassination of the Rev  Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr   and the crowd roared in approval  I find so much of this present moment to be a picking up  a revival  of where King left off   Ms  Ocasio Cortez said  before being played off to James Brown   Bigotry  sexism  and xenophobia are the easiest ways to distract from substantive discussions of classism   

Justices O Connor and RobertsTo the Editor I was struck by the contrast between Jeffrey Toobin s review of Evan Thomas s  First  Sandra Day O Connor  and Adam Cohen s review of Joan Biskupic s  The Chief  The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts   March 24  In his review  Toobin carefully analyzes the work of the author by citing numerous examples and has generally avoided any ideological judgments about Justice O Connor On the other hand  Cohen s review contains very little on the merits  or lack thereof  of Biskupic s work and offers many of his opinions about Justice Roberts s ideology It seems to me that Cohen s review would be more suitable as an op ed piece JAMES ROSETTI ATLANTA To the Editor Behind the umpire s mask worn by Chief Justice Roberts is an ideology and countenance like that of Chief Justice Melville Fuller Fuller is famous for leading the Gilded Age court in upholding the doctrine of separate but equal  striking down the federal income tax and habitually ruling against labor Chief Justice Roberts and his four ideological brethren are returning the court to its pre New Deal role as an institution that rules in favor of the powerful against the weak WILLIAM A  HERBERT DELMAR  N Y  To the Editor Evan Thomas s new biography provides valuable insight into how Sandra Day O Connor shaped American history  most significantly as the first woman appointed to the court  Thomas s work is revealing  though he understates O Connor s historic contribution to the rights of L G B T  Americans In 1986  she joined the Hardwick case majority  holding that there was no prohibition on states outlawing same sex relations  By 2003  in the Lawrence case  she not only voted to overturn these very same sodomy laws but wrote a concurring opinion affirming for L G B T  Americans the constitutional right of equal protection  As Thomas indicates  her highly respected  openly gay clerk  Stuart Delery  had helped open her eyes When O Connor married us in the Supreme Court in October 2013  she cast another vote  even though a retired justice by then  with chambers in the court  Significantly  she performed our marriage ceremony almost two years before the court would rule  5 to 4  in the Obergefell decision  that Americans in same sex relationships enjoy the same constitutional right to marry as those in opposite sex relationships  At the time she heard our vows  the District of Columbia had legalized same sex marriage but this was not yet a federally protected right Sandra Day O Connor is very much an American of our time  Perhaps her service as an elected state legislator gave her the gifts of listening and learning from her fellow citizens  L G B T  Americans owe her a debt of gratitude for her recognition that we are not strangers to our own Constitution and should receive its equal protection JEFF TRAMMELL STUART SERKIN WASHINGTON To the Editor If the reviews of books about Sandra Day O Connor and John Roberts are any guide  it can be assumed that Supreme Court justices appointed by Republican presidents will be given a hard time by reviewers for the Book Review While Evan Thomas s  First  appears to be a balanced approach to O Connor  Jeffrey Toobin starts his review by discussing Ruth Bader Ginsburg  appointed by President Clinton  Toobin goes on to lament that  Thomas pretty much lets O Connor off the hook for her shabbiest moment on the court   her decisive role in the 5 to 4 travesty that was Bush v  Gore   In the interest of fairness  Toobin could at least have acknowledged that many people thought the decision in that case was the correct one Adam Cohen s review of the Roberts biography is accompanied by a photograph of an awkward Roberts greeting his young son  and Cohen sums up the book by reminding readers that Roberts  who nevertheless tends to be a highly regarded chief justice   regularly opposes the rights of blacks  gay people  the poor and other relatively powerless groups  Justices O Connor and Roberts deserved better treatment from the Book Review DIANA KLEBANOW QUEENS To the Editor In his excellent review of Evan Thomas s  First   Jeffrey Toobin repeats Justice O Connor s self description as  the Yenta of Paradise Valley   which was intended as a reference to her matchmaking skills The quote and sentiment are no doubt accurate  but the Yiddish is not  Although Yenta was the name of the matchmaker in  Fiddler on the Roof   it actually means  busybody  or  gossip   As any Yiddish speaker would explain  a matchmaker is a  shadkhn  Joseph Stein was obviously being playful when he wrote the script for  Fiddler   Over time  it appears that  yenta  has come to stand for the character s attributes  not unlike Dickens s Scrooge  though with the opposite effect STEVEN LUBET CHICAGOThe writer is director of the Bartlit Center for Trial Advocacy at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law

Hollywood agents have played a number of roles for television writers over the years  For a fee  they have served as dependable friends  occasional therapists and  most important  fierce advocates able to extract large sums from studio executives That relationship has been tested by a large group of TV writers affiliated with the Writers Guild of America who claim that the major talent agencies have been enriching themselves at the expense of their clients  At a time when there are more scripted shows than ever  the writers say  their pay is stagnant or going down The agents counter that they are looking out for their clients in a fast changing business  The current setup  they claim  gives writers the best shot at making big money in a landscape disrupted by the rise of streaming and the mergers of corporate media giants If the two sides prove unable to resolve their differences  the East and West branches of the W G A  have said they will instruct their roughly 13 000 members to fire their agents en masse  The two affiliated unions have given the Association of Talent Agents  a group representing the agencies  a deadline of Saturday at 11 59 p m  Pacific time to pledge that they will change their ways David A  Goodman  the president of the W G A  West  accused the agencies of behaving selfishly   They re not focused on representing talent  and writers are actually earning less   he said   That s why it s a problem now  Chris Silbermann  the managing director of ICM Partners  disputed that view of writers and their representatives   The agents are their best friend   he said   I d argue their wages would be worse if it weren t for agents constantly fighting buyers  My agents spend all day long fighting that good fight  According to the writers  the agencies have unfairly benefited themselves in two ways  The first is by collecting so called packaging fees from the studios  in lieu of a percentage of their clients  compensation Under this practice  which goes back to the days of radio  agencies put together a lineup of their own clients   a group that may include writers  directors and stars   in an effort to get a studio to say yes to a given project The second sticking point has to do with a newer phenomenon  the big agencies  entry into the production business  In recent years  William Morris Endeavor  Creative Artists Agency and United Talent Agency have started functioning more like studios  with the establishment of sibling companies that develop and own content  That means agents may find themselves across the negotiating table from executives who are essentially their colleagues The battle between the writers and the agencies is highly unusual  In previous Hollywood labor disputes  writers have typically gone after the studios ImageChris Silbermann  the managing director of ICM Partners  disputed the view that agents were not looking out for the best interests of writers   The agents are their best friend   he said CreditAngela Weiss Getty Images This is unlike a classic labor dispute where labor is fighting with its employer   said Jonathan Handel  a lecturer at the University of Southern California who has written on labor issues for The Hollywood Reporter   If you think about the questions a newly arrived writer in Hollywood asks  it s   How do I write a good screenplay  How do I find an agent   Now the question they re asking is   How do I fire my agent   More than 100 agencies represent writers  but the consolidation of the major agencies has left four dominant players   William Morris  Creative Artists  United Talent and ICM  The big four account for the bulk of W G A  members  earnings  the guild said Last week  7 882 members of the W G A  West and W G A  East voted in favor of a new code of conduct that would require agencies to get rid of packaging fees and lose any ownership stakes in their clients  shows  392 members voted against the proposition  Before the vote  more than 800 name writers  including J  J  Abrams  Tina Fey and Shonda Rhimes  signed a letter encouraging their fellow members to go along with the plan Some writers have claimed that agencies take packaging fees with little transparency or input from their clients  David Simon  the creator of  The Wire   wrote on his blog about feeling more or less duped into a packaging deal in the 1990s  when his nonfiction book  Homicide  A Year on the Killing Streets  was adapted into an NBC series  Packaging is a lie   Mr  Simon wrote   It is theft  It is fraud  In the hands of the right U S  Attorney  it might even be prima facie evidence of decades of racketeering  Meredith Stiehm  the creator of the CBS hit  Cold Case   which aired from 2003 to 2010  said she discovered a  75 000 per episode fee earmarked for Creative Artists when she was asked to cut the show s budget 134 episodes into its run  She asked Warner Bros   the studio behind the show  if it would cut that fee  only to be told no  she said  Why in the world should my agents make  75 000 per episode on my show   Ms  Stiehm said in an interview   Agencies don t work on television shows  They make the deal in the beginning  and that s it  When the series became profitable  she said  Creative Artists received more money  in addition to the per episode fee   C A A  ended up making 94 cents for every dollar that I earned   she said Ms  Stiehm  a member of the W G A  board  said she had known little about packaging fees at the time   It s complicated to understand  and it s all very hidden   she said Sonya Rosenfeld  a Creative Artists agent who represented Ms  Stiehm  said she had informed her client of the arrangement from the get go  I do find it incredibly hard to believe that a showrunner who had a fiduciary responsibility overseeing a multimillion dollar budget of a series and who looks at a budget every single season would not have known about this until Season 6   Ms  Rosenfeld said ImageMeredith Stiehm  a W G A  board member  said so called packaging fees were  complicated to understand  CreditFrank Micelotta Invision for FXMs  Rosenfeld added that  in her view  Ms  Stiehm benefited from packaging  The agency had paired her with another client  Jerry Bruckheimer  a producer known for blockbuster films and popular TV shows Last month  United Talent released an analysis that writers make more money on packaged series than they do on non packaged programs  And Mr  Silbermann  the ICM agent  said packaging only benefited writers   I m advocating the studio for a better budget  and better license fees  and more episodes from the network   he said The W G A  disputes the idea that packaging is a boon  claiming that the median weekly earnings of its members dropped by 23 percent from 2014 to 2016 Studio executives have largely stayed out of the fracas  as have the actors and directors unions  In interviews  many of the bystanders compared the writers guild s strategy to Brexit   an unyielding stance that could bring on a chaotic future Agencies have pointed to the changing dynamics of the television business in making the case for the status quo  Streaming has ushered in shorter seasons  longer hiatuses and less residual money  with the syndication and DVD markets starting to go dry And the fact that agencies  sibling companies have gone into production should also not be considered a problem  the agents say  After all  the talent and production arms of the companies operate separately Union leaders don t buy those arguments and take particular issue with the idea that the agencies can protect themselves from conflicts of interest as they act more like studios  That an agency is also your boss is something we can t accept   Mr  Goodman said   If your agent is your employer  you don t have an agent  In recent years  some of the major agencies have taken investment from private equity firms and expanded their businesses  Endeavor  the parent company of William Morris  is preparing an initial public offering  The Wall Street Journal reported TV writers have more of a problem with packaging fees and the expanded roles of agencies than screenwriters  For now  the W G A  and the agencies seem to agree that packaging  even with its attendant fees  has helped films   especially independent films   get financed Whatever the W G A  s recommendation on Saturday night  lawsuits could be flying in the coming weeks  I think the only way this is going to be resolved is through litigation   Mr  Handel  the U S C  lecturer  said   I don t see how either side pivots from this  in what could be an epic litigation battle

LUXEMBOURG   France and Germany expressed concern over the independence of Polish courts at a meeting of European Union ministers on Tuesday  keeping up pressure on Warsaw to drop changes to the judiciary that the EU believes undermine the separation of powers Last week  the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Poland over a new disciplinary system for judges  which the Commission argues is meant to scare them into sentencing in line with the wishes of the ruling euro sceptic and nationalist PiS party   We hope that the infringement procedure launched by the European Commission last week regarding the new disciplinary regime for judges will allow some improvements  in particular regarding the right to an effective remedy before an independent and impartial court   a Franco German statement said The Commission  guardian of the EU treaties  has already opened two infringement procedures against Poland  in mid 2017 and in mid 2018  over changes to retirement provisions for Polish judges and the possible impact on their independence Poland is also already subject to an unprecedented EU rule of law procedure  called Article 7 from the article of the EU treaty it is based on  since 2017 over judiciary reforms  The process could in theory result in Poland losing its EU voting rights  though this is unlikely because all other 27 EU member states would have to agree  Hungary  also under the same procedure  has vowed to veto such a move  We want to seize the opportunity     to stress  once again  our concerns regarding the overall situation created by the reform of the judiciary system in Poland   the joint statement said  In our view  the combined effect of the legislative changes could put at risk the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers in Poland   it said Paris and Berlin said concerns over the rule of law in Poland that led to the launch of the Article 7 procedure had not been completely and properly addressed  We reaffirm our support to the Commission in this regard    In view of the recent developments  we propose to hold a new session of the hearing of Poland after the European elections     in June    Reporting by Jan Strupczewski  Editing by Giles Elgood  

WASHINGTON   U S  House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler called on Attorney General William Barr on Thursday to release any summaries of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Trump Russia report that were prepared by Mueller s team  Nadler  a Democrat who is also demanding release of the full Mueller report to Congress  sent a letter to Barr citing media reports that Mueller s team prepared their own summaries of the special counsel s report   If these recent reports are accurate     then those summaries should be publicly released as soon as possible   Nadler said Nadler also called on Barr to produce  all communications  about the Mueller report between the special counsel s office and the Justice Department  including those on Barr s March 24 letter to Congress summarizing the investigation s main conclusions and the disclosure of the report to Congress and the public Thursday s letter surfaced hours after the Justice Department defended its handling of Mueller s report on the investigation of Russian election meddling and contacts between President Donald Trump s 2016 campaign and Russia  The department maintains that Barr must redact confidential and classified information from the nearly 400 page document But news media reports said that members of Mueller s team were unhappy with the way Barr had characterized its main conclusions in his four page summary  The Barr summary said Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia but also did not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice  But Barr said he concluded there was not enough evidence to show that Trump committed the crime of obstruction On Wednesday  the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to authorize Nadler to issue subpoenas for the full report  underlying evidence from the 22 month investigation and documents and testimony from five former Trump aides Congress  not Barr  should determine what gets made public  Nadler said  He has yet to issue a subpoena   We are entitled to that information and we need that information   Nadler told reporters on Thursday   Reporting by David Morgan  editing by Grant McCool  

JERUSALEM   Benjamin Netanyahu s portrayal of Israel as a success story under his leadership and the showcasing of his rapport with U S  President Donald Trump were vital ingredients in his triumphant election campaign The contest was effectively a referendum on Netanyahu s rule as prime minister for the past decade  a test of his personality and character  after Israel s attorney general announced in February he intends to charge him in three corruption cases  In the end  voters kept to the right in granting a fifth term to a leader who has a reputation for getting things done  despite an array of former generals who stood against him    and were dismissed by Netanyahu as the  weak left  Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing and will have the opportunity to plead his case at a pre trial hearing against the filing of potential bribery and fraud charges The veteran leader  who served his first term as prime minister from 1996 to 1999  crafted a bellicose campaign that focused voters on whether they should take a risk on his politically untested challenger  Benny Gantz Gantz  a former military chief  was joined in his centrist Blue and White party by two other prominent Israeli generals  a phalanx of officers that failed to unseat Netanyahu  an ex commando who has held power since 2009 On the campaign trail  Netanyahu  69  dominated the news cycle  springing surprises on his supporters and opponents He went to the United States to get Trump to sign a decree recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  seized from Syria in a 1967 Middle East war and considered by the United Nations to be occupied territory  He visited Russia to thank Moscow for honoring his request to recover the remains of an Israeli soldier lost in Syria With Trump already having recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital  Netanyahu further alarmed Palestinians by announcing during the campaign his intention to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re elected Palestinians seek a state of their own in the West Bank and Gaza Strip  with East Jerusalem as its capital  Israel captured the areas in the 1967 war and pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005  while maintaining a blockade of the enclave On social media  Netanyahu pounded out alerts which included unproved accusations that Iran could blackmail Gantz after hacking his phone  although Tehran denied doing so  Much of the electorate evidently feels there is no worthy rival to  Netanyahu   and his political base does not believe that he is a crook   said Amotz Asa El  a fellow of the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem  Many voters felt more secure keeping in that seat the person who has performed at least reasonably well there  and arguably  more than reasonably well  RIGHT TURNDespite his legal troubles  Netanyahu could bank on an electorate that had largely turned to the right since a 2000 2005 Palestinian uprising He also knew that when it came to trying to build a governing coalition he could rely on a likely alliance with ultra Orthodox parties that have little in common with Israel s secular left wing and are hostile to one of Gantz s partners    former finance minister Yair Lapid  who has been critical of the religious establishment  No one meets Netanyahu s caliber in terms of his political power  assertiveness  his self confidence and courage  No one has achieved that and I can t see anyone getting there   said Judie Raziel  a 60 year old religious Jew who lives in the settlement of Maale Adumim in the West Bank Netanyahu kept his close ties with Trump in the public eye  erecting billboards in big cities showing the two smiling leaders shaking hands  Trump is hugely popular in Israel While Gantz cast himself as a force for national unity  Netanyahu doubled down on divisiveness  He excoriated Gantz as a friend to Israel s 20 percent Arab minority and the darling of liberal media   codes  to many conservative ears  for dangers to the Jewish state Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler of the Israel Democracy Institute deemed the strategy saw  a one to one imitation  of Trump s 2016 presidential campaign   This was about both spreading fear and sowing a victim like mistrust in the democratic institutions  Ofer Zalzberg  a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group  said Netanyahu played to his constituency by portraying any future Palestinian state as a threat to Israel s security That meant  Zalzberg said  that  even those right wing voters frustrated with Netanyahu s conduct went with him   Gantz stopped short of endorsing Palestinian statehood In the final days of the election  Netanyahu launched what Israeli political commentators dubbed a  gevalt strategy   a Yiddish expression for alarm  aimed at motivating complacent supporters to get out and vote or risk his defeat at the hands of a resurgent left wing On election day itself  Netanyahu went to a beach near the coastal city of Tel Aviv  urging sunbathers to get out of the water and save him at the ballot box   posting a video of his appeal on Twitter   The digital effort here was in the micro targeting   getting the  right  people to come out and vote after creating pressure on the Arabs not to   Altshuler said    Additional reporting by Ron Bousso  Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Timothy Heritage  

TEL AVIV   It was a referendum on him and he nailed it  Nobody can take that away from Benjamin Netanyahu  This summer  in his fifth term  he will surpass David Ben Gurion as the longest serving Israeli prime minister  Enough said His victory contains a warning for any Democrat still imagining that the 2020 election will bring an easy victory over Donald Trump  The Netanyahu playbook will be President Trump s next year  Gather nationalist and religious voters in your camp  add in a strong economy  dose with fear  sprinkle with strongman appeal  inject a dash of racism and victory is yours   whatever indictments are looming It s not that this could happen  It will happen  absent some decisive factor to upend the logic of it  Netanyahu is savvier than Trump  but they share a shrewd assessment of how to control and manipulate the politics of spectacle  as well as a fierce determination to stay out of jail  They campaign ugly Exactly a century ago  Ben Gurion said   Everyone sees the difficulty of relations between Jews and Arabs  but not everyone sees there is no solution to that question   Netanyahu s solution is by now clear  He is a true believer in Greater Israel and will not give up one inch of the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River  There will be no Palestinian state on his watch  Period Many Israelis  weary of the chimera of a two state peace  thank him for that   as they thank him for a strong economy  Trump s support and a sense of stability  Netanyahu is a formidable politician adept in using hate and fear  the strongest currency in contemporary politics His victory was personal but it was also structural  Israel now has a structural majority of the right  This will almost certainly enable Netanyahu to form a right wing government  even though his Likud party appeared tied with the Blue and White party of his upstart challenger  Benny Gantz  each winning 35 seats The Gantz performance was remarkable  It demonstrated the deep disquiet of liberal Israel over Netanyahu the King  But in the end Gantz took more votes from the left   the Labor Party and Meretz   than from the right  As Avi Scharf  editor of the English edition of the liberal daily Haaretz  put it to me   Israel s founding left is totally obliterated  The structural majority of the right is composed of the ultra Orthodox  the settler movement  Mizrahi Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent  nationalists of various stripes and Russian immigrants like the one who recently told my friend Shlomo Avineri  a political scientist   I don t want to live under Putin  but I want my leader to be like Putin  Netanyahu never passes up a photo op with Vladimir Putin  any more than he does with Trump   A different league   one of his campaign ads said  Netanyahu was able to project presence among the superpowers  His base loved it  Trump s base loves him  unswervingly  The president is not structurally assured of victory in 2020  but he is structurally within sight of it That Netanyahu is facing indictment on bribery and other charges proved no obstacle to Likud increasing its seats to 35 from 30 in 2015  In the near term  Israeli politics   and its democracy   will hinge on Netanyahu s attempts to secure immunity from prosecution while in office  He may make acquiescence to such legislation a condition for coalition partners joining the government  It will not be pretty  We could see a coup d tat against democracy  something very dangerous   Tom Segev  a prominent historian  told me For now  Israelis seem prepared to shrug  The not with a bang but a whimper conclusion to the Mueller report reinforced a feeling that the cloud of corruption that has hung around Netanyahu for years should not be taken as proof of it In the longer term  Israeli politics will turn to the question of annexation  At the last minute  to shore up the right  Netanyahu promised to start annexing the West Bank if he won another term  The United Right and other extreme parties will not let him forget it Still  there is no reason to take Netanyahu at his word  He made himself kosher with the Obama administration through his Bar Ilan speech of a decade ago supporting a Palestinian state  only to do nothing to favor one and everything to block one Annexation could see the same fate because it s problematic  Netanyahu is happiest in the gray zone where Israel controls millions of Palestinians without having to confront the question of whether they vote or are granted Israeli citizenship  He does not want to jeopardize good relations with Egypt and the Saudis  He s quite happy with a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that once saw itself in the role of leading the way to a Palestinian state but has become the feeble enabler of Israel s gray zone domination Netanyahu s annexation decision may hinge in the end on the long incubated Trump plan for Israel Palestine  It s said to exist  Maybe it really does  God knows  The fact that strong pushback from the United States on partial annexation is no longer assured says it all  The rightist nationalist wave has yet to crest The Times is committed to publishing a

Pascal Siakam confidently launches shots he may not have dared attempt in previous seasons  He makes plays during times of the game when he would have been sitting on the bench The Toronto Raptors forward might be the leading candidate for the most improved player award and he d like to win it  But he s already received recognition that means more to him Fellow players have noticed how much work he s put in and how much it has paid off this season  The acknowledgement from All Stars such as Paul George and Bradley Beal shows that Siakam s giant leap has caught the attention of more than just the media panel that votes for the NBA awards  I just enjoy sometimes after the games  guys coming up to me and showing respect for me  That s the most important thing   Siakam said   Like  I don t care about the rest  I think when your peers respect your game and respect the fact that they ve seen you work  I think that s more important  There s a lot for them to have noticed  including   Siakam s scoring  It is up from 6 0 points per game through his first two seasons to 17 0 this season   His 3 point shooting  That s jumped from 21 6 percent to 36 8 percent A player who was feared almost entirely for his work around the basket now has to be accounted for even when he s away from it  Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson called Siakam an X factor who now demands a much bigger part of the scouting report  It changes because he s shooting the ball better   Atkinson said   I think at first you could ignore his shot  Now it s like you ve got to respect him from 3 and I know he s worked on it extremely hard  so that changes it  You could be in the paint  wait for his drives  You still have to respect  that  but I think he keeps getting better and better  D Angelo Russell  Atkinson s All Star point guard  might be the other top candidate for most improved player after leading the Nets to a surprising playoff berth  Sacramento s De Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield  Denver s Malik Beasley and the Clippers  Montrezl Harrell are some other players worthy of consideration But of them  Siakam has the biggest role on the team with the best chance to be playing into June The Raptors made major changes after they were swept out of the postseason by LeBron James and Cleveland in consecutive years  Dwane Casey was fired even after winning coach of the year honors  and All Star DeMar DeRozan was dealt to San Antonio in the trade to bring in Kawhi Leonard The Raptors have come back with 57 wins and the second best record in the East  with Siakam s growth central to their success  He can play in a traditional big lineup alongside Leonard and center Marc Gasol  or in a smaller one if they go with Serge Ibaka in the middle The athleticism was always there for the 6 foot 9 forward  But now it s only part of the package for a player who made one 3 pointer his entire rookie season in 2016 17 and now averages one per game  the easiest place to notice his improvement  I don t know who else is even really up for it  who the voting s between  all that stuff  I know that if anybody s done more than this kid  has improved more  has impacted the team more and continued to improve from even geez  20 games ago   Raptors coach Nick Nurse said   He just keeps taking another step forward  there has been no steps back  He s certainly deserving  If there s somebody else who is deserving  then sometimes that s the way it works  But he s had an unbelievable season  Soon it will be time for the Raptors to show how much they ve improved along with him  They became postseason punching bags the last couple years who want to show they won t be pushed around any longer  We have a new group so it s going to be definitely tough and I think we re more focused on that   Siakam said   Obviously we think about the playoffs  we re excited about it  can t wait for it  We just want to make sure we get the right chemistry and everything going so when that time comes  we ll be ready to perform  He got into only two playoff games two years ago  when the native of Cameroon was still learning the game  It was only five years earlier when he had come through the Basketball Without Borders camp in Africa  then headed to Texas for prep school and onto New Mexico State before becoming a late first round pick He s not sure if friends back home are aware of his success  But if he wins the Most Improved Player award  chances are they ll hear about it  I m definitely not a personal type guy where I care about personal accolades and stuff  but definitely a team guy first   Siakam said   Something like that  in terms of who I am and the person that I ve become  and people that know my story and how I came up  that would mean a lot just because that s me  Like  that s literally who I am as a player and as a person         

WASHINGTON   The Treasury Department allowed the influential Russian oligarch Oleg V  Deripaska to satisfy the terms of his divorce by transferring tens of millions of dollars in stock to benefit his children as part of a deal to lift United States sanctions on his corporate empire  according to the Trump administration and an interview with Mr  Deripaska The deal  announced by the Trump administration in December without publicly disclosing its details  included a clause providing for the completion of a transfer of 10 5 million shares of Mr  Deripaska s main holding company  EN   to a trust fund for the two teenage children he had with his former wife  Polina Yumasheva The couple divorced last year  and their settlement  which called for him to provide funds for their children  was finalized before Mr  Deripaska and his companies were sanctioned in April 2018  according to representatives of the Treasury Department  Mr  Deripaska and EN  The transfer has drawn the ire of Senator Ron Wyden  Democrat of Oregon  who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee  which has jurisdiction over the Treasury Department  He said in a letter sent late last month to Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  that the transfer of the EN  shares   which had a value of more than  78 million at the close of business on Monday    constitutes a clear benefit to Deripaska and his children   and conflicts with Treasury Department claims that neither would benefit from the sanctions relief deal The sanctions were intended to punish seven oligarchs and their companies   including Mr  Deripaska  EN  and the giant aluminum company it controls  Rusal   for their affiliations with a Russian government that  engages in a range of malign activity around the globe   including election interference  Mr  Mnuchin said at the time When the Treasury Department announced the deal with Mr  Deripaska s companies to lift the sanctions  it cast the move as an effort to stabilize global aluminum markets roiled by the sanctions  and said that Mr  Deripaska would not personally benefit  As part of the deal  he agreed to relinquish control of the companies and sell off a significant portion of his ownership  with proceeds going into blocked accounts that he would not be able to access But members of Congress on both sides of the aisle blasted the deal as soft on Russia  and unsuccessfully tried to block it from going into effect  Those concerns were inflamed further when it was revealed that the confidential  legally binding document detailing the agreement showed that Mr  Deripaska and his allies would retain majority ownership of EN  The agreement specified that 1 64 percent of the shares of EN  would be transferred to an entity called the Liberi Foundation  for which there was no easily traceable public record  After receiving inquiries from journalists  EN  officials said Liberi was a trust fund for Mr  Deripaska s children But when asked by Mr  Wyden at a Senate Finance Committee hearing late last month about the arrangement  Mr  Mnuchin said of Mr  Deripaska that  his children did in no way benefit from sanctions relief  A Treasury Department spokeswoman sought to clarify Mr  Mnuchin s statement last week  saying that  Deripaska s children were legally entitled to shares stemming from a divorce settlement that predated the sanctions  Larissa Belyaeva  a spokeswoman for Mr  Deripaska  said in a statement that he  disclaimed all rights to claw back those shares  She added   Nor did his children benefit as all that was honored was a pre existing legal entitlement to settle shares as part of a divorce settlement  She said the votes from the shares would be cast by independent trustees appointed by the Treasury Department Independent trustees also will control the votes associated with shares owned by other people or entities with connections to Mr  Deripaska  They include his charitable foundation  his former wife  her father and a family linked firm called Orandy Capital Limited  as well as shares being transferred to VTB  a Russian government owned bank under limited United States sanctions that had lent Mr  Deripaska large sums of money And in a rare interview late last month  Mr  Deripaska said of the transfer to Liberi   It s a small portion of the shares  And it was part of my settlement with my wife  which was set long before  Last month  Mr  Deripaska sued the Treasury Department and its officials  including Mr  Mnuchin  to reverse the sanctions that remain in place on him personally  claiming that he was deprived due process and that the sanctions cost him billions of dollars and made him  radioactive  in international business circles In the interview with The New York Times  he blasted the sanctions as targeting him solely because he was a prominent Russian who has  a popular brand in the U S  He accused the Treasury Department of misrepresenting him in its justification for the sanctions  In announcing the sanctions  the department had noted that  Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state  Mr  Deripaska explained the statement to mean that  it was just who I am   I am Russian   he said   And unfortunately  I was sanctioned because I am Russian  He added   I m not planning to leave Russia to buy a hockey club  a football club  to spend crazy money on luxury things outside my country  I spend most of my time here  My kids are here  And my future also will be in Russia   

My mother is a devout Democrat  but also one of the most socially conservative people I know  This is typical of our home state of Louisiana among black citizens   they can be as conservative as any Republican  but are also completely convinced  by dint of history and experience  that the Republican Party not only abides racists  it courts them  and therefore they would die rather than vote red My mother is so austere that she never drank or partied in any way  except for the one time she told me that she went to a nightclub and tried a drink  She didn t much like the dingy space or the bitter beverage  so she swore them both off She abhorred the showy  deeming it vulgar  so every single article of clothing in her closet was white  black  brown or navy blue  Red  Yellow  Green  God forbid And she was unshakable in her sense of moral rectitude  viewing sins like lying  gambling and philandering as absolute corruptions of character And yet  through my time growing up there and going to college there  she took a devilish pride in enthusiastically supporting and voting for the four term Democratic governor  Edwin Edwards  a cocksure  gambling womanizer who would end up in federal prison in 2002 for bribery and extortion On the surface  it doesn t make sense that my mother  who thought herself a moralist  would find a champion in a flaunting immoralist  but she did as did many other Louisiana voters  And I believe this was possible because Edwards achieved something that few politicians achieve  He transcended the political  and on some level even the rules of the workaday world  and entered the astral league of folk heroes The rules don t apply to the folk hero  People don t measure them by the same tape  Behavior that people would never condone in their personal lives  they relish in the folk hero I believe that the great miscalculation people make in trying to understand Donald Trump and the cultlike devotion of the people who follow him is that they continue to apply the standard rules of analysis  I believe that  like Edwards  Trump ascended to folk hero status among the people who like him  and so his lying  corruption  sexism and grift not only do no damage  they add to his legend The folk hero  whether real or imaginary  often fights the establishment  often in devious  destructive and even deadly ways  and those outside that establishment cheer as the folk hero brings the beast to its knees The only vulnerability the folk hero has is an exposed betrayal of the folk  Trump fawns over his base  and they reciprocate Edwards once joked on the eve of one of his elections   The only way I can lose this election is if I m caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy   He won  of course  This is not wholly unlike Trump joking   bragging    that  I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn t lose any voters  O K    He won  of course I think it is a mistake to believe that Trump s supporters don t see his lying or corruption  They do  But  to them  it is all part of the show and the lore  They have personal relationships and work relationships like the rest of us  and those relationships depend on honesty and virtue  They  like my mother did  are allowing in him something that they would not allow in themselves And  when you survey the constellation of folk heroes  you see that many have been criminals  Bonnie and Clyde  John Dillinger  The Sundance Kid I would also argue that some other recent troubled  corrupt or corrosive politicians came close to the definition without receiving the designation  The former Washington  D C   mayor  Marion Barry  The former Toronto mayor  Rob Ford  The former Maine governor  Paul LePage And this elastic morality around the folk hero appears to be a global human inclination  El Chapo  who  as CNN pointed out   Claimed in 2014 that he has killed 2 000 3 000 people   was a folk hero in Mexico Like Edwards and Bonnie and Clyde and El Chapo  Trump s Br er Rabbit like ability to avert the best attempt by authorities to hold him accountable  at least for a while  only increases the chorus of applause Perhaps one of the most popular folk heroes in the world is mythological  Chinese folklore s Monkey King The British Council wrote of his legend  Despite his superpowers  at the heart of the Monkey King s appeal is his human fallibility   he is greedy  selfish  and prone to sudden changes of mood and outbursts of exceptional violence  He defies divine authority  laughs at attempts to be controlled  and leaves chaos in his wake  But we know that there is fundamental good within him  He is the misbehaving child who only needs a firm hand and a sense of purpose to come good  Sound familiar Anti Trump forces must stop operating as if they are doing battle with a liar  they are doing battle with what his supporters have fashioned into a legend  How does one fight a fiction  a fantasy  That s the question  Its answer is the path to America s salvation The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some

BRUSSELS   Telecoms lobbying group GSMA stepped up pressure on Tuesday on EU lawmakers to reject a European Commission push for a wifi based standard for cars  saying that it was an old technology that would not reduce road accidents The issue has divided the auto and tech industries and spawned fierce lobbying from both sides eyeing a share of a potentially lucrative market for internet connected cars  The critique from GSMA  whose members include Deutsche Telekom  Orange  Vodafone and AT T  came ahead of a make or break vote at the European Parliament next week  A key committee of EU lawmakers on Monday rejected the Commission s proposal The Commission s preference for the wifi based ITS G5 has won backing from Volkswagen and Renault   GSMA  together with Daimler   Ford   PSA Group  Qualcomm and Samsung   endorse a rival 5G standard  The Commission s decision will impact makers of telecoms companies providing the equipment for high speed networks ITS G5 wifi based technology primarily connects cars to other cars  The rival fifth generation  or 5G  standard hooks up to both cars and devices in the surrounding environment  with a wider range of applications in areas such as entertainment  traffic data and general navigation where data speeds or signal failure are less of an issue However companies have not publicly argued in detail that one technology is better than the other  instead focusing on costs and what they are best placed to deliver Mats Granryd  GSMA s director general  wrote in a letter to Parliament that the Commission proposal would not improve road safety  This wifi standard was developed over a decade ago for the ITS G5 framework  Despite being ready for many years  it has seen very little commercial deployment so far   he said  Granryd said that the alternative 5G was already commercially available globally since last year and gaining popularity as the standard for short  and long range communications  with BMW  PSA and Ford ready to roll out 5G equipped cars  A majority of EU lawmakers would need to block the Commission s plan  The next hurdle would be the European Council where a blocking majority would also be required to overturn the proposal    Reporting by Foo Yun Chee  Editing by Robin Emmott and Frances Kerry

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Friday called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and take additional steps to stimulate economic growth  his latest attempt to put the traditionally independent central bank under his thumb Speaking to reporters before traveling to the southwestern border  the president once again criticized the Fed s interest rate increases in 2018  saying  they really slowed us down   Mr  Trump  who is presiding over one of the longest sustained economic expansions in United States history  also said the Fed should do more to give the economy a lift   including resuming a stimulus program that he opposed when it began under President Barack Obama Mr  Trump s comments came on the same day the Labor Department reported strong job growth  with employers adding 196 000 jobs last month  His remarks also coincide with his efforts to install allies at the Fed as he heads into a re election campaign that will largely be a referendum on the state of the economy  While the economy is still strong and unemployment remains low  the effects of the president s  1 5 trillion tax cut are waning and his trade war has begun to hurt some American industries  as well as contributing to slower growth in China  Most forecasters see growth slowing this year  though Mr  Trump s economic advisers continue to see it speeding up But the president appears to be taking no chances  On Friday  he escalated his previous critiques of the Fed by pressing for it to resume the type of stimulus campaign it undertook after the recession to jump start economic growth  That program  known as quantitative easing  resulted in the Fed buying more than  4 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities as a way to increase the supply of money in the financial system  As the economy recovered  the Fed began to reverse that program  slowly winnowing its portfolio of bonds in a process known as quantitative tightening  Well I personally think the Fed should drop rates   Mr  Trump said   I think they really slowed us down  There s no inflation  I would say in terms of quantitative tightening  it should actually now be quantitative easing  Very little if any inflation  And I think they should drop rates  and they should get rid of quantitative tightening  You would see a rocket ship  Despite that  we re doing very well  The Labor Department s numbers signal a rebound from an unexpectedly lackluster February  It was the 102nd straight month of job gains  Wages were also up  with average hourly earnings in March 3 2 percent higher than a year earlier  And unemployment remained low at 3 8 percent  Read more about the March jobs report  which showed a return to solid growth  The president has become increasingly bold in his efforts to influence the Fed  which he and his advisers blame for economic growth falling short of the 4 percent annual rate last year as he promised  He has repeatedly criticized his handpicked Fed chairman  Jerome H  Powell  and has described the central bank as a counterweight to his economic policies The Fed raised interest rates four times last year  to the current range of 2 percent to 2 25 percent  drawing frequent rebukes from Mr  Trump  Such criticism is unusual for presidents  who typically avoid commenting on monetary policy But the Fed has since diverted from what had been a steady march of interest rate increases  in the face of stock market turmoil  growing domestic and global economic risks and pressure from Mr  Trump  The central bank does not expect to increase rates at all this year and has cut its growth projections to 2 1 percent for 2019 As he enters the 2020 campaign  Mr  Trump is banking on a much faster pace of growth than the Fed and most outside economists say is likely  Global growth is moderating  with slowdowns in Europe and China underway  And there are signs of weakness in the United States  where chief executives see investment  hiring and sales growth all slowing this year and business economists say the risks of undershooting economic growth are higher than overshooting Democrats denounced Mr  Trump s comments  saying they showed his disregard for the traditional independence of the Fed and his desire to use its powers to help him win re election  There s no question that President Trump is seeking to undermine the long term stability of the economy and independence of the Federal Reserve to boost his own re election prospects   said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the top Democrat on the Finance Committee Larry Kudlow  Mr  Trump s top economic adviser  said on Friday that the president was concerned about a global slowdown and wanted the Fed ensure the American economy continued to grow  We are facing a worldwide slowdown  You know  recession  arguably   Mr  Kudlow said in an interview on Bloomberg TV   Europe is not doing well  Germany itself may be in recession  That troubles us  Mr  Kudlow denied that the president was trying to infringe on the Fed s independence and said he simply wanted it to keep things thriving  We re not pressuring  We re not going after their independence   he said   We just don t want any threats to this rebuilding  reviving  growing economy  But in recent days  Mr  Trump has made it increasingly clear that he will do what it takes to keep the Fed heading in the direction he wants The president said on Thursday that he planned to nominate Herman Cain  a Republican who abandoned his 2012 presidential campaign in the face of sexual harassment allegations and who started a political action committee to combat what he claims is  misinformation  about Mr  Trump  to a seat on the Fed s seven member board  Mr  Trump also plans to nominate Stephen Moore  an adviser and conservative economist who has become a vocal critic of the Fed s interest rate increases Those selections are a marked shift from his previous nominations to the board  The president has tended to tap largely conventional candidates  not loyalists or those with starkly contrarian views  His choice of Mr  Powell for chairman was seen as a vote for consistency on the Fed  given Mr  Powell s approach was expected to be   and indeed has been   in line with his predecessor  Janet L  Yellen  who called for a moderate pace of rate increases Mr  Trump s three other Fed appointments have also been fairly unsurprising   Richard Clarida  whom he appointed as vice chairman  was a Columbia University economist and a scholar in monetary policy  Randal K  Quarles  who oversees bank supervision  worked in the financial industry and at the Treasury Department in previous Republican administrations and Michelle W  Bowman was the state bank commissioner of Kansas Wall Street analysts  economists and at least one Republican senator warned on Friday that Mr  Trump s choice of political actors could wind up compromising the Fed in a way that could be detrimental to the health of the economy  In our view  the selections could raise questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and could be perceived as an attempted politicization of monetary policy   researchers at Barclays wrote in a note to clients  adding   the experience of each candidate does not seem to be the main reason the Trump administration is considering their nominations  Senator Mitt Romney of Utah  who ran against Mr  Cain for the Republican nomination  told Politico that he would prefer nonpolitical appointees  I would like to see nominees that are economists first and not partisans  I think it s important that the Fed be a nonpartisan entity   Mr  Romney said   The key is that someone is outside of the political world and is an economic leader  not a partisan leader  It is unclear whether Mr  Moore or Mr  Cain  who are still undergoing background checks and have yet to be formally nominated  will be confirmed by the Senate  Mr  Trump has previously faced pushback on two of his Fed choices  neither of whom were considered highly contentious but nonetheless failed to gain traction Nellie Liang  an economist and financial regulation expert  withdrew from consideration after financial industry lobbyists worked against her nomination and Senate Republicans made clear they would not vote to confirm her  And Marvin Goodfriend  a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a former monetary policy adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond  Va   languished in the last Congress after lawmakers questioned his previous views on inflation For now  most Senate Republicans have said they will wait for confirmation hearings before determining their votes Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the Republican leader  has remained mum on both selections for the Fed  But aides and senators close to Mr  McConnell said that he had made it clear that he had no intention of moving ahead quickly with either nomination  giving the president and his staff ample time to vet both men and consider other candidates

BRUSSELS   The chairman of European Union leaders Donald Tusk is likely to offer Britain a flexible extension of the date of the country s exit from the EU of up to one year  with the possibility of leaving sooner  a senior EU official said The official said the option could be presented to British Prime Minister Theresa May at the EU summit on Brexit on April 10th in Brussels  If May accepted  Britain would have to hold elections to the European parliament in May  the official said  The only reasonable way out would be a long but flexible extension  I would call it a  flextension    the official said  We could give the UK a year long extension  automatically terminated once the Withdrawal Agreement has been accepted and ratified by the House of Commons   the official said  And even if this were not possible  then the UK would still have enough time to rethink its Brexit strategy  A short extension if possible  and a long one if necessary  It seems to be a good scenario for both sides  as it gives the UK all the necessary flexibility  while avoiding the need to meet every few weeks to further discuss Brexit extensions   he said Britain s exit from the EU  nearly three years since the country voted to leave the bloc  is now in doubt because the British parliament cannot decide what exit terms it wants  just a week before the current Brexit date of April 12 May offered to quit to get her deal passed but it was defeated for a third time last Friday  the day Britain was originally due to leave the EU  She is now in talks with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to find a way out of the deadlock  but it is not clear if they can find a solution in the next few days  A request for an extension  if May makes one  would have to be backed by sound arguments why the EU should grant it  officials said  Britain s BBC reported that May would make such a request on Friday  If we are not able to understand the reason why the UK is asking for an extension  we cannot give a positive answer   French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters in Bucharest  when asked about the possible 12 month extension   Reporting By Jan Strupczewski and Francesco Guarascio  Editing by Hugh Lawson  

WASHINGTON   As a religious gay man who believes his party has ceded discussion of religion and spirituality to Republicans  Pete Buttigieg  a Democratic candidate for president  is talking about God and sexuality in an unconventional way  He is using the language of faith to confront the Christian right on territory they have long claimed as their own Mr  Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   has provoked a backlash from conservatives in the last few days after questioning the moral authority of evangelicals like Vice President Mike Pence who remain silent about President Trump s personal conduct yet disapprove of same sex marriages and oppose gay rights  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  Though many conservatives were initially reluctant to engage Mr  Buttigieg because they feared it would only add to his growing stature as a 2020 contender  they jumped on his latest comments  Some suggested he was attacking the vice president to further raise his profile  Others challenged Mr  Buttigieg s understanding of Christianity and accused him of smearing the religious convictions of the very people he wants to win over A devoted Episcopalian who fluidly quotes Scripture and married his husband  Chasten  in a church service last year  Mr  Buttigieg is making the argument that marriage is a  moral issue   In a speech on Sunday to the Victory Fund  a group that supports gay  lesbian  bisexual and transgender politicians  he said his relationship had made him  more compassionate  more understanding  more self aware and more decent  He then directly addressed Mr  Pence  as one man of faith talking to another   And yes  Mr  Vice President  it has moved me closer to God  This is not the domain where social conservatives and gay rights advocates are used to doing battle  In the decade and a half since same sex marriage became a galvanizing issue for both sides  the national debate has largely focused on the tension between civil rights and individual freedoms Mr  Buttigieg has reframed it in religious terms  raising questions about God  morality  sexuality and intolerance that depart from the familiar left right fault lines  That quickly caught the attention of Republicans and conservative media commentators  who tried to cast his remarks as an unprovoked attack on faith abiding Christians Karen Pence  the vice president s wife  insisted Tuesday that her husband has no quarrel with Mr  Buttigieg   I don t think the vice president does have a problem with him   she said in an interview with Fox News radio   I think in our country we need to understand you shouldn t be attacked for what your religious beliefs are   she added  noting that the speech was probably  helping Pete to get some notoriety  Mr  Buttigieg  who has been mayor of South Bend since 2012  had a friendly working relationship with Mr  Pence while Mr  Pence was governor of Indiana  They toured factories together and occasionally exchanged text messages ImageMr  Buttigieg has reframed the fight over gay rights in religious terms  raising questions about faith  tolerance and morality that depart from the familiar left right fault lines CreditBizuayehu Tesfaye Las Vegas Review Journal  via Associated PressBut Mr  Buttigieg has cited Mr  Pence s support for legislation that made it easier for religious conservatives to refuse service to gay couples as a reason he decided to come out publicly in 2015 Mr  Pence s office responded to Mr  Buttigieg s comments this week by releasing an old video clip in which he praised the mayor as a  dedicated public servant and a patriot   Mr  Buttigieg s ramped up attacks on Mr  Pence have miffed the vice president  who has privately told allies that if Mr  Buttigieg had questions about his religious beliefs  he could have asked him at any time during their friendship The issue followed the vice president to the United Nations on Wednesday  where reporters shouted questions at him about whether being gay was a choice  Mr  Pence walked away without answering In an interview with CNBC that aired Thursday  Mr  Pence addressed Mr  Buttigieg s criticism by saying that the mayor  knows me   and suggested that repeated questioning of his beliefs were a way for Mr  Buttigieg to gain traction in a crowded field  My family and I have a view of marriage that s informed by our faith   Mr  Pence said   But that doesn t mean that we re   that we re critical of anyone else who has a different point of view  The reaction from other conservatives has been less measured  A Fox News host  Todd Starnes  accused the mayor of wanting  to shove evangelical Christians into the closet  Erick Erickson  an evangelical blogger  said that Mr  Buttigieg s comments about religious conservatives who support Mr  Trump suggest that he  would be O K  with using the government to persecute Christians   After Mr  Buttigieg spoke about his beliefs in an interview with USA Today  Mr  Erickson wrote a blog post headlined   Mayor Pete Buttigieg Apparently Thinks Jesus Would Be Okay With Beastiality    Mr  Buttigieg actually said nothing on that subject  though he did quote a favorite Bible verse   And when you pray  do not be like the hypocrites  for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others   Mr  Buttigieg has provoked a mixture of concern  derision and faint admiration from conservatives  Some built him up early as an undeniable but stealth force in the race  Rush Limbaugh warned his listeners that someone as articulate  personal and seemingly reasonable as Mr  Buttigieg would be a strong opponent  Ben Shapiro  the writer and podcast host  argued that he was the candidate who could most likely beat Mr  Trump   Really  He s not crazy  he s from the Rust Belt  he served in Afghanistan   Mr  Shapiro wrote on Twitter But this week provided a moment of clarity on the right  and the backlash was a reminder of how galvanizing religion and homosexuality can be when evangelicals and other conservatives of faith are convinced that their values are under attack  This sentiment  which was stoked by Mr  Trump and his allies in the Christian right in 2016  was a major factor in the president s huge margins with white evangelicals  Eighty one percent voted for him  compared with 16 percent for Hillary Clinton Indeed  if Mr  Buttigieg continues to gain in the polls  it could prompt the religious right to draw attention to numerous comments he has made about evangelicals and Mr  Trump    the hypocrisy is unbelievable   he said on NBC s  Meet the Press  this week   as conservatives did after Mrs  Clinton called Trump voters a  basket of deplorables  ImageMr  Buttigieg and Mike Pence in 2015  when Mr  Pence was governor of Indiana  Mr  Buttigieg has challenged the moral authority of evangelicals like Mr  Pence who disapprove of same sex marriages CreditRobert Franklin South Bend Tribune  via Associated PressRalph Reed  the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition  said Mr  Buttigieg s approach struck him as odd given how so much of his message has been focused on unity and restoring the Democratic Party s relationship with voters who are more religious and conservative   It seems to me the solution to that is not to attack the faith of anyone else  whether it is the president  the vice president or anyone else   Mr  Reed said   The solution should be to talk about their own faith  Mr  Buttigieg s words suggest that he will spend little effort trying to entice any of the president s most loyal religious supporters  But by pushing the discussion of homosexuality and marriage toward morality and the Bible  he is opening a door to voters of faith who are turned off by the dominance of the Republican Party s far right but are not yet convinced they could vote for a Democrat That approach would be similar to the one Barack Obama took in 2008 when he received 26 percent of the white evangelical vote  Mr  Trump s approval rating among white evangelicals has remained high   69 percent as of January  according to the Pew Research Center  But that has slipped 9 points since his inauguration Some evangelical Christians say that the fracture over Mr  Trump within their community runs so deep that the desire for an alternative   especially one like Mr  Buttigieg  who is so temperamentally different from the profane  brash and unpredictable president   will remain strong Pete Wehner  an evangelical who worked in the George W  Bush White House and has split with his community and his party over Mr  Trump  said the way Mr  Buttigieg speaks with ease and familiarity about Christianity is a trait many voters will find to be a welcome contrast with the president  It s not a foreign language to him like it is to Donald Trump  so you re not going to get  Two Corinthians  from him   Mr  Wehner said  referring to Mr  Trump s flub of the Bible book properly referred to as  Second Corinthians   He speaks about faith in a way that is largely nonthreatening and not filled with anger   Mr  Wehner added   That is a real opening  But the unflagging devotion that most white evangelicals have for the president suggests that many will be far more concerned with policy results like conservative Supreme Court justices than with electing someone who speaks their language  The relevant question for Mr  Buttigieg is whether there is a critical mass of those who are wavering  Mayor Pete could not have hoped to capture conservative Christian voters or moderate Christian voters at any point in modern American history   until now   said Jonathan Merritt  an evangelical author and speaker who disagrees with the decision by evangelical political leaders to stand by the president Mr  Merritt  who believes the taint of hypocrisy has turned many young evangelicals like him away from traditional leaders  said he remembers growing up in the South when antipathy toward President Bill Clinton and his personal conduct was running hot The line he remembers seeing and hearing over and over  he said  was  character matters   

MADRID   Spain s left wing parties could win a majority in elections on April 28  although that is not guaranteed  while right wing parties look set to fall short under any scenario  according to an opinion poll on Tuesday Spain is facing one of its most bitterly fought parliamentary elections in decades  and polls have been suggesting for weeks that the result is too close to call The state run Centre for Sociological Studies  CIS  is forecasting a wide range of 157 181 seats for the ruling Socialists together with the anti austerity Podemos and smaller left wing allies Under the best case scenario  they would together secure a majority in the 350 seat parliament But they might not be able to rule on their own and would have to seek allies among regional parties in Catalonia or the Basque country  a difficult undertaking that would require lengthy talks The election is expected to mark a watershed in Spain s democratic history as a far right party looks set to win seats for the first time in four decades The CIS poll  the last before the election  sees that party  Vox  gaining 29 to 37 seats The conservative People s Party is seen getting 66 76 seats and the center right Ciudadanos 42 51  This means that the poll does not see the three right wing parties winning a majority of seats  even under the most optimistic scenario A Ciudadanos Socialist alliance would theoretically get a majority  but Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera has ruled out such a pact The poll also indicated that one in four voters had not yet decided who to vote for  and more than eight percent gave no answer  showing that things could still change Spanish pollsters have traditionally struggled to predict seats for smaller or new parties such as Vox  and they disagree on what the outcome will be  https   tmsnrt rs 2ENugtw CIS polled 16 194 people from March 1 18  after Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called the snap election The poll shows important changes in seats for most parties  The Socialists would see a big jump from their current 84 seats to 123 138  while the conservative People s Party could lose about half its seats Podemos and regional offshoots would see their seats drop from 71 to a maximum of 43   Reporting by Ingrid Melander  Paul Day  Belen Carreno  Editing by Giles Elgood

ImageInactive Candida auris seen on a screen  The deadly fungus is impervious to major antifungal medications CreditMelissa Golden for The New York TimesThe quiet spread of a lethal fungusA tenacious fungus called Candida auris  which can kill people with weakened immune systems  has appeared in countries around the world over the past five years  The U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has deemed it an  urgent threat   Hospitals and governments are reluctant to disclose outbreaks  and a hushed panic is playing out  Here are some basic facts about the fungal infection Big picture  Antibiotics are credited with saving tens of millions of lives  Health experts have long warned that their overuse was helping spawn drug resistant bacteria  and now scientists are seeing an explosion of resistant fungi as well Another angle  Antibiotics have never been more accessible to the world s poor  thanks in large part to the mass production of generics in China and India  But in an impoverished community in Kenya  their cheapness and prodigious use have fueled the evolution of deadly infections like salmonella ImageA Chinese Communist Party member using Study the Great Nation

TREVISO  Italy   Matteo Salvini  the anti immigrant politician who is the most powerful figure in Italy s government  on Monday announced the formation of a new European alliance of populist and far right parties ahead of critical European Parliament elections in May  Others will join between now and the 26th of May   the last day of voting  Mr  Salvini  leader of the League party in Italy  said at an event in Milan with allies from Denmark  Finland and Germany   Our objective is to be the force of government and change in Europe  The elections in May have become a rallying point for European populist parties  once relegated to the margins  to seize their building momentum and expand their power across the continent Marine Le Pen  the leader of France s far right National Gathering party  did not attend the announcement on Monday  though she has signaled her support for the new group But it is still unclear how populous the new populist alliance will be Noticeably absent from the event were some political figures who would appear to have an affinity with the project  like Hungary s prime minister  Viktor Orban  Mr  Orban s Fidesz party still belongs to the European People s Party group  the alliance of center right parties that leads the 28 nation European Parliament Under a sign that read  in four languages   Towards a Common Sense Europe  People Rise Up   Mr  Salvini maintained that he was a stand in for his Austrian  Belgian  French and other potential partners  because it would have been unwieldy to have a news conference with so many people  And he said that the full strength of the alliance would be demonstrated on May 18 during a large event in the Piazza Duomo in Milan  We are working for a big party for the new Europe   said Mr  Salvini  Italy s deputy prime minister and interior minister  whose efforts overlap with those of Steve Bannon  the former strategist for President Trump ImageViktor Orban  the Hungarian prime minister  has not yet allied his far right Fidesz party with Mr  Salvini s coalition CreditPool photo by Julien WarnandJrg Meuthen  a leader of the far right Alternative for Germany party  or AfD  said at the news conference that there were absent partners  who will join us soon   Immediately after the elections in May  he said  the allied parties will form a new group in the European Parliament called the European Alliance of Peoples and Nations  the result of numerous meetings over recent months Olli Kotro  a member of the Finns Party who attended the event  was more cautious  saying   It remains to be seen who will join us  While they share common ground when it comes to strong borders against migration and an emphasis on traditional  national identities  Europe s far right populists also disagree on many points of policy  Mr  Salvini s German and Scandinavian partners lean toward free market economics  while their French allies are more protectionist Mr  Salvini has argued repeatedly that other European Union members must take their fair share of migrants  but some countries  like Hungary  have slammed the door shut  And Poland does not share the warmth that Mr  Salvini and other populists have toward Russia On Monday  Mr  Salvini rejected the suggestion that he and his allies were extremists and said they all had a  clear memory of what happened in the past  but the tired debate of left and right  fascists  communists  that s not what we are passionate about or what 500 million European citizens are passionate about  The debate on the past we will leave to the historians  For Mr  Salvini  the European elections could affect his standing at home  as well as across the continent  A strong showing in May would help him consolidate power in Italy s governing coalition  where he is technically a junior partner to the anti establishment Five Star Movement  which has hemorrhaged support since the election in March 2018 But his Italian allies are less than pleased with his international project On Monday  Mr  Salvini s struggling coalition partner  Luigi Di Maio  the Five Star leader  wrote an open letter to Corriere della Sera  Italy s leading newspaper  arguing that ahead of the European elections in May he found it  paradoxical  that Mr  Salvini was seeking a formal alliance  with those countries who refuse to accept the redistribution of migrants who arrive in Italy  He added   It would be nonsense to complain to the European Union that they don t accept the quotas and then hold close to parties from the same countries  I m thinking of Orban  that are the cause of our emergency  Countries that snub us  violate the laws and lack respect for Italy and the Italians  ImageLuigi Di Maio  the leader of the Five Star party in Italy  has been critical of Mr  Salvini s efforts to form a Europe wide populist coalition CreditAlessandro Di Meo EPA  via ShutterstockAsked about those comments  Mr  Salvini said  with all due respect for the sensibilities of whoever  we have a big plan   I don t comment on what my government allies do   he said  before doing precisely that  reminding reporters of Mr  Di Maio s attempts to form an alliance with the Yellow Vest movement in France  damaging relations with the French government When Mr  Di Maio  goes to Paris and meets someone who then puts in difficulty the Italian government  I don t comment   Mr  Salvini said  He then noted that while Mr  Di Maio now criticized the League s alliance with the AfD   in the past years  the path of Five Star was with our friends in AfD  For now  Mr  Salvini said  his goal is for the aligned parties to win as many votes as possible and take control of the machinery of the European Parliament  He elided questions about whether he or Ms  Le Pen would be the leader of the new group  Today there is no personal ambition  at least for me   he said  A moment later  though  he added  that as an Italian he was proud that  this departs from Italy  this dream  this project  this vision  this future  departs from Milan and Rome  Those present seemed to prefer Mr  Salvini  who has refused to allow ships carrying migrants from Africa and the Middle East to dock in Italy Mr  Meuthen talked about how  when it came to enforcing borders and sending migrants back from whence they came   Matteo Salvini and the League are the exemplars from this point of view  Anders Vistisen of Denmark s Dansk Folkeparti  said that while Mr  Salvini had not asked for any such support  he would make a superb president of the European Commission  

SRINAGAR  India   Tough curbs on civilian traffic along a highway linking disputed Kashmir to the rest of India have provoked outrage in the insurgency hit region  as authorities free up access for troops guarding general elections set to begin this month India has tightened security in the Himalayan region since a suicide bombing on the highway killed 40 paramilitary police in February in an attack claimed by a militant group based in neighboring Pakistan The incident nearly pitched the nuclear armed rivals into a fourth war  and prompted India to launch a massive crackdown on militants and separatists in Kashmir  which is also claimed by Pakistan Politicians  rights activists and school operators in the region labeled Wednesday s move  collective punishment  for Kashmiris because a militant from the area carried out the attack  We can t run schools under these circumstances   said G N  Var  chairman of an association of privately run schools in Kashmir   They are pushing Kashmir into darkness  Late on Wednesday  the government of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir said civilian traffic on the highway was banned from 4 a m  to 5 p m  every Sunday and Wednesday until May 31  to allow for exclusive movement of security convoys Shaleen Kabra  an official of the state s home department  said the curbs aim to protect lives during the movement of troops around India s staggered general election that starts on April 11  with votes to be counted on May 23  The local administration and police will regulate civilian emergencies on the highway during these days   he told Reuters But the limits will hurt the tourism dependent economy in India s  paradise on earth   said Khurram Parvez  a human rights activist and coordinator of the Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Societies  This is an attempt to choke the economy and daily life   Parvez said   These militaristic policies are aimed at collective punishment of the people of Jammu and Kashmir  Instead of closing the only highway connecting the main cities of Jammu and Srinagar  security forces should use special trains wherever possible  said Omar Abdullah  the state s former chief minister   There has to be a better  less people unfriendly way of protecting forces using the highway   Abdullah said on social network Twitter  Patients will not be able to reach hospitals  students will be deprived of access to schools  employees won t be able to reach work and the list goes on and on    Writing by Krishna N  Das  Editing by Clarence Fernandez  

COLUMBUS  Ohio   Interest rates may need move  a bit higher  if the U S  economy performs as expected and dodges fears of a global slowdown  a Federal Reserve policymaker said on Thursday Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said in a speech that she backed the central bank keeping interest rates steady for the moment between 2 25 and 2 5 percent  with  no urgency  to make any changes now But she said she expects a slowdown in the U S  economy this year and shown in recent economic data from factory activity to business and consumer confidence and inflation to be  temporary   I am biased to either keeping rates where they are or moving them up a little bit   Mester told reporters after the speech at a banking regulation event in Columbus  Ohio  If my likely outcome comes to pass then I think rates might have to go up a bit from where they are  But as you know the economy could evolve in a different way than I m expecting as my most likely outcome  Several Fed policymakers have in recent days used speeches and interviews to battle a view growing in financial markets  and embraced by the Trump administration  that the central bank will need to cut rates before long Mester  who is not voting on the central bank s policy this year but takes part in the deliberations  also said the Fed will be making decisions on how to transition its  4 trillion in assets to mainly U S  Treasuries  at upcoming meetings   The bank bought trillions of mortgage backed securities in the aftermath of the financial crisis to stimulate the economy Mester said business contacts in the district covered by her bank  which spans Ohio as well as parts of Pennsylvania  Kentucky and West Virginia  report that business has picked up after slowing late last year  That strength could offset a slowdown she sees in Europe and China But uncertainty over U S  China trade talks could still weigh on business spending  she said  China and the United States are in intense negotiations to end a months long trade war that has rattled global markets  Washington wants sweeping changes to China s economic and trade policies  while Beijing wants Trump to lift expensive sanctions on Chinese goods   Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama  

JERUSALEM   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he would annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he wins another term in office  a last minute pre election promise likely to enrage Palestinians and the Arab world In an interview with Israeli Channel 12 News three days ahead of the April 9 poll  Netanyahu was asked why he had not extended sovereignty to large West Bank settlements  as Israel did without international recognition in east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights  both captured in the 1967 Middle East war   Who says that we won t do it  We are on the way and we are discussing it   Netanyahu said   You are asking whether we are moving on to the next stage   the answer is yes  we will move to the next stage  I am going to extend  Israeli  sovereignty and I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlements  The veteran right wing Israeli leader  who has dominated Israeli politics for a generation  is fighting for his political survival against former top general Benny Gantz  a political novice campaigning on a centrist platform Netanyahu has cast Gantz as a weak leftist who would endanger Israel s security by giving territorial concessions to the Palestinians But Netanyahu  who has fought the election campaign under the shadow of corruption allegations  is also competing for votes with far right parties who advocate annexation  His comments are likely to appeal to hardline voters  who oppose ceding lands Palestinian leaders immediately reacted with anger Saeb Erekat  the chief Palestinian negotiator and a close aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  said   Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity  particularly with the Trump Administration s support and endorsement of Israel s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine  In Gaza  Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri urged Abbas s western backed Palestinian Authority to halt its security cooperation with Israel in the occupied West Bank  Netanyahu s dreams of annexing the West Bank will never be achieved and we will not allow that to happen   he said  It is time for  the PA  to stop security coordination with the occupation  and to get united in the face of the challenges  WEST BANKSettlements are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart Israeli Palestinian peace talks  frozen since 2014 After decades of settlement building  more than 400 000 Israelis now live in the West Bank  according to Israeli figures  among about 2 9 million Palestinians according to the Palestinian Statistics Bureau A further 212 000 Israeli settlers live in East Jerusalem  according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs The Palestinians and many countries consider settlements to be illegal under the Geneva conventions that bar settling on land captured in war  Israel disputes this  citing security needs and biblical  historical and political connections to the land The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank  east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip  all territory Israel captured in 1967  Israel has annexed east Jerusalem and withdrawn from Gaza  The West Bank remains under Israeli military occupation with limited Palestinian self rule Netanyahu s remarks follow a series of announcements and policy changes by U S  President Donald Trump that were seen to favor Israel In March  Trump broke with decades of international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  territory Israel captured from Syria That followed his December 2017 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel  and to move the U S  embassy there  Both moves delighted Israel  infuriated Palestinian and Arab leaders  and were opposed by most U S  allies With Trump s moves on Jerusalem and The Golan  the Israeli leader may feel emboldened to advocate for annexation  U S  officials have said they would unveil a long awaited Trump administration Middle East peace plan after the Israeli election  but prospects to restart negotiations appear dim The Palestinians have been boycotting the Trump administration over its Jerusalem moves and other recent decisions they view as pro Israel bias ELECTION CAMPAIGNThe U S  State Department declined to comment about Netanyahu s remarks  which were viewed in the Israeli media as an attempt to draw right wing votes rather than an immediate change of policy Netanyahu has been plagued by corruption allegations throughout the election campaign  after Israel s attorney general publicly announced in February that he intends to indict Netanyahu Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in three cases of alleged bribery and fraud  but the allegations could cloud his political future and that of any government he might head  possibly leading to a new election His main election rival  Gantz  has vowed to pursue peace with the Palestinians  but he has also stopped short at embracing their quest for statehood A spokeswoman for Gantz declined comment on Netanyahu s remarks  On Friday  the last day polling is allowed  Gantz s centrist Blue and White party was projected to take 30 seats  more than the 26 forecast for Netanyahu s right wing Likud  according to a poll in Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper But this and other polls also projected a majority of the Knesset s 120 seats will go to the parties in Netanyahu s right wing bloc  giving Netanyahu a slim but workable majority A few days before the previous Israeli election in 2015  Netanyahu vowed there would never be a Palestinian state under his watch but then backtracked on that statement after a rebuke from Trump s predecessor  Barack Obama  Last year  however  Netanyahu told members of his right wing Likud party that Israel and the United States were discussing the possibility of Israel annexing settlements  The White House

LONDON    Backstory is a series of reports showing how Reuters journalists work and the standards under which they operate   What do you want to take a picture of me for  Funeral director Heather Lighten seemed baffled when Reuters created a pop up studio in her east London neighborhood and invited her and six others to pose for photos But for Reuters photographer Hannah McKay  the studio was perfect for capturing Lighten and other charismatic residents of Dagenham  the subject of  Wish You Weren t Here  Postcards from the Edge of London in the Age of Brexit  For the past 15 years  immigrants from the European Union and beyond have poured into Dagenham  transforming what was once a predominantly white British community In 2016  Barking and Dagenham was one of just five of London s 32 boroughs to vote to leave the EU McKay created the studio by converting a conference room at Kingsley Hall  a bustling community center in Dagenham set up nearly a century ago by two peace activists Her subjects   who also included a boxer  a pastor and a grocer   visited the room over two days  The studio was an intimate space at the heart of the community  which helped calm people s nerves in front of the camera   McKay said She said her subjects were  pleasantly surprised  when she showed them the result One of them  a young Dagenham boxer called Alfie Lee  joked that he looked like a model for a sportswear company For Reuters reporter Andrew MacAskill  Dagenham was a break from covering a British parliament that has been struggling to break the Brexit deadlock Over the space of six months  he and colleague Andrew Marshall spoke to people in cafes  shops  pubs and social clubs to gauge their opinions during a time of great political upheaval  Getting to know Dagenham helped me understand why so many Britons feel let down by politics   MacAskill said   Almost everyone we interviewed felt politicians were remote and unaccountable  MacAskill met young people in Dagenham who were optimistic about their futures and seemed unfazed by the mass immigration that had so transformed the area  It s the older generation who have less mobility and who feel the changes to Dagenham more deeply   he said   It s easy to understand their anxieties as they watch an old way of life disappear    Reporting by Andrew MacAskill  Hannah McKay and Andrew R C  Marshall  Editing by Alexandra Hudson

ST PETERSBURG MOSCOW   Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday commented for the first time on Special Counsel Robert Mueller s completed report into Russian interference in the 2016 U S  presidential election  saying Moscow had always said it would find nothing U S  Attorney General William Barr said in a summary released last month that Mueller had found no evidence of collusion between Trump s campaign and Russia in the election Putin  speaking at an Arctic forum in the Russian city of St Petersburg  said on Friday that Mueller s findings were predictable for Moscow  That it  Mueller s inquiry  would finish in that way   like a mountain giving birth to a mouse as they say   was clear to us in advance  I ve been telling you this all along   We said from the start that this infamous commission of Mr Mueller s would not find anything because nobody knows this better than us  Russia did not meddle in any elections in the United States  There was no collusion  as Mr Mueller said  between Trump and Russia   Putin said the original allegations of collusion were  complete nonsense  that had been invented for domestic U S  political consumption and as part of what he described as America s internal political struggle The U S  Attorney General told lawmakers on Tuesday that he intends to release the Mueller report to the public within a week While the Mueller report cleared Trump of colluding with Russia it did not clear Moscow of trying to meddle in the 2016 vote  U S  intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia did interfere  with a campaign of email hacking and online propaganda aimed at sowing discord When asked at the same event whether he wanted to see Trump re elected next year  Putin declined to express a view  citing a long list of disagreements with the Trump administration and saying that the question of Trump s possible re election was purely a matter for the American people But Putin  who has praised Trump in the past  said he hoped Moscow and Washington would be able to work together to try to resolve their many differences on the international stage once what he described as the U S  political crisis was over Putin in July last year said he had wanted Trump to win the 2016 U S  presidential election because Trump had spoken of wanting to repair U S  Russia relations Overshadowed by the Mueller report and disagreements over everything from Syria to Ukraine  relations between Russia and the United States have in fact got worse under Trump    Additional reporting by Maria Tsvetkova  Writing by Andrew Osborn  Editing by Christian Lowe

PARIS   French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said that after three months of public debate it was that clear tax cuts must be speeded up to quell the widespread anger over high living costs that has fueled anti government protests In an act of political theater on Monday  Philippe was presenting the findings from two million online contributions and 10 000 hours of town hall debates that President Emmanuel Macron must now digest and respond to with policy moves Four broad needs emerged  the prime minister said  renewing ties between Paris and the regions  making the political process more relevant for citizens  responding better to climate change  and easing the tax burden  The debate clearly shows us in which direction we need to go  we need to lower taxes and lower them faster   Philippe said in a speech in the Grand Palace in Paris Planned increases to a fuel tax prompted five months of  yellow vest  protests nationwide and the worst rioting Paris has witnessed since the 1968 student uprising  though the discontent swiftly turned into a broader backlash against inequality and an aloof political elite More violence in mid March reminded Macron that putting his reform agenda back on track would not be easy and the unrest could damage his party s European election campaign The  yellow vests  remain an amorphous group with varied demands  including higher salaries  better public services  and more power for voters on policy decisions Tight public finances mean Macron has limited wriggle room  The French have understood     that we cannot lower taxes if we don t lower public spending   Philippe said The debates reinvigorated Macron  who rolled up his sleeves and held forth for up to seven hours at a time with high school students  mayors and working mothers  as well as intellectuals and philosophers  Polls showed only a tentative recovery in Macron s weak popularity  so the stakes are high for him and his prime minister New policy measures are yet to be decided and could be put to a plebiscite  The option of a referendum   which has the advantage of responding to the yellow vests  demand for more people s votes   remains on the table Nonetheless  Ingrid Levavasseur  who pulled out of leading a  yellow vest  list for the European elections because of internal divisions within the movement  doubted the debates would produce meaningful reform  I count myself among the skeptics   she told Reuters  Additional reporting and writing by Richard Lough  Editing by Giles Elgood

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved an osteoporosis drug that represents the first new treatment approach in nearly two decades   a strategy based on a rare gene mutation in people with bones so dense that they never break About 10 million people in the United States have osteoporosis  Worldwide  about 200 million people have brittle bones  one in three women  and one in five men  will suffer a fracture because of osteoporosis  often of the hip or spine  For many  the break leads to a downward spiral of disability  Standard treatments  drugs called bisphosphonates  stop the loss of bone but do not build it  The alternatives  parathyroid hormone and a derivative  build bone but also break it down  limiting the therapeutic effect  The new drug  romosozumab  brand name Evenity   developed by Amgen in collaboration with the Belgian drug company UCB  restores bone without breaking it down  according to the findings of two large clinical trials   Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  It was approved only for postmenopausal women with a high risk of fracture  and will carry a warning on its label that it may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke  the F D A  said   This is an extraordinarily important drug   said Dr  Richard Bockman  chief of the endocrine service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York   It s a true bone building drug that takes advantage of the underlying biology of bone   In large clinical trials  patients taking the drug saw increases in bone density in their spines on the order of 15 percent   a huge figure  similar to the amount of bone made in early adolescence  said Dr  Clifford J  Rosen  an osteoporosis expert at Maine Medical Center Research Institute and member of an F D A  panel that evaluated the data  Merely a 6 percent increase in bone density can translate into a doubling of bone strength  Dr  Bockman said  In the trials  patients taking the drugs saw a reduction in breaks  both in the spine and  clinical  fractures   broken bones that a patient notices  rather than  say  a collapsed vertebra discovered only in X rays In one study  spinal fractures occurred in 127 of 2 046 patients taking the new drug  compared with 243 of 2 047 taking alendronate  an older drug   It s a tremendous advance   said Dr  Dolores Shoback  a professor of medicine and an osteoporosis expert at the University of California  San Francisco But there also was a small  unexpected increase in heart attacks  strokes and sudden deaths in that study   50 of 2 040 patients  or 2 5 percent  taking Evenity  compared with 38 of 2 014  or 1 9 percent  taking alendronate  The effect was seen in one of the two large clinical trials  but not the other  The F D A  said it was requiring the boxed warning on the drug s label saying the drug should not be used by people who had a heart attack or stroke in the past year  Doctors should also consider whether to prescribe the drug to patients at high risk for heart attacks and strokes  Patients who have a heart attack or stroke while taking Evenity should stop taking the drug Side effects can include joint pain and headaches and irritation at the injection site The agency is requiring the company to conduct a post marketing study of cardiovascular risks  It is hard to know what to make of the possible risk  said Dr  Bart Clarke  a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic and president of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research   Maybe there is something unique about those patients   he said Amgen would not disclose the price at the time of approval  saying it would be disclosed next week  Evenity will be given as a monthly injection  Parathyroid hormone is given as a daily injection  while the drugs in the other major treatment class  the bisphosphonates  are taken as pills The new drug has a striking back story In 1964  researchers began studying an unusual group of Afrikaner patients in South Africa  They were tall and heavy  but not fat  Instead  their bones were large and dense  Their bones grew so profusely that their heads became distorted  Their jaws were large  and an overgrowth of bone in their skulls impinged upon nerves  often causing deafness or facial palsy  Many had terrible headaches  In some  the index and middle fingers fused together  In 2001  scientists reported that all these effects resulted from a single gene mutation  The finding led researchers to understand how the body controls the building of bone  Bones are in a state of constant flux  built up and broken down by the body  In osteoporosis  the balance is disrupted   more bone is broken down than is made  Bone cells make a protein called sclerostin that halts the production of bone and increases its breakdown  The gene mutation in the Afrikaner patients stops the production of sclerostin  so their bodies keep building bone without brakes  Scientists reasoned that if they could mimic the mutation by blocking sclerostin with an antibody  people with osteoporosis should build more bone  Once bone density increased  patients could stop taking the sclerostin blocking drug and switch to an older drug to maintain the new bone  Animal studies were successful  as were clinical trials  culminating in two large studies involving more than 10 000 postmenopausal women  In one trial  Evenity was compared to a placebo  in the other  it was compared to a bisphosphonate  In both studies  women taking Evenity ended up with more bone and fewer fractures In January  Evenity was reviewed by an advisory committee to the F D A   which voted 18 to 1 for approval   but called for Amgen to do more research to understand the possible cardiovascular side effects  There is a tremendous need for this medication  and there is an amazing amount of morbidity and mortality with this disease   said Dr  Frederick G  Kushner  a cardiologist at the Heart Clinic of Louisiana and a panel member  who voted to approve the drug The next step  Dr  Bockman said  is for companies to develop pills to block sclerostin so patients do not have to have monthly injections It may not be easy to convince patients to take the new drug  Experts anticipate that it will be offered to patients at highest risk  those who have had a serious fracture  or who have taken bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone  and did not respond or experienced serious side effects All too often  however  high risk patients are afraid to take drugs to prevent fractures  They remember stories of the rare patients who took bisphosphonates and had an unusual fractures or deterioration of the bones in their jaws  They don t remember the good   that fractures are being prevented   Dr  Shoback said   They remember some pivotal terrible thing that someone told them   Dr  Bockman has seen these patients  too  but hopes they can be convinced at least to try Evenity  This is a very important  great new drug   he said   And it is something we really need   

Avid readers of Robert A  Caro may greet his new book   Working  Researching  Interviewing  Writing   with a mixture of excitement and trepidation  On the one hand  Another Caro book  and it s not a biography  On the other hand  Another Caro book   and it s not a biography Considering that the 83 year old averages a book a decade  his fans might wonder whether  Working  will reset the clock that started in 2012  when the fourth book of his multivolume magnum opus   The Years of Lyndon Johnson   was published No need to worry  though this assemblage of personal reflections and interviews may give the true Caro completist a creeping sense of dj vu  Much of the material was either published before or distilled from stories Caro has recounted elsewhere  and the book reads as if it were designed to divert as little of his time as possible   Caro says he has a  full scale memoir  planned  to be completed after the next Johnson volume  though at his age  he says  he can also  do the math    Small and charming at about 200 pages  a quick spritz instead of a deep dive   Working  is like the antithesis of Caro s labor intensive oeuvre  making it strangely reassuring proof that he is  well  working    Working  was one of our most anticipated books of April  See the full list   The next Johnson book will be  the fifth of a projected three volumes   he writes  declining to get into specifics   My writing seems never to come out well if I ve talked about it beforehand   while promising that it will be the final installment  That means it will have to cover  among other things  the presidential election of 1964  Johnson s Great Society programs and his continuing feud with Bobby Kennedy  the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act  the decision not to run for re election in 1968  Martin Luther King Jr  s assassination  Bobby Kennedy s assassination  and Johnson s post presidency life until his death in 1973 Not to mention the escalation of the war in Vietnam  a subject about which  the L B J  Library is opening up new files all the time   It sounds like biography writing as Zeno s paradox   getting infinitesimally closer to the end without ever reaching it Caro  though  wouldn t have it any other way  His research methods are deservedly legendary  He and his wife  Ina  pore through archival documents with a determination to  turn every page   He tracks down as many people to talk to as he can  counting 522 interviews for  The Power Broker   his landmark biography of Robert Moses  and  thousands  for the Johnson books But these standard techniques are just a start  He and Ina moved from their home in New York to the Texas Hill Country in 1978  living there for three years to better understand Johnson s childhood   To get the local women to warm to her and open up about what their lives were like before Johnson brought electricity to the region in the  30s and  40s  Ina taught herself how to make fig preserves   Caro has said he wants to spend time in Vietnam to get a sense of what it felt like  to fight in the jungle  ImageRobert A  Caro  the biographer whose new book   Working   gives readers a look at his research and writing process CreditJoyce RavidAll of this painstaking work takes time  The writing itself comes quickly and easily   so much so that the critic R P  Blackmur  who taught Caro at Princeton  admonished him to  stop thinking with your fingers   The prose in Caro s biographies is a mesmerizing combination of fine grained  meticulous detail recounted in lush  incantatory sentences  he is  as he says repeatedly in  Working   always trying to accumulate enough material to  show  rather than to tell    to make readers not only see but understand and feel  the consequences of power Because power  Caro says  is his real subject  He doesn t think of his books as biographies in the conventional sense   From the very start   he writes   I thought of writing biographies as a means of illuminating the times of the men I was writing about and the great forces that molded those times   Robert Moses was an unelected bureaucrat whose public works projects transformed the skyline and shorelines of New York City  Lyndon Johnson was a ruthless opportunist and an astonishingly effective legislator who transformed the country s social landscape  These were men who channeled power  wielded it  embodied it Caro talks a lot about power in  Working   It can corrupt  yes  but not always   Once you get enough power  once you re there  where you wanted to be all along  then you can see what the protagonist wanted to do all along  because now he s doing it   he says   What power always does is reveal  It s a memorable line  from an interview Caro gave to The Paris Review in 2016  It appears not only in  Working  but also in  Master of the Senate   the third of the Johnson books  published in 2002  There are a number of anecdotes in  Working  that Caro has shared before   after all  his books are so comprehensive that it only makes sense for  say   Means of Ascent   the second book in the Johnson series  to include a section on how Caro tracked down Luis Salas  a former voting official who confessed to helping Johnson steal the 1948 Senate election The version of the Salas story that Caro includes in  Working  is presented as an example of what Caro calls  something in my nature     the part of me that  now that I was writing books  kept leading me  after I had gotten every question answered  to suddenly think  despite myself  of new questions that  in the instant of thinking them  I felt must be answered for my book to be complete  This is awfully windy   where is Prof  Blackmur when you need him  Caro makes the same point more succinctly when writing about  The Power Broker   recalling how he was swept away by the scandalous material he was discovering and an accompanying sense of duty   I just couldn t write the book about the great highway builder   couldn t outline it  even   without showing the human cost of what he had done   he writes   There really was no choice involved  For someone so interested in the power of others  Caro seems coy about his own power to shape legacies  The writer who emerges from these pages is so humble as to be self effacing   a quality that makes his halting bids at introspection  for all their genial appeal  seem mostly denuded

SO PAULO  Brazil   A little more than a year ago  a member of Rio de Janeiro s City Council was murdered with four shots to the head and neck  The councilwoman  Marielle Franco  was headed home from an event when a car pulled up and someone opened fire  killing her and her driver  It was obvious from the beginning that this was a premeditated  professional assassination  Ms  Franco was a black  feminist L G B T  activist  a fierce human rights defender who wasn t afraid to take on sensitive issues  the use of state violence in favelas  for instance  or the involvement of police and politicians in Rio s paramilitary groups There was finally a breakthrough in the case  last month  when the state police arrested two suspects  Unsurprisingly enough  they were former military police officers  The alleged shooter  Ronnie Lessa  had retired from the force after being injured in a car bomb attack  according to investigators  he then took a job as a contract killer and gun runner for one of the most powerful militias in Rio de Janeiro  called the Escritrio do Crime  or Crime Bureau  The other suspect  lcio Vieira de Queiroz  who might have acted as a getaway driver  had been expelled from the police force under suspicion of providing security for an illegal gambling house   Both men deny involvement in the murders  ImageInvestigators say Ronnie Lessa  suspected in the murder of Marielle Franco  has ties to Brazil s president CreditLucas Landau ReutersBut who ordered the assassination  That s where things get messy  So messy that last year  the federal police began an inquiry into the local murder investigation  after allegations that it had been systematically obstructed by militia members  public officials and politicians  Last November  Brazil s public security minister at the time said that it s  more than a certainty  that powerful people are involved in the murder  Some say  half jokingly  that it might be easier to pinpoint who is not involved By now the federal task force has searched the residences of a former state representative  a former civil policeman  a former federal agent and an active duty federal police official  Even the current president of Brazil  Jair Bolsonaro  has come under public scrutiny for his ties to both of the suspects in the killing  He and Mr  Lessa were neighbors in a luxury seaside condominium in Rio de Janeiro  and his youngest son once dated Mr  Lessa s daughter  There is also a picture of Mr  Bolsonaro posing alongside Mr  Queiroz   The president has denied knowing the men  But these could be just coincidences  More troubling is the outspoken sympathy of the president and his family for the paramilitaries The infamous  milcias   in their current form  were established in Rio de Janeiro s favelas in the late 1990s and early 2000s  under the pretext of protecting residents from drug traffickers  They are mainly formed of active duty and retired police officers who assume control of the communities and extort money from ordinary citizens and shopkeepers  A 2013 academic report concluded that of the roughly 1 000 favelas in the city  45 percent are controlled by militia organizations and 37 percent by drug gangs During his 27 years as a congressman  Jair Bolsonaro repeatedly supported death squads and militias  In 2003  he said   As long as the state does not have the courage to adopt the death penalty  those death squads  in my opinion  are very welcome   In a 2008 interview  the future president of Brazil declared that the government should support militias and potentially legalize them  since they  offer security and in this way they can maintain order and discipline in their communities  It runs in the family  apparently  Mr  Bolsonaro s eldest son  the senator Flvio Bolsonaro  was recently revealed to have connections to a former military police captain  Adriano Magalhes da Nbrega  the purported head of the Crime Bureau   The ex police officer is now a fugitive from justice   Both Mr  Nbrega s mother and wife were employed for years in Flvio Bolsonaro s office when he was a Rio de Janeiro State lawmaker  In a news release  Senator Bolsonaro claimed that the women were hired by someone else and that he was the victim of a smear campaign  But he also praised Mr  Nbrega twice in Rio s Legislative Assembly for his work as a police officer  awarding him the highest honor granted by the assembly   the Tiradentes Medal   while he was still in jail on a homicide conviction   The murder victim was a favela resident who had just denounced crimes of torture and extortion allegedly committed by his police squad   Incidentally  when Mr  Nbrega was found guilty and sentenced to 19 years in prison  Jair Bolsonaro  too  came to his defense in the Congress  saying he was a  brilliant officer  and demanding a review of the conviction   Mr  Nbrega was eventually acquitted on appeal  In 2015  Flvio Bolsonaro was the only legislator to vote against the establishment of a parliamentary commission to investigate frauds in  autos de resistncia    killings on the part of the police that are reported as having occurred in self defense  He argued that the investigation would put a  knife in the throat  of police officers  who already do not have legal security to carry out their work  In 2008  he spoke of the  happiness  of the people  residing in these communities  supposedly dominated by militiamen   Finally  last year  he was the only legislator to vote against awarding the Tiradentes Medal   that same honor he once gave to a purported militia leader   to Marielle Franco ImageThe police say these rifles were found at an address linked to Mr  Lessa  a former police officer CreditCivil Police  via Associated PressWhich brings us back to her assassination  Bank records have showed a cash deposit of 100 000 reais  about  25 000  into the alleged shooter s account  Who ordered the crime  And why  How widespread is the influence of paramilitary gangs in Brazil s police force and politics Those questions are met with silence while the country remains one of the deadliest places for human rights defenders in the world  Many cases are never solved  Most of them seem to be quickly forgotten  The situation looks poised to get only worse  since our new president loathes the concept of human rights  in a 2016 tweet  he compared them to  manure   and welcomes the actions of death squads   If it were up to me  they would have all the support   he told Congress in 2003  It looks like there s no need to legalize militias in Brazil  after all  Today one might have the impression that paramilitary groups are not merely acting as a parallel state   they are the state The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of

BRUSSELS   With less than 48 hours before Britain s scheduled departure  the European Union extended the exit deadline early Thursday until the end of October  avoiding a devastating cliff edge divorce but settling none of the issues that have plunged British politics into chaos  dysfunction and recrimination On another difficult night for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain  European leaders scrapped her proposal for a postponement until June 30  concluding that such a short deadline was unrealistic for the departure known as Brexit  They agreed  however  to review the arrangement at the end of June to prevent British disruption to the bloc while the nation remains in Europe s departure lounge Although the intense pressure of recent weeks may abate for now  the path ahead still resembles a minefield  dotted with explosive issues like a possible attempt to topple Mrs  May  a general election or a second Brexit referendum   or some combination of the three  Most immediately  Mrs  May is likely to face calls to step down  and potential successors are already trying to raise money and advertise their credentials At a news conference  Donald Tusk  the president of the European Council  said that the two sides had agreed to what he called  a flexible extension  until Oct  31  adding that this provided an  additional six months for the U K  to find the best possible solution   In essence  the bloc agreed to kick the Brexit can down the road for another six months Mr  Tusk said that the Oct  31 date was  a bit shorter than I expected   but said that the extension should be enough to complete Brexit if London showed  good will   He told the British   Please do not waste this time  ImageFrom left  European Council President Donald Tusk  Prime Minister Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg  Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at the start of a special summit meeting on Brexit at the European Council in Brussels on Wednesday CreditOlivier Hoslet EPA  via ShutterstockBut he did not rule out another extension  The June review  he said  was not for negotiation  but only to inform member states about the state of play in Britain European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker dismissed worries that Britain would interfere in the work of the bloc  saying that Britain s being  a difficult partner  was  nothing new  Mrs  May said she knew that there was  huge frustration  at home that she had needed to request the extension  She appealed to lawmakers to support a Brexit agreement  adding that  the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear  But she can expect fierce criticism later on Thursday from her own lawmakers  many of whom opposed delaying Brexit to June  let alone October  Reminded of statements that she would not contemplate remaining in the bloc beyond June  Mrs  May said that the agreement allowed Britain to leave by then if Parliament approved a deal The extension means that Britain will almost certainly have to hold elections for the European Parliament on May 23  something Mrs  May once argued would be absurd  almost three years after Britons voted for withdrawal  That prospect seems certain to anger hard line Brexit supporters ImageEuropean leaders stressed that Britain s Parliament would still have to pass the withdrawal agreement before there could be any discussions about the future relationship  even if the country left without an agreement first CreditDan Kitwood Getty ImagesPresident Emmanuel Macron of France called the October date  the best compromise  to maintain European unity  It s now  up to Britons to be clear with themselves and their people   he said  about whether they want to participate in the European Parliament elections next month even though they would have to abandon the legislature a few months later This was not the first time Mrs  May had requested a postponement  Originally  she had promised Britons that she would strike a deal by March 29  only to acknowledge last month that the goal was impossible  Having missed that deadline  Mrs  May was a supplicant to the 27 other leaders of the bloc  who made their latest decision after she had left the room Having lost control of the process in Brussels  Mrs  May will return to a pitched battle with pro Brexit Conservative lawmakers  including a significant number who now want her out and seem willing to risk an economically damaging departure without an agreement Some have been arguing that Britain should use an extension to sabotage European Union business from the inside  While Mrs  May has promised not to do so  her position is so shaky that thoughts are turning to how a successor might behave  particularly a pro Brexit hard liner like Boris Johnson  the former foreign secretary At the same time  if Britain s Parliament should finally pass the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the bloc  then Brexit would take place on the first of the next month ImageThe president of the European Council  Donald Tusk  center left  and the president of the European Commission  Jean Claude Juncker  have suggested a lengthy extension to the Brexit deadline CreditEmmanuel Dunand Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesEuropean nations had been divided between those who wanted a shorter extension  to keep up pressure on Britain to resolve Brexit  and those who wanted to give it the time and space to reach a sensible conclusion On Wednesday it was Mr  Macron who took the toughest line  arguing that Britain needed to propose a credible plan to resolve the crisis On his insistence  plans to give Britain as much as another year were scrapped in favor of a shorter delay  He had argued that a long extension risked disrupting the bloc s more important work and that Britain s political confusion could prove contagious But there was never any question of slamming the door instantly on Britain and triggering a disruptive  no deal  Brexit that would have occurred Friday night in the absence of an extension  And Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany stressed the need for Britain to have time to manage an orderly process  which would allow for a good relationship between the two sides after the divorce The October deadline was therefore a compromise  chosen in part because it would keep Britain outside the new European Commission  which will be formed in the fall ImageTrucks queued last month on the main road into the Port of Dover  southern England  because of a work slowdown by French customs officers  The bottleneck illustrated the possible effect of a no deal Brexit on traffic across the English Channel CreditGareth Fuller Press Association  via Associated PressSo far  the British Parliament has shown little indication that it will ever approve the withdrawal deal that Mrs  May negotiated with the European Union  That is a legally binding treaty that would resolve technical issues  like the government s outstanding financial commitments to the bloc  and keep Britain inside its economic structures until at least December 2020 After that point  Mrs  May wants to detach Britain from Europe s customs union and single market  and to take control of immigration from the Continent That formula has been rejected three times in Parliament and  despite attempts to broker an accord with the opposition Labour Party  prospects for its passage still look low More talks between the parties were scheduled for Thursday  but Labour has complained that Mrs  May has shown no sign of budging from her basic goal of taking Britain out of a customs union with the bloc Were she to accept staying in a customs union  which is Labour s bedrock position  that would preclude Britain from forging trade deals on its own  defeating  in the minds of pro Brexit lawmakers  the entire purpose of Brexit  Such a step would risk cabinet resignations and enrage the party faithful In the coming weeks there may be more votes in Parliament to gauge opinion on various approaches to Brexit  but the possibility of assembling a sustainable majority for any one blueprint still seems remote Conservative Brexit supporters are hoping they can replace Mrs  May with a hard liner who could reopen the withdrawal agreement painfully negotiated over months with the European Union But European officials emphasize that the withdrawal agreement  including a provision known as the Irish backstop  designed to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland  will not change  If Britain wants a managed Brexit  it must pass the withdrawal agreement first  they say  Only then can the European Union begin negotiations on a future relationship  

Since it was proposed in the early 1990s as a bill to protect women  on the streets and in homes   the Violence Against Women Act has been argued over by lawmakers  the Supreme Court  civil rights groups and the National Rifle Association  among others The bill  which President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994  was designed to protect victims of domestic crimes and reduce the stigma associated with domestic abuse  It must be renewed every few years by Congress  and on Thursday the House approved a bill that would reauthorize the act for a fourth time The act has established the National Domestic Violence Hotline  the Office on Violence Against Women within the Department of Justice  and myriad programs to train victim advocates  police officers  prosecutors and judges on gender based violence  Since it was created  more than  7 billion in federal grants has been given to programs that prevent domestic violence  sexual assault  dating violence and stalking  It has also funded shelters  community programs and studies tracking violence against women Addressing gender based violence seems like it  would be a bipartisan issue   said Carol Baldwin Moody  president and chief executive of Legal Momentum  one of the organizations that has spent the last two years drafting language for the latest reauthorization of the act  Unfortunately there was more debate about a bill that reflects the real needs of survivors than we would expect   she said In the last quarter century  as sexual violence on college campuses and harassment in the workplace have sparked widespread discussion and the  MeToo movement  the act has been changed  tweaked and fought over  Here is a look at its evolution 1990sImageSenator Joseph R  Biden Jr  discussing the Violence Against Women Act in July 1994  He was one of the sponsors of the bill  which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton later that year CreditJohn Duricka Associated Press The bill has three broad  but simple  goals  to make streets safer for women  to make homes safer for women  and to protect women s civil rights   Joseph R  Biden Jr   one of the bill s sponsors when he was a Delaware senator  said in 1990 That summer  survivors delivered stirring testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee  At the time  the Senate had only two women and the proposal had little support from women s groups or civil rights groups Some critics said that penalties for rape were too stringent  and that domestic abuse was a  fad   A major sticking point was a provision that allowed victims of gender based violence to sue their attackers The Department of Justice under President George Bush opposed the legislation  Chief Justice William H  Rehnquist criticized its criminal provisions for being  open ended   and its civil rights provision  so sweeping   that it would  involve the federal courts in a whole host of domestic relations disputes  But in 1994  during late night debates over the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act  the bill became  a war flag for congressional leaders who wanted to show they are tough on crime   The New York Times wrote The rape and murder of Megan Kanka  a 7 year old from New Jersey  in July 1994 prompted the creation of sex offender registries and galvanized some lawmakers When Mr  Clinton signed the Violence Against Women Act into law in September 1994  it created new offenses and penalties  enhanced sentencing for repeat federal offenders  and strengthened investigations and prosecutions of sex offenses The act also provided grants to a range of groups  including law enforcement  intervention and prevention programs  and women s shelters  and created the National Domestic Violence Hotline 2000ImageHillary Clinton promoting the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2000  when she was the first lady CreditPaul Hosefros The New York TimesThe Violence Against Women Act suffered a small setback in 2000 when the Supreme Court ruled part of the law unconstitutional  That decision centered on a lawsuit brought by a woman who had accused two men of assaulting and repeatedly raping her while they were students at Virginia Tech Her lawsuit was made possible by the provision of the act that allowed victims of gender based violence to sue their attackers in federal court  but the Supreme Court decided that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to enact such a measure That fall  a bill reauthorizing the act for another five years passed Congress with nearly universal support before being signed into law by Mr  Clinton  The renewal included  3 3 billion in financing for law enforcement and for shelters for victims of domestic violence  It also created new programs designed to protect elderly and disabled women and provided funds for rape prevention and education 2005ImageM L  Carr  a basketball star and spokesman for Family Violence Prevention Fund  and Salma Hayek  an actress and spokeswoman for the Avon Foundation  testified at a 2005 hearing about the Violence Against Women Act CreditChris Maddaloni Roll Call  via Getty ImagesWhen the act came up again for reauthorization in 2005  lawmakers were virtually unanimous in approving it  The renewal of authority took  a more holistic approach   according to the National Network to End Domestic Violence  including encouraging collaboration among law enforcement  health and housing professionals and community organizations The 2005 reauthorization included a new focus on prevention  housing protections for victims  funding for rape crisis centers and culturally sensitive services  according to the network  It also strengthened penalties for repeat stalking  added cyberstalking to the federal definition of stalking and expanded services for communities of color and immigrants 2013ImagePresident Barack Obama signing the Violence Against Women Act in March 2013  This version strengthened provisions to fight human and sex trafficking CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesAuthorization for the act expired in 2011  and efforts to renew it the following year fell apart amid objections from conservatives over some of the more obscure provisions in the bill  In particular  those on the right were concerned by the bill s inclusion of visas for abused undocumented immigrants  funds for victims in same sex relationships and provisions strengthening American Indian courts But the 2012 election changed the political dynamic  Having lost the female vote  Republicans felt pressure to move ahead  In early 2013  House Republican leaders unexpectedly allowed a vote on the bill  which eventually made its way to President Barack Obama  who signed it into law That reauthorization included nondiscrimination protections for victims seeking help from grant funded organizations  It also strengthened provisions to fight human and sex trafficking  established housing rights for victims  and expanded the information that colleges and universities must share with the federal government about gender based crimes 2019ImageRepresentative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  speaking on Thursday about the Violence Against Women Act  A reauthorization bill easily passed the House and now heads to the Republican controlled Senate CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesOpposition this year to renewing authorization for the act a fourth time has centered on gun control The National Rifle Association  the nation s largest gun lobby  sought to block the act s renewal because of a new provision that expanded law enforcement s ability to strip domestic abusers of their guns  known as the  boyfriend loophole  On Thursday  however  the majority Democratic House  with its historic number of women  easily passed the reauthorization bill If it becomes law  those convicted of abusing  assaulting or stalking a dating partner or those subject to a court restraining order would be barred from buying or owning firearms  I know that fear  I know that terror and I just want to try to save another family from going through that terror   said Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  recalling how she was afraid as a child that her father  who had a mental illness and owned a gun  would harm her mother or her siblings   Why would you not close that loophole  It is unclear how the new gun provisions will fare in the Republican controlled Senate  where the reauthorization bill heads next  

LONDON   Brexit is so confusing it s even confounding the robots Machine driven trading systems in the  5 1 trillion a day global currency market are struggling to cope with the blizzard of headlines about Britain s efforts to extricate itself from the European Union  making it more expensive and risky to bet for or against sterling Prime Minister Theresa May s failure  after three attempts  to get her divorce deal with Brussels through parliament has sent the UK s planned departure careering off piste  raising questions over who is in charge and when  how or even if the UK will actually leave As a divided government battles a divided parliament over a way forward  the chorus of characters who can now influence events has grown  flummoxing news reading algorithms  or  algos   which are designed to parse phrases from recognized speakers before executing a trade  The model signals are more quantitative driven and rely on historical data feeds   said Neil Jones  head of hedge fund currency sales at Mizuho in London   Brexit headlines have thrown a spanner in their works for the sheer number of characters moving the currency on a daily basis  News reading algos are a growing part of a wider revolution on the trading floor of banks and asset managers  where machines have supplanted swathes of human traders  slashing costs and boosting the speed at which deals are done   sometimes down to millionths of a second  Traditionally designed to process economic data or central bank policy statements  some computer trading models have evolved to allow for split second analysis of news headlines or Twitter storms before executing a buy or sell order The problem for the computers is that Brexit is producing too many headlines for them to process  Reuters  for instance  has published up to 400 news headlines on Brexit per day in recent weeks  up from around 15 on British politics before it became an issue Rival Bloomberg has also pumped up the volume of Brexit content by four times since last autumn  running more than 1 000 headlines some days   such as on March 12 when May s deal was defeated a second time  according to a spokeswoman HAND SIGNALS The mechanics of how Brexit may be hammered out have also made it more difficult for the computers Obscure British parliamentary procedures are now at the center of policymaking and people who typically would not feature in a computer trading model are suddenly taking center stage John Bercow  the speaker of the House of Commons  for example  sent sterling skidding last month when he stopped May from bringing forward a vote on her deal So sensitive is the currency to developments that even a hand signal can affect the price On November 6  Britain s then Brexit Minister Dominic Raab  pushed the pound up simply by giving a  thumbs up  after a cabinet meeting    a visual cue that would outfox machines programmed to analyze words Raab s market moving gesture came after the

There is no official data on what proportion of trade in foreign exchange is carried out by news reading algos  but three currency traders at London based banks estimated it was less than 10 percent Given the complexities of Brexit  that proportion is likely to be even lower for trading sterling right now Some hedge funds have opted out of trading sterling altogether because the usual models they rely on don t work in the current climate  according to one FX trader at a major UK investment bank Their models are based around economic data and expectations for Bank of England rate changes  but those have become secondary drivers compared with political news  he said He declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly about clients  Some banks are ensuring that trading the pound is not left completely to the machines while other banks are using tiny orders within narrow trading ranges to prevent large losses   If it was your job and given the complexity of the

around Brexit has made that more difficult too To reduce the risk of getting caught on the wrong side of a headline  market makers are programming algorithms to offer a wider spread between the price they will buy  the bid  and sell  the offer  But a wider spread makes it more expensive to deal in pounds  Rob Turner  a quantitative trader at RBC Capital Markets said the average cost of trading  by taking into account the spreads  for sterling in a usual 10 million ticket jumped last week to 2 9 pips from 1 9 pips in October  That shows that the price at the very best moment for executing a

Good Monday   Want this by email  Sign up here  Pinterest s modest I P O  valuation should worry other unicornsThe digital pin board company disclosed today that its I P O  would value it at less than its last private fund raising round  That s a big warning sign for other tech companies that are poised to go public this year The high range of Pinterest s I P O  would value it at  11 3 billion  below the  12 billion attained from private investors two years ago  In Silicon Valley speak  that s a  down round    something companies generally hope to avoid because it undermines confidence Coupled with early volatility in Lyft s first days of trading  the Pinterest offering suggests that public market investors are wary of maintaining high valuations for tech start ups  especially given that many won t turn a profit for years It comes as a slew of unicorns are preparing to go public  including Uber  whose I P O  was expected to give a valuation as high as  120 billion   the workplace messaging platform Slack and the software company PagerDuty But there s some reason not to panic yet  After initially falling below their I P O  price  Lyft shares bounced back  Other companies have gone on to do well after down rounds  For instance  the file sharing company Box is trading well above its debut price two years after its I P O  And Pinterest could end up pricing its offering higher if investor demand proves robust during its road show More I P O  news  Though many investors are betting against Lyft s newly public stock  the high profile short seller Andrew Left isn t among them

they move them to change things the way you want them to change   he writes Devise clear metrics for success   I d bring that sort of accountability down to the individual level to encourage an accountability culture in which individuals are aware of whether they are net contributors or net detractors to the society  and the individuals and the society make attempts to make them net

both social and economic returns   Raise taxes on pollution and other causes of bad health   Impose targeted tax increases on the wealthiest to pay for social welfare programs to bolster economic productivity Better coordinate monetary and fiscal policies  so that more money ends up in the hands of people who will spend it  the lower and middle classes  as opposed to saving it  the wealthy  ImageA Facebook ad in London CreditHenry Nicholls ReutersBritain s plan to police the internetThe British government has proposed sweeping new powers to regulate harmful content and false information  recommending one of the world s most aggressive actions to police the internet  Adam Satariano of the NYT reports   A regulator would be given the power to  issue fines  block access to websites if necessary and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content spread on their platforms    Terrorism  inciting violence  encouraging suicide  spreading disinformation and cyberbullying are among the topics that companies would be required to address  The rules would apply to social media platforms  discussion forums  messaging services and search engines   Facebook and Twitter will work with the government  representatives from the companies said  Actions in Britain and elsewhere signal a new era for the internet  Western democracies have largely avoided regulating online communication   Mr  Satariano writes  But governments have become more willing to intervene  as evidence mounts that online actions are having harmful real life consequences by contributing to violence  compromising elections and spreading hateful ideologies   In the United States  where free speech is more of a core value than in other nations  there s been less momentum to regulate internet content   Mr  Satariano adds  But even in America  there is increasing support for new rules Why you don t want a partisan FedPresident Trump is ready to nominate Herman Cain and Stephen Moore   two vocal supporters of his policies   to the Federal Reserve board  Many analysts say such a move would politicize the central bank  Neil Irwin of the Upshot takes a look at what that would mean Historically  Fed appointees have generally been economic experts who kept their political views out of policy discussions Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain wouldn t change much at first  They d hold two of 12 votes on the Fed s Open Market Committee  so their ability to swing other governors would depend on their politicking abilities But over time  the Fed could lose credibility   The United States  role as the global reserve currency   which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight   is built in significant part on the credibility the Fed has accumulated over decades   Mr  Irwin writes The financial world is watching closely   I think it s a very big benefit to the U S  economy and the financial markets that we have a strong and independent Fed  and I hope

ImagePresident Trump spoke at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner in Washington on Tuesday  mentioning health care as one of the topics he wanted the party to focus on CreditPool photo by Ron SachsWe don t know what will emerge as President Trump s plan to replace Obamacare  which he has promised to unveil immediately after the 2020 elections  But he has recently endorsed several proposals  and they could provide clues Over the last two weeks  he has sought to re emphasize health care as an issue  after a set of bruising legislative defeats in 2017  He directed the Justice Department not to defend the Affordable Care Act against a legal challenge  And he issued statements and tweets calling for Republicans to become  the party of health care   at a moment when many of his party s leaders had hoped to focus on different issues He also began reprising various promises about what a future plan to repeal and replace parts of the Affordable Care Act might achieve  The plan  short on specifics  will come with  far lower premiums  costs    deductibles   he said this week in a series of tweets  He promised that any Republican health plan would protect Americans with pre existing health conditions  a major concern of voters that Democrats effectively exploited in the 2018 midterm elections After his election  President Trump made similar promises  saying that the Republican proposal would be  far less expensive and far better  than Obamacare  The legislation that came later  and earned his endorsement  would have made insurance less expensive  but only for certain groups of young  high income  healthy Americans  The bills would have also eliminated coverage for millions of people by scaling back Medicaid  and would have made it harder for those with pre existing illnesses   and those who are older with low incomes   to find meaningful affordable options if they didn t get insurance from work The three senators he has chosen to lead the effort   Bill Cassidy of Louisiana  John Barrasso of Wyoming and Rick Scott of Florida   have so far also declined to point to many specifics  When asked about an Obamacare replacement this week  they mentioned their more modest bills to reduce health care costs in the emergency room and at the drugstore   A fourth senator the president has mentioned  the majority leader  Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  has been even more clear that he has little interest in pursuing comprehensive health care legislation  One clue to Mr  Trump s thinking is the choice of Mr  Cassidy  Along with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  he was the author of a legislative plan that received some scrutiny in 2017 but never came up for a vote  Another hint can be found in the president s own budget  released just before his reinvigorated health care push  A third is a draft proposal developed by a group of conservative Washington policy groups The Graham Cassidy billThe president has spoken fondly several times about this proposal  which did not have enough support in Congress to advance to a vote  It would eliminate current programs funding Obamacare s Medicaid expansion  which covers the working poor  and insurance subsidies helping low  and middle income Americans buy their insurance  Instead  that money would be grouped together  then parceled out to states to use in the service of health care programs they favor The legislation attaches some rules to how the money can be used   it must go toward health care  for example   but its main goal is to provide states with maximum flexibility to develop local and innovative solutions   Some experts worry that states could struggle to develop such plans on the bill s abbreviated timetable  That flexibility would allow states  if they so chose  to waive Obamacare s rules that plans must cover a standard set of medical benefits  and that insurers must charge the same prices to customers with different health histories  It would be easy for states to circumvent current protections for Americans with pre existing conditions  That ability would be at odds with the president s recent promises to protect such rules  The bill would also restructure the Medicaid program  even for populations that were enrolled in the program before Obamacare The bill s formula for allocating money among the states would also lead to big redistributions  generally taking money away from states that have expanded Medicaid  toward those that have not  It would also restrict the growth of the block grants over time  Those funding formulas  while technical  make a big difference in the impact of the program  It would result in substantial funding shortfalls for several large states nearly immediately  and leave nearly every state in a funding crunch over the long term The budgetBecause the 2020 White House budget was developed and published by the White House itself  it is perhaps the most useful clue about how the president imagines a world without Obamacare  Like the Graham Cassidy proposal  it includes block grants to the states to replace the Obamacare coverage expansion  and it replaces the remainder of Medicaid with a set of fixed payments to states But the rate at which the different grants would grow over time would be even smaller than under the legislation   to make the system more efficient  The budget is vague about what sorts of insurance regulations would be allowed  but it does note that a tenth of funds would need to be set aside for people with pre existing conditions  a sign that states would be allowed to exclude such people from the mainstream insurance markets The conservative coalition proposalA group of conservative health policy experts  including the Heritage Foundation  has developed a health care proposal that shares a basic structure with the two systems described above  It would hand states blocks of money and a few rules  and encourage them to develop their own health care systems The rules in the conservative plan differ a bit from those in Graham Cassidy  The plan would require that government subsidized systems offer every American a choice of a private health plan  a requirement that would probably foreclose a liberal state from enacting a single payer program and that might require restructuring of some state run Medicaid programs The plan shies away from specifying funding formulas  It doesn t say how the block of money should be divvied up among the states  though it says that states with more low income residents should get a bigger share  It also doesn t specify precisely how quickly the pot of money should grow over time Like the budget proposal  it nods to concerns about Americans with pre existing conditions by encouraging states to develop special programs  like high risk pools  to insure people with expensive health needs  But it also encourages insurance strategies  like discounts for young customers  or stripped down benefit plans  that would tend to make mainstream insurance less useful for people with serious health needs The proposal also leaves the legacy Medicaid program as is  That choice neutralizes one possible political line of attack  But it also substantially diminishes the program s possible cost savings The court case over the Affordable Care Act will be decided on the judiciary s timetable  so it s not clear how long the White House may have to develop a replacement plan  But  since it certainly has at least months  there is time to develop some new proposal more aligned with the president s recent promises Doing so will not be easy  however  Health care in the United States is expensive  which means that health plans that cover everyone with low deductibles are likely to be costly  The block grant plans the president has admired reduce rather than increase current federal spending on health care  Looser rules on health insurance are likely to increase costs on customers unfortunate enough

WASHINGTON   The U S  Federal Reserve on Monday proposed a new regulatory regime for 23 foreign banks operating in the U S  that could make life easier for some lenders  while tightening up rules for more risky foreign firms  The proposal  which would affect major banks like UBS  Credit Suisse  Deutsche Bank and HSBC  is part of a broader plan by the Fed to more closely tailor banking rules in line with firms  risk profiles The proposed changes  which are subject to industry feedback  would relax the capital and stress testing requirements for the subsidiaries of foreign banks  They would  however  impose stricter liquidity rules on subsidiaries of foreign lenders that rely extensively on riskier activities like short term funding The Fed also said it was soliciting input on imposing stricter liquidity requirements on foreign bank branches for the first time  although it stopped short of proposing new rules  In addition  the central bank proposed relaxing the schedule for how frequently foreign banks and domestic banks must submit  living wills  detailing how they could be dissolved in the event of failure  Currently  large foreign banks have to submit the plans annually  but the proposal would allow them to submit plans every two years  Smaller banks would be able to submit less detailed plans on a three year cycle  All domestic banks would also be allowed to submit scaled down plans every two years and comprehensive plans every four years Overall  Monday s proposal could reduce aggregate capital requirements for foreign banks by 0 5 percent  in addition to lowering compliance costs associated with stress testing  the Fed estimated However  changes to the liquidity rules on foreign bank subsidiaries would see aggregate liquid asset levels rise 0 5 percent to as much as 4 percent  the Fed said  Most foreign lenders currently hold enough liquid assets to satisfy the proposed changes  but depending on a bank s precise activity  some banks including UBS and Credit Suisse could see their overall costs rise  according to Fed officials The Fed board of governors voted the proposal through on Monday  although governor Lael Brainard dissented The proposed changes were prompted by legislation passed by Congress in May 2018 which gave the Fed discretion to ease rules for all but the nation s largest banks The package aims to broadly put foreign banks on an even footing with domestic firms after the Fed last October unveiled a similar proposal tailoring rules for super regional and other large domestic banks  But the Fed on Monday also said foreign banks tend to engage in riskier activities than their domestic rivals  including cross border lending and trading  and short term wholesale funding  leading it to be tougher on firms more heavily engaged in those businesses Foreign banks have for years complained that they are at a regulatory disadvantage in the U S  and are likely to push back on an additional idea floated on Monday to impose stricter liquidity rules on the branches of foreign banks  Unlike foreign banks  separately capitalized subsidiaries  branches are legally part of the overseas parent and therefore not subject to the same degree of U S  oversight as domestic firms  That arrangement had sparked concerns that branches could become a haven for riskier assets Fed data shows that of foreign banks with combined assets of more than  50 billion  around 40 percent of all their U S  assets were held in branches as of June    Editing by Michelle Price and Chizu Nomiyama  

MENLO PARK  California   Facebook has said it has made strides in its efforts to prevent online abuses in the Indian national election that starts this week but acknowledged that gaps remain in its  election integrity  efforts During a media tour of the company s election operations center at its Menlo Park headquarters in California on Friday  company officials touted new fact checking efforts for suppressing misinformation and technological advances such as the ability to detect when videos had been doctored But Katie Harbath  Facebook s public policy director for global elections  said measures including a better system for verifying the buyers of political advertisements remained imperfect and called for more government regulation of ad spending disclosures Excoriated for failing to stop Russian manipulation in the 2016 U S  presidential vote  Facebook has ramped up efforts to prevent abuses in subsequent elections  including the 2018 American midterms and the recent Brazilian and Mexican contests  Governments in many countries  including India and the UK  are contemplating strict new regulations for social media companies India  where Facebook has more users than in any other country  is shaping up as a major test  On April 1  the company said it had removed more than 500 accounts and 138 pages linked to India s opposition Congress party for  coordinated inauthentic behavior   Facebook s term for the use of fake accounts and other deceptive methods to promote a message It also took down a page with 2 million followers which  according to Facebook s review partner Atlantic Council think tank  was  pro BJP   India s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  and a supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi Harbath said the company can now quickly detect viral  politically sensitive stories and refer them for fact checking by outside organizations  The officials also touted heavy investment in technology for detecting doctored videos and text inside pictures  but acknowledged that that they have been unable to stop some duplicates of videos that have been identified as spurious  Facebook has partnered with seven fact checkers in India  If a post is found to be untrue  the company says it reduces the circulation of such fake posts by more than 80 percent  but slightly modified versions of the same images  video or text can escape detection and spread further Reuters earlier this month found instances of edited posts circulating on Facebook which the company s own fact checkers had said were false Deceptive political advertising has become another hot button problem for the company  Facebook has toughened the rules in India and political ads now include  published by  and  paid by  disclaimers  Users can also access a library that allows them to search and find out more about political advertisements  Harbath said political ad purchases in India now require either a certificate from the Election Commission or a physical address in India  as well as a phone number and group name of the entity purchasing the ad While Facebook will check that the address and phone number are legitimate  the company agreed that the same person could make up multiple entities at the same address  without any available record of the original source of money  This is a great example  we think  of where there needs to be more regulation   Harbath said   Reporting by Joseph Menn  Editing by Jonathan Weber and Raju Gopalakrishnan

Good Friday   Want this by email  Sign up here    It doesn t take a genius  to know capitalism needs fixingCapitalism helped Ray Dalio build his investment empire  But in a lengthy LinkedIn post  the Bridgewater Associates founder says that it isn t working anymore   Mr  Dalio writes that he has seen capitalism  evolve in a way that it is not working well for the majority of Americans because it s producing self reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have nots     Disparity in wealth  especially when accompanied by disparity in values  leads to increasing conflict and  in the government  that manifests itself in the form of populism of the left and populism of the right and often in revolutions of one sort or another     The problem is that capitalists typically don t know how to divide the pie well and socialists typically don t know how to grow it well     We are now seeing conflicts between populists of the left and populists of the right increasing around the world in much the same way as they did in the 1930s when the income and wealth gaps were comparably large     It doesn t take a genius to know that when a system is producing outcomes that are so inconsistent with its goals  it needs to be reformed  Stay tuned  Mr  Dalio says that he ll offer his solutions in another essay Elon Musk and the S E C  need their  reasonableness pants A federal judge gave Elon Musk and the S E C  two weeks to resolve a dispute about whether Mr  Musk violated a settlement he reached with the commission  Matthew Goldstein of the NYT reports Mr  Musk s tweeting is at the heart of the skirmish  The S E C  says that a tweet about Tesla production numbers violated the settlement  in which he promised to get approval from a Tesla lawyer before publishing any Twitter posts that include potentially market sensitive information His lawyers insist that the tweet didn t contain material information  One of them said yesterday that the S E C  s policy on what needs to be vetted was  murky   Judge Alison Nathan of Federal District Court in Manhattan wondered if there was a  lack of clarity  and whether the settlement should be modified or struck down  Take a deep breath   Judge Nathan told both sides  She added that they should put on  their reasonableness pants  to find common ground This is  something of a victory for Mr  Musk  who could have been fined if he was found to be in contempt   Mr  Goldstein writes  But Judge Nathan told Mr  Musk that  regardless of how powerful a person he is  a  court order is not optional  More  Tesla shares fell

investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash last month suggest that Boeing didn t give pilots enough guidance on new anti stall software in the 737 Max 8 The Ethiopian Airlines pilots followed Boeing s instructions when the anti stall system kicked in  the report suggests  They then shut down the software and tried to retake control   but failed to do so  Four minutes later  the plane crashed The system appeared to have forced the plane s nose down several times in less than three minutes  It  left the pilot with no ability to gain control of the aircraft if it went to the full limit   Dennis Tajer  a spokesman for American Airlines s pilots union  told the NYT   It s our responsibility to eliminate this risk   Dennis Muilenburg  Boeing s C E O   said yesterday   We own it

that  Anna Swanson of the NYT reports  instead saying that it may take at least four more weeks to secure an  epic  trade deal    The United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues  including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed  and when     In remarks at the White House  Mr  Trump said that the deal was  very complete  and that the two sides had  agreed to far more than we have left to agree to       I think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to   Mr  Trump added Yet no matter what  Mr  Trump can already claim a trade

What s in a mushroom burger  Or a veggie sausage Perhaps worried that you may be confused  some epicures at the European Parliament have proposed a new rule  If a product does not contain meat  it cannot be called a burger or a sausage or a steak The proposed amendment was passed by the body s agricultural committee this week as part of a voluminous revision of the European Union s Common Agricultural Policy Eric Andrieu  a French Socialist member of the European Parliament  introduced the proposal  but suspicions remained that the meat lobby was behind the idea  Environmentalists said the suggested labeling rules were an effort to undermine the growing demand for plant based foods  We didn t support the proposal   said Molly Scott Cato  a British member of the European Parliament from the Green Party   We don t see any problem with calling a veggie burger a veggie burger  Mr  Andrieu  who could not be reached to comment  told The Guardian that the meat lobby had nothing to do with the amendment and that he was attempting to add some common sense to food labeling  We felt that steak should be kept for real steak with meat   he said  warning that  a lot of creativity  would be needed to come up with new names for vegetarian products   People need to know what they are eating  Some news accounts of the proposed rule reported on a search for new names  including  vegetable protein tubes  and  veggie disc  Dairy producers were the first to allege that competitors selling plant based foods were using misleading labeling such as  tofu butter  or  veggie cheese  and they won a 2017 ruling from the European Court of Justice that reserved the names of dairy products for foods with an animal source  As part of its vote last week  the agricultural committee added to the dairy restrictions with a rule that would ban the use of phrases like  yogurt style  or  butter substitute  for plant based products The proposal about meat labeling was opposed by a coalition of environmental and animal rights groups  There is no evidence of consumer confusion   Greenpeace  Humane Society International and other groups wrote in a letter dated April 1   On the contrary  consumers purchase these items because they do not contain meat or dairy  The proposal must still pass the full European Parliament  which will not take it up until after elections in May  It would then have to be negotiated and agreed on by the Council of Ministers before becoming law  according to Neil Corlett  a European Parliament spokesman Whether the proposal is a maneuver by the meat lobby or simply an attempt by the French to assert food traditions  the proposal reflected a certain defensiveness by the meat industry as more and more people reduce their meat consumption  Ms  Scott Cato said  There was no consumer demand for this   she said  adding that she would continue to oppose the amendment as  an attempt by the meat industry to make life harder for people  who prefer vegetarian diets In the United States  there has been a push by the dairy industry to require the Food and Drug Administration to enforce labeling rules for milk as more Americans switch to  alternative milks   which come from any number of plants   Pea milk  anyone   Nobody thinks their almond milk comes from a cow   said Michele Simon  the executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association in San Francisco As for efforts in some states to come up with labeling for plant based meat substitutes  there was no confusion there either  she said   People are happily buying these products not thinking they are beef   she said Ms  Scott Cato pointed to the breakout success of vegan sausage rolls this year introduced by Greggs  a British bakery chain  in January  as evidence that more people are eating vegetarian dishes   and that they know what is in them  It s not like anybody bought a vegan sausage roll and asked where is the pig   she said

WASHINGTON   Senator Bernie Sanders stepped to the lectern on Wednesday  red faced and rumpled as ever  with a placard screaming  Medicare for All   and likened his quest for a government run universal health plan to earlier movements for women s rights  civil rights  workers  rights and gay rights  What we are involved in is not just health care legislation   he declared  flanked by admiring doctors in lab coats  Democratic senators and one of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York   We are involved in a great struggle  Medicare for All is not passing this Congress  Its cost is still unknown  the mechanisms to pay for it still the subject of debate  But behind Mr  Sanders s choreographed theatrics were the unmistakable politics of 2020 and his campaign for president  a campaign that never really ended with the election of Donald J  Trump After the 2016 election  Democrats made efforts to pull Mr  Sanders  a political independent from Vermont  into the fold with a newly minted leadership post  But that has only bolstered his platform to seek the presidency   and gave him more power to disrupt the party s status quo VideoSenator Bernie Sanders is embarking on a second run for president  This time the field will be bigger  more diverse and filled with candidates who have adopted his progressive populist mantle CreditCreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times I ran for president  I got 13 million votes  going over 1 700 delegates to the Democratic convention  and got more young people s votes than Clinton and Trump combined   Mr  Sanders boasted in an interview in his Washington office   And I thought that those 13 million people deserved a voice in Democratic leadership  The Medicare for All Act unveiling   its fifth iteration   comes as Mr  Sanders s  18 million fund raising haul has made him an instant front runner in a very crowded field  But in many ways he is still the  same old Bernie   as many of his colleagues like to say   a gruff and sometimes grating presence in a chamber that prides itself on civility  He still knows how to rankle He ran as a Democrat for president in 2016  then shunned the entreaties of Democratic leaders and sought re election last year as an independent  His push for Medicare for All runs counter to the wishes of top Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer  the minority leader  and Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who are trying to de emphasize it At the same time  Mr  Sanders   who has long cast himself as an outsider   has joined party leadership  which gives him a voice in plotting strategy  His post as  chair of outreach    a job that did not exist until he and Mr  Schumer created it after the 2016 presidential election   has also given him license and a small budget to travel the country doing what he likes best  rallying the progressive left to resist President Trump Image I ran for president  I got 13

CreditErin Schaff The New York Times Bernie Sanders  now a millionaire  pledges to release tax returns by Monday  More than a half dozen members of Congress are running for president  but few have used their seats as adroitly as Mr  Sanders to burnish a brand  He announced his candidacy in 2015 on a patch of grass  known as the Swamp  outside the Capitol   an unusual locale given that senators are not supposed to mix official business with politics Not long after the 2016 campaign  when some moderate Democrats worried he would help foster primary challenges against them  he brought his chief strategist  Jeff Weaver  to meet behind closed doors with his colleagues to tutor them on how to appeal to his millennial base He went on CNN to debate tax policy with Senator Ted Cruz  Republican of Texas  He held dozens of rallies in 2017 to whip up opposition to Mr  Trump s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act  I think he feeds off these crowds  there s no question about it   said Larry Cohen  chairman of Our Revolution  the organization that spun out of Mr  Sanders s 2016 campaign  Mr  Cohen added that Mr  Schumer realized there was  a huge benefit  to bringing on Mr  Sanders   You don t just bring him back after that kind of relative success and just treat him as the junior senator from Vermont  How  Medicare for All  Would Affect YouBernie Sanders s proposal has big implications for consumers and the health care industry Mr  Sanders also staked out policy crusades to address concerns that arose during his 2016 campaign  Criticized for lacking foreign policy experience  he teamed with two Republicans   Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky   to pass a resolution calling for an end to American military involvement in Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen  He also embraced a criminal justice overhaul after being accused of not being sensitive enough to issues of racial injustice He shrewdly hired the Democratic operative Tyson Brody  who compiled opposition research on him for Hillary Clinton s campaign in 2016  Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and a co chairman of Mr  Sanders s 2020 campaign  calls Mr  Sanders  the perfect insider outsider  who  unlike Mr  Trump  at least knows how Washington works The last time he embarked on a run for the White House  in April 2015  Mr  Sanders  was viewed by his colleagues as a kind of oddball figure   a self identified democratic socialist on a Don Quixote  tilting at windmills quest  I think people should be a little bit careful underestimating me   he said then Now the senator has a different problem  So many Democrats sound so much like Bernie Sanders that some are asking why America needs Bernie Sanders  His Medicare for All bill is a case in point  Its co sponsors include at least four Senate Democrats who are running against him  Ms  Gillibrand  Cory Booker of New Jersey  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California ImageMr  Sanders this month at a campaign rally in Davenport  Iowa  Democratic efforts to pull Mr  Sanders into the fold with a newly minted leadership post have helped bolster his presidential bid CreditJordan Gale for The New York TimesBut in planting a political stake in the ground with Medicare for All  Mr  Sanders is effectively challenging his Democratic rivals to follow suit  which could come back to haunt whomever is chosen as the party s nominee  said David Krone  a former chief of staff to Harry Reid  the former Senate Democratic leader  I m very concerned that his campaign is creating a litmus test for other candidates and that s a dangerous path   Mr  Krone said The Medicare for All Act would provide health insurance to all Americans under a single plan run by the government and financed by taxpayers  private insurers could remain in business but could only provide benefits  such as elective surgery  not covered by the government  The 2019 version includes coverage for long term care  perhaps increasing its appeal but also its cost The rollout   complete with Sanders esque finger jabs and talk of  doctahs  and  dollahs    was live streamed from a packed room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building  After Mr  Sanders poked Mr  Trump  the president s press secretary  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  no relation   poked back  denouncing  self proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders  for  proposing a total government takeover of health care  Would  Medicare for All  Save Billions or Cost Billions We asked a handful of economists and think tanks to find out The plan s main drawback   and one that alarms many moderate Democrats and Democratic leadership   is the cost  as high as  32 trillion over 10 years  according to two different studies  But the Sanders camp cites various other studies  including one by the RAND Corporation  to back up its assertion that Medicare for All would save middle class families money by decreasing their premiums and out of pocket costs As to why America needs Bernie Sanders  Mr  Sanders s answer is simple  He was there first  Find out how many folks in the 1980s were going up to Canada to learn about Medicare for All   he said  adding   In 1999  I took a busload of Vermonters across the Canadian border to purchase low cost prescription drugs in Canada  O K   I was the first member of Congress to do that  So are other people talking about the greed of the pharmaceutical industry  Yes  Check out who was there first  He also took a subtle swipe at another of his competitors  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  Of her idea for a trillion dollar infrastructure plan  he said   Well  we were talking about that how many years ago  2015  Ms  Klobuchar then swiped back   While a big infrastructure plan has been kicked around for years  I can get it done   she wrote in an email message Mr  Sanders has always been a scowling presence in the Senate  He plows through the Capitol corridors  always too busy to talk  stingy with his smiles    If you worked here  you wouldn t smile either   he said  His official website offers a hint of where the job falls on his priority list  Until Wednesday  after this article pointed it out  it had not been updated to reflect his re election in 2018 and still said he was  serving his second term after winning re election in 2012  He is thinner these days  having dropped 10 pounds on no particular diet   or at least none that he cares to share    By not eating   he said  when asked how he did it   And though his  national support has given Bernie more credibility   in the words of Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the No  2 Democrat  his colleagues say not much has changed  He s Bernie   said Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia  who ran for vice president alongside Mrs  Clinton after she defeated Mr  Sanders for the 2016 Democratic nomination   Whether that s running or just being Bernie  he kind of does what he does

KIGALI   Rwanda began a week of solemn ceremonies on Sunday to commemorate the lives of 800 000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus murdered during the Rwandan genocide  a three month killing spree that began 25 years ago President Paul Kagame laid a wreath at the Gisozi genocide memorial site  where over a quarter a million of people are buried  before an afternoon of speeches and song  Later  a candelit vigil was held in the packed national soccer stadium   There is no way to fully comprehend the loneliness and anger of survivors and yet over and over again we have asked them to make the sacrifices necessary to give our nation new life  Emotions had to be put in a box   Kagame said  his tall  thin form projected onto television screens around the nation   We are far better Rwandans than we were  But we can be even better still  We are the last people in the world who should succumb to complacency  The 100 days of slaughter began on April 6  1994  after President Juvenal Habyarimana and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi    both Hutus    were killed when their plane was shot down over the Rwandan capital  The attackers have never been identified Among the legacies of the genocide is the International Criminal Court  which grew out of tribunals to investigate and prosecute those responsible for atrocities committed in Rwanda and during the Balkan wars of the 1990s  At Gisozi on Sunday  popular Rwandan artists sang songs like  Turabunamira twiyubaka   meaning  honouring them as we rebuild   Remembering is necessary because it s only thanks to looking back at what happened  that we can  ensure that it never happens again   said hairdresser Olive Muhorakeye  26 In the late afternoon  thousands of people marched from parliament to the national soccer stadium  After they had entered  the lights were extinguished and the dark stadium was lit only by a sea of flickering candles as survivors spoke   I named my children after all my siblings that died   Samuel Dusengiyumva told the emotional crowd  before praising the actions of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  RPF   a Tutsi led rebel movement led by Kagame that ended the genocide   I thank the RPF army that rescued us as the rest of world did nothing  As the testimonies continued  counsellors in green jackets hurried through the rows of seats as some members of the crowd wept or screamed  Others took selfies  NEIGHBOUR TURNED ON NEIGHBOUR    The downing of Habyarimana s plane was immediately followed by killings as Hutu government soldiers and allied extremist militia began trying to exterminate the Tutsi minority In villages across the densely populated country  neighbour turned on neighbour  Men  women and children were hacked to death  burned alive  clubbed and shot     As many as 10 000 people were killed daily  Seventy percent of the minority Tutsi population was wiped out  and over 10 percent of the total Rwandan population     The fighting ended in July 1994 when the RPF  led by Kagame  swept in from Uganda and seized control of the country      Under Kagame  any talk of ethnicity is strongly discouraged  The opposition says the tight control of the media and political sphere is also used to stifle dissent     The ruling party has decided to adopt dictatorship from early days after the genocide as they said they were protecting the national sovereignty  but now I feel that should end   opposition figure Victoire Ingabire told Reuters   The government should let the opposition politicians work freely because denying them their rights will create problems  Twenty five years is enough  the government should let people be free to express their opinions  Kagame  who won nearly 99 percent of the vote in 2017 polls on a 96 percent turnout  rebuffs such criticism  pointing to Rwanda s strong economic growth and relative peace since the genocide  In Sunday s speech  he also issued a challenge to anyone who might threaten the country  What happened here will never happen again  For those  who      want to mess with us     we will mess up with them big time   he said    Editing by Katharine Houreld and Catherine Evans  

LONDON   Some British citizens planning to travel abroad already have a tangible sign of what life will look like once the country is no longer a member of the European Union  new passports missing  European Union  on the front cover Last month  even as lawmakers wrestled over the principal terms of the withdrawal process known as Brexit  the Home Office said that the design of new passports would change after March 29  the initial date set for Britain s departure For a while  both the old and new designs will be made and both are valid for travel  the Home Office said  adding   You will not be able to choose whether you get a passport that includes the words European Union or a passport that does not  While Brexit itself has been delayed   the original departure deadline was extended to April 12  and Prime Minister Theresa May has asked Brussels for a further postponement   the passport changes have moved forward as planned One early recipient  Susan Hindle Barone  posted images of her new and old British passports on Twitter on Friday  asking others to  spot the difference  Both passports have burgundy covers dominated by a golden coat of arms  But on one  the words  European Union  were missing from the top  Truly appalled   Ms  Hindle Barone wrote   I didn t notice it until I looked at them next to each other  It makes me feel sick  In an email on Saturday  Ms  Hindle Barone  a supporter of remaining in the European Union wrote   I was just shocked and dismayed to see the change to the passport as we haven t left the E U  yet  It s not the passport itself  but what the changes symbolize   something which I believe to be completely futile  What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union A Home Office spokeswoman told the BBC that  in order to use leftover stock and achieve best value to the taxpayer   British passports with  European Union  will still be issued for  a short period  Among the chief uncertainties surrounding Brexit was how traveling to Europe would change  depending on whether Britain reached a deal with the bloc  In posters on public transport and the internet  the government has warned people to renew their passports early if they planned to travel as the Brexit process was unfolding Drivers who held pink plastic permits under European Union standards were told to get ready to apply for international licenses in case Britain left without a deal  Here is what a no deal Brexit would look like  But for Britons  whose passports sometimes are their only form of identification  the document has come to symbolize Brexit  When the government announced that it would return to the old blue passports after Brexit  hailed by Mrs  May  who supported remaining in the bloc  as  an expression of independence   those in favor of the withdrawal saw a strong sign of their country reclaiming control Their joy was soon tempered by news that the documents would most likely be manufactured in France The symbolism of seemingly mundane documents is not limited to passports  In 2015  a year after Scotland voted not to declare independence from the United Kingdom  the government placed the British flag on driving licenses issued in England  Scotland and Wales in a bid to foster national unity  Driver s licenses are handled differently in Northern Ireland   The transport minister at the time  Tariq Ahmad  described the addition as  a true celebration of one nation Britain  The European Union requires its members to make passports with certain security elements  but it does not mandate a uniform design  Nearly all 28 member countries have adopted the recommended layout  the name of the bloc on top  followed by the name of the country  a coat of arms and the word  passport   with translations of information on the cover in all 24 official languages inside Only Croatia  which joined the bloc in 2013  has continued to issue a dark blue passport Britain first issued blue passports in 1921  It had 32 pages and was written in French  according to the Home Office  Passports carried the signature of the foreign secretary until 1947  The covers were changed to burgundy in 1988 to align with Britain s European partners Britons eager to start using a blue passport will have to wait until at least the end of the year  when the government will begin phasing them in  But burgundy booklets will continue to be issued until early 2020  

NEW YORK   Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders  courting the black voters who did not support his 2016 White House run  drew a sharp personal contrast on Friday with what he called President Donald Trump s racist policies Sanders  a U S  senator from Vermont  told a crowd of African American activists that his push for economic equality  including universal healthcare  free public college and a higher minimum wage  would help ease the country s racial wealth gap  Like many of you here  I have been fighting for economic  social and racial justice  As this presidential campaign begins  I believe that is the defining difference between President Trump and me   Sanders said at the Reverend Al Sharpton s National Action Network in New York  Donald Trump is a man who has said he believes Nazis and white supremacists are  very fine people    Sanders said  a reference to Trump s comments after violence at a white supremacist march in Charlottesville  Virginia in 2017  I am the son of an immigrant whose family was murdered by the Nazis  and so  from a very young age  I knew that we must stand up to bigotry wherever it exists  Sanders  whose father was an immigrant from Poland  struggled to win black support in his losing 2016 Democratic primary race against Hillary Clinton  who along with her husband  former President Bill Clinton  had proven appeal to black voters Since launching his 2020 presidential campaign  Sanders has made an effort to emphasize his history of civil rights activism and make an explicit case for how his economic policies would benefit African Americans  HE HAS LIVED UP TO EVERYTHING At the conference  Sanders drew words of praise from Sharpton  who has said he will not endorse a Democratic candidate until later in the year  Sharpton reminded the crowd  however  of his breakfast in Harlem with Sanders at the height of the campaign for president in 2016  I can say in the two years since  he has lived up to everything he has said to me and more  I want you to know he has done what he said   Sharpton told the crowd Sanders was one of seven Democrats who spoke to the conference on Friday  Five others in the growing Democratic 2020 White House field appeared at the conference earlier in the week The candidates have backed an array of policies to close the racial gap in economic equality  improve access to healthcare and institute criminal justice reforms including eliminating cash bail  outlawing the death penalty  legalizing marijuana and wiping clean the records of non violent drug offenders Democrats in the 2020 race have intensified their outreach to black voters this year following the first decline in African American turnout in 20 years during the 2016 election  which helped sink Hillary Clinton and contributed to Trump s stunning upset victory The historically diverse 2020 Democratic field includes black  Hispanic and openly gay candidates  as well as a record six women so far  U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren raised the prospect in her speech of eliminating the Senate filibuster  the procedural rule that requires a 60 vote supermajority in the 100 member chamber  for legislation  saying it had been used through history to block civil rights and other bills Democrats eliminated the filibuster for some executive branch and lower level judicial appointments when they controlled the Senate under Democratic President Barack Obama  Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has curtailed it further to apply to Supreme Court nominations Eliminating the filibuster for legislation would be a significant escalation of the partisan battle that has raged in Congress in recent years  For generations  the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice  And in recent years  it s been used by the far right as a tool to block progress on everything   Warren said  When Democrats have the White House again  if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama  and puts small minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country  then we should get rid of the filibuster   Warren told the conference   Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Bill Berkrot  

How s this for a state of emergency  An entire region of the country takes up armed resistance against the federal government  brazenly murdering and raping its African American citizens in a decades long campaign of terror that subverts and then rewrites the law More dire  certainly  than an invasion of criminal migrants at the border  And it actually happened The shockingly violent  depressingly predictable backlash in the American South to the end of slavery  and to the attempt to make freed slaves equal members of society  is the central concern of  Reconstruction  America After the Civil War   a four hour PBS series written and narrated by Henry Louis Gates Jr   It shows in two hour installments  on Tuesday and on April 16  Among the many lacunae in Americans  knowledge of their own history  our hazy notions of Reconstruction and its overthrow   essential to an understanding of so much in our own times  from the civil rights movement to today s mirror like rise of white nationalism   may be the most damaging  Many people  if they have any sense of the era at all  came by it through  Gone With the Wind  or  even more grievously   The Birth of a Nation  So Gates s series is a great service  especially in its first two hours  which cover the years from the end of the Civil War  with the initial enthusiasm and promise of Reconstruction  to the contested election of Rutherford B  Hayes in 1876  which essentially ended the federal government s efforts to enforce Reconstruction in the South The project mostly hews to the standard PBS history format  with a large cast of scholars and writers   more than 40   talking over antique photographs and documents  with the occasional impressionistic recreation of events and snippets of gospel and ragtime  But it also incorporates contemporary images of violence and protest  and it is distinguished by Gates s onscreen presence  talking to the camera while strolling through the story s locales and interviewing inheritors of the struggle Without hitting us over the head  the series continually brings out connections and correspondences between then and now  One of the first great fruits of Reconstruction is the establishment  in the 14th Amendment  of birthright citizenship  now under attack   Convict leasing  institutionalizes the unwarranted jailing of African American men and women to provide labor for plantations that no longer have slaves  Techniques like poll taxes and literacy tests are quickly invented to suppress the black vote  Fake news  campaigns alleging the rape of white women are used to incite and justify the indiscriminate killing and lynching of black men  Minstrelsy and blackface powerfully reinforce notions of white supremacy  Overwhelming efforts in the South to rewrite history and take slavery out of the Civil War narrative lead to the proliferation of Confederate monuments  and thus  more than a century later  to pitched battles and murder in Charlottesville  Va   The series s second two hours   which cover subjects like the Jim Crow system  the Ku Klux Klan  W E B  DuBois  the creation of the N A A C P  and the ascendance of black popular culture   are engrossing but less urgent  To cover so much ground  they settle into a more anecdotal  great person approach   For a more detailed look at some of the stories in this period  seek out the invaluable documentaries of Stanley Nelson  like  The Black Press  and  Tell Them We Are Rising  Historically Black Colleges and Universities   both streaming online  It s conceivable that  Reconstruction  could be criticized for being one sided   for not finding someone to defend the romantic view of Confederate history  or to make the contemporary case that white Americans are economically and culturally victimized  It would be a baseless criticism from the point of view of scholarship or principle  One thought  though  The series s accounts of violence against African Americans tend to have an abstract feeling  and some direct insight into the racist mind set could help to communicate its full force  Reconstruction  chooses to tell its story soberly and quietly  From the beginning  it silently establishes a predominant visual motif  photographic portraits of African Americans  singly and in groups small and large  in fields  yards and forest clearings  on church lawns  school steps and front porches  Their subjects look directly into the camera  proudly and  to the modern eye  accusingly  The succession of images insists on their dignity and humanity at a time when these qualities were brutally denied  a point made explicitly late in the series in a segment on the importance of photography in the African American community Their descendants continue to make that same case  Half of the 40 plus historians Gates has assembled are black  Calmly dissecting white America s unceasing claim that they aren t intelligent or civilized enough for full citizenship  those scholars are the irrefutable answer  still in plain sight after 400 years

CAMBRIDGE  Mass    Harvard is investigating its longtime fencing coach after learning that he sold his house for a vastly inflated price to the father of a current student  shortly before the student was admitted The inquiry into the coach  Peter Brand  comes as universities around the country are scrambling to respond to a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud  which has raised questions about athletic recruitment and whether coaches have enriched themselves by essentially selling recruiting slots The United States attorney s office in Boston has charged 50 people in the case  including eight coaches and 33 parents  among them Hollywood celebrities and prominent business people Harvard has so far not been tied to the scandal in court documents  A university official said in an email to students and faculty members on Thursday that she did not believe the circumstances surrounding Mr  Brand  first reported by The Boston Globe  were connected to that case In 2016  Mr  Brand sold his house in Needham  a suburb of Boston  to Jie Zhao  whom The Globe described as a wealthy Maryland businessman  At the time  Mr  Zhao s older son was a student at Harvard and on the fencing team  and his younger son was still in high school  Mr  Zhao paid  989 500  some  400 000 more than the assessed value at the time  which was  549 300  Place is vintage 1960s in bad shape   the town s assessor wrote when he inspected the house after the sale   Makes no sense  At around the same time  Mr  Brand and his wife  Jacqueline Phillips  bought a condominium in Cambridge for  1 3 million  well above the  989 000 asking price Soon after  Mr  Zhao s younger son  Edward  was admitted to Harvard  where he is currently a sophomore and at least until recently was on the fencing team  according to a profile that was recently deleted from the website for Harvard s sports teams  He is no longer listed as a member of the team Mr  Zhao sold the house in Needham in October 2017  for  665 000  a significant loss Mr  Brand  Mr  Zhao  and Mr  Zhao s sons did not respond to messages A spokeswoman for Harvard  Rachael Dane  said that the university was unaware of the circumstances surrounding the sale until asked about it by The Globe  and that it was now conducting an independent review  We are committed to ensuring the integrity of our recruitment practices   she said Ms  Dane would not confirm whether Mr  Zhao s younger son was in fact recruited by Mr  Brand  although the brothers were referred to as student athletes in the email sent to students and faculty members on Thursday In the email  Claudine Gay  the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences  wrote that Harvard s athletic recruitment practices were different from those of some other schools  The applications of student recruits are reviewed by the full admissions committee  which has roughly 40 members  and admissions decisions are made by a vote of the whole committee  Also  she said  all recruited athletes had to be interviewed by an admissions officer or alumni interviewer At this stage of the investigation into Mr  Brand  she said  there was a lot the university did not know yet  Regardless of what we eventually learn about these allegations  this is not a time for complacency   she wrote   Where there are opportunities to clarify practices and strengthen procedures  we must act on them  and do so with a sense of urgency  The university s admissions practices have been under scrutiny for months  A lawsuit charging Harvard with discriminating against Asian American applicants went to trial in October  In the process of defending itself  Harvard was forced to reveal many admissions secrets  including the advantages given to students whose parents went to Harvard  relatives of donors and recruited athletes  Documents showed that in recent years the admission rate of recruited athletes was 86 percent  A judge has not yet ruled in the lawsuit The Globe also reported on another set of peculiar transactions involving Mr  Brand  Mr  Zhao  and a nonprofit organization called the National Fencing Foundation of Washington D C In 2013  Mr  Zhao made a  1 million gift to the fencing foundation  according to Timothy Miller  who was the organization s treasurer at the time  The next year   the same year that Mr  Zhao s older son  Eric  enrolled at Harvard   the fencing foundation made a  100 000 grant to a private foundation set up by Mr  Brand and his wife  tax documents show  The grant was one of only two that Mr  Brand s foundation received before it dissolved two years later The fencing foundation s president  Alexandre Ryjik  did not respond to messages  

Jeff Bezos  Amazon s founder and chief executive  and his wife  MacKenzie Bezos  said on Twitter on Thursday that they had finalized the details of their divorce Mr  Bezos will keep 75 percent of the couple s Amazon stock and all of their ownership of The Washington Post and the Blue Origin space company  Ms  Bezos wrote  Mr  Bezos will also have  sole voting authority  over Ms  Bezos  Amazon shares  according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission After the divorce  Ms  Bezos will own roughly 4 percent of Amazon  a stake that was worth almost  36 billion on Thursday  By keeping 75 percent of the couple s Amazon shares  or about 12 percent of the company  Mr  Bezos will most likely remain the richest person in the world  His remaining stake in the company was worth almost  108 billion on Thursday   Bill Gates  the second wealthiest  is worth  102 billion  according to Bloomberg  Experts had said that in Washington State  where Amazon is based and where the couple have been raising their four children  Ms  Bezos was entitled to roughly half of their assets  They have other investments and properties across the United States  The details of divorce settlements are not public  and theirs could contain other compensation for Ms  Bezos Ms  Bezos wrote on Twitter on Thursday that she was  excited about my own plans   without providing details  She has historically kept a low profile  focusing on her work as a novelist and on raising the couple s children Amazon declined to comment Their divorce filing caps four months of the kind of public drama that Amazon and its founder have long eschewed The couple announced their plan to split on Twitter in early January  saying that  after a long period of loving exploration and a trial separation  we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends   The news came as a surprise  Just a few months earlier they were spotted in a Miami nightclub celebrating their 25th anniversary After the news initially sent Amazon shares down  investors brushed it away  and the price rebounded But the relatively quiet disclosure took on new life a day later when The National Enquirer reported that Mr  Bezos was romantically involved with Lauren Sanchez  a former Los Angeles TV anchor  The tabloid published photos of the two together as well as intimate text messages Since then  Mr  Bezos and American Media Inc   the parent company of The National Enquirer  have been embroiled in a public feud Mr  Bezos published emails from American Media that he said amounted to  extortion and blackmail   He said the company had threatened to publish more embarrassing details  including a  below the belt selfie  that he had sent Ms  Sanchez  He insinuated that the leaks could have been politically motivated to harm him because of his ownership of The Washington Post  American Media denied those accusations On Saturday  Mr  Bezos  security consultant wrote an opinion article for The Daily Beast that said his team had  concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos  phone  and gained private information   He said the Saudis had targeted Mr  Bezos because of the newspaper s reporting on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi  one of its columnists  who United States officials believe was killed on the orders of the Saudi crown prince Mr  Bezos  consultant did not provide direct evidence of the accusation  nor did he say whether the Saudis had provided information to The Enquirer American Media flatly denied any Saudi involvement  It said that Ms  Sanchez s brother  Michael Sanchez  was the  sole source  of its investigation  and that  there was no involvement by any other third party whatsoever  A Saudi official also said Saudi Arabia  categorically rejects all allegations  of being involved in the matter Despite all the drama  the Bezos divorce moved quickly  did not resort to court and was announced in unison  This is an example of how you would want to handle this kind of situation if you were a public figure   said Jennifer Payseno  a divorce lawyer who works with wealthy families in the Seattle area  where the Bezoses live  They are intertwined financially  so anything that helps him succeed helps her and vice versa   Ms  Payseno said After filing for divorce on Thursday  under state law the Bezoses must wait 90 days to submit their divorce decree to a court for approval  

RAMALLAH  West Bank   Israel is holding an election on Tuesday  and Palestinian communities in the occupied territories are not following it with much interest  This is not because whoever is elected will not have a strong impact on our lives  It s because none of the leading candidates has a program for peace  The main contenders are committed to maintaining the illegal Jewish settlements that have been established in the West Bank  They do not seek to end the occupation  Israel has not formally annexed the West Bank or the Gaza Strip  but it lords over these lands like a sovereign power  Or worse  It has seized tax revenues from the Palestinian Authority  which is supposed to administer the West Bank  it keeps Gaza under siege  It dictates that we  Palestinians  can only watch from our homes the results of an election whose outcome will govern our lives and the future on our land  Israeli Jews in the West Bank are citizens  but we are not  They will be able to go into Israel to vote  Not us During the last Israeli election  in 2015  I wrote that Palestinians here had become less interested in the results of that race than in the prospect of filing various international legal cases  I  for one  had pinned my hopes on the preparation of several claims to be brought before the International Criminal Court in The Hague  One of them would challenge the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank  There was no lack of evidence  I thought  and the transfer of civilians by a government into territories it occupies is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 Now I think  Never mind the merits of any such cases  With the United States government threatening to refuse granting visas to the court s staff   this  in relation to another case  to do with suspected crimes in Afghanistan   our chances are slim  Last month  the Trump administration also recognized Israel s authority over the Golan Heights  disputed territory that Israel forcibly seized from Syria in 1967  This can only embolden Israel to eventually proceed with the formal annexation of the West Bank Israel  thanks partly to this support from the United States  now appears to be winning on all fronts  with impunity  And we Palestinians seem too weak to stop it Israelis  for their part  seem to live under the illusion popularized by their prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  that their government can manage the conflict   that there is no need to actually resolve it  Yet over the span of Mr  Netanyahu s premiership  the situation has gone from gloom to more gloom  from dark times to darker ones  from some measure of hope to despair Then again  at this point  maybe even darker would be better for us   maybe that s the only way out  My one consolation watching Israel pursue its current path is to think that it is doing itself damage  too Consider three examples Violence by Jewish settlers and right wing activists against Palestinians in the West Bank more than tripled last year  compared with 2017 An Israeli family built a home on land taken away from Palestinians   and then tried to rent it out on Airbnb  When the company balked  citing a new policy announced late last year against listing properties in settlements  the family brought a case for discrimination in the United States   The Palestinian family is suing back  Last week  a family near the village of Hizma  north of Jerusalem  whose house is in an Israeli settlement  chose to destroy its home of more than three decades rather than paying Israeli authorities to do the job  and being fined  Won t Israeli society at some point also feel the nefarious effects of its government s inhumanity toward us In Arundhati Roy s novel  The Ministry of Utmost Happiness   one of her characters  Musa  says that if Kashmiris have failed to gain independence from India  at least in struggling for it they have exposed the corruption of India s system  Musa tells the book s narrator  an Indian   You re not destroying us  You are constructing us  It s yourselves that you are destroying   Palestinians today might say the same of our struggle with Israel Raja Shehadeh is a lawyer and the author of  Where the Line Is Drawn  A Tale of Crossings  Friendships and Fifty Years of Occupation in Israel Palestine  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

LANSING  Mich    Bruising political fights are usual business in Becky Debowski s eighth grade social studies classroom  From a model Constitutional Convention to a bare knuckle debate in Congress over slavery  she regularly has students assume roles of partisans throughout American history  like Abraham Lincoln and John C  Calhoun After the exercises  the class comes back together to debate whether the nation lived up to what the state of Michigan calls  core democratic values   such as equality  liberty and diversity  For decades  the values have been the heart of the state learning standards in social studies  a doorstop of a document that guides what teachers of history  civics  economics and geography cover in their lesson plans  I m really proud of my students   Ms  Debowski said   They can handle the complexity   So she was angry last year when she learned of a proposed revision of the state standards  in which the word  democratic  was dropped from  core democratic values   and the use of the word  democracy  was reduced The changes were made after a group of prominent conservatives helped revise the standards  They drew attention to a long simmering debate over whether  republic  is a better term than  democracy  to describe the American form of government That the two sides in that tussle tend to fall along party lines  each preferring the term that resembles their party name  plays no small part in the debate  But members of the conservative group also brought to the table the argument that K 12 social studies should be based on a close  originalist reading of the United States  founding documents They contended that the curriculum ought to focus more on the nation s triumphs than its sins  And they pushed for revisions that eliminated  climate change    Roe v  Wade  and references to gay and lesbian civil rights After a local publication  Bridge Magazine  reported the changes  the backlash in this political swing state was intense  In response  the state brought a broader group of Michiganders into the process to redraft the standards  which will be presented to the State Board of Education on April 9  The board  an elected body with eight members  will then vote on whether to adopt the document  Social studies is not rocket science   said Jim Cameron  who led the committee s work   It s more difficult  Defining American ValuesThe United States  unlike many other developed nations  lacks a national curriculum that defines what students should know  Each of the 50 states can create its own learning standards These documents are closely examined  While schools can teach material not included in them  they shape the content in standardized tests  and many educators rely heavily on the standards as they craft lesson plans  Student teachers are trained to use them Activists have long seen influencing state standards as an effective way to shape the next generation of voters  In 2010  conservatives on the Texas State Board of Education removed the word  democracy  as a description of American government  prompting protests  Georgia has also debated the term  eventually settling  in 2016  on standards that use the phrase  representative democracy republic  The Michigan conservatives   who prefer  constitutional republic    say their arguments are historical  not partisan ImageThe kindergarten section of the new draft of the Michigan social studies standards  Previously  conservatives pushed for the nation to be called a  constitutional republic  founded on  core values   not  democratic values   The previous draft also used the term  roles of the citizen  instead of  civic participation   When you read Article IV  Section IV  it says you re guaranteed a republican form of government   said Patrick Colbeck  a Republican former state senator  citing the United States Constitution While the founders were indeed skeptical of direct democracy  mainstream historians  political scientists and legal scholars say that the United States is both a representative democracy and a republic   and that there is no contradiction between those terms A democracy is government by the people  who may rule either directly or indirectly  through elected representatives  A republic is a form of government in which the people s elected representatives make decisions Some of the country s political processes  like ballot referendums  are more democratic than others  like the Electoral College  Grappling with that complexity is key to understanding American government  according to social studies experts The Michigan Department of Education invited Mr  Colbeck to participate in the standards writing process after he submitted a 13 page critique of a 2015 draft of the document  Mr  Colbeck  a former aerospace engineer who became active in politics through the Tea Party movement  saw liberal bias throughout the standards Asked to name the influences on his view of American history  Mr  Colbeck cited Dinesh D Souza  the right wing commentator  and a radio talk show hosted by Levon R  Yuille  a pastor and anti abortion activist  I wanted to make sure there was a seat at the table for a conservative worldview   Mr  Colbeck said After the proposed revisions garnered local media attention  hundreds of people flocked to community meetings to voice their outrage about what they considered conservative bias  Thousands more registered their objections online Ms  Debowski  the eighth grade social studies teacher  was among those against replacing  democratic values  with  core values   She was capable  she said  of explaining the difference between party names and political concepts   It belittles my subject   she said Many of the students who protested were less worried about terminology than about the way the standards dealt with gender and race  Alex Hosey  a 16 year old high school sophomore in East Lansing  objected to what had been left out  such as any mention of redlining  which contributed to the racial segregation of Michigan cities  Hiding our nation s sins isn t the right way to do it   he wrote in a letter to the State Board of Education   Teach us about everything   the good and the bad  so we can learn to think for ourselves  ImagePatrick Colbeck  a Republican former state senator  participated in the standards writing process CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesImageMarsha Lewis  a Detroit assistant principal and a chairwoman of the bias review group CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesBack to the Drawing BoardUnder fire  the state education agency asked for volunteers to help rewrite the standards yet again   for the third time in five years Out of 144 people who applied  116 were selected  They included teachers  college professors  parents  students and retirees  They were placed on subcommittees dealing with every aspect of the document  from American history  civics and economics to  bias review   and sorted through thousands of pages of public comments They added depth to sections on indigenous peoples  history  Roe v  Wade  climate change and gay and lesbian rights were all restored  The bias review committee suggested the terms  enslaved people  or  enslaved Africans  instead of  slaves  The overall goal was that every Michigan student   a third of whom are nonwhite   would be able to  see themselves  in the social studies standards  said Marsha Lewis  a Detroit assistant principal and a chair of the bias review group But in the days before the document was to be sent to the State Board of Education  fundamental questions about how to describe American government and citizenship had not been resolved It was not just that some Democratic leaning committee members liked the term  democracy  while some Republican leaning members preferred  republic   The debate was really about bigger disagreements that transcended party lines  about how to deal with populism and protest  and about whether the United States is a unified entity of citizens or a conglomeration of groups divided by race  class  language and other identities On March 7  the heads of all the subcommittees gathered at the Historical Society of Michigan in Lansing to go through the draft one last time  The laptop screen of the head writer  a district social studies consultant named Dave Johnson  was projected onto the wall as he made last minute revisions in a Google document Should  responsible citizenship  be replaced with  civic participation   in an effort to include undocumented students Were elementary school students ready to learn about the right  stated in the Declaration of Independence  to  alter or abolish  a government  There s a treason clause in the U S  Constitution   said Michael Libbee  a professor of geography at Central Michigan University  It s only treason until it works   replied Ellen Zwarensteyn  executive director of the Michigan Center for Civic Education In the end   alter or abolish  was included  though the number of mentions was greatly reduced  The writers replaced many  but not all  instances of the word  citizenship  with  civic life  or  civic participation  After lunch  Mr  Cameron  the committee leader and a state education consultant  tacked to the walls poster pages of handwritten suggestions from African American and Asian American community groups Among their suggestions were to add references to Korematsu v  the United States  the Supreme Court case that allowed Japanese internment during World War II  They also asked for mentions of the Chinese Exclusion Act  the Flint water crisis  the  MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter Ms  Zwarensteyn took careful notes  Some of the most rigorous debates had occurred on the civics subcommittee she helped lead  where Michael Warren  a circuit court judge  was a strong conservative voice  Judge Warren preferred the term  first principles  to  democratic values   and had pushed for the civics standards to be based on a close reading of the founding documents ImageMichael Warren  a circuit court judge  was a strong conservative voice CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesImageEllen Zwarensteyn  executive director of the Michigan Center for Civic Education CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesThe list of core values that the standards writers eventually agreed on was  equality  liberty  justice and fairness  unalienable individual rights  including life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness   consent of governed  truth  common good  And after months of sometimes bitter debate  the group decided these values could still be called  democratic   As part of a compromise  the nation s political system would be referred to primarily as  American government   but also  in some instances   constitutional government  and   yes    democracy  Korematsu and the Flint water crisis made it into the standards  Redlining  the Chinese Exclusion Act   MeToo and Black Lives Matter did not  Neither did James Madison  to the consternation of Mr  Warren Mr  Colbeck  the former state senator who had helped write the previous draft  was displeased  Calling the nation a democracy was not  politically neutral and accurate   he said There will still be time for public comment and revision  Education officials plan to introduce the new standards in  listen and learn  meetings across the state this spring If the Board of Education  which after November s election went from a 4 4 partisan split to a 6 2 Democratic majority  votes to adopt the document  the state will begin training teachers on how to use the new standards Then  most likely in the next decade  policymakers will outline new priorities for Michigan schools  and they will ask educators and experts to rewrite the standards once again  The process of retelling the nation s history   deciding what gets left out and who is heard from   never ends  

TEL AVIV   As if facing indictment on bribery and other charges were not a big enough problem for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  along comes a rugged  retired army chief called Benny Gantz  an Israeli hero straight out of Central Casting  to challenge the  King of Israel   Gantz  in his gruff authenticity  gets under Netanyahu s skin  A mensch ousts manipulator dethronement in Israeli elections on Tuesday can no longer be ruled out It s still a long shot  however  Netanyahu  seeking a fifth term after a total of 13 years in power  is fighting not only to extend his rule but also to stay out of jail   He has to leverage political success into stopping the criminal process   Dan Meridor  a former minister of intelligence and deputy prime minister in a Netanyahu government  told me  This tends to focus the mind Netanyahu  who has the strong backing of President Trump  is at his shrewdest and most ruthless when backed into a corner  He has vowed to start annexing the West Bank  wherever an Israeli settler may be  in a last minute gambit  The support for him that popularized that regal  melekh yisrael  epithet is fanatical  despite the accusations from the attorney general that the prime minister traded official favors for gifts and for flattering news coverage   A blood libel   Netanyahu calls the charges  To the last  he will summon every specter of the  Arab loving left  in a bid to hang on  That he will stop at nothing is by now well known I wish I could say this election was about something   the Palestinian conflict  the bottoming out of the middle class  Iranian threats   other than Netanyahu  It s not  This gives it an almost ritualistic quality  Israelis have gotten used to going through the ballot box motions and then bowing to their  magician   The prime minister s instincts are as feral as Trump s  His hold on the Israeli imagination is tenacious  The question is whether this grip can be broken in a country where the start up economy is humming  the American Embassy is in Jerusalem  and military conflict has been contained  A lot of Israelis feel good  or good enough  about Netanyahu s nation Israel is a changed country  The land for peace left died  It broke as a political camp  the idea was orphaned  Separation supplanted peace as Israel s aspiration  Palestinians  for many Israelis  continue their eerie passage into abstraction  a process cynically encouraged by the Trump administration  A half century on  it seems the White House is circling back to Golda Meir s  There is no Palestinian people   The one politician who put the peace issue front and center  the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni  dropped out   from the campaign and from politics altogether  If you are left  you will lose   Polly Bronstein  who heads a movement to empower the political center  told me  Yes  it s that simple Enter Gantz  59  son of a Holocaust survivor  born and raised in an agricultural cooperative  paratrooper  chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces  with his candid blue eyed gaze  his less than perfect English   Let me up front you    Ladies and Gentlemens    his Sabra quintessence and his weary yet resolute air reminiscent of murdered Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin ImageBenny Gantz  leader of the Blue and White Party  speaking at a campaign event in Ashkelon  Israel  CreditCorinna Kern for The New York Times Strength and moral power come together   he told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  or Aipac  to vigorous applause in Washington last month   Moral  is not a word Netanyahu can utter with a straight face  Gantz  whose new Blue and White party borrows the colors of the Israeli flag  produced a black and white photograph of his mother  weighing 90 pounds  as she emerged from Bergen Belsen  It may be too much to ask of Israel  in its harsh neighborhood  to be a  light unto nations   But it must surely stand for something more ennobling than graft Blue and White is the latest in a series of parties   Kadima   Forward    Yair Lapid s Yesh Atid   There is a future   and Isaac Herzog s Zionist Union   that have tried over the past decade to create a centrist alternative to Netanyahu  Likud and the prime minister s increasingly rabid crew of rightists  ranging from the religious Messianic to the racist nationalist  They all failed Although fragmented  the half dozen right wing parties including Likud still appear to have a more plausible path to a Knesset majority than any potential Gantz coalition  But it s close and unpredictable  with many voters undecided and the question open of which small parties make the threshold for Knesset admission The forebears of Blue and White could not convince an Israel drifting right on the back of Russian immigration and Palestinian violence of the security and viability of a post Netanyahu Israel  Now three former generals   Gantz himself  Moshe Ya alon and Gabi Ashkenazi   are screaming security  security and security  Lapid  the fourth party leader  brings a touch of razzmatazz The presence of Ashkenazi  a Mizrahi Jew  is important because Jews of North African and Middle Eastern stock have always formed a Netanyahu stronghold  The prime minister has cleverly exploited their old resentments of the liberal left that dominated Israel in its early decades I said the election was about Netanyahu  In fact  because of the prime minister s attacks on democratic institutions and his legal troubles  it s about more than one man s fate  The vote is about the nature of Israeli democracy  perhaps its very existence  Gantz  in an interview this month with The Times of Israel  hammered on this point  saying  the trend is very  very  very dangerous  and that democracy  is at stake  Netanyahu  applying a by now familiar illiberal playbook  one whose elements he helped forge and that has seen such success from Budapest to Washington  has attacked a free press  He has set out to undermine an independent judiciary and embraced a form of nationalism that  like Trump s  sees enemies and traitors everywhere The country s basic law that was passed last year declared Israel the nation state of the Jewish people alone  despite the fact that Arab citizens make up a fifth of the population  When Netanyahu says  as he did this year  that Israel is  the nation state  not of all its citizens  but only of the Jewish people   he eviscerates the core idea of democratic citizenship  No longer is everyone equal before the law  What then are the others  second class shadows From there  it is but a short step to making that monarchical sobriquet perfectly fitting  Netanyahu is not only facing bribery charges  He has also admitted that  in an extraordinary arrogation of powers  he authorized the sale of advanced German made submarines to Egypt  without telling the National Security Council  without telling the head of Mossad or the defense minister  without telling the military chief of staff  He says he did tell the attorney general  The attorney general denies this  The reason   State secrets   says Netanyahu  Oh  please The prime minister has also acknowledged that he made some  3 million on investments in a company that supplied the German shipyard that built the Egyptian submarines and warships for Israel  Still  he insists he did not  make a shekel  on the submarines and that the stock was sold before the deals were made  The whole thing stinks   Itamar Rabinovich  a former Israeli ambassador to Washington  told me  Gantz s view  as expressed in The Times of Israel  was   If it walks like a duck  if it quacks like a duck  maybe it s a duck   He added   We are speaking about a corrupt man who is destroying the country  The danger is evident  a conflation of Netanyahu s legal and political battles that subverts the rule of law to save him  Already  his justice minister  Ayelet Shaked of the New Right party  has been lambasting the Supreme Court s powers  portraying it as the liberal elite s means to dilute the will of the people and accusing it of a  coup  against democracy Everyone here is talking about a  French law   This is what Israelis call the legislation that Netanyahu would try to pass  if he wins  that would grant the prime minister immunity from prosecution while in office  Get that done  eliminate the Supreme Court s power to rule such a move unconstitutional  maybe engineer an eventual passage from the prime minister s to the president s office  and he s home free  He really is king at last Of course  the rightist parties Netanyahu would try to woo into doing this would exact a price  like that promised annexation of part of the West Bank  the death knell for a two state peace   Trump s recognition of Israel s authority over the Golan Heights has encouraged the annexationists  and lawlessness in general   Next up  Area C  the 60 percent of the West Bank under exclusive Israeli control  It may not happen  but the drift under Netanyahu toward one state in all but name between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River  with millions of disenfranchised Palestinians  is relentless  The status quo is an illusion   Meridor told me   It moves  You end up in one state that contains people who don t vote  that is not Jewish in terms of numbers  and that is not democratic   In this sense  too  another Netanyahu victory would undermine Israeli democracy Between Israel and that fate stands Gantz  He s no dove on Palestine  but I believe he would at least attempt to engage in serious negotiation with the Palestinians  who do  after all  exist   so closing Netanyahu s decade long kick the can chapter  He s a political neophyte  but that Rabin air feels significant and he has identified something important  The word  moral  has to mean something for a country that gathered Jews bound during the millennial diaspora by a covenant of ethics and that rose from the ashes of the Nazi crematories  In  unity   an oft repeated word  Gantz has identified another important idea eroded for too long by the master of division who has increasingly split Israel into rival tribes When you ask Israelis about their election  they often draw an analogy with soccer   You play for 90 minutes   they say with a half amused  half bitter shrug   and then Germany wins   Except  of course  that Germany has been losing a lot of late  Perhaps that s a sign  It s time  Gantz can take it from here RelatedMore on the Israeli electionOpinion   Hagai El AdDemocracy  Israeli StyleApril 7  2019As Netanyahu Seeks Re election  the Future of

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  who emerged from this week s election poised to win a fourth consecutive term  may benefit from an effort by his right wing coalition to protect him from prosecution on possible corruption charges At least one right wing party expected to join his new governing coalition has been open about its goal of passing a law granting immunity to Israeli Parliament members  including prime ministers Mr  Netanyahu  who worked on Wednesday to consolidate support for a new coalition  is on track to become Israel s longest serving prime minister  but also the first to be charged with a crime while in office  If Netanyahu gains the public s trust in the coming elections   Bezalel Smotrich  leader of the Union of Right Wing Parties  wrote on Twitter last month   it will be imperative to enact a law that will prevent him standing trial  Mr  Smotrich said parliamentary immunity was necessary to honor the people s democratic choice and ensure smooth government  By Wednesday  his party was projected to win five seats in the 120 seat Knesset  or parliament An aide said on Wednesday that Mr  Smotrich was demanding the post of justice minister and another leader of his party wanted to be minister of education ImageBezalel Smotrich  center  the leader of the Union of Right Wing Parties  said it was  imperative  that legislation be enacted to prevent Mr  Netanyahu from standing trial CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesMany countries grant lawmakers immunity  Israel too used to have such a law Until 2005  Israeli lawmakers had immunity that could only be removed by a vote of Parliament  The law was changed in 2005 after Supreme Court petitions to lift immunity in several cases where Parliament had denied it Mr  Netanyahu could request immunity by an act of Parliament now without a new law  but legal experts said the Supreme Court would be likely to reverse the decision for fear of harming the public s trust in government institutions Two ultra Orthodox parties whose support Mr  Netanyahu will need to help him build a governing majority are unlikely to oppose legislation restoring automatic immunity for members of Parliament Two of their leaders  Yaakov Litzman  of United Torah Judaism  and Aryeh Deri  of Shas  have recently been under police investigation themselves  Moshe Gafni  a lawmaker from United Torah Judaism  said his party would wait and see how Mr  Netanyahu s cases proceeded Israel s attorney general said in February that he planned to indict Mr  Netanyahu on charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  Mr  Netanyahu  who denies any wrongdoing  is entitled to a hearing before an indictment is issued Mr  Netanyahu has said in the past that he would not promote a new immunity law  But when pressed in a television interview days before the election  he was more evasive  saying only that he was currently  not dealing  with the issue Some potential coalition partners have spoken out against an immunity law  saying they oppose any personalized and retroactive legislation designed to help Mr  Netanyahu  Some senior members of his own conservative Likud party have expressed similar sentiments ImageThe Jewish settlement outpost of Yishuv Hadaat in the West Bank  in 2016  Critics say Mr  Netanyahu may promise right wing parties that he would support the annexation of Jewish settlements in occupied territory in exchange for their support for an immunity law CreditUriel Sinai for The New York TimesYuli Edelstien  the No  2 in Likud and long time Parliament speaker  told reporters last week that Mr  Netanyahu  like everybody else  should be treated as innocent until proven guilty  Regarding immunity  Mr  Edelstein said   No one is seriously discussing this kind of legislation in the Israeli Knesset  But Mr  Netanyahu s critics suspect that he may promise right wing parties that he would support the annexation of some Jewish settlements in the West Bank in exchange for their support for an immunity law The liberal Haaretz newspaper said Wednesday that the two goals of the emerging government  could be summed up as  immunity in exchange for sovereignty   In a surprise announcement a few days before the election  Mr  Netanyahu pledged  to begin extending sovereignty into the occupied West Bank  a popular cause on the Israeli right and within his own party  He had resisted such a policy in the past  and much of the world would consider it a violation of international law Mr  Smotrich s aide  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be able to discuss internal party affairs  vehemently denied any linkage between immunity and sovereignty  He said Mr  Smotrich had never discussed the immunity law with Mr  Netanyahu  and needed no encouragement or payback to support either immunity or annexation Shortly before Mr  Netanyahu s unexpected announcement  Mr  Edelstein  the Likud official  said he had not heard of any proposal to impose sovereignty in the West Bank  though Likud favored it in principle Amir Fuchs  an expert in legislative processes at the Israel Democracy Institute  a nonpartisan research group in Jerusalem  said he found the talk of an immunity for sovereignty deal  embarrassing  and said it would  go against the rule of law  Legally  Mr  Netanyahu can stay in office until a final conviction  It would not be so surprising   Mr  Fuchs said   if he kept his job while on trial   

Facebook said on Monday that it would ban several far right groups and figures in Canada  including Faith Goldy  who ran for mayor of Toronto last year  as part of the company s widening crackdown on users who espouse white nationalism and other forms of hate The company  which owns Instagram  said the ban would also be applied to the Canadian Nationalist Front and its leader  Kevin Goudreau  the Aryan Strikeforce  the Wolves of Odin  and the Soldiers of Odin and one of its offshoots  the Canadian Infidels In a statement  Facebook said Ms  Goldy  Mr  Goudreau and the banned groups had violated its community standards  which include a prohibition on  organized hate   The individuals and organizations we have banned today violate this policy  and they will no longer be allowed a presence on our services   the company s statement said   Our work against organized hate is ongoing and we will continue to review individuals  pages  groups and content against our community standards  Attempts to reach Ms  Goldy  who has denied being a white supremacist  were unsuccessful on Monday  But she responded to the decision with a mixture of anger and pride on Twitter  I have committed no crime   she wrote on Twitter   My only fault has been loving my country and citing statistics  Later she posted a video of herself lounging in a hot tub overlooking a beach while she mocked Facebook  calling the company  so terrified and so weak that they are going out of their way to ban and to censor little old me who just quotes census data from my kitchen table  Monday s decision comes two weeks after Facebook strengthened its ban on white supremacist content by also prohibiting material billed as white nationalist and white separatist  It previously viewed those three categories as distinct  which drew criticism from civil rights groups Rights groups in Canada began calling for Facebook to bar Ms  Goldy  who had earlier been barred from Airbnb and the fund raising website Patreon  soon after the new policy on white nationalism was announced Evan Balgord  the executive director of the Canadian Anti Hate Network  called her  the most public face of the alt right neo Nazi movement in Canada  and said her removal was  a litmus test  for Facebook s new policy  Here in Canada  when we heard about the policy on white nationalists they were going to put in place  the first thing that came to mind was  If this is going to be meaningful to any extent  then the most obvious person they should remove from the platform is Goldy   Mr  Balgord said But Mr  Balgord said he was disappointed that Facebook had not taken action against other groups  including the Quebec based Atalante Qubec and Fdration des Qubcois de Souche  He said they posed a bigger threat to public safety than the groups banned on Monday  They have group members with criminals records  they are explicitly neo fascist  they march around in the streets  It is neo Nazi stuff   he said   Faith Goldy and these other groups are the tip of the iceberg  Ms  Goldy rose to prominence working for The Rebel Media  a far right Canadian outlet that fired her after she appeared on a podcast hosted by the neo Nazi website The Daily Stormer following the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville  Va  Ms  Goldy used social media to build a political brand based on disdain for multiculturalism  liberalism and nonwhite immigration  which she has described as a threat to the country s  European Canadian identity  She is a proponent of the white genocide conspiracy theory  which contends that liberal elites are plotting to replace white Christians with Jews and nonwhites Her pugilistic style won her some admirers in the United States  including the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and Representative Steve King of Iowa  who endorsed her in the Toronto mayoral race and approvingly described her on Twitter as  pro Western Civilization and a fighter for our values  But her flame throwing persona did not help her in the mayoral race  where she was largely shunned  A television station refused to air her campaign ads  she sued and was ordered to pay the station s legal fees after her lawsuit was dismissed   She was not invited to participate in a September debate  so she jumped onstage and was removed by the police In the end  she garnered just 3 4 percent of the vote in October  Mr  Balgord said she had alienated many on the Canadian far right during the campaign by making overtures toward members of the Jewish Defense League  She was courting their support because they are on the far right  but for a lot of people in the neo Nazi movement that is a line you can t cross   he said  

CHICAGO   There was little time for Lori Lightfoot to bask in her sweeping  historic victory in the mayoral election in Chicago last week By the weekend  she was facing one of Chicago s most intractable problems  when 31 people were shot  three fatally  If people don t feel safe  they re not going to stay   Ms  Lightfoot said on Monday of gun violence   If people don t feel safe  they re not going to have hope  If people don t feel safe  they re not going to invest  Six weeks before her inauguration  we sat down with Ms  Lightfoot for a wide ranging interview in her transition office along the Chicago River  She discussed her first post victory meeting with the outgoing mayor  Rahm Emanuel  how Chicago compares to  The Wire   and the city s fabled political machine  which she says isn t quite dead yet Here are highlights of her responses  edited for clarity Gun violence is her biggest challenge  Fundamentally  if people don t feel like their lives are valued and they don t value their lives  they re not going to value their neighbors  lives  So we have to disrupt that mentality and the only way that I know how to do it is to do it with investment  An open air drug market in Chicago was appalling  but not shocking  I met with some West Side elected officials and part of the conversation they re like  Yeah  there s an open air drug market at X location on Madison Street   And when you think about open air drug markets  you think some abandoned house  something shady  right out of  The Wire   right  But no  this is a strip mall where commerce is being conducted  But in order to get into that strip mall  you ve got to drive by the drug dealers who are standing out in the parking lot yelling  blow  and having big fistfuls of money in their hands and it s like somebody selling tamales  right  That s not acceptable  And what message does that send to our children who walk by there every single day  That s not tolerable to me  Some on the City Council might be plotting against her  She s ready  The machine was built to last  And no one in that kind of context gives up power easily or willingly  and I know that  But what I said before and I ll repeat here is  we won in all 50 wards  We won with an almost 50 point spread  I am not going to allow a relic of the past to undermine the mandate of the people  And I would like to have a good  productive relationship with members of the City Council  but I m not going to allow them to undermine what the people s choice was and what the people want  which is change  And you know  I haven t gotten to where I ve gotten in life by letting people walk all over me  And I m not about to start now  And I would  as I said  would like people to recognize and respect the vote  and if they re not willing to  I m ready to fight  Mr  Emanuel gave her a briefing book   and some advice for Ms  Lightfoot and her wife  Amy  He started it by talking about the importance of family and making sure that  you know  my Amy and I were doing everything we could to make sure that our daughter had a normal childhood and that he was interested in doing everything he could to share advice  both he and his wife  Amy  on how to make that happen and their experiences  Which I thought was very generous  But it was mostly business related  Being the first openly gay  African American woman to run Chicago is a sign of progress  The fact that I won all 50 wards in such a convincing fashion   against somebody who s been an elected official for decades as the head of the party  and who ran  I think unfortunately  a very race based campaign  particularly in the last couple of weeks   says to me that we are in a place in our city where we re going to reject hate  where we re not going to divide ourselves up by what our demographics are  But I do think there s a real desire to move beyond the categories and to be a city that says   We re Chicagoans   The national reputation of Chicago isn t very positive  She wants to change that  I think the reality on the ground needs to change  It s hard to brand when we are facing these challenges  The reputation nationally and to some extent globally unfortunately right now is that we re a violent city  And that s what people know  That s what gets reported  She didn t realize how big her win would be  We had some sense that victory was happening  But the magnitude of it   you never know  You never know  And when somebody invests a lot of energy in trying to destroy you personally  you never know  And I take nothing for granted  You know  I can t afford to take anything for granted  I mean  you probably know probably more than you care to know about my story  but coming where I come from  you have to always be on the lookout for the thing that might be coming that you don t expect  But now we re here  And having fun   

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to nominate Herman Cain  who abandoned his 2012 presidential bid in the face of escalating accusations of sexual misconduct  for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board Mr  Trump  speaking from the Oval Office  called Mr  Cain  the former chief executive of Godfather s Pizza   a truly outstanding individual  and said   I ve told my folks that s the man  The decision to consider Mr  Cain is the second time in weeks that the president has floated candidates with deeply held political views and past ethical issues to fill a seat on the Fed  signaling his intent to put allies on a traditionally independent body  It comes as Mr  Trump has continued to attack the Fed and his handpicked chairman  Jerome H  Powell  for raising interest rates in 2018  saying those moves slowed economic growth Last month  Mr  Trump said he planned to nominate Stephen Moore  a conservative economist who advised his presidential campaign and has become a vocal critic of the central bank s recent rate increases  as a Fed governor Mr  Trump has staked his presidency on a booming economy and his re election could hinge on whether it continues to surge or falter  The Fed  which has the ability to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates and using other tools at its disposal  will play a crucial role in the economy s trajectory While presidents have long stocked regulatory agencies with partisan appointees in pursuit of ideological goals  the Fed s seven member board of governors has largely been an exception given the role it plays in the United States economy  The Fed s primary job is to guide the economy  typically by adjusting interest rates  It aims for sustainable growth  maximum employment and stable prices  It also regulates banks and oversees the plumbing of the financial system Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short term growth at the expense of inflation and instability  Some modern presidents have opined openly about what the Fed should do  including President George Bush  who declared in a State of the Union address that the central bank should keep rates low But in recent decades  the volume of public commentary greatly diminished as politicians concluded that pressuring the Fed was counterproductive The president has largely abandoned that tradition  Last year  as interest rates rose and the stock market declined  Mr  Trump repeatedly attacked Fed policy as  crazy    wild  and  loco   He asked aides whether he could replace the chairman and lamented privately that Mr  Powell s appointment was one of his biggest regrets The Fed  which raised rates for five consecutive quarters amid a roaring economy with the lowest unemployment rate in nearly two decades  has since paused its campaign  Mr  Powell has repeatedly rebuffed any suggestion that the central bank is being influenced by Mr  Trump s broadsides  saying it is adopting a more  patient  approach to interest rates given signs of economic weakness in the United States and abroad With two open seats on the seven member Fed  Mr  Trump has the ability to drastically shape the central bank for the foreseeable future  The president has already appointed four of the Fed s current governors  who carry 14 year terms  One governor  Lael Brainard  is a holdover from the Obama administration The appointment and confirmation of Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain could put the Fed in uncharted territory  While the institution has strongly rooted values around technical competence and apolitical debate  Mr  Trump s latest choices have been political actors rather than in the weeds experts in any of the main areas in which the Fed makes policy Two governors alone cannot entirely shape Fed policy  but they can have an effect on decisions  The Federal Open Market Committee  which sets interest rates  consists of 12 voting members  including the seven governors  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents  who serve one year terms on a rotating basis  Changes to interest rates must be approved by a majority of the voting members Both Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain are undergoing background checks  and if nominated  must be confirmed by the Senate The choice of such candidates to fill two of the most powerful jobs in economic policy is raising fears among some Fed veterans that the president is installing political allies at the central bank to do his bidding  It s one thing to put cronies into the executive branch  but I think the central bank is another kind of institution that it s so critical in that it holds the reins solely to monetary policy   said Sarah Bloom Raskin  who served on the Fed s board of governors from 2010 to 2014   It has the potential to undermine the credibility of monetary policy  Mr  Cain s nomination is being supported by Larry Kudlow  who heads the National Economic Council and also recommended Mr  Moore for a Fed seat  according to a person familiar with the discussions While he heaped praise on his  friend  Mr  Cain  Mr  Trump earlier in the day continued his assault on the  destructive actions  taken by the Fed and said on Twitter that the economy was very strong despite the central bank s efforts The selection of Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain appeared to be a counterweight to Mr  Powell  But while Mr  Moore has been publicly critical of the Fed and called for Mr  Powell to resign  Mr  Cain s views are less clear As a presidential candidate  Mr  Cain rode a brief surge in popularity to the top of the polls on the back of his  9 9 9  economic plan  The proposal called for scrapping the existing tax code and replacing it with a flat 9 percent income tax  a 9 percent business tax and a 9 percent national retail sales tax  The concept was hailed by some for its simplicity  but it ultimately fizzled with his campaign On monetary policy  his views are equally unorthodox  In a 2012 op ed in The Wall Street Journal  Mr  Cain accused the central bank of manipulating the value of the dollar by raising and lowering interest rates by whim and called for a return to the gold standard  which was abandoned in 1971  For the last 40 years in Washington  regulate has meant manipulate  with the Federal Reserve raising and lowering interest rates and buying and selling assets at its own discretion   Mr  Cain wrote  arguing that a complex society needs fixed standards   A dollar should be defined   as it was prior to 1971 under the postwar Bretton Woods system   as a fixed quantity of gold  Mr  Cain is also a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  a role that is often given to local business leaders  In a 2011 interview with The Atlantic  Drue Jennings  who served with Mr  Cain on the board  said that Mr  Cain was an  inflation hawk  when it came to monetary policy  a moniker attributed to those who view rising prices as a threat to economic growth and favor higher interest rates to keep inflation in check Mr  Trump has made clear he has no interest in a Fed governor who wants to raise rates but  more recently  Mr  Cain has shown that he has evolved on the subject  If I were offered the job  I would try to encourage the Fed not to make inflation a fear factor because deflation  as Stephen Moore had pointed out in a great article that he wrote along with another economist  deflation is more of a fear factor than inflation   Mr  Cain said in a February interview with the Fox Business Network Perhaps most important to Mr  Trump  Mr  Cain has shown that he is loyal to the president  In September  Mr  Cain formed the America Fighting Back PAC  which has a mission of publicly rebutting what he believes is misinformation about Mr  Trump  We re offering a compelling  solid refutation to what you hear from the media and the rest of the left about President Trump and conservative ideas   Mr  Cain said at the time It is unclear whether Mr  Cain will clear the background check  His presidential campaign came to a screeching halt after several women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment or improper behavior The selection of Mr  Cain drew backlash on Thursday from some of those women Ginger White  who publicly said in 2011 that she and Mr  Cain had had an affair  said that he should not be rewarded for such actions  Ms  White said that the affair was on and off for 13 years and that Mr  Cain denied it because he was seeking the Republican nomination for president  We need honesty and integrity in those who are appointed to public office   Ms  White said in a statement released by her lawyer  Gloria Allred   Herman Cain should not be rewarded for his bad behavior  In my opinion  he lacks what should be required for appointment to the Federal Reserve or any public office  Sharon Bialek  who is also represented by Ms  Allred  came forward in 2011 and accused Mr  Cain of grabbing her in a sexually aggressive way when she sought his help after losing her job at the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s  Ms  Bialek said in a statement on Thursday evening that Mr  Cain sexually harassed her and that he was not fit for public service  I did not think that he was a man of character then  and I do not think he is now   Ms  Bialek said   Anyone who uses their position of power to take advantage of a woman does not possess the character  integrity or values required to serve on the Federal Reserve Board  In some ways  Mr  Cain  who preferred news interviews to intensive retail campaigning  presaged Mr  Trump s own outsider campaign four years later  But unlike the president s presidential bid  Mr  Cain s was fatally wounded when he faced charges of sexual misconduct In October 2011  Politico reported that Mr  Cain  as head of the National Restaurant Association  had been accused of sexually harassing two women  who left the trade group after receiving financial payouts and signing nondisclosure agreements  One of the women  who was from Chicago  said that Mr  Cain made an unwanted and rough physical advance Confronted with the claims  Mr  Cain initially did not deny them  He later proclaimed his innocence and sought to cast blame on political rivals and the news media for what he called a smear campaign Other women emerged soon after to say that they  too  had been sexually harassed by Mr  Cain  By that December  he dropped out of the presidential race

ISTANBUL   President Tayyip Erdogan s losses in local elections have dented investors  hopes that Turkey will adopt painful reforms they say are needed to stabilize the economy as he moves to shore up his political base Erdogan s Islamist rooted AK Party  AKP   in power nationally since 2002  lost control of the capital Ankara and the business hub Istanbul in the March 31 polls  initial results showed  The AKP has demanded recounts in both cities Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak  who is Erdogan s son in law  is expected this week to announce to jittery foreign investors the structural reforms he hopes will revive an economy plagued by high inflation and a fragile currency  State owned Anadolu news agency said the announcement would be on Wednesday After a currency crisis last year that saw the lira lose nearly 30 percent of its value  economists say Turkey needs to make long term commitments to increase exports  relieve debt laden companies and free up the central bank to do its job Erdogan  who campaigned hard ahead of the vote  said on election night the AKP would now refocus on the economy But many analysts are skeptical about the chances for a comprehensive reform plan  especially after the elections  and fear the AKP will opt instead for short term stimulus measures that fail to tackle  and may even exacerbate  deeper weaknesses  The AKP base want more pro growth measures  they want more fiscal measures  they want lower inflation  It is exactly what they  the AKP  did before the elections and it will have to continue if  Erdogan  wants to remain popular   said Guillaume Tresca  senior emerging markets strategist at Credit Agricole   I would not expect concrete reforms  it will be just words  BOOM AND BUSTAt the heart of Turkey s economic malaise is years of cheap foreign funding that drove a construction driven boom  Once the lira collapsed  firms could not pay off debts and that exposed their lenders and employees to default and bankruptcy As the economy tipped into recession last year  the lira stabilized and inflation dipped a bit from a 15 year high of 25 percent  offering some relief But a series of ad hoc measures have stoked investors  concerns that Turkey is not fully committed to letting its currency float freely or to allowing the central bank to keep interest rates high   at 24 percent since September   for as long as needed to bring inflation down from 20 percent  To help hard pressed Turks this year  the government launched discount fruit and vegetable stands and extended tax cuts on some goods  To tackle a lira meltdown last month  it ordered banks to choke off lira funding to a London foreign exchange market and tapped into central bank reserves   It looks like the Erdogan instinct is to survive   said Nihat Bulent Gultekin  a former Turkish central bank governor and now a professor at the University of Pennsylvania  I don t think they have any long term objectives  It would require a constant focus on the economy for an extended period of time  HARD TO SWALLOWAlbayrak has given few details of the coming reforms  saying only that they would address a wide range of issues The lira has settled down in recent days after its pre election volatility and analysts say Albayrak s reforms will help determine whether volatility returns   The market expects concrete measures to address economic imbalances accompanied by a specific timetable   said Piotr Matys  emerging markets forex strategist at Rabobank Moody s said  the credibility and effectiveness  of reforms will be key to Turkey s credit profile  which the ratings agency downgraded in August   There is a risk that the government will embark on even more expensive stimulus programs as it begins to recognize the extent of the economic downturn   it said  Investors and economists say Ankara needs a plan to recapitalize banks dealing with corporate restructuring and non performing loans  which could more than double this year  It should also boost competitive export sectors such as auto and textile manufacturing in order to lower its annual current account deficit  which leaves the economy reliant on speculative foreign inflows  they say  We need to provide the right training and the right subsidies to the right sectors   Selva Demiralp  professor at Istanbul s Koc University  The reforms would take time and  there will be a price to pay because when the production structure is changing some people will be unemployed   she said That may be hard to swallow for Erdogan and Turks in general who would not welcome a recession that lasts beyond the second half of 2019  when economists currently expect a return to growth  Unemployment has already risen above 13 percent  Although an unlikely option for Erdogan  who has repeatedly said Turkey does not need the International Monetary Fund  Matys of Rabobank said the reforms should ideally be overseen by the IMF to restore investor confidence   A PowerPoint presentation  by Albayrak  with slides claiming that the economy is rebalancing quickly and a few bullet points may not prove sufficient to restore confidence among investors   he said

WASHINGTON   Federal Reserve officials were worried about slowing economic growth abroad and the fading effects of President Trump s tax cuts when they decided in March to pause interest rate increases and cut economic growth forecasts for 2019  according to minutes from the meeting released on Wednesday The minutes showed that members of the Federal Open Market Committee judged consumer spending and business investment to be slowing in the first quarter of the year  and that they  generally expected the growth rate of real G D P  this year to step down from the pace seen over 2018   which was 3 percent Some Fed officials raised concerns that complications with Britain s withdrawal from the European Union or the Trump administration s trade talks with China could further hurt growth this year  and  a few  worried that high levels of debt corporations have taken on during the expansion could exacerbate a downturn in the United States  Officials showed little concern over the possibility that inflation could surge this year  A number of participants judged that economic growth in the remaining quarters of 2019 and in the subsequent couple of years would likely be a little lower  on balance  than they had previously forecast   the minutes said   Reasons cited for these downward revisions included disappointing news on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy than had previously been anticipated  After raising interest rates four times in 2018  Fed officials left them unchanged in March  citing subdued inflation and increased challenges to global growth  They surprised financial markets by releasing projections showing that the typical Fed official does not expect any changes to interest rates this year  down from the two increases that the Fed said it expected in December  And they announced a faster than expected end to the winnowing of the Fed s giant portfolio of bonds  which it accumulated in an effort to stoke economic growth after the financial crisis The Fed also reduced its 2019 growth forecast to 2 1 percent   a full percentage point less than what the Trump administration predicts for the year Those revisions  along with muted inflation pressures  prompted most Fed officials to concur that interest rates would likely stay unchanged in 2019   A majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year   the minutes said In a news conference after the meeting  the Fed chairman  Jerome H  Powell  called the domestic economy  strong  but said the Fed would be patient   and attentive to economic data   before deciding its next move on interest rates  Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected   he said Taking questions from reporters  Mr  Powell did not rule out the Fed s next move being a rate cut  as many investors now expect   The data that we re seeing are not currently sending a signal which suggests moving in either direction for me   he said   which is really why we re being patient  Mr  Powell is under intense pressure from Mr  Trump to keep interest rates low and take new measures to stimulate growth  On Friday  Mr  Trump called for the Fed to cut rates and to resume its bond buying program to goose the economy  The president has previously criticized Mr  Powell for the Fed s rate hikes  which he said slowed economic growth  and has expressed frustration with his Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin  who recommended the Fed chair to Mr  Trump At an event held at the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday  Mr  Mnuchin defended Mr  Powell and praised him for making interest decisions based on economic data  I do trust Chairman Powell to get it right   Mr  Mnuchin said during a moderated discussion   I see no reason why his job isn t safe  He also weighed in for the first time on Mr  Trump s plans to nominate Herman Cain  a former businessman and Republican presidential candidate  to the Fed  along with one of his economic advisers  Stephen Moore Mr  Mnuchin said that while he disagrees with Mr  Cain s call for a return to the Gold Standard  he believes that both Mr  Cain and Mr  Moore would be good members of the board  And he dismissed criticism that the president was trying to interfere with the Fed s independence by choosing political allies for the seven member Fed board  It is the president s job to nominate people to the Fed   Mr  Mnuchin said   People talk about this like there s some political aspect  It s the president s job  like anything else  to send these nominations to the senate  Republican senators expressed concerns this week about Mr  Cain  whose White House run was derailed by multiple allegations of sexual harassment from several women  Asked on Wednesday if Mr  Cain s nomination was safe  Mr  Trump offered only a limited vote of confidence  I like Herman Cain  and Herman will make that determination   he said   He s just somebody I like a lot  As to how he s doing in the process  that I don t know  Herman s a great guy and I hope he does well   

With the election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a fourth consecutive term  Israel reached a fateful moment  Mr  Netanyahu has set a course that could end Palestinian chances for statehood  threaten Israel s democratic character and deepen the alienation between its right wing coalition government and a majority of American Jews  Mr  Netanyahu can still choose to try to repair the damage from an ugly campaign  During an election night celebration  he promised to be  the prime minister of all the citizens of Israel   We hope he will  although he has not governed that way up to now and has formed alliances with extreme right wing parties Benny Gantz  a centrist former military chief and Mr  Netanyahu s main rival  conceded defeat on Wednesday  paving the way for Mr  Netanyahu to become Israel s longest serving leader Still  forming a government is expected to take weeks of horse trading  In theory  a broad coalition based on Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and Mr  Gantz s Blue and White Party  formed only a few weeks ago with two other military chiefs  could be the best option  forcing Mr  Netanyahu to compromise on his extreme policies  But analysts say it s far more likely he will stitch together a coalition that depends on ultra Orthodox and ultranationalist parties  driving the government further to the right and worsening the country s political divide  One question hanging over Mr  Netanyahu s victory is his likely indictment on corruption charges involving donors and friendly media outlets  The scandal could cut short his tenure  On Mr  Netanyahu s watch  Israel has evolved into an economically vibrant  technologically innovative country that has improved ties to leading Arab states  even if the only peace agreements are still with Egypt and Jordan  and expanded a number of international relationships  including with Russia  China and India Israel also is strong enough  either by itself or with the United States  to defeat any enemy  Yet its people remain fearful  especially of Iran   And some Israelis are even fearful of their fellow citizens who are Arabs  Mr  Netanyahu successfully exploited these fears to his political advantage He has accelerated construction of thousands of new housing units for settlers in the West Bank and removed Arabs from their homes in East Jerusalem  steadily shrinking the land available for a Palestinian state In a desperate bid to secure re election  Mr  Netanyahu publicly aligned with a tiny party  Otzma Yehudit  or Jewish Power  led by followers of the extreme nationalist Meir Kahane  the Brooklyn born rabbi whose Kach party was outlawed in Israel in the 1980s and placed on the American list of terrorist groups in 1997  Otzma Yehudit advocates annexing the occupied territories  expelling  enemies    widely understood to mean Arabs   and seizing the Temple Mount  a move tantamount to declaring war on Islam  Once Mr  Netanyahu crossed this line  perhaps it should not have been surprising that days before the voting he went even further and said he would begin effectively annexing parts of the West Bank that are expected to be incorporated in any Palestinian state Standing behind him in all this has been Donald Trump  who inserted himself on behalf of an Israeli leader in ways no previous American president has  Mr  Trump moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv  recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  closed the consulate in East Jerusalem that is the link with the Palestinians  and sharply reduced humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians in an apparent attempt to force them to abandon their dreams of an independent state At a congressional hearing on Tuesday  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did what was once unthinkable   he refused to publicly recommit the United States to a two state solution and to say whether it opposes unilateral annexation of the West Bank In the process  the United States and Israel have upended decades of American policy  United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreements like the 1993 Oslo Accords  which said the borders of Israel and Palestine  the future of Jerusalem  security arrangements and the fate of Palestinian refugees would be negotiated by the two parties Under Mr  Netanyahu  Israel is on a trajectory to become what critics say will be an apartheid state like the former South Africa   a country in which Palestinians will eventually be a majority  but without the rights of citizens  That s not good for Israel  nor for the United States Ami Ayalon  a former head of Shin Bet  Israel s internal security service  says his country refuses to confront a basic dilemma about what it wants to be in 40 years  He told The Times that the war most Israelis think they are fighting   over the recognition  sovereignty and security of their state   was actually won decades ago  The war now being fought is over expanding Israel s eastern border by building more settlements and demanding a Palestinian state alongside Israel  We are doing everything in order to create a virtual reality in which Palestinians cannot exist   Mr  Ayalon said   It is not a just war   he added   It will be a catastrophe if we should win  It is the end of our Zionist dream  More commentary on Israel in The TimesOpinion   Thomas L  FriedmanBibi Trump and Donald NetanyahuApril 10  2019Opinion

WASHINGTON   Members of Congress from both parties expressed immense frustration on Wednesday at big increases in insulin prices and vowed to work together on legislation to prevent more people from dying because they could not afford the lifesaving medicine Representative Earl L  Carter  Republican of Georgia  said at the end of a three hour hearing with pharmaceutical executives and middlemen  known as pharmacy benefit managers   You ve done something here today that we ve been trying to do in Congress for years  and that is to create bipartisanship   This is going to end   Mr  Carter  known as Buddy  said of the convoluted arrangements that drive up list prices of insulin and the out of pocket costs for many people with diabetes The hearing was one of several indications that Congress was serious about trying to address the cries of distress from constituents unable to afford the medicines they need Mr  Carter s comments echoed statements by Representative Jan Schakowsky  Democrat of Illinois  who said that  on both sides of the aisle  there is a commitment  to end price gouging by insulin manufacturers Insulin manufacturers said that prices were going up  in part  because they had made many improvements in insulin products  leading to better treatment and longer lives for people with diabetes But Representative David B  McKinley  Republican of West Virginia  said he was baffled  Innovation is supposed to drive the prices down  not up   Mr  McKinley said Congress heard from the three main producers of insulin   Eli Lilly and Company  Novo Nordisk and Sanofi   and from three middlemen that manage drug benefits for most Americans  CVS Health  Express Scripts  which was acquired last year by Cigna  and OptumRx  which is part of UnitedHealth Group  the nation s largest health insurance company The drug makers said they could not reduce list prices because it was not feasible to do so in  the system  as it now exists  In that system  they said  the middlemen and insurance companies demand discounts  rebates and other price concessions that are calculated as a percentage of the list price  And they provide the concessions to guarantee that their drugs will be covered But  they said  many consumers  including people with high deductible health insurance plans and people who are uninsured  do not receive the benefit of those discounts The drug makers said that the net price they received for insulin   after discounts and rebates   was declining  even as the list prices were rising  For example   said Kathleen W  Tregoning  an executive vice president of Sanofi   the average net price of Lantus  our most prescribed insulin  has declined by over 30 percent since 2012  while the average out of pocket burden for patients with commercial insurance and Medicare has increased by approximately 60 percent over the same period  Michael B  Mason  a senior vice president of Lilly  said the company could not reduce the list prices of its insulin products ImageEli Lilly and Company is one of the three main producers of insulin  Michael B  Mason  a senior vice president at the company  said reducing the list prices of its insulin products would be  too disruptive  CreditDarron Cummings Associated Press No pharmaceutical manufacturer has lowered list price for a significant medication because it is too disruptive to the system and thus to people who rely on that medication   he said in his written testimony Under questioning by members of Congress  Mr  Mason said   The current system is not working  We agree 100 percent  Representative Diana DeGette  Democrat of Colorado  who presided over the hearing as the chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  said   The people who are suffering are the people who need insulin every second of every minute of every day or they will die  Ms  DeGette  who has a 25 year old daughter with diabetes and is a leader of the Congressional Caucus on Diabetes  said she saw a high likelihood of bipartisan agreement on legislation to address the problem  Lawmakers will work with drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers  she said Although she represents a liberal Denver district  Ms  DeGette has a history of working with Republicans on health legislation like the 21st Century Cures Act  adopted in 2016 to speed the discovery of cures for killer diseases The chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee  Representative Frank Pallone Jr   Democrat of New Jersey  told the witnesses that he believed in a competitive market built on private enterprise  but that many of his constituents were losing faith in it  My constituents are disgusted   Mr  Pallone said  adding   What they tell me is   Just set the price  You the Congress or some government agency should set the price  and that s it   The drug companies generally endorsed a proposal by President Trump to outlaw payment of rebates unless they are passed on to consumers  The pharmacy benefit managers said premiums would go up if they no longer received rebate payments On Tuesday  the House Ways and Means Committee voted unanimously to approve a bill that requires drug manufacturers to publicly justify large price increases for existing drugs and high prices for new products  Drug companies would  for example  have to report what they spent on research and development of such drugs  as well as the costs of manufacturing  marketing and advertising them Also on Tuesday  the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to investigate the business practices of pharmacy benefit managers  The current system is so opaque that it s easy to see why there are many questions about P B M s  motives and practices   said Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the committee  referring to the managers Senator Sheldon Whitehouse  Democrat of Rhode Island  said that drug manufacturers had performed a remarkable act of  political jujitsu   shifting the blame for high drug prices to the middlemen But Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee  said the middlemen had  raked in profits while drug prices have shot into the stratosphere   Whether pharmacy benefit managers bring any real value to taxpayers is a mystery   Mr  Wyden said  

WELLINGTON  New Zealand   Less than a month after 50 Muslim worshipers in the city of Christchurch were fatally shot in terrorist attacks on two mosques  New Zealand passed a law banning most semiautomatic weapons on Wednesday   a measure supported by all but one of Parliament s 120 lawmakers The passage of the bill means temporary restrictions imposed by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern six days after the massacre  to prevent New Zealanders from stockpiling guns before the law went into effect  will now be permanent  The swift action by lawmakers stands in stark contrast to similar efforts in the United States  where nationwide gun control proposals have stalled despite a series of mass shootings in recent years  New Zealand stands apart in its widespread availability of weapons of such destructive nature and force   Ms  Ardern told Parliament on Wednesday   Today that anomaly ends  How to Buy a Gun in 16 CountriesMany Americans can buy a gun in less than an hour  In New Zealand  the process can take weeks or months She said she could not have faced the surviving victims of the Christchurch attack  hand on heart  and told them  our system and our laws allow these guns to be available and that is O K  It is not  The law outlaws military style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles  and violators face five years in prison  Some semiautomatic guns will still be allowed  including  22 caliber rifles with magazines holding fewer than 10 rounds  and shotguns with internal magazines that hold no more than five rounds  All of the weapons used by the Christchurch gunman will be banned  as well as parts and magazines that can convert lower powered guns to higher powered versions In her speech  Ms  Ardern  who leads the center left Labour Party  choked up when she talked about visiting surviving victims at Christchurch Hospital  In addition to those killed  50 people were injured in the attack  None of them had one gunshot wound  In every case they spoke of multiple injuries   Ms  Ardern said   They will carry disabilities for a lifetime  and that s before you even consider the psychological impact  ImageFirearms and accessories at a gun shop in Christchurch CreditJorge Silva ReutersSimilar laws had been recommended to New Zealand s Parliament several times before  but each time they had failed to gain support from lawmakers   including after the mass shooting that had previously been New Zealand s largest  in which a gunman killed 13 people in 1990 This time  the bill quickly sailed through Parliament  Usually in New Zealand  new laws can take around six months to pass after they are introduced  More than 13 000 people submitted opinions to the government   60 percent in support of the ban   and some were invited to speak to lawmakers in a single day of public hearings But while sports shooters and farmers were among those who pleaded for exemptions to the restrictions  lawmakers allowed just two  for commercial pest control businesses and for licensed collectors of guns  or those who want to keep particular guns as heirlooms or mementos  Collectors will be required to remove a part  making the weapons nonoperational  and store that part at a different location Ms  Ardern s center right opponents used their speeches on Wednesday to praise her leadership since the March 15 attacks and voice their support for the changes  Just one  David Seymour  the leader of the libertarian ACT Party  voted against the law ImageAn advertisement for a gun shop in Christchurch CreditAdam Dean for The New York TimesMr  Seymour said he was not opposed to more restrictive gun laws but believed that Parliament had rushed the process   It is not an attempt to improve public safety  it is an exercise in political theater   said Mr  Seymour  who argued that there was a risk of a growing black market in banned weapons Ms  Ardern had dismissed concerns that Parliament was moving too fast   My question here is simple  You either believe that in New Zealand these weapons have a place or you do not  And if you do not  you should be able to agree that we can move swiftly   she said   My view is that an argument about process is an argument to do nothing  Many commentators welcomed the new measures but said work remained to be done to ensure that gun regulations were properly enforced  The government said more measures  including a requirement to register individual firearms  would be in place by the end of the year  We really need to have a system where we understand where all the firearms in New Zealand are   said Chris Cahill  president of the Police Association  a national union for police officers  He added that gun owners should be forced to justify wanting to own large numbers of guns  something he said

NEW YORK   Donald Trump isn t on the ballot for Israel s national election  yet he s a dominant factor for many American Jews as they assess the high stakes of Tuesday s balloting At its core  the election is a judgment on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  who has won the post four times but now faces corruption charges  In his battle for political survival  Netanyahu has aligned closely with Trump   a troubling tactic for the roughly 75  of American Jewish voters who lean Democratic  The world has come to understand that Netanyahu is essentially the political twin of Donald Trump   said Jeremy Ben Ami  president of the liberal pro Israel group J Street   Unlike his previous elections  there is a much deeper antagonism toward Netanyahu because of that close affiliation between him and Trump and the Republican Party  Netanyahu featured Trump in a recent campaign video  while Trump has made a series of policy moves viewed as strengthening Netanyahu in the eyes of Israeli voters  including relocating the U S  Embassy to Jerusalem  withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and officially recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory  It s troubling   said Halie Soifer  executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America   The U S  Israel relationship should not be about any two leaders or any two parties  The American Jewish community wants the relationship to remain on a bipartisan basis  Though it leans Democratic overall  the American Jewish community   numbering 5 5 million to 6 million   is not monolithic  Most older Jews remain supportive of Israel s current Middle East policies  as does the roughly 10  of the Jewish population that is Orthodox  Jewish billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has been a staunch financial supporter of Trump and the GOP Divisions among U S  Jews have been exacerbated by recent allegations of anti Semitism directed at the Democrats  two Muslim American congresswomen   Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib  Seizing on the controversy  Trump tweeted his support for a purported  Jexodus  movement that would encourage Jews to leave the Democratic Party  Republicans are waiting with open arms   Trump tweeted on March 15 Morton Klein  president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America  predicts such an exodus will take place because of the Democrats  decision to avoid explicit condemnation of the congresswomen Ben Ami scoffed at the notion  suggesting that Jexodus was a fantasy of pro Trump operatives  I ve yet to meet an actual Obama Clinton voter who s said publicly they re switching to vote for Donald Trump   he said   This is not real  It s completely made up  New York based journalist Jane Eisner  former editor of The Forward  a Jewish newspaper  said many American Jews have  Netanyahu fatigue    even some who supported him in past Among liberal Jews  Eisner said  there are strong worries that Netanyahu will push Israel s government even further to the right if he wins  perhaps moving to annex some land in the occupied West Bank with confidence that the Trump administration will not object Morton Klein conceded that some Jews have grown weary of Netanyahu  but predicted he would prevail  People would be nervous if he s not there   Klein said Jack Rosen  president of the American Jewish Congress  said any surge in Netanyahu fatigue should not be interpreted as a weakening of American Jews  support for Israeli  There is a sense of fatigue having one leader for 10 years   Rosen said   Just as we ve had Clinton fatigue and Bush fatigue  Among liberal and centrist American Jews  dismay with Netanyahu extends beyond his alliance with Trump  Some say he s been too harsh in his treatment of migrants  and they bemoan his backtracking on a promise to allow mixed gender prayer at the Western Wall  Perhaps most disturbing has been Netanyahu s alliance with an ultranationalist political party linked to a movement previously banned for anti Arab racism and incitement That political alliance was assailed as  repugnant  by Eric Yoffie  a rabbi from Westfield  New Jersey  in a March 27 op ed in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz  Yoffie also decried Netanyahu s  excessive enthusiasm  for Trump  Cordial relations are essential   wrote Yoffie  president emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism   But the sycophantic buddy movie that Bibi has produced with America s unbalanced and unpredictable president is something else altogether     Bibi s egregious and unnecessary embrace of everything Trump will cost Israel dearly  In Israel  a prevalent view  at least in pro Netanyahu ranks  is that the prime minister s friendship with Trump is paying unprecedented dividends  There is widespread sentiment that liberal American Jews  as a constituency  are dissipating due to intermarriage  and that the evangelical Christian community in the U S  is a more dependable ally for Israel At last year s ceremony in Jerusalem celebrating the relocation of the U S  Embassy from Tel Aviv  evangelical Christian pastors allied with Trump delivered the opening and closing blessings Netanyahu s main challenger in the election is Benny Gantz  a former military chief popular in Israel but with a relatively low profile in the United States  American Jews who dislike Netanyahu view Gantz as preferable  due in part to a less combative personality  but liberals note with frustration that the platform of Gantz s Blue and White party makes no mention of Palestinian statehood  and says that Israel will maintain control of parts of the West Bank Emily Mayer of IfNotNow  a group of youthful American Jewish activists opposed to Israel s treatment of Palestinians  is dismayed at how that issue has been marginalized in the Israeli election campaign  Regardless of the winner  the utter erasure of Palestinian humanity from this election cycle and the normalization of an undemocratic and immoral military occupation should alarm any Jew who cares about freedom and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians   Mayer said in an email    Associated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report  

JERUSALEM   Struggling to rally right wing voters before Tuesday s elections  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he would start to extend Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if given a fourth consecutive term Such a move has been ardently sought by the settler movement but resisted until now by Mr  Netanyahu  and by more moderate Israelis  as a potentially fatal blow to a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  In the eyes of most of the world  it would also be a violation of international law that bars the annexation of land seized in war But Mr  Netanyahu trailed his main challenger  Benny Gantz  a former army chief of staff  in final polls of the campaign published Friday  And he has been frantically trying to mobilize conservative Israelis to vote for his Likud party rather than for other  more extremist parties whose leaders have joined his government but have often portrayed him as more of a brake on the settler movement than an accelerator Mr  Netanyahu was pressed in a live television interview Saturday night over why he had not already annexed settlement blocs like Maale Adumim and Gush Etzion  two large Jewish communities built on occupied territory on the outskirts of Jerusalem  He vowed to begin the effective annexation of those and other  more isolated areas under Jewish control  The question you re asking is an interesting one  Will we move on now to the next stage   he said   And the answer is  yes  We will move on to the next stage  Asked by his interviewer if that meant he would annex the settlement blocs  Mr  Netanyahu said yes  but that he would not stop there  I m going to apply sovereignty  but I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlement points  because from my perspective every such point of settlement is Israeli   he said   We have a responsibility as the Israeli government  I won t uproot anyone and I won t place them under Palestinian sovereignty  I ll look out for everyone  The West Bank is home to about 2 8 million Palestinians and more than 400 000 Jewish settlers Mr  Netanyahu did not say whether he would seek to annex areas now under Palestinian control under the Oslo Accords Applying sovereignty to Israeli settlements on West Bank land that the Palestinians demand for a future state  presumably along with the roads and infrastructure tethering those places to the rest of Israel  would leave the Palestinians at best with an archipelago of disconnected territory  The West Bank is now under Israeli military jurisdiction  though settlers are subject to civilian law  as Israeli citizens ImageA Palestinian family tending their vineyard in the West Bank with the the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the background  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he will begin extending Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if re elected CreditTomas Munita for The New York TimesThe chief negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization  Saeb Erekat  responded to Mr  Netanyahu s statements by attacking both him and the Trump administration  The White House has long promised a proposal for a  deal of the century  to end the Israeli Palestinian conflict But in the meantime  it has showered Mr  Netanyahu with priceless political gifts   from last year s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital to last month s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights   while battering the Palestinians with aid cuts and public scoldings  Such a statement by Netanyahu is not surprising   Mr  Erekat said on Twitter   Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity  particularly with the Trump administration s support and endorsement of Israel s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine  He added   We ll continue to pursue our rights through international forums  including the international criminal court  until we achieve our long overdue justice  Shalom Lipner  a former aide to Mr  Netanyahu and several other prime ministers  said Mr  Netanyahu might well believe the Trump administration could allow him to proceed with annexation  But he called the promise  the ultimate Hail Mary pass   and one that came with little political risk  The only reason it s even credible now is because of what he s been able to coordinate with Trump   said Mr  Lipner  an analyst at the Atlantic Council   Maybe he can actually get Trump to sign off on that as well  But if it became clear it s not in the cards right now  then he can just say   Sorry  I can t swing it  Conditions change    Read our guide on Israel s elections  In the television interview  Mr  Netanyahu vowed not to divide Jerusalem or  uproot any settlement   and said he would  ensure that we will control the territory west of the Jordan River   meaning the entire West Bank When asked if he would push through before Tuesday the much delayed evacuation of Palestinians living in Khan al Ahmar  a Bedouin village near the Maale Adumim settlement bloc  he reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state on the West Bank  I don t know whether it will be before the elections   he said of the Khan al Ahmar expulsion  which set off intense international criticism after being marked for demolition to make way for an expanded Jewish settlement But  he added   We have to control our destiny  and that is going to be impossible if we place there an independent  Arab entity   an Arab state  for all intents and purposes  A Palestinian state  That will endanger our existence   

There s a theory of human psychology that holds that the time you enter maturity becomes fixed in your mind as a civilizational peak   with everything since a falling off that conveniently matches your own stagger toward the grave  Thus it doesn t matter if you came of age in the Great Depression or some other nadir  because you were 18 then  it must have been a golden age Some of us are lucky  though  Our solipsism actually matches the wave function of history  and the moment we entered adulthood really was a peak  That s the case for my cohort  for Americans born around 1980  Whether you choose to call us  Xennials  or  Generation Catalano   after the heartthrob on  My So Called Life   our first teen show   the important thing is that we became legal adults at the end of the 1990s  and bliss it was in that time to be alive Not that we knew it then  of course  because no punk 18 year old knows anything  But I ve been thinking about how good we had it lately because we re 20 years out from 1999  and the cultural press is thick with reminders that it was a pop culture annus mirabilis    from the premiere of  The Sopranos  that defined a golden age of television  to the yearlong cascade of brilliant movies  The Ringer recently wrote up a top 50 films list for  99  in 2019 it was a struggle to write up a top 10  from a Hollywood not yet captive to the superhero era Widen the aperture a little  so that the  Xennial  cultural era covers 1995 to 2005  and you get everything from the perfection of the sitcom  late  Seinfeld   season one of  Friends   the silver age of  The Simpsons    Arrested Development   to the peak of HBO  when  The Wire  and  The Sopranos  and  Deadwood  and  Sex and the City  were all airing   Oh  and those were also the days when George R R  Martin could publish three  Game of Thrones  novels in five years  inventing all the good parts of the TV show s plot in an end of millennium rush De gustibus non est disputandum  and if you prefer a zillion algorithmically generated Netflix shows and endless Marvel sequels to  The Matrix  and  The Sopranos   then God bless you  But cold hard economic data also suggest that ours was a uniquely blessed coming of age  a time of low unemployment  surging productivity  strong working class wage growth   and all without a huge overhang of public and private debt In March  a Time magazine writer  Charlotte Alter  attracted some conservative sneers on Twitter for explaining the youthful vogue for socialism by arguing that Alexandria Ocasio Cortez s generation had a coming of age  defined by financial crisis  debt   climate change   No wonder she and her peers are moving left  The sneerers argued that the Ocasio Cortezans exaggerate the burdens borne by twentysomethings  which is fair   this is still a rich country whose young people are relatively privileged But as a statement about generational experiences  Alter was basically right  If you were born around 1980  you grew up in a space happily between   between eras of existential threat  Cold War War on Terror  or Cold War climate change   between foreign policy debacles  Vietnam Iraq   between epidemics  crack and AIDS opioids and suicide   and between two different periods of economic stagnation  the  70s and early Aughts   If you were born later  you experienced slow growth followed by financial crisis followed by a recovery that s only lately returned us to the median income and unemployment stats of   1999 And even with under 4 percent unemployment  the differences between our economy and 1999 s are notable  Our current expansion features lower work force participation rates and weaker productivity growth  a fertility collapse instead of the modest 1990s baby boom   plus it s all floated by deficits that seem necessary but aren t a sign of deep economic health But perhaps the best way to understand the lost world of 20 years ago is that it was the just enough internet era  There was just enough internet to boost economic productivity  the Facebook Amazon era has not had a similar effect   just enough to encourage subcultural ferment  just enough to challenge cultural gatekeepers and give lonely teenagers succor  It was the early blogosphere instead of Twitter mobs  serendipity instead of ruthless curation  geek culture as an insurgency rather than a corporate establishment  online as an escape for eccentrics rather than an addictive dystopia for everyone Still  we should have seen the bad days coming  The filmmakers of 1999 did  as Reason magazine s Jesse Walker noted when The Ringer s top 100 list came out   Election    The Matrix    Fight Club    The Blair Witch Project    Office Space    The Talented Mr  Ripley   even  God help us   The Phantom Menace    it s all there  everything that followed  class anxiety and workplace alienation  end of history discontents and internet fueled hoaxes  disputed elections and virtual reality prisons  plus a tottering republic waiting for its Palpatine We should have listened  Instead  we took that stupid red pill from  The Matrix   and now we ll never find our way back up Listen to the latest episode of  The Argument A

LONDON   British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk on Friday asking to delay Brexit until June 30 The text of May s letter is below  Dear Donald In the European Council Decision of 22 March  taken in agreement with the United Kingdom  the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed that if the House of Commons had approved the Withdrawal Agreement by 29 March 2019  the period provided for by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union would be extended until 22 May 2019 to provide for ratification  The House of Commons declined to approve the Withdrawal Agreement and take up that option  Therefore unless we agree a further extension at the European Council you have convened for 10 April  the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal at 2300 BST on 12 April 2019  The Government s policy has always been and remains to leave the European Union in an orderly way  and without undue delay  The House of Commons has not thus far approved the deal that would enable this  nor   despite considerable efforts by both Members of Parliament and by the Government   has it yet found a majority in favor of any other proposal The House has  however  continued to express its opposition to leaving the European Union without a deal  The Government agrees that leaving with a deal is the best outcome This impasse cannot be allowed to continue  In the UK it is creating uncertainty and doing damage to faith in politics  while the European Union has a legitimate desire to move on to decisions about its own future  That is why the Government has decided to take further action to seek a consensus across the House of Commons on the right way forward  I therefore met the Leader of the Opposition earlier this week to discuss whether we might be able to agree a proposal that can be put before the House of Commons which allows the United Kingdom to leave the European Union with a deal  We agreed follow up discussions that are now taking place  I have also extended an open invitation to Members of Parliament more broadly to work with me to achieve a consensus that respects the result of the 2016 referendum  I am clear that all of these discussions need to be based on acceptance of the Withdrawal Agreement without reopening it  as the United Kingdom agreed with the European Council at our last meeting  and should focus on the framework for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union  If a consensus is going to be found  compromise will be needed on all sides  in the national interest  If the talks do not lead to a single unified approach soon  the Government would instead look to establish a consensus on a small number of clear options on the future relationship that could be put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue  The Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House  if the Opposition will commit to doing the same  These steps demonstrate that the Government is determined to bring this process to a resolution quickly  The Government acknowledges  however  that after approval to the Withdrawal Agreement is achieved  the process of enacting those commitments in domestic law and therefore ratifying the Agreement in the United Kingdom will take time  Therefore having reluctantly sought an extension to the Article 50 period last month  the Government must now do so again  It remains the Government s view that  despite this request to extend the Article 50 period  it is in the interests of neither the United Kingdom as a departing Member State  nor the European Union as a whole  that the United Kingdom holds elections to the European Parliament  However  the United Kingdom accepts the European Council s view that if the United Kingdom were still a Member State of the European Union on 23 May 2019  it would be under a legal obligation to hold the elections  The Government is therefore undertaking the lawful and responsible preparations for this contingency  including by making the Order that sets the date of the poll  The process I have laid out in paragraphs 4 and 5 is designed to bring the House Of Commons to rapid approval Of the Withdrawal Agreement and a shared vision for the future relationship  and to allow the Government to introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and so ratify the Agreement  An important part of that process will be the Government agreeing with the Opposition a program for the Bill  The Government s objective is to ensure that this program means the Bill can complete its passage such that the Agreement can be brought into force and the United Kingdom withdraw from the European Union in time to cancel the European Parliament elections  I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50 3  of the Treaty on European Union  including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty  The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019  If the parties are able to ratify before this date  the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early  The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections  but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible  It is frustrating that we have not yet brought this process to a successful and orderly conclusion  The United Kingdom Government remains strongly committed to doing so  and will continue to act as a constructive and responsible Member State of the European Union in accordance with the duty of sincere cooperation throughout this unique period  I would be grateful for the opportunity to update our colleagues on the position at our meeting on Wednesday     Reporting by Elizabeth Piper and Alistair Smout  Editing by Guy Faulconbridge  

Mike Leigh s  Peterloo   about a notorious episode of political violence  is for most of its running time a riot of verbal eloquence  One of the characters  Henry Hunt  Rory Kinnear   takes  Orator  as an honorific  like  Reverend  or  Doctor   but his rhetorical gifts hardly set him apart  High flown phrases pour from the mouths of activists at meetings  judges on the bench and politicians in the halls of Parliament  Orotund syllables drip from the mouths of government ministers  military officers and property owners in private consultations  Radicals rouse the rabble with vivid images of oppression and fiery exhortations to revolt Every so often  someone will remark that the time for talk is past  that what is needed now is action  But part of the argument of this brilliant and demanding film is that words are deeds  that language matters  Language is a weapon in the arsenals of power and resistance alike  and if you listen closely to the motley idioms and accents that fill the soundtrack  punctuated and underlined by Gary Yershon s musical score   you can hear the currents of history moving This is not just a matter of accuracy with respect to the look and sound of the past  though Leigh and his crew see to that with characteristic artistry  as they did in  Topsy Turvy  and  Mr  Turner   The production and costume designers  Suzie Davies and Jacqueline Durran  and the director of photography  Dick Pope  create a plausible  breathing picture of England in 1819  and Leigh s script takes pains to capture the texture of the time  Surely this is as close as we can hope to come to experiencing what people saw and how they spoke in various corners of Regency society  from the royal boudoir to the taverns of Manchester But the past  if it is a foreign country where people do things differently  is also a mirror  We can see our own world in its contours if we look from the right angle On Aug  16  1819  in St  Peter s Field near Manchester  at least 16 demonstrators were killed   trampled by horses and run through with swords   by military and constabulary forces  The protesters  60 000 to 80 000 strong according to contemporary estimates  marched under a broad banner of reform  demanding expanded suffrage  tax relief and repeal of the trade inhibiting Corn Laws The march  forever after known as the Peterloo massacre  comes at the end of the film  which begins on a different battlefield a few years earlier  A young bugler  Joseph  David Moorst   wanders through the carnage of Waterloo before making his way home to Manchester  Meanwhile  the prime minister  Lord Liverpool  Robert Wilfort   heaps praise and public funds on the victorious Duke of Wellington  The home secretary  Lord Sidmouth  a marvelously vulpine Karl Johnson   worries that the forces unleashed by the French Revolution will survive the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte  The threat of insurrection is especially dire in the North of England In some ways  the plot of what follows could not be simpler  The disaffected residents of Manchester   owners of small businesses  intellectuals and weavers toiling in the newly mechanized mills   plan a mass meeting  The defenders of the status quo  in government and private enterprise  calculate their response  A great many arguments ensue But Leigh s narrative is touched by the literary spirit of the later 19th century   Peterloo  has the sweep of Tolstoy and the bustle of Dickens  It s crowded with noble  villainous and comical characters  police spies and magistrates  radical firebrands and anxious liberals  pompous officials and plain spoken workers  servants  tradesman  gossips  thugs and children  The prince regent himself  Tim McInnerny   Every one carries a spark of individuality  Every voice and face is something to remember The movie is equally packed with ideas   about strategy and tactics  ends and means  liberty and order  Through the mist of ideology and the fog of oratory  the sharp outlines of modern politics become visible  There are two sides  those who demand reform and those who oppose it  but each side is crosshatched with factional and temperamental schisms  Orator Hunt s main cause is his own ego  and it s his celebrity that brings out the crowds  Among his fans are city businessmen who see universal suffrage as a way of bringing a share of political influence to a middle class whose economic influence is growing  The workers see the vote as a steppingstone toward full social equality  While the organizers insist on nonviolence  a group of younger militants  egged on by an agent provocateur in the pay of the home secretary  dreams of armed revolt and regicide The specter of Jacobinism   of the guillotine and the mobs at the Bastille   haunts Britain s rulers  from the prince regent to the owners of Manchester s factories  But they  too  have their quarrels  Should they offer modest improvements in wages and political access in the hopes of quieting popular fury  Or should they respond with force As it happens  the state and its agents both take control and lose it  The violence in  Peterloo  arrives swiftly and grimly  The chaos of the climactic minutes stands in brutal contrast to the decorum that has come before  For most of the movie  even when tempers flare and passions burn hot  a certain courtesy prevails  This civility  though  serves as both screen and scaffolding for the cruelty that is the society s organizing principle Like many great works of history   Peterloo  has a point of view   you might even say a grudge  Leigh s sympathies lie with Joseph  the bugler  and his family  particularly his parents  Nellie  Maxine Peake  and Joshua  Pearce Quigley   whose suffering seems to lie beyond the reach of any political rhetoric  The way they are portrayed edges close to sentimentality  but the honest sympathy the film extends them is the element that gives the wider tableau its clarity and force  The concerns and causes that for most everyone else provide occasions for speechmaking are  for these people  a matter of life and death  

AMHERST  Mass    When Coach Greg Carvel arrived at University of Massachusetts Amherst from St  Lawrence University in 2016  he inherited a hockey program that had just two winning seasons since 1995 and had won only 11 conference games in Hockey East the previous three seasons  We were the joke of Hockey East for a while there   said Kurt Keats  the only senior on the team who has been in the program for four years   We definitely were not a source of pride for the university  But this season  the Minutemen won their first Hockey East regular season title and advanced to their first men s Frozen Four They will play eight time national champion Denver University in the semifinals on Thursday night in Buffalo  with the winner facing the defending champion Minnesota Duluth or Providence in the championship game Saturday night Almost from the moment he arrived on campus  Carvel  who on Tuesday was named the national coach of the year  promised a change in culture and fortune for a program that was often overshadowed by in state rival UMass Lowell  announcing   We re not ZooMass  we re NewMass  Still  in his first season  UMass had only five victories and lost its last 17 games  Last year UMass finished 17 20 2  but did win its first round series in the Hockey East playoffs Signs of a breakthrough came early this season  The Minutemen won at Ohio State  ranked No  1 at the time  in its second game  then rode a nine game winning streak to the top spot  sweeping No  4 Providence along the way  They are ranked fourth in the most recent poll  and are the only Division I men s team that did not lose consecutive games this season UMass takes a 30 9 0 record to the Frozen Four  but after earning its berth in Buffalo  even Carvel admitted   We re way ahead of schedule  The Minutemen produced this surprising season with one of the youngest rosters in college hockey  Of its 25 skaters  19 are freshmen and sophomores  including the first year Finnish goalie Filip Lindberg Lindberg took over the starting job from the sophomore Matt Murray  who had won 20 games  in the Hockey East quarterfinals sweep against New Hampshire and has posted three shutouts since  In the N C A A  East Regional  UMass outscored Harvard and Notre Dame by a combined 8 0 The team s marquee player  though  is the sophomore defenseman Cale Makar  the No  4 overall pick in the 2017 N H L  draft  He is expected to join the Colorado Avalanche in the Stanley Cup playoffs as soon as his college season ends Along with St  Cloud State s Jimmy Schuldt and Harvard s Adam Fox  also defensemen  Makar is a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award  given to the most outstanding player in college hockey  The winner will be announced on Saturday Carvel left no doubt on how he thinks the vote should go  saying last week of Makar   He s the best player in college hockey  It s not even close  ImageFilip Lindberg  a freshman goalie from Finland  had shutouts in his first two N C A A  tournament games  CreditCharles Krupa Associated PressAccording to Brian Willsie  the development consultant for the Avalanche  Makar has all the qualities necessary for success in the N H L  To say he s a mobile defenseman is an understatement   Willsie said   His skating is what blows you away  It s on a different level  With 16 goals and 32 assists  Makar  a native of Calgary  Alberta  is tied for third in the nation in scoring  With three points in Buffalo  he would become the first defenseman to lead the nation in points  In tight games  in the third periods  he knows how to win games   Willsie said   He s such a driven  focused kid  Northeastern Coach Jim Madigan has seen enough of Makar the last two seasons to say    He has all the makings of a 15 year pro  Makar anchors a defense that is UMass  strength  Not only are the Minutemen sixth in the country in goals against average  1 97   but their defensemen have accounted for 39 goals and 87 assists  powering an offense that is third in the country at 3 77 goals per game Forward Brett Boeing said UMass s aggressive style starts with its defense  We want to force turnovers and then control the play   he said   When we re playing well  you can see the frustration on the other team  Carvel  48  was not thinking about immediately reaching Frozen Fours when he took over the program in 2016 UMass had been a Division II program when it dropped men s hockey in 1979  The sport didn t return to Amherst until the 8 389 seat Mullins Center opened in 1993  After one year as an independent  when it won 20 games  UMass joined Hockey East for the 1994 95 season  UMass received an at large bid to its first N C A A tournament in 2007  losing to Maine in the quarterfinals Despite losing records in all but two of its Division I seasons before this one  the Minutemen have produced N H L  players  among them goalie Jonathan Quick and forward Conor Sheary  who have won Stanley Cups Carvel s first objective was to identify the right players to take the team forward Keats  who played 35 games as a freshman  was one of those players under the microscope  When he came in  we knew he wanted to weed guys out   Keats said That first season  Keats said  players bought in to Carvel s message   but we didn t see the results  For the 2017 18 season  Carvel brought in 13 freshmen  including Makar and fellow defenseman Mario Ferraro  the No  49 overall pick by the San Jose Sharks in 2017  A different attitude arrived with them  You could see something starting to develop   Keats said In a season of few regrets  Carvel said he wished success had come earlier for players like Keats and Boeing  who were around when the program was floundering  I think they re a little wistful about that  how success came late in their time at UMass   he said   But they will always carry that they were part of the group that turned this program around   

 Reuters    A political feud over President Donald Trump s picks for the U S  Federal Reserve Board broke into an open brawl on Tuesday even before the nominations of Herman Cain  a former restaurant chain executive  and Stephen Moore  a conservative economic commentator  have been formally submitted to the Senate Cain and Moore  both overt loyalists to the president  in recent days have waged unprecedented public campaigns for the Fed jobs  with both eagerly endorsing Trump s economic policies and Moore pledging to  accommodate  those policies once he is at the Fed The central bank s leadership prides itself on its nonpartisan stewardship over the world s biggest economy  and views political independence as key to its ability to carry out monetary policy effectively  On Tuesday  Democrats including Senator Chuck Schumer and Joint Economic Committee Vice Chair Carolyn Maloney took public aim at the pair s qualifications  with Maloney saying that Moore is  superbly underqualified for the role for which he has been nominated  And at least four Republican Senators indicated they could break ranks on Cain  enough to sink his chances for the required approval in the Senate The Trump administration is  probably going to hear from a number of our members about concerns that they have  about Cain  John Thune  the Republican whip in the Senate  told Politico  Another Republican senator  John Cornyn  said   Before the president starts floating names     we need to have a conversation about who is actually confirmable up here   according to a Twitter post by New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush  Cain and Moore are battling hard for the two vacant seats on the Federal Reserve s Board of Governors  positions that would give them a say for years on interest rate policy and bank regulation  In recent days they have taken to social media and the airwaves to promote themselves and lash out at critics and anyone they view as standing in the way of Trump s agenda or his prospects for reelection In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday  Moore trumpeted his agenda for economic growth and again took aim at critics  There are a lot of people on the left that are afraid of my ideas  They realize that they couldn t defeat me based on my ideas  because they re popular  and they re right  so that leads to this kind of smear campaign  which is ugly   Moore said   I have a pretty populist agenda that I m pursuing  which is more growth  higher wages  more transparency and more sunlight on how the Fed operates   Moore said  calling those priorities  the right things to do  and saying that he wants  to talk directly to the American people   NOT SO FAVORABLY INCLINED Cain and Moore s open politicking is a departure from past practice  with confirmation of Fed nominees typically a sleepy process of quizzing candidates  mostly economists with doctoral degrees  about their views on monetary policy and banking oversight  Lewis Alexander  chief U S  economist at Nomura Securities  said it was positive  for people s views to be known   but he added a note of caution   It is certainly not a part of the Federal Reserve s mandate to promote the chances of reelection of a particular president  Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed for raising rates  saying that rate hikes are holding back the economy  His pick of Moore and former Republican presidential candidate Cain has been seen by critics as a means to put pressure on the central bank to ease policy and help him politically Moore and Cain have kept up unusually public profiles  Cain s has included digs against Democrats   lunatic liberals   he said Monday on Facebook  and gays  a Tuesday tweet linked to a piece on Floyd Brown s Western Journal that portrays gays as unnatural   Cain has said he would not be disappointed if he does not get the Fed job  but has repeatedly brought it up on his daily show  In a video posted Tuesday  Cain said  a lot of people     do not like the fact  that he is under consideration and are trying to discourage the administration from nominating him because of his conservative political leanings   The decision s going to be made basically on the facts   he said  Cain remains co chair of the America Fighting Back PAC  which was co founded by Brown to promote Trump s reelection  Cain s photo and name were used as recently as last month in a letter raising funds to oppose a group of 12 senators if they ever  cross  Trump  Two of those senators are on the Senate Banking Committee  the first stop in a two step Senate approval process for any Fed nominee  Brown  who was the founding chairman of Citizens United  said in an interview that Cain has stepped back from day to day involvement in the PAC  Cain did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment Moore in radio and TV interviews has praised Trump s economic record and embraced easing monetary policy  a stance that Trump himself has vigorously promoted  People  are not going to vote against someone who has been this successful on the economy   Moore said on Monday  adding in another interview that day that he is  looking forward to getting over to the Fed   Cain s candidacy appeared by late Tuesday to be drawing the most political fire  Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski told The Hill that she is  not so favorably inclined  on Cain  whose 2012 run for president was derailed by claims of sexual harassment  which he has denied  Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell declined to publicly endorse him  the Washington Post reported  It is not the first time a Fed nominee has faced political opposition  In 2011 Republicans scuttled the nomination by Democratic President Barack Obama of Peter Diamond  a Nobel laureate in economics and MIT professor  for what Republican Senator Richard Shelby then said was a lack of experience and appropriate policy preferences    Reporting by Ann Saphir and Trevor Hunnicutt  Additional reporting by Howard Schneider

DUBAI   Saudi Aramco is set to raise  12 billion with its first international bond issue after receiving more than  100 billion in orders  a record breaking vote of market confidence for the oil giant which has faced investor concerns about government influence over the company State owned Aramco s bond issue  split into maturities ranging from three to 30 years  is seen as a gauge of potential investor interest in the Saudi company s eventual initial public offering Before the bond deal was marketed on Monday  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said initial indications of interest for the paper were over  30 billion Having swelled to over  100 billion during the sale process  demand appeared to be the largest ever for emerging markets bonds  fund managers said  surpassing orderbook value of more than  52 billion for Qatar s  12 billion deal last year   67 billion for Saudi Arabia s inaugural issue in 2016 and  69 billion orders for Argentina s  16 5 billion trade that year Such strong interest was also the latest sign that international investors are pouring money back into Saudi Arabia  as the kingdom tries to move on from the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi after his killing at the hands of Saudi agents in October strained ties with Western allies  Purely on figures  it is a fantastic credit   said Damien Buchet  CIO of the EM Total Return Strategy  Finisterre Capital But he added   The thing is  they are part of Saudi Arabia  they are a government arm  For equity investors this is always going to be an issue  more so than for bond investors  The Aramco issue has attracted interest from a wide range of investors  as the oil producer s vast profits would put its debt rating   if unconstrained by its sovereign links   in the same league as independent oil majors like Exxon Mobil and Shell Aramco has insisted on its independence while meeting investors ahead of the bond issue last week  saying the Saudi government remained committed to Aramco s governance framework to safeguard its independence even when oil prices dropped But for some investors Riyadh s control over the oil giant is an issue as its state ownership means decisions will ultimately be for the benefit of the government rather than investors  Aramco is more transparent  has stronger credit metrics and is on an improving ESG  environmental  social and governance  trajectory whereas the government is more complex   said Mohieddine Kronfol  chief investment officer of Global Sukuk and MENA Fixed Income at Franklin Templeton Investments  The link between the two however is understandably very strong   he said NO PREMIUMPreviously reluctant to do so  Aramco last week opened for the first time its books to investor scrutiny  showing it is by far the most profitable company in the world Having made core earnings of  224 billion last year and with  86 billion in free cash flow at the end of 2018  Aramco does not need to borrow Initial indications of over  30 billion in investor demand prompted Aramco to market the notes with almost no premium to Saudi government debt   They are clearly trying to price it  the bond  off existing AA corporates in this world  so people are looking at curves like Shell  Total  Exxon but also technology giants like Apple   said Buchet After  tightening  the price guidance  Aramco on Tuesday ended up selling a  1 billion three year tranche offering investors 55 basis points  bps  over U S  Treasuries  a  2 billion five year tranche at 75 bps over the benchmark  a  3 billion 10 year tranche at 105 bps   3 billion in 20 year notes at 140 bps and  3 billion in 30 year bonds at 155 bps  a document issued by one of the banks leading the deal showed  Managers said the pricing meant the bonds will yield less than Saudi Arabia  which owns it  This is rare  as state owned entities generally offer higher returns than their governments  I think it s madness that s it s going inside the sovereign by a decent margin  Despite the fundamentals of Aramco  it s ultimately sovereign risk   said Richard Briggs  emerging markets strategist at London based CreditSights The issue follows on the heels of Aramco s planned  69 1 billion acquisition of a 70 percent stake in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp  SABIC  from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund  a deal that many see as a transfer of government funds aimed at boosting the Saudi Crown Prince s economic agenda  This bond is being issued for two reasons  to establish Aramco s status as an independent corporate identity and to enable the transfer of wealth out of the company   said Marcus Chenevix  analyst  MENA and global political research at TS Lombard Aramco  however  said the bond issue was not linked to the SABIC acquisition  which will be paid in tranches through internal cash flow and  potentially  other resources Many see the deal as a relationship building exercise with international investors ahead of its planned initial public offering  scheduled for last year and then postponed to 2021 The debt offering initially included a three year floating rate bond  which was later dropped  according to the document The new bonds were trading up before they were officially sold in the so called grey market  where investors trade them on a when issued basis   Strong demand in a world looking for extra yield  a new name  and lots of cash   said Andrew Brenner  managing director at National Alliance Capital Markets Aramco has hired Lazard as financial adviser for the bond deal  JPMorgan  Morgan Stanley  HSBC  Citi  Goldman Sachs and National Commercial Bank have been chosen to arrange the bond issue   Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker in London  David Gaffen and Jennifer Ablan in New York  Editing

A day before he was to appear at a congressional hearing focused on the biggest banks in the United States  Bank of America s chief executive  Brian Moynihan  said on Tuesday that the bank planned to raise its minimum wage to  20 an hour from  15 over the next two years It was another example of how big banks are trying to deal with shifting political winds in Washington  where they face new scrutiny under the Democrats  who now control the House of Representatives Income inequality has become a key focus of some liberal lawmakers  some of them part of the tide of Democrats swept into office in last year s midterm elections  And now the banks  leaders must explain to progressive representatives like Maxine Waters of California and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York why they are paid more than 700 times what low wage workers  including some tellers in their branches  earn each year Appearing on the MSNBC show  Morning Joe   Mr  Moynihan said that starting next month  Bank of America s lowest paid employees would earn  17 an hour  The hourly rate would increase incrementally over the next two years until it reached  20  the highest minimum wage paid by any of the country s largest banks JPMorgan Chase said last year that it was using some of the savings it had realized as a result of the Trump administration s corporate tax cuts to raise its minimum wage to  15 an hour Mr  Moynihan is set to appear before the House Financial Services Committee  where he and leaders of Bank of New York Mellon  Citigroup  Goldman Sachs  JPMorgan Chase  Morgan Stanley and State Street Corporation are expected to be questioned on issues like executive pay  diversity  fair lending and the financial services industry s ties to gun makers For years under Republican control of the committee  members focused on the effects of Dodd Frank financial regulations  Now  instead of lamenting the constraints of stricter regulations  banks are being forced to respond to lawmakers  inquiries about compensation and fair competition  Ms  Waters  who is chairwoman of the committee  recently harangued Wells Fargo s chief executive  Timothy J  Sloan  for receiving a  2 million bonus even as regulators continued to criticize the bank s performance   Mr  Sloan resigned on March 28  The change is reflected in the topics that banks and trade groups choose to address at industry events  Discussions of income inequality are popping up in places like the Bank Policy Institute s annual New York conference and the World Economic Forum s retreat in Davos  Switzerland  Meet the new hyper attuned bank C E O s    said Mike Mayo  an analyst for Wells Fargo who covers Bank of America and other big banks   If the top levels of the financial industry were tone deaf around the financial crisis  this is the opposite  Big banks face growing pressure to show they are treating their less powerful customers and employees well  On Tuesday at Bank of New York Mellon s annual shareholder meeting  the Rev  Jesse L  Jackson  the civil rights leader  was in the audience  During a question and answer session  he first praised the bank s chief executive  Charles W  Scharf   on your efforts to achieve diversity across the United States in a fundamental way  But  he added  the bank still has work to do   There s too much disparity  too little transparency   he said   Are you preparing to raise the wages of workers  for example  Across the country  workers in low wage jobs often find they need government assistance even though they have full time employment  or even several jobs  A 2015 report from the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California  Berkeley  found that bank tellers were among those who struggled to earn enough A spokeswoman for Bank of America said the new wage would affect tellers as well as workers in consumer banking  technology and operations and staff support  among other areas  The bank has over 200 000 employees At Wells Fargo  which has been working to repair its culture and its standing with regulators after a series of scandals  some employees have had their pay stagnate or shrink as the bank reshaped its incentive plans so that they no longer encouraged cheating  Some rank and file employees have reported difficulties making ends meet  In 2017  Wells Fargo set its minimum wage at  15 an hour  up from  13 50 Mr  Scharf said at Tuesday s meeting that Bank of New York Mellon had recently raised its minimum wage to  15 an hour Another source of pressure is an effort by the wealth management company Arjuna Capital to get several big banks  including Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon  to disclose comparisons of the pay for men and women  and for white employees and minorities  The most striking feature of these banks is that they re run by white men  and that there isn t a balance of gender and racial equity in the top jobs   Arjuna s managing partner  Natasha Lamb  said in an interview on Tuesday   Really  the goal of our proposal is to create a more diverse  balanced leadership  Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon both advised shareholders to vote against Arjuna s proposal this year  as did Wells Fargo and JPMorgan  Citigroup revealed last year that the median pay gap between its male and female employees was 29 percent   women earned that much less   while the gap between white and minority workers was 7 percent Mr  Mayo said the wage increase announced by Bank of America also reflected a trend among large banks toward employing fewer low wage employees like tellers in favor of more highly skilled workers like financial advisers and technologists who help operate digital banking services  Mr  Moynihan was paid more than  26 million in 2018 The Committee for Better Banks  an activist group that promotes employee unions  reported on Tuesday that in 2018  the six largest banks   JPMorgan  Citibank  Wells Fargo  Bank of America  Goldman and Morgan Stanley   laid off more than 3 000 employees in total  an increase from 349 the previous year  Last year also had record annual profits for the banks  

PITTSBURGH   Casey DeSmith has seen it at every stop of his hockey career  Practice comes  the focus shifts to defending and the guys paid lavishly to score goals take their foot off the gas  I ve had people on every single team I ve ever played on like that  obviously   the Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender said   It just comes with the territory of being a gifted offensive player  There is an exception  Then again  there almost always is when it comes to Sidney Crosby The Penguins captain   whose resume is stuffed with six 100 point seasons  a pair of scoring titles and two Hart Trophies as the NHL s Most Valuable Player   has long been respected and feared for his creative playmaking It s his leadership and conscientious approach to every aspect of the game while stewarding the Penguins through a rocky season to a 13th straight playoff berth that has put the 31 year old into the conversation for the Selke Trophy  given annually to the NHL s top defensive forward Both the metrics and the eye test heading into Pittsburgh s first round matchup with the New York Islanders provide a compelling case Crosby won more than 55  of his faceoffs this season  his best mark since 2009 10  He blocked 43 shots and took away the puck from an opponent 54 times  the second highest total of his career  After a talk with coach Mike Sullivan last fall  Crosby occasionally found himself killing penalties  a role he embraced and would have happily kept doing if not for concerns over his workload Still  there are situations when Sullivan knows he needs the star he calls  the best 200 foot player in the game  to go do his thing  Nursing a one goal lead late against Carolina on March 31  Sullivan sent Crosby over the boards over and over and over as the clock dwindled  Pittsburgh held the Hurricanes at bay and emerged with a crucial 3 1 win  He was out there three of the last five minutes  defending the six on five  defending the five on four   Sullivan said   He was the one guy that was dominant in the faceoff circle  I thought his defensive effort was on display  Hall of Famer Sergei Fedorov was the last player to capture the Selke while scoring 100 points  doing it for Detroit in 1996  Crosby has an outside shot at joining that exclusive company when the league awards are announced in June  Not that Crosby  who has never finished higher than seventh in Selke voting  seems to care  I m still trying to figure it out  to be honest with you   Crosby said   I think it s still something  you re trying to ingrain those habits and be in the right positions  I think experience helps that  You realize that it can help you offensively to be good defensively too  It s not as bad as sometimes you think it needs to be  I think that s part of it  Or maybe more than a part of it Pittsburgh center Matt Cullen  at 42 the league s oldest player  has carved out a 21 year career due in large part to his defensive expertise  Around the time he hit 30  Cullen knew he needed to find different ways to contribute beyond trying to put the puck in the net if he wanted to stick around  He sees Crosby taking some of the same steps not out of necessity but by choice  which makes it all the more impressive  I think Sid s the best example of a guy that has that growth mindset as far as he s never completely satisfied with where he s at   Cullen said   He s always evolving and learning and adapting to different situations  Cullen likened Crosby to Michael Jordan  who was named to the NBA s All Defensive team nine times in addition to winning 10 scoring titles and leading the Chicago Bulls to six championships  Sid s accepted all the challenges of playing against the top lines and then going out and scoring  too   Cullen said Forward Jared McCann arrived in a trade with Florida on Feb  1  The 22 year old grew up admiring Crosby from afar  The up close look has been even more revealing  McCann will find himself transfixed on Crosby s No  87 during film sessions  studying the subtle aspects of Crosby s play in Pittsburgh s end looking for tips that might translate to his own game  be it positioning  physicality or a sense on knowing where the puck is headed before it gets there  I kind of catch myself moving a little bit too much  kind of circling too much   McCann said   I see him stop his feet and then read the play  see where it s going to go and then go  I feel like as a young player  as much as you can watch him in the defensive zone  you should learn from him  Coach Peter Laviolette has spent more than a decade trying to find ways to deal with Crosby during stops in Carolina  Philadelphia and now Nashville  with only occasional success  Never once did it cross my mind to think maybe we could put somebody on the ice and take advantage of him   Laviolette said   It s just that I think his offense overshadows  his defense  sometimes because he s an elite offensive player  Which Sullivan believes separates Crosby from annual Selke contenders like Boston s Patrice Bergeron and Los Angeles  Anze Kopitar  He s the most dangerous guy with the puck   Sullivan said   He also has the ability to score goals at the other end of the rink in quick strike better than any of the other players in conversation  Opportunities that typically begin with Crosby in the defensive zone  doing the dirty work others won t in an effort to produce the highlights few can  His ability to win faceoffs  his puck protection  his strength on the puck  his ability to control the game  all of those things  as important as they are on the offensive side of the puck  they re just as important on the defensive side   Predators defenseman PK Subban said  When he decides  he s going to come back into the zone  get the puck and take it out of the zone  he s going to do it      

MINNEAPOLIS   The Circle 6 Ranch sits halfway between Stanton and Lenorah  just off a stretch of Highway 137 in West Texas where the tumbleweeds have free rein  Parker Hicks  a sophomore on the Texas Tech basketball team  had another description for its location   It s in the middle of nowhere  The final chapter of the Texas Tech basketball team s season will be written on Monday night  when the Red Raiders play Virginia in the N C A A  men s national championship game  But the opening one was set at the Circle 6  a broad spread on a dusty plain  over a long weekend in early September Back then  the Red Raiders were in many ways a group of players and coaches who hardly knew one another  Several of the team s key players were new  So were a few members of the coaching and support staffs  The trip is where they laid the groundwork for what they have become  The whole point of the retreat was to really get to know each other a little bit better   said guard Matt Mooney  a graduate transfer who scored 22 points in Saturday night s win over Michigan State at the Final Four   Oftentimes it s hard to really trust each other and play for each other and play for the coaches if you don t really know them  So the team bussed about 15 miles to the nearest high school gym for the year s first practices  but it also sang karaoke  hung out by a bonfire  and walked along ledges buoyed only by the trust of a teammate  Everyone took part  players  coaches  managers  staff members One of the first exercises called for everyone s name to be put in a hat  and then one by one each scrap of paper was pulled out to form pairs  Those tandems went walking around the ranch  getting to know one another Noah Parker  a freshman manager  learned that the wife of Tim McAllister  who was hired last summer as the team s chief of staff  is a college rifle coach  Josh Mballa  a freshman who was born in Detroit and raised in Bordeaux  France  learned that the graduate assistant Gino Saucedo s dad had a similar experience  coming from Mexico as a kid  The new assistant coach Glenn Cyprien learned that the mother of one of the team s managers was battling cancer These types of exercises are not unique to Texas Tech  Virginia s players had a hoot on a white water rafting trip   At least all of them except De Andre Hunter  who can t swim   And Texas Tech s players hollered when they visited Upper Manhattan s Rucker Park in December and the team s graduate assistants played impromptu pickup games For the Red Raiders  though  the bonhomie engineered at the ranch and cultivated ever since has been essential Last year s team had lost five seniors and Zhaire Smith  a freshman who turned pro and was selected in the first round of the N B A  draft  from a team that reached the N C A A  tournament s East Region final  Texas Tech is not Kentucky or Duke  its coaches knew they could not restock the roster with new plug and play lottery picks  So Coach Chris Beard brought in two graduate transfers   Mooney  who played at Air Force and South Dakota  and Tariq Owens  who played at Tennessee and St  John s   along with four freshmen and a junior college transfer  He also had new coaches  like Cyprien  and staff members  like McAllister  who would need to be integrated It was hard  then  to argue with Texas Tech s being pegged for seventh place in the Big 12 in a preseason vote But Beard knows what it is like to build on the fly He has coached at junior colleges  Division II and Division III programs  and spent a year in the semiprofessional American Basketball Association and a summer coaching Switzerland s national team  In his one year at Arkansas Little Rock  Beard took a team with 10 new players to the second round of the N C A A  tournament And so  fighting the clock to forge relationships  Beard regularly ate lunch and checked in last summer with Mooney and Owens  knowing how important the former  a scoring point guard  and the latter  a shot blocking forward  would be to his team  It s not arrogance  it s just the truth  we re really good at coaching one year guys   Beard said  He added   My experience in professional basketball  the rosters always change   guys come in on contract and just leave  I think there s an art to it  The court  then  is a canvas Watch Texas Tech play defense  with its persistent switching on screens  and its disciplined funneling of dribblers toward the baseline  Trust is essential  And on offense  with its high volume of motion sets   the ones plucked from the playbook of his one time boss in an earlier stint at Texas Tech  Bobby Knight   all five players are moving and reading one another with no predictable path for the ball  Communication is critical The transition has not always been seamless In mid January  the Red Raiders lost three consecutive games  After a couple of wins  they were routed at Kansas and what had started as a promising season was turning sideways  Mooney and the redshirt senior Norense Odiase invited the players to their apartment  letting people get things off their chests and reminding everyone that there was still time to accomplish what they wanted this season  time to become a team that left enduring memories They lost only once after the meeting  and most recently rolled past second seeded Michigan  thwarted top seeded Gonzaga and staved off Michigan State  another No  2 seed On Monday  they arrived in the championship game  an unforeseen occurrence for a team that until last season had never reached a regional final  That Texas Tech could have an extra challenge against Virginia if Owens  who injured his ankle on Saturday night  is unable to play or be effective  almost seems beside the point The Red Raiders will lean on each other for another 40 minutes  They will trust a bond whose roots were laid at a West Texas ranch   a fitting place to start a journey that seems to have come out of nowhere  

ImageStephen Moore founded the Club for Growth  which supports conservative candidates for office CreditTom Williams CQ Roll CallImageHerman Cain  a former pizza executive  sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 CreditCarolyn Kaster Associated PressPoliticians have had strong opinions on what the Federal Reserve should and shouldn t do throughout its 105 year history They have pushed for lower interest rates and easier money  or for this or that policy on bank regulation or consumer protection  They have summoned Fed leaders to the White House or Congress to persuade and cajole In that sense  there is nothing new in President Trump s aggressive approach to the Fed  This week  he called for lower interest rates and new quantitative easing  and he signaled an intention to appoint two vocal supporters  Stephen Moore and Herman Cain  to the board of governors What makes Mr  Trump s approach to the Fed so unusual is that he has repeatedly  publicly undermined a Fed chief he appointed  Jerome Powell   and  if successful  he would put two officials with a background in partisan politics in the inner sanctum of Fed policymaking   Mr  Moore was founder of the Club for Growth  which supports conservative candidates for office  and Mr  Cain ran for president   It s more overtly political than anything we ve seen since at least the  80s  and historically when we ve had political appointments and interventions in the Fed  there have been unintended consequences that last   said Julia Coronado  president of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Fed staffer   It may be expedient in the near term  but what s good for the next year or two may not be good for the next decade  All presidential appointees to the Fed s board of governors come with their own political point of view  which generally dovetails with the president who appointed them  But typically they have also brought deep technical expertise and an inclination to keep political dimensions out of Fed debates  People around the table did have political views  and I did  too   said Alan Blinder  who was appointed vice chairman of the Fed by President Bill Clinton and is more recently the author of  Advice and Dissent   about the role of politicians versus technocrats in shaping policy   But you weren t supposed to bring them into the room when it was time to make a decision  and people didn t  That is the tradition that Mr  Trump s approach endangers You can read thousands of pages of transcripts of closed door Fed policy meetings without seeing a reference to the political jockeying that occupies the rest of Washington Three times in recent decades  a president has reappointed a Fed chairman first named by a president of the opposite party  Ronald Reagan with Paul Volcker  Mr  Clinton with Alan Greenspan and Barack Obama with Ben Bernanke  You will see no political bumper stickers in the underground parking garage  When Dan Tarullo  an Obama campaign veteran and a banking expert  was named a governor in 2009  there was some tut tutting among staff that he initially left his sticker on In effect  the risk is that the Fed becomes yet another partisan battlefield  as is already often the case with the Supreme Court nomination process  congressional intelligence oversight committees and regulators like the Federal Communications Commission In the immediate future  this probably wouldn t mean much for policy  If nominated and confirmed  Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain would hold two of 12 votes on the Federal Open Market Committee  Their ability to sway the Fed toward Mr  Trump s desired interest rate cuts and a new round of quantitative easing would depend on their ability to persuade their new colleagues  It will be their task to convince the others that their way of thinking about monetary policy will improve the Fed s ability to meet its legislative mandates for maximum employment and stable prices   said Don Kohn  a former Fed vice chairman who was appointed by George W  Bush   That will require solid economic analysis backed up by research  The risk of more overt political divisions within the Fed would come over time  if the Fed came to be seen as basing decisions on the political impulses of appointees rather than on sound economic analysis The United States  role as the global reserve currency   which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight   is built in significant part on the credibility the Fed has accumulated over decades During the global financial crisis and its aftermath  for example  the Fed could feel comfortable pursuing efforts to stimulate the United States economy without a loss of faith in the dollar and Treasury bonds by global investors  The dollar actually rose against other currencies even as the economy was in free fall in late 2008  and the Fed deployed trillions of dollars in unconventional programs to try to stop the crisis The Fed Claims to Be Independent  That s Mostly a Myth Oct  19  2017The hazards of a more politicized Fed are evident from the experience of the early 1970s  when Richard Nixon used both political pressure and underhanded tactics to try to push the Fed chairman  Arthur Burns  to keep interest rates low heading into the 1972 election Among other things  the White House leaked a false story that Mr  Burns sought a large pay raise at a time the Fed was pressuring employers not to increase wages to fight inflation Mr  Burns and the Fed followed the president s wishes  and Mr  Nixon won re election handily in 1972  amid a booming economy  But it was in those years that inflationary pressures were building in the economy  and within a few years the rate of inflation reached double digits No one would argue that the Fed is divorced from politics  It is constantly making decisions that pit the interests of workers against owners of capital  and those of banks against those of consumers  But there is a difference between acknowledging that there are choices that must be informed by political values and putting those political values ahead of what are often highly technical discussions In Senate confirmation hearings  would Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain adopt the cautious  careful language typical of central bankers   or embrace a role as partisan warriors  The safest bet is that investors around the world will be watching carefully for hints of just how politicized the Fed of the future will turn out to be  

My parents and I used to high five one another when we learned that the child of someone very rich had been found to have Type 1 diabetes  We weren t being mean  just desperate  I was given my diabetes diagnosis in 1987  when I was 9  and the years immediately following were spent fantasizing about a cure  A cure would solve all my problems  the physical  mental and financial strains of having a chronic illness  A cure would require fund raising for charities that would then be able to sponsor life changing research  Put more simply  a cure would require money   lots of it So  like monsters  my family and I rooted for offspring of the wealthy to join the broken pancreas club  so that diabetes would become their pet cause and their fancy friends would get involved  The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation s charity auction would make a killing When I was a kid  I was certain there would be an end point to my disease  a day I could check off on my calendar when I d be free  By the year 2000  I was sure that my pancreas  which had stopped producing insulin  would suddenly restart thanks to modern technology  I was particular  I hoped the cure would not require surgery   injectable was preferred  but something in pill form would be even better  As if I d have any say in the matter There have been some improvements in the management of my diabetes in the past 30 years I used to have to put a hanging drop of blood on a strip and then wait three minutes for my bulky glucometer to give me a reading  Now all I need to test my blood sugar is a small pin prick of blood  and in five seconds I have an answer  Different types of insulin work more steadily and are faster acting  allowing more flexibility around mealtimes  Insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors are providing stability and greater freedom for many  There s still no cure  but I m actually glad that most researchers don t talk solely about a cure  Diabetes is no longer centered around it   living well with diabetes is better than wishing to throw money at it and make it go away What I didn t expect  what I still can t fathom  is that insulin prices would skyrocket so much  The price of my insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016  with average costs per patient rising to nearly  6 000 a year  I definitely never thought that in 2019 there would be people who would die from lack of access  Many insulin dependent people with diabetes in America  right now  even people with health insurance  are having financial trouble meeting their most basic need  I recently read about a nurse named Meaghan Carter  whose family said that she died when she lost her insurance in 2018  after she had lived with diabetes for more than 18 years  In 2017  a man from Houston died after his GoFundMe for insulin came up  50 short  GoFundMe yielded more than 8 000 results when I searched for  insulin   If my childhood impressions of the future were more sci fi than realistic  then I never imagined the current state of diabetes management would be dystopic  with so many patients in our rich nation rationing their doses  trying to make little glass vials of life blood last as long as possible while drug companies make a hefty profit Diabetics like me need insulin to process the sugar in our blood in order to live  With too little insulin to manage the food we eat  our blood sugars climb  I ve struggled for years to describe what it feels like to have high blood sugar  All my energy is sapped away  I m thirsty and sluggish  and my calves tend to cramp  It feels like a panic attack  I can never separate what high feels like from what anxious feels like because both feelings tend to develop together in a self perpetuating ball  along with guilt  I feel guilty  whether the high is my  fault  or not  did I eat cake    because I m supposed to be in control of my disease  damn it  When I m high  I inject insulin into my belly as quickly as possible and hope to find a nice place to rest while the insulin works its magic That need for insulin takes center stage in my subconscious and many of my stress nightmares  My blood sugar is high but I can t find my insulin in my purse  my version of showing up naked to class for a test I didn t study for  I test my blood sugar and I get a result in the thousands  normal for me is around 100  and I try to fathom the ways in which my body will betray me  I m a prisoner trapped on a plane without my insulin  feeling sicker and sicker  and I have to rely on Nicolas Cage to beat up some bad guys and find spare insulin to bring me  O K   that s not a nightmare  that s the plot of the movie  Con Air   but I certainly had a panic attack while seeing it with my parents as a teenager Since I was a kid I ve felt unfortunate to have diabetes  but now I have to consider myself lucky because my insulin  on my husband s health insurance plan  comes at a somewhat reasonable price  In 2018  I paid  740 for my prescriptions  the plan covered  14 411  Eli Lilly s recent announcement that it will offer a generic version of the fast acting insulin Humalog at half of the list price is too little  too late I m done imagining cures  I just want basic human dignity for all diabetes sufferers  No one should die from lack of insulin  a patent for which was granted nearly a century ago for  3  For now  I will vote for politicians who would regulate drug companies  but I will still keep all of my expired insulin stockpiled in my fridge just in case  I m certainly not brave enough to throw it out right now RelatedOpinion   Elisabeth

KAMPALA  Uganda   A quarter century after Rwanda s brutal genocide  President Paul Kagame remains a constant figure atop the country s politics  feted by those who say it needs his visionary leadership and loathed by others who see a firm authoritarian with a malicious streak Kagame is so little questioned that he speaks openly about the apparent assassinations of opponents  That fear factor keeps him in power  critics say  even as he embraces a global reputation as the man who helped bring an end to the mass killings of some 800 000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus  and who has brought stability to the East African nation In a speech last month  Kagame spoke dismissively of the crime that launched his reputation as a hard liner  The 1998 killing of exiled opposition leader Seth Sendashonga  a fierce Kagame critic  who was gunned down in the streets of the Kenyan capital  Nairobi Referring to the assassination  widely believed to have been carried out by a Rwandan hit squad at Kagame s orders  Kagame said he had little to say   But I am also not apologetic about it   he added It was vintage Kagame  who has been Rwanda s de facto leader since his rebel group seized power by force  ending the 100 day genocide that began on April 7  1994  He has been president since 2000  and could rule until 2034 following changes to the constitution Now 61  Kagame shows no signs of giving up power A darling of the development community  Kagame is lauded by some as a driver of economic growth that has lifted many Rwandans from poverty  bringing improved health care and education  He has also pushed for more women in political office  and 64  of the lawmakers in Rwanda s parliament are women  the highest percentage of any country in the world But for many others he is the architect of an authoritarian regime that has stamped out virtually all opposition in Rwanda as opponents are jailed  flee  disappear  or are killed under mysterious circumstances  There is absolutely no room for dissent within Rwanda   said British writer Michela Wrong  who is researching a book on the country   You agree  you accept Kagame s supreme power  or you leave  Rights groups decry what they describe as rampant violations that include the arbitrary detentions of street children and other poor people as part of an unofficial government program to hide  undesirable  citizens from view  according to Human Rights Watch  Street vendors  many of them women  have been among the main targets  it said Civic groups  journalists  rights watchdogs and political opponents  cannot operate independently or criticize government policy   Human Rights Watch said in its most recent assessment of conditions in Rwanda Amnesty International cited a  climate of fear  before Kagame was re elected to a third term in 2017  a vote that the president described as  a formality  after the most serious challenger was prevented from running and later jailed Even government programs ostensibly aimed at forging national unity are criticized by opponents as tools to more tightly control society The U S  State Department  which describes Rwanda as  a constitutional republic dominated by a strong presidency   also cites the problem of impunity among civilian authorities and the security forces Still  Rwanda s government remains a major recipient of U S  and other foreign aid despite persistent allegations of abuses   a fact that has been sharply criticized by Kagame s opponents  Some analysts have long noted that Western remorse over failure to stop the genocide allows Rwanda a measure of goodwill from benefactors who would act tougher with a similarly repressive regime Olivier Nduhungirehe  Rwanda s deputy minister of foreign affairs  told The Associated Press that those complaining about human rights  should keep quiet   as Rwanda marks 25 years since the genocide  We can t say that everything is perfect  of course   he said  of concerns voiced by some exiles  who say they are afraid to return home   But reconciliation is a reality for the past 25 years  Some critics who have fallen out with the president  including senior ruling party members once seen as Kagame allies  have fled into exile  where safety isn t always guaranteed British police have warned two prominent Rwandan dissidents of the threats to their lives posed by Rwanda s government  Similar warnings have been issued to dissidents elsewhere in Europe In South Africa  an inquest continues into the death of former Rwandan spy chief and Kagame critic Patrick Karegeya  who was found strangled in a Johannesburg hotel in 2014  Kagame has denied his government had anything to do with the killing but warned that those who betray their country will  pay the price  Jean Marie Micombero  a former army major who broke with the Kagame government and who has lived in exile in Belgium since 2011  said that 25 years after Rwanda s genocide  the country has yet to truly heal from its violent past  Under Kagame s leadership Hutus and Tutsis are forced to live together   said Micombero  a Tutsi  He called for new leadership that would  work in the areas of truth and justice in the context of a broken society      There cannot be reconciliation without truth and justice  One group in exile that is leading the opposition against Kagame includes former members of Rwanda s ruling party Outlawed in Rwanda as a terrorist group and accused of running rebel cells in eastern Congo  the Rwanda National Congress denies the allegations and says it is working toward  a united  democratic  and prosperous nation inhabited by free citizens  The group s Johannesburg based leader  former Rwandan army chief Gen  Kayumba Nyamwasa  has been the target of multiple assassination attempts that he blames on Kagame Rwanda s government dismisses charges it runs hit squads abroad  Nduhungirehe  the deputy foreign affairs minister  accused the Rwanda National Congress of  walking hand in hand with those who committed genocide   something the group strongly denies But  says Wrong  the British author and journalist   The level of invective Kagame dedicates to the Rwanda National Congress  the amount of energy he has expended trying to get Uganda and South Africa to expel or extradite or close down these players  suggests he sees them as a real threat   These individuals were once incredibly close to Kagame  they know exactly what makes him tick   Wrong said   I think it s a case of fearing no one quite so much as a former brother in arms      

KIRYAT GAT  Israel   The surprise candidate shaking up the last days of the campaign before Israelis head to the polls on Tuesday is a far right nationalist libertarian who advocates small government  legalizing marijuana and a free market economy While the candidate  Moshe Feiglin  the leader of the Zehut party  remains on the fringes in the election  his message is attracting enough young and disaffected voters that he could emerge as kingmaker in a close race between the two main contenders  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz  a former army chief  Under Israel s parliamentary system  even a few seats could be enough to give one side or the other a majority coalition While the pro marijuana stance has received some notice  it is his economic message that is resonating with young voters who are fed up with Israel s same old politics and exorbitant cost of living  I don t smoke   said Dor Thaler  24  who runs an e commerce business and was attending a recent town hall meeting in Kiryat Gat  a working class town in southern Israel   But I like everything else about his platform  An iconoclastic pied piper  Mr  Feiglin  56  is pledging to upend the customs and tax system by introducing a flat tax and gradually eliminating import duties and quotas  He wants to privatize hospitals and dismantle the state monopoly over land distribution  which he says will create affordable housing  Read our guide to the Israeli elections  His political agenda tends toward an extreme nationalism that critics call dangerous  He advocates a one state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  that would be one Jewish state  and the takeover by Israel s rabbinical authorities of Jerusalem s most contested holy site   the sacred compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary  He also proposes eventually rebuilding the Jewish temple there ImageThe Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem  part of what Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and what Jews refer to as the Temple Mount  Mr  Feiglin has called for Israel s rabbinical authorities to take over the site CreditUriel Sinai for The New York TimesHis platform  published as a 355 page book  titled  To Be a Free Jew  Operating Manual for the State of Israel   topped the nonfiction best seller list of a major Israeli book chain in late March At the town hall meeting in a dingy synagogue annex in Kiryat Gat he swept into the room to the chorus of a popular Israeli hit   He Who Believes Does Not Fear   There is a revolution here  a true revolution   Mr  Feiglin said   It s so different   he said  that young people are drawn to it  like butterflies to the light  Referring to the Palestinians as  tribes  Arabs or whatever   he said Israel had lost its most important weapon  the justice of its cause  By endorsing a two state solution that envisages a Palestinian state alongside Israel  he told his audience   You have turned yourself into a colonialist and an invader in your own country  His alternative  Impose Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank and Gaza  provide assistance to Palestinians who want to emigrate  and grant permanent resident status to those who remain if they pledge allegiance to the Jewish state Critics view his agenda as a crazy hodgepodge of ideas bordering on the anarchic and Messianic  There isn t enough space to fully describe Feiglin s right wing  ultranationalist and dangerous vision   the liberal Haaretz newspaper warned in an editorial this week titled   Joints on the Temple Mount  ImageMr  Feiglin  right center  campaigning at the Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem this month  His party is drawing support from young Israelis CreditAmmar Awad ReutersIt added   Anyone who doesn t fully subscribe to this vision ought to be wary of him  Young people  at least  are subscribing  Mr  Feiglin s Zehut party finished second to Mr  Gantz s centrist Blue and White party in a recent poll on university campuses by the National Union of Students On Tuesday  he received a rock star reception at a concert venue in Tel Aviv  attended by some 2 000 supporters  for an appearance that was live streamed on Facebook and received wide coverage in the mainstream news media  Two days later  he went on a bar crawl in a trendy area of downtown West Jerusalem  Appearing unannounced  he received a warm welcome in one establishment but was jeered at another In a pallid parade of establishment politicians Mr  Feiglin stands out as a colorful  convention busting alternative  said Batia Siebzehner  a sociologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  Today the elections are not about a worldview or political view  but about personalities   Ms  Siebzehner said She described him as  a bit of a clown  and  a bit of a hippie   but an extremist nonetheless  The somewhat Messianic vision of being on Temple Mount   I don t think the young Israelis understand the consequences   she said   It s a type of a gimmick  It s a kind of revolt  a revolt against everything  Recent polls predict that Mr  Feiglin s party could win from four to seven seats in the 120 seat Parliament  If the election is close enough  his bloc could determine who leads the next government ImageMr  Feiglin s campaign platform  published as a book titled  To Be a Free Jew  Operating Manual for the State of Israel   is a best seller in Israel CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesMr  Netanyahu  who is facing corruption charges and battling for his political survival after a decade in power  is polling neck and neck with Mr  Gantz Mr  Feiglin has said he is willing to join whichever coalition makes him the best offer He is demanding the legalization of cannabis  the post of finance minister and  if his party wins enough votes  the education ministry too Mr  Feiglin has long been in the public eye as a far right activist and leader of the  This Is Our Land  movement  In the 1990s  he was sentenced to six months in prison for sedition after protesters blocked roads throughout the country to try halt the Oslo peace process  In 2000  he joined Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and failed in four bids to become party chairman  He was elected to Parliament in 2013 and served a two year term  Israeli politics isn t subtle  Read about how from the far left to the far right  political ads are aimed at riling up the base  He has long lobbied for the wider availability of medical cannabis and has spoken of how his wife uses the drug to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson s disease  He now advocates freeing all cannabis from state control Israel partly decriminalized recreational use of marijuana in a law that took effect this week  imposing fines for possession but opening criminal proceedings only after a fourth offense  Cannabis promoters say that is not enough But legalization did not even come up in the Kiryat Gat meeting Mr  Feiglin talked about the high prices of groceries  his plans for breaking what he calls the state land cartel  and the Oslo accords  which he wants to abrogate  People think it s all about legalization   he said in a brief interview on his way out of the hall   It s not  It s about all the rest

sexual assault victims  said it took her some time to realize how uncomfortable she had been made to feel by the former vice president  whom she d met after the ceremony  Biden had introduced the performance   He had clasped Karasek s hands and placed his forehead against hers  a moment captured in a widely shared photograph   a copy of which she kept framed in her home for a while  She took it down as  MeToo began gaining ground  In the video  Biden  still didn t take ownership in the way that he needs to   Karasek told The Post   Too often it doesn t matter how the woman feels about it or they just assume that they re fine with it   Vail Kohnert Yount  a White House intern in 2013 who said Biden once pressed his forehead into hers and called her a  pretty girl  when she had expected a handshake  said that she didn t consider her experience  sexual assault or harassment   but that  it was the kind of inappropriate behavior that makes many women feel uncomfortable and unequal in

HAMBURG  Germany   Two weeks ago I was on the outskirts of Derry  a town in Northern Ireland  just a few yards away from the border where Britain ends and the Republic of Ireland begins  Behind a garden wall  a wiry  older man was eager to vent  This is Ireland  The English have no business here   he exclaimed  He pointed down the road toward a small stone bridge  The checkpoint there vanished two decades ago  he said  Should the British try to erect a new guard house  he went on   we will burn it down  Come on  I cajoled him  incredulously  What will really happen if  after Britain leaves the European Union  customs officers or the police might be stationed at what will then be a new border  We will stone them   the man replied  more calmly  He shrugged  warming to his idea   Yeah  We ll stone them  There is no end to the problems surrounding Brexit  but especially for the rest of us Europeans  the dilemma at the Irish British land border is the most perplexing  and perhaps the most concerning  at least in a symbolic sense  This week Chancellor Angela Merkel is traveling to Ireland to see firsthand what is happening  Europe in the 20th century was marked by hideous violence   often wars  but just as often extended periods of political violence  like the Troubles in Northern Ireland  The great postwar project of European cooperation and unification was an effort to  among other things  make that violence a thing of the past  The Good Friday Agreement  which brought the Troubles to an end  seemed to validate everything we had worked toward  whether  we  were Irish or British or German Now  with Brexit looming  the talk of renewed violence in Ireland brings that optimism and progress into question Whether the Troubles are about to return is still just speculation  But in Ireland  many people believe it   If there is going to be hard borders in Ireland   Richard O Rawe  who showed me around that day  said   there will most definitely be a flare up of violence  both in the short and long term   Mr  O Rawe knows what he is talking about  In the 1970s  at the height of the Troubles  he belonged to the Irish Republican Army  He was imprisoned by the British  in prison he served as spokesman for a group of inmates associated with the political activist Bobby Sands  who died after a hunger strike in 1981  After prison  Mr  O Rawe wrote several books on the conflict and broke with the I R A  Twenty years have passed since the Good Friday Agreement  To a German visiting Northern Ireland  a couple of similarities with my own country  reunited 30 years ago  spring to mind  Social cleavages have softened but not vanished  A heavily protected barrier that once was a symbol of unnatural separation has given way to a natural coalescence  But unlike in Germany  the former oppressor is still a political player in Northern Ireland  Germany has its regional differences  but there is no doubt that we are all Germans  Not so on the island  where resentment at what is seen as English highhandedness runs rife   and where few believe that things will be any better post Brexit  Mr  O Rawe worried that a new  visible dividing line on the island would revive ancient division and anger   A hard border would cement the injustice that has been historically perpetrated against the Irish people   he said   It would be presented as the British government asserting a warped definition of democracy in Ireland to suit their own agenda  and would energize the adage that Britain only respects one thing  the barrel of a gun  In the 2016 Brexit referendum  a majority of people in Northern Ireland  55 8 percent  voted to remain in the European Union  This means that it would be dragged out of the union against its will  and in particular against the will of its Irish nationalists  Support for independence  and a reunification with the Irish republic  is growing  In London  Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to respect the peace accord and avoid a hard border in Ireland  But neither she nor anyone else has yet explained how not to control a border that separates a European Union country from a nonunion country  Mrs  May s Brexit plan leaves open the possibility of at least customs checks along the border  without a plan in place  a hard border will almost certainly be needed  Mr  O Rawe believes that the British government  preoccupied with political strife in Westminster  has given no thought to what Brexit might bring in terms of violent Republican reaction   They see a weak dissident campaign at present   he said   and tell themselves that they ve nothing to worry about  But they are blinkered fools  In January  just a few miles from were I met the angry local man  a car bomb exploded in the center of Derry  No one was injured  luckily  but the entire island was unnerved  The police blame a splinter group called the New I R A  Though the I R A  is a small shell of its old self  some suspect that it is eager to see a hard border  and the strife that would accompany it  Martin McAllister  an ex I R A  member I met in South Armagh  said he also quit the organization in the 1970s  when he decided it had devolved into a terrorist criminal enterprise  A few years ago  after he began speaking out about I R A  gangsterism  he was ambushed and beaten Driving through his home region  Mr  McAllister pointed out a remarkable number of oil tanks and fuel trucks   the sign  he said  of a gasoline smuggling ring  a continuing activity left over from the Troubles   For the I R A   this was a way of making money to pursue the war   he said   Some of the main leadership of the I R A  have been personally involved in it for personal gain   Profits are lower today  but a border will change that   If there is a hard border  all these smugglers will have a great time  If you believe Mr  McAllister and Mr  O Rawe  a hard border across the island will effectively be a tripwire  Locals will loathe it  Gangsters will love it  And ultimately  a generation of new resistance fighters might find themselves in a conflict of interest with Godfathers turned freedom fighters  A whole generation of Europeans has grown up seeing Britain as a nation that overcame its bitter sectional differences   proof that cooperation worked  that borders might be a thing of the past  Now not only is Britain turning its

 Want to get this newsletter from Marc Stein each week   for free  Sign up here  As the 2018 19 regular season dribbles to a close  with just two nights and 22 of 1 230 games to go  voters leaguewide are finalizing their year end award ballots in six major categories  I am no longer one of them  because The New York Times does not permit its reporters to vote for such awards  but it s still a useful exercise as we take stock of the season to break down each race and who I would have picked Most Valuable Player  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Milwaukee Bucks Official selections are due Friday night and there is simply no wrong answer when choosing between Antetokounmpo and Houston s James Harden for the top spot on the five man M V P  ballot I have always approached this category by trying to identify who had the best overall season   based on a subjective and imprecise mixture of individual and team success   rather than paying attention to the noise about which player is most widely regarded as the game s best   or the best two way player   or any other such designation So who had the better 2018 19 season  I would go  ever so narrowly  with Giannis  On top of all his individual superlatives  Antetokounmpo has been the face and chief culture setter in the Bucks  transformation from 44 win underachiever to the best team in the league  regular season edition   And his candidacy gets bonus points on our scorecard because Milwaukee  for Eastern Conference supremacy  had to beat out a trio of worthy challengers who were all projected as superior before the season Harden would be tremendously unlucky to finish second in M V P  balloting for the third time in five seasons  but I think that s where this is headed  He is going to be the first scoring champion  36 1 points per game  to win the scoring title by more than eight points per game since Michael Jordan did over Dominique Wilkins in 1986 87  And I tend to agree with Houston Coach Mike D Antoni s contention that Harden is the only player capable of hauling the injury riddled Rockets to 53 victories out of the 11 14 hole they were in  Harden simply has the misfortune of doing all that damage in a season that belonged to Antetokounmpo and the Bucks Rookie of the Year  Luka Doncic  Dallas Mavericks It feels as though I have been writing and tweeting about Doncic and his Atlanta Hawks counterpart Trae Young all season  I suspect I will be writing about the two of them for the next decade plus  And I m fine with that Doncic has had the start to finish stronger campaign and continued to look like a franchise player even though the Mavericks steadily increased his Year 1 workload after trading away four fifths of their starting lineup in February  The trade brought in Kristaps Porzingis and better positions Dallas to build out a supporting cast tailored to their electric European import Young has delivered even more impressive post All Star break production  24 9 points per game and 9 1 assists per game  for a scrappy Hawks team with a passable record of 23 29 since its dismal 6 23 start   and an increasingly bright future Doncic is going to win the race  but Young overcame his own worrisome launch to make it a competition   and a rivalry that should have staying power   with his second half surge Doncic will be remembered as the only rookie in N B A  history not named Oscar Robertson to average at least 20 points  7 rebounds and 5 assists  And Young can take solace in being almost as unfortunate as Harden if he doesn t win the hardware  It s quite a compliment when you think about it Coach of the Year  Mike Budenholzer  Milwaukee Bucks Had the Indiana Pacers won 50 games in a season in which Victor Oladipo was healthy enough to play only 36  Nate McMillan would have the rsum to deny the Bucks  Budenholzer  I m not sure McMillan is miles off with 47 wins Doc Rivers of the Los Angeles Clippers  like McMillan  is another victim of bad timing  Rivers hasn t had a team overachieve like these starless Clippers since his rookie season on the bench with Orlando in 1999 2000 when the Magic won a wholly unexpected 41 games in a season billed as a placeholder before a splashy free agent summer that ultimately landed Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady in the Magic Kingdom But Milwaukee s improvement in Budenholzer s first season has been so dramatic that I can t see how he doesn t win his second Coach of the Year trophy  Perhaps some voters will try to convince themselves that the Bucks would be getting too much love if they vote for both Giannis for M V P  and Bud for this honor  But we re talking about the league s only 60 win team   and the runaway champions in average point differential for the season   9 1    and the only team in the league to rank in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency Antetokounmpo is the biggest reason all that is possible  General Manager Jon Horst is likewise on an impressive run of roster moves  But Budenholzer s impact has been undeniable Honorable mentions  along with McMillan and Rivers  Denver s Mike Malone  Brooklyn s Kenny Atkinson  Portland s Terry Stotts  Orlando s Steve Clifford  Detroit s Dwane Casey  Golden State s Steve Kerr and  of course  San Antonio s Gregg Popovich Sixth Man Award  Lou Williams  Los Angeles Clippers Manu Ginobili  who just had his familiar No  20 retired by the San Antonio Spurs  used to be synonymous with sixth man excellence to me  Ditto for Jamal Crawford Yet I d say Williams wears that crown now The Clippers  designated scorer won this award last season and stands as a huge favorite to join Crawford as the league s only three time winner   despite the challenge he s getting from teammate Montrezl Harrell Someone from the Clippers has to win some year end recognition in light of the Cinderella season they ve assembled  Williams makes the most sense over a quality field that also features Harrell  Indiana s Domantas Sabonis  Brooklyn s Spencer Dinwiddie  New Orleans  Julius Randle and San Antonio s Davis Bertans Most Improved Player  Pascal Siakam  Toronto Raptors As the self proclaimed overseer of the All Lefty Team  it pains me to snub both D Angelo Russell of the Nets and Sacramento s De Aaron Fox in this category But I ve been saying for years that ultra high former draft picks like Russell and second year players like Fox are not going to be Most Improved candidates for me  Russell made a tremendous  inspiring leap to All Star status in Brooklyn this season  but the wow factor partly stems from the fact that he fell so far short of expectations in his first three seasons  Fox  meanwhile  made the sort of Year 1 to Year 2 leap Sacramento was counting on from someone it billed as a franchise cornerstone No one expected Siakam to become an impact player at both ends and a borderline All Star who helped the Raptors to post 57 wins amid the 22 games Kawhi Leonard missed for various reasons of injury and precaution The nostalgic sap in me  truth be told  wanted to go with Minnesota s resurgent Derrick Rose  But D Rose only wound up being healthy enough to appear in 51 games   and as a former M V P  he s more of a Comeback Player of the Year than a Most Improved candidate  The N B A  s specific instructions in this category read as follows   This award is designed to honor an up and coming player who has made a dramatic improvement from the previous season or seasons  It is not intended to be given to a player who has made a  comeback    Siakam  in other words  is perfect  He s a former No  27 overall pick who zoomed from role player to foundational player   either beside Leonard or in a post Kawhi world should Leonard flee Canada in free agency this summer Defensive Player of the Year  Rudy Gobert  Utah Jazz Antetokounmpo is a leading candidate here  too  as is Oklahoma City s Paul George and Indiana s Myles Turner  But the Bucks  at least on this mythical ballot  will have to settle for two of the six top prizes Three would have been too many  Especially since Utah s Gobert remains such a dominant deterrent at the rim in his role as the anchor for a defense that officially ranks No  2 but is essentially on par with Milwaukee s The Scoop  TheSteinLine Marc Stein s newsletter will have the latest on the N B A  playoffs  which start Saturday  Sign up here  Corner ThreeImageGolden State s Kevin Durant  35  and Stephen Curry are two of the best players in the league  But who is the best for the Warriors CreditTony Avelar Associated PressYou ask  I answer  Every week in this space  I ll field three questions posed via email at marcstein newsletter nytimes com   Please include your first and last name  as well as the city you re writing in from  and make sure the subject line reads  Corner Three   Q  Deandre Ayton hasn t had a terrible rookie year  but it has paled in comparison to what we ve seen from Luka Doncic and Trae Young  What do you think Ayton needs to improve on   and will he ever match Luka or Trae s potential    Henry Roth  Scottsdale  Ariz  STEIN  It speaks to how far the Suns have faded from prominence that Ayton  as the No  1 overall pick last June  got so little attention given the numbers he posted  16 3 points and 10 3 rebounds per game  The leaguewide fascination with Doncic and Young is also a factor  as you mentioned  but Ayton was overlooked in the extreme this season  Suns fans should be hoping that the snub helps motivate Ayton in Year 2  because consistency and sustained energy have been issues for him so far From a technical standpoint  Ayton has to develop into more of a rim protector  With his mobility and athleticism  Phoenix should be able to build a defense around him  He s not close to elite yet at that end But it would also be unfair to ignore that Ayton was frequently forced to start alongside two other rookies on a squad that still doesn t have a starter level N B A  point guard Q  Dirk Nowitzki hasn t come out and said he is retiring  but everyone else seems to be saying it  At first I didn t believe Adam Silver would have put Dirk in the All Star Game if he didn t have it on good authority that Dirk would soon retire  but could this actually not be his final year  It looks like Dirk s ankle has finally recovered from surgery and he s moving a lot better  Why not play one more season with Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis and try to go out with a playoff berth    Sharad AcharyaSTEIN  This much I can tell you  Dirk joining Dwyane Wade in the All Star Game as a so called  commissioner s pick  has nothing to do with Nowitzki s retirement plans  As Dirk stated before  during and after his trip to Charlotte  this was his All Star swan song no matter what  even if he decided to play next season I think there have been times since the All Star break when an encouraged Nowitzki has imagined himself carrying on  He s been a huge Porzingis fan for years and would naturally love to experience the Doncic Porzingis tandem  But the reality is that season No  21 has been a bigger challenge physically than he ever imagined Is it really worth putting his body through the rigors of yet another nine month ride  The case against coming back is much stronger than the case for it  which is why you ve heard the likes of Mark Cuban and Steve Nash give interviews in recent days that make it sound as though the end is near Q  I d like to hear your thoughts on how Stephen Curry makes everyone else on the floor better and how that may not necessarily be the case with Kevin Durant    Michael DortheimerSTEIN  Anyone who believes this must not have watched the last two N B A  finals Steph is Golden State s No  1 playmaker and a true revolutionary when it comes to the way his seemingly limitless shooting range bends defenses But there s a reason Durant has won back to back M V P  trophies in the finals  He s the best finisher in the game and was the best player on the floor on the game s grandest stage two years in a row The Warriors are 32 6 in the playoffs since Durant arrived  Who would dare say he doesn t make all of the other Warriors better just by being out there Curry has the ball in his hands more  which surely fuels the perception you describe  but Durant commands more double teams than any other Warrior and is a great passer both out of the post and in pick and roll situations  There is no shortage of coaches and scouts around the league who regard him as an elite playmaker Numbers GameImageUtah s Rudy Gobert has dunked 301 times this season  more than anyone else CreditRick Bowmer Associated Press5This is the fifth time in the Knicks  73 season history that they ve had the league s worst record  The first three times  there were fewer than 10 teams

86 at 23 59  At 16 64 so far this season  the Knicks will post the lowest win total in franchise history unless they win at least one of their final two games  301Utah s Rudy Gobert is poised to finish this season with more dunks than anyone else  with 301 dunks to Antetokounmpo s 279 for Milwaukee  Gobert  though  has played in all 80 of Utah s games this season  Antetokounmpo has missed 12 of the Bucks  81 games to date  17Antetokounmpo s Bucks finished 18th in defensive rating last season  They ve climbed 17 spots this season to rank No  1 overall entering Tuesday s play  allowing 104

Across the decade that preceded Donald Trump s election  American politicians of both parties consistently tried to pass big  sweeping immigration bills that would legalize most of the country s illegal population and increase immigration overall  These bills failed because of populist opposition  at first bipartisan  the resistance of a certain socialist senator from Vermont helped doom the 2007 effort  but increasingly simply conservative  and over time the conservative opposition developed a well founded suspicion of Republican elites  whose plans on immigration always seemed to require ignoring their own base This sense of betrayal was fertile ground for Trump  who used bigotry and bluster to sell himself to immigration hawks as a Republican who wouldn t  indeed couldn t  sell them out  You could trust him more than the Bushes and Rubios because he was willing to be disreputable  willing to give the finger to elite opinion  willing to play not only the tough guy but the bad guy  And you had to trust him  some hawks argued  because the Democrats had been radicalized on the issue and the hour was late  it was either Trump or a Californian future  in which waves of immigration transformed the entire United States into a one party  Democratic governed state But the irony was that the populist resistance had already itself been reasonably effective in achieving some of the goals that Trump promised to pursue  Over the years when bipartisan elites were seeking the grail of  comprehensive  reform  they tried to appease skeptics with various forms of border security spending  and this spending really did gradually harden the United States Mexico border and make it much more difficult to simply slip across  Combine this with economic and demographic change in Latin America  and by the time Trump took office  border crossings had fallen by two thirds since the presidency of George W  Bush In this sense Trump was a lagging  not a leading  indicator  He represented the political triumph of an attitude that had already changed policy  albeit in piecemeal and only half intentionally  and partially sealed the porous borders of 15 years before  And his chief proposal  the famous wall  would have been a  literal  extension of the existing border security project rather than a radical addition  Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  This reality created an interesting opening  especially in Trump s first year  for a different kind of comprehensive deal  between restrictionists feeling a little more secure in their position and immigration advocates feeling chastened by populist backlash  And there was even some evidence that the White House might be groping in this direction   toward reforms that would seek stability more than radical change  tilting the entire system away from low skilled immigration and toward recruitment  and compromising between restrictionists and enthusiasts by trying to keep the overall immigration rate about the same But that possibility has evaporated because of the second irony of immigration in the Trump era  Having inherited a border situation that was somewhat better than his rhetoric of crisis suggested  Trump has now been handed an actual crisis   a wave of Central American families claiming asylum  which has returned monthly crossings to their highest levels in a decade and overwhelmed the system for handling new arrivals There is a sense in which this crisis vindicates immigration hawks  who warned from the late Obama era onward that the immigration decline wasn t necessarily permanent  that there could easily be another wave  that United States policy   particularly the Obama precedent of a tacit amnesty for child migrants   created specific incentives for families and children to come north But those same hawks ended up electing a president whose signature immigration policy  more walls to deter border crossers  has proved largely ineffective in dealing with an immigration crisis created by people surrendering to Border Patrol officers and asking for asylum Nor does that president have the capacity to devise a more effective response  it seems  since any policy solution would require two negotiations  First  negotiation with Congress  to change asylum law to override the court decisions currently tying up the Trump White House s attempts at deterrence   like the attempt to make Central American asylum petitioners wait out the process in Mexico  Second  negotiation with the Mexican government  to get more help discouraging migration on its side of the border  For a different president these tasks would be challenging  for Trump  they seem impossible Hence the flailing on display this week  with the president purging his entire Homeland Security apparatus  in the hopes of finding somebody with the requisite toughness to succeed where the present staff has failed  Since  toughness  apparently means one of two things   returning to the cruelty of child separation or ordering Border Patrol agents to simply ignore asylum law themselves   it s doubtful that this purge will produce anything except more unpopularity for Trump s policies  and more unsuccessful collisions with the courts The flailing also absolves the Democratic Party  currently torn between radicalism and evasion on immigration  from actually having to propose a coherent alternative to the White House s approach  If this sort of crisis were happening on President Hillary Clinton s watch  it would create all kinds of political problems for the Democrats  as it stands  they can point at the man who once boasted of Washington that  I alone can fix it  and say  well  why don t you There is still some political peril here for liberals  who may be inclined to confuse the public s distaste for Trump with a consensus for an open door  though that Vermont socialist is still willing to swat down calls for open borders   But the greater peril by far is for conservative immigration skeptics  for whom the Trump presidency is at risk of turning into a policy disaster The attempts to increase deportation have been real enough  but they will be evanescent should Trump lose in 2020  The attempt to legislate sustained legal immigration cuts has conspicuously failed  Someone in the administration is making deals behind the scenes to increase visas for low skilled guest workers   one of the policies that hawks resisted for years in  comprehensive  bills  And the longer the current border crisis goes on  the more this White House s most important legacy may be offering evidence that even Donald Trump  even Donald Trump  can t really stop illegal immigration when enough people get the idea to bring their kids and come For every conservative faction  supporting Trump was a gamble   do you reach for short term victory  even though his incompetence and unfitness might cost you in the long run  The danger for immigration hawks is that the long run has already arrived trump and immigrationTrump Says the U S  Is  Full   Much of the Nation Has the Opposite Problem

PARIS BERLIN BRUSSELS   European Union leaders will grant Prime Minister Theresa May a second delay to Brexit but they could demand she accepts a much longer extension as France pushed for conditions to limit Britain s ability to undermine the bloc A  flextension  until the end of the year or until March 2020  under which Britain could leave much sooner if its warring political tribes can find a majority  was shaping up to be the most likely  EU diplomats said  after envoys met in Brussels late on Tuesday to prepare for Wednesday evening s summit with May In a sign of just how far the three year Brexit crisis has sapped British power  May dashed to Berlin and Paris to ask Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron to allow the world s fifth largest economy to put off its divorce from April 12 While it was not immediately clear what Merkel and Macron  Europe s two most powerful leaders  agreed with May  an advance draft of conclusions for Wednesday s emergency EU summit said Britain would be granted another delay on certain conditions  The United Kingdom shall facilitate the achievement of the Union s tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardize the attainment of the Union s objectives   read the draft seen by Reuters  As a full member state of the EU  Britain could in theory exercise a veto on any major policy decision May has asked the EU for a Brexit delay to June 30 but the draft left the end date blank pending a decision by the other 27 national leaders on Wednesday evening in Brussels More than a week after Britain was originally supposed to leave the EU  May  the weakest British prime minister in a generation  has said she fears Brexit might never happen as she battles to get a divorce deal ratified by a divided parliament After her pledge to resign failed to get her deal over the line  she launched crisis talks with the opposition Labour Party in the hope of breaking the domestic deadlock   People are tired and fed up  with Britain s indecision    but what to do   one EU diplomat said   We won t be the ones pushing the UK off the cliff edge  HOW LONG Another EU official involved with Brexit said no European power wanted the chaos that they fear a  no deal  exit would sow through financial markets and the EU 27 s  16 trillion economy  Nobody wants to pull the plug by 13th April   said the official   But for how long   I don t know  And France will ask a lot of questions in Brussels  But as May arrived at the Elysee Palace in Paris to a guard of honor  she was unable to trumpet any breakthrough with Labour Shortly before she landed in Paris  an official in Macron s office said that  in the scenario of an extended delay  one year would seem too long for us  He added that if Britain did delay its exit  it should not take part in EU budget talks or in choosing the next president of the EU s executive commission   and that the other 27 member states should be able to review its  sincere cooperation  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Macron would not veto May s extension but wanted conditions attached  He  Macron  certainly wants to know about conditionality  particularly the issue of the United Kingdom being involved in future  EU  decision making   Varadkar said   STOP BREXIT Earlier in the day  May met Merkel at her riverside Chancellery  a short walk from Berlin s Brandenburg Gate  and departed with a warm exchange of kisses While they discussed Brexit  Germany s opposition liberal FDP party drove an advertising van past the Chancellery with a slogan reading   Dear Theresa May  Just do it  Stop Brexit  Make the most of Europe s opportunities  Several EU diplomats said the 12 month extension proposed by European Council President Donald Tusk  who will chair the Wednesday summit  was unlikely to fly and several capitals had agreed with France that this would be too long  fearing a protracted distraction from other pressing EU business In London  British Solicitor General Robert Buckland said May would  listen carefully  to any constructive suggestions made by the EU on the length of the extension  He conceded that the government might not have managed to ratify an exit deal in parliament before European elections are held on May 23 26 According to the draft conclusions  if Britain did not take part in EU parliamentary elections properly  it would have to leave on June 1  2019  The pound  which has seesawed so much on Brexit news that some investors have stepped away from the sterling market  rose and then dipped on speculation Merkel could offer May a better deal  Germany denied that   GBP  DIVIDED KINGDOMThe 2016 referendum revealed a United Kingdom split over much more than EU membership  and has sparked impassioned debate about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism  empire and what it means to be British Yet nothing is yet resolved Unable to convince enough of her own Conservatives of the merits of her deal to get it passed  May is courting socialist Jeremy Corbyn  whose Labour Party wants to keep Britain more closely tied to the bloc after Brexit Labour s demands include keeping Britain in a customs union with the EU  something that is hard to reconcile with May s desire for Britain to have an independent trade policy  and potentially a second referendum on any deal  After Tuesday s round of talks  Labour said it had not yet seen a clear shift in May s stance  We had further detailed and wide ranging talks with cabinet ministers and officials today   a Labour representative said   We have yet to see the clear shift in the government s position that is needed to secure a compromise agreement  A customs union with the EU  seen as the most likely area for compromise but so far resisted by May s government  was the first item on the agenda for the talks  which were to include finance minister Philip Hammond  Talks resume on Thursday The idea of a softer Brexit is anathema to euroskeptics in May s Conservative party who have helped to defeat her divorce deal three times this year  Meanwhile  British lawmakers on Tuesday approved by a 420 110 margin May s plan to seek to delay Brexit to June 30 while she tries to strike a compromise with Labour The government was forced to hold the vote after parliament passed a law on Monday giving themselves power to scrutinize and make changes to May s request to extend the Article 50 negotiating period a second time   Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan  William James  Elizabeth Piper and Costas Pitas in London  Gabriela Baczynska in Luxembourg  Alastair Macdonald

Since March 31  the defeat in Turkey of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s Islamic conservative Justice and Development Party  the A K P   and its ultranationalist electoral partner Nationalist Movement Party  the M H P   in municipal elections in Ankara  Istanbul and several others cities has led to premature commentary that Turkey is on the verge of change By wresting control of mayoral positions in Ankara and Istanbul  which were held by Mr  Erdogan s party for 25 years  the opposition coalition has shown that Mr  Erdogan is not invincible But it is no victory for liberal values  The opposition coalition of the Republican People s Party  the C H P   and its electoral partner  the Good Party   an offshoot of Mr  Erdogan s ultranationalist partner   is simply another version of the right wing nationalism of the ruling coalition of the A K P  and the M H P The C H P   which is officially a social democratic party  has endorsed the imprisonments of elected Kurdish politicians and nominated ultranationalists  among them Mansur Yavas  the mayor elect in Ankara  the national capital  Kemal Kilicdaroglu  the C H P  leader  has said that he  loves  the ultraright nationalists  He has also said that the left right divide has become irrelevant and that it was a mistake by the left in the past to focus on income redistribution The C H P  formed an alliance with the Good Party  whose leader Meral Aksener as interior minister in the 1990s oversaw a dirty counterinsurgency war against the Kurds  She has not offered any evidence that her views have become more moderate since  Both the M H P  and the Good Party are intensely opposed to changing Turkey s oppressive practices toward the Kurds Fundamentally  Turkey s democratic evolution has been hampered by the absence of a democratic leftist alternative  The authoritarian right has held sway since the Turkish republic was founded in 1923  The historical record shows us   Sweden a century ago or Spain  Greece and Portugal in the 1970s   that a strong democratic left is crucial for democratization The Turkish state has been consistently ruthless in its oppression of the left  In 1921  Mustafa Kemal  Ataturk  had all 15 members of the leadership of the Turkish Communist Party killed  fearing a leftist challenge to his power  He banned trade unions and imprisoned leftist intellectuals of all stripes Mr  Erdogan has carried on Mr  Ataturk s legacy by maintaining a labor hostile order  The A K P  government has banned strikes of nearly 200 000 workers  Twenty two thousand workers have lost their lives in workplace accidents since the A K P  came to power Turkey s democratic travails have conventionally been explained through the supposed clash between Islam and secularism  Turkish democracy is generally   and inadequately   understood to have been undermined by the military allegedly staging coups to protect secularism and  in recent years  by the Islamist ambitions of Mr  Erdogan In fact  the history of Turkey has been shaped by class politics that are obscured by a misleading narrative that pits Islamization against secularism  Closer inspection reveals that Turkey s secularists and Islamists represent the two shades of the same right wing ideology  which includes a commitment to unrestrained capitalism  hostility to labor  conservatism and nationalism Mr  Ataturk s secular reforms laid the foundations of a modern capitalist society  but for his successors it has made sense to use Islam to protect capitalism  With the onset of the Cold War  Turkey s ruling  ostensibly secular elite opted for Islamization to check leftist politics  and religious education was reintroduced in 1946 The rise of socialist student and labor movements in the 1960s and of a democratic left in the 1970s prompted the military to step in to crush the left  Gen  Kenan Evren  who took power in 1980 after a coup  called upon the people to  firmly embrace our religion  to ward off the threat of socialism  His junta made religious education mandatory  opened new religious schools and continued to populate the state bureaucracy with members of religious fraternities  who were reliable anti socialists The military junta also imposed a neoliberal order that the business class had been calling for  it banned trade unions and incarcerated their leaders and activists  together with hundreds of thousands of other leftists Mr  Erdogan rose to power promising to serve the same capitalist interests  He embraced the neoliberal economics of the generals and was endorsed by the secular  westernized business barons who did not mind his religious conservatism The Islamic conservatives recast the class conflict as a cultural conflict between the people and the elite  They won by championing the religious culture of the masses  but privileged the interests of the economic elite after coming to power  Mr  Erdogan s populism notwithstanding  income inequalities have grown under Mr  Erdogan  The richest 1 percent of the population has increased its share of the national wealth by 43 percent  putting it in possession of 54 percent of the country s wealth Conservatives   secular or Islamic   have won every Turkish election since 1950 except once  That exception was in 1977  when the democratic left led by Bulent Ecevit  a progressive populist who called for social justice and respected popular religiosity  won over 40 percent of the votes  Mr  Ecevit s call for social justice alarmed the business elite and the military that feared that a Communist revolution was in the making The present regime in Turkey has its ideological roots in the right wing coalition of the 1970s  when the secular conservatives  ultranationalists and Islamists came together to defeat the ascendant left  This was when Mr  Erdogan began his political career in the Islamist National Salvation Party The paramilitary gangs of the ultranationalist M H P  abetted by the security forces killed thousands of leftist supporters  students  intellectuals and labor activists between 1975 and 1980  Last month  President Erdogan paid tribute to this heritage when he ordered a university in the city of Adana renamed after Alparslan Turkes  the founding leader of the M H P   who led the bloody campaign against the left in the 1970s Mr  Kilicdaroglu  the C H P  leader  endorsed this decision  a stunning step considering that the right wing death squads commanded by Mr  Turkes had attempted to kill Bulent Ecevit  the democratic leftist C H P  leader  in the 1970s But Turkish social democrats have simply never recovered from the devastating blow of the 1980 coup to challenge right wing ideology  instead  they have concluded that they must shift to the right to appeal to the people If the democratic left had not been crushed  Turkey would most likely have followed the same democratic path as Greece  Spain and Portugal  Turkish social democrats today would do well to revisit the example of the 1970s  They need to speak for social justice and freedom  instead of aligning with right wing nationalism  if they want to make a difference RelatedOpinion   Selim

The 2020 United States presidential campaign is already in full swing in Latin America  Four hot button issues that helped propel President Trump to the White House in 2016 are already coming into play in his approach with the region  and they are being driven by two parallel electoral strategies  appeals to his political base nationwide on immigration  drugs and trade  and a hard sell directed at South Florida on Cuba and Venezuela Since he announced his candidacy in 2015  Mr  Trump has treated Mexico as a proxy and scapegoat  particularly on immigration and trade  two issues on which he promised a radical policy shift  Calls to build  the wall  on the United States Mexico border became shorthand for a tough  aggressive stance on these issues that reliably rallies and excites Mr  Trump s hard core supporters But closing down the border  as the president threatened to do recently  would hurt both countries and cause irreparable damage to what is arguably the United States  most crucial relationship  On Thursday  under pressure from Republicans in Congress  he backed off that threat  only to issue another one   We re going to give them a one year warning  and if the drugs don t stop or largely stop  we re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products  particularly cars  Until now  President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador of Mexico has done a great deal to accommodate Mr  Trump  including working out an updated Nafta agreement and allowing Central American refugees to remain in Mexico while their asylum claims are being adjudicated  The move to close the border will test the limits of Mr  Lpez Obrador s forbearance  On March 29  the Mexican foreign minister  Marcelo Ebrard  said on Twitter   Mexico does not act on the basis of threats  We are a great neighbor  Perhaps just as outrageous  Mr  Trump also announced that he would cut aid to the three countries of Central America s so called  Northern Triangle    Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras   citing their failure to curb the continuing mass outflow of migrants headed for the United States  This move has led some to speculate that Mr  Trump is seeking to deepen the crises in these countries  which could result in exploding migration flows and that could pose a  real  national security crisis on the United States Mexico border  thus justifying the president s hard line policies and providing a powerful campaign issue It remains to be seen whether Mr  Trump even has the authority to cut off congressionally appropriated funding  or if he ll follow through on these threats  But the announcement understandably left the governments of Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador bewildered  having done everything to accommodate the United States  The Guatemalan and Honduran governments sought to curry favor with the Trump administration by moving  or considering moving  their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem  Mr  Trump s announcement is particularly insulting to El Salvador s incoming president  Nayib Bukele  On a recent visit to Washington  Mr  Bukele unveiled a much tougher policy on Venezuela and pledged to review the outgoing government s decision to break with Taiwan and recognize China   both diplomatic wins for the Trump administration  Moreover  there is evidence that United States assistance is helping reduce migration from El Salvador On the drug question  too  the president is posturing to shore up his political base for the campaign  The Colombian president  Ivan Duque  recently met with Mr  Trump and vowed to pursue a United States backed strategy to bring down rising levels of coca production  But that wasn t enough  Mr  Duque was reportedly taken aback when Mr  Trump told reporters   he  Duque  said how he was going to stop drugs  More drugs are coming out of Colombia right now than before he was president   so he has done nothing for us   The title of an article that ran in the Colombian weekly magazine  Semana  was telling   With Friends Like These  The Colombian president deserves better treatment  Mr  Duque has been the Trump administration s most steadfast regional partner in pressuring the regime in neighboring Venezuela  His government is struggling to cope with over 1 3 million Venezuelans who have fled to Colombia  As the United States presidential campaign picks up steam  United States Colombia ties are in danger of becoming  re narcotized   which would undermine efforts in recent years to broaden the bilateral agenda The Trump administration s approach toward Venezuela and Cuba should be distinguished from issues of nationwide concern such as immigration  drugs  and trade  Still  there is little question that domestic politics  largely focused on South Florida  is a key element helping to shape policy  More ideological factors  advanced less by Mr  Trump himself and more by his national security adviser  John Bolton  and Marco Rubio  the Florida senator  are also relevant  The Trump administration s sustained pressure on the Venezuelan dictatorship  carried out in concert with hemispheric and European allies  has rightly provided badly needed support for a democratic transition to a beleaguered Venezuela  But the United States  agenda in Venezuela is tightly linked to the administration s pursuit of regime change in Cuba  as Mr  Bolton has repeatedly made clear  Though in Latin America there is no love lost for the Cuban regime  the region is more cautious about Cuba than Venezuela  Most Latin Americans consider the past six decades of United States policy toward Cuba  aside from the two year opening under Obama  to be a failure and strongly oppose any new threats and punishments To be sure  infelicitous phrases by Mr  Trump and other senior administration officials like   All options are on the table   and   I wish Nicols Maduro and his top advisers a long  quiet retirement  living on a nice beach somewhere   may draw cheers  help deliver votes  and generate money in a critical swing state in 2020  But they also evoke possible military action and  as a result  risk weakening or dividing the broad coalition that has been forged on Venezuela  To preserve this coalition   a major asset for the United States  Venezuela policy   the Trump administration needs to keep its posturing for electoral purposes in check  Invoking the  socialism  boogeyman in Venezuela as a way to attack the Democratic Party for its health care and New Green Deal proposals shows how the hemisphere s worst crisis could be used in the presidential campaign It would be nave to call for a moratorium on theatrics as November 2020 looms  Playing on domestic politics with Latin American issues may work for President Trump as he pursues a second term  Still  it is crucial not to completely lose sight of the national interest  which means investing wisely in Central America and cooperating closely with Mexico  Mr  Trump needs to stick with the broad coalition on Venezuela  eschew any suggestion of military action there and any reference to regime change in Cuba  These issues should command bipartisan support  If not handled well  they could have consequences for the United States policy in the region for decades to come  RelatedOpinion   Someone Is Always Trying to Kill You April 5  2019Trump Wants to Cut Aid to Central America  Here Are Some of the Dozens of U S  Funded

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Monday that he was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization  the first time that the United States has named part of another nation s government as that type of official threat The designation imposes wide ranging economic and travel sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as well as organizations  companies and individuals with ties to it  Iran s Revolutionary Guards carry out operations across the Middle East  train Arab Shiite militias and oversee businesses in Iran Monday s designation  will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime   Mr  Trump said in a statement The designation was opposed by some top Trump administration national security officials who said it could incite retaliation by Tehran against American troops and intelligence officers  It takes effect April 15  but was announced Monday in what American officials described as a chaotic and rushed process In Baghdad  where some Iraqi officials have close ties to Iran  American officials said they had been given no guidance on how to enforce the policy The timing of Mr  Trump s announcement appeared aimed at giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel a final boost in a tight re election campaign before a vote on Tuesday  Mr  Netanyahu and Trump administration officials have said Iran is the greatest threat to Israel  and Mr  Netanyahu immediately thanked Mr  Trump in a Twitter post Mr  Netanyahu has repeatedly raised the specter of the Iranian threat to Israel and tried to reinforce the notion that his close ties to Mr  Trump strengthen Israeli security In thanking Mr  Trump on Twitter  Mr  Netanyahu took credit for the idea of the terrorism designation   Once again you are keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism   Mr  Netanyahu wrote in English  while writing in a separate tweet in Hebrew   Thank you for accepting another important request of mine  Last month  in an effort to bolster Mr  Netanyahu  Mr  Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  the United Nations considers it occupied territory After Mr  Trump s announcement  Iran s Supreme National Security Council said it was designating as a terrorist organization the United States Central Command  which oversees American military operations in the Middle East Iraqi leaders had no immediate reaction  although Karim al Nuri  a senior figure in the Badr Organization  an influential Iraqi Shiite militia  said there may not be much direct effect  But it will put more pressure on Iraq  from Tehran to grow closer to Iran  he said Some American officials said the broad designation potentially covers 11 million members of the Iranian group and affiliated organizations  including the large Basij volunteer militia In its statement about the new designation  the State Department sharply criticized the Quds Force  an elite unit of the Revolutionary Guards led by Qassim Suleimani  That unit and Mr  Suleimani are already under sanctions from lesser terrorism designations Top American intelligence and military officials  including Gen  Joseph F  Dunford Jr   the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  opposed Mr  Trump s action  which they argued would allow Iranian leaders to justify operations against Americans overseas  especially Special Operations units and paramilitary units working under the C I A But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R  Bolton  the national security adviser  pushed for it  a Trump administration official said  The fighting among the senior administration officials intensified after The New York Times disclosed the pending designation last month VideoSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would designate Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization  This is the first time that the United States has labeled a part of another nation s government a foreign terrorist group CreditCreditSaul Loeb Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe final decision belonged to Mr  Pompeo because the State Department controls the list of designated terrorist organizations At the height of the Iraq war in the mid 2000s  Iranian military officials and partners helped train Iraqi Shiite militias to fight American troops  The Defense Department says at least 603 American personnel were killed in Iraq by Iran backed fighters   17 percent of all Americans killed in hostile action there When the Islamic State  a radical Sunni group  took over large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014  the Quds Force helped train Iraqi Shiite militias to retake the territory  The American military also took part in the campaign  meaning the Americans and Iranians were on the same side Many Iraqi officials are opposed to the new terrorist designation  as it could impose travel limits and economic sanctions on some lawmakers in the Shiite led government and other Iraqis who have ties to Iranian officials The new pressure from the Americans also could fuel a popular proposal among Iraqi lawmakers to limit the movements and actions of some 5 000 American troops based in Iraq In recent days  State Department officials had asked Mr  Pompeo to delay any announcement  arguing that the designation could have unintended consequences for unrelated countries  a government official said  But Mr  Pompeo dismissed their concerns Under a provision of the USA Patriot Act  low level officials are empowered to deny entry to foreigners who are associated with an organization that the officials decide meet broad standards for terrorism   even when the United States government has not formally applied a terrorism label to that group Until now  American officials had never interpreted laws as permitting them to deem a government entity a terrorist organization The Trump administration s decision to breach that constraint with the Iranian group raises the question of whether other government intelligence services that use violence   including those of Israel  Pakistan and Russia   also now meet that standard  If so  should American officials deny visas to people who work with those agencies  State Department officials say the rushed announcement meant such policy details have not been worked out The George W  Bush administration considered a range of tough actions on Iran during the Iraq war  but held back  The potential blowback vastly outweighs the benefits   said Jeffrey Prescott  a senior Middle East director under President Barack Obama Wendy R  Sherman  a former top State Department official  said the Obama administration considered designating the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization  but decided against it because there would be no practical payoff given the risks to Americans and the fact the group was already under other sanctions  By designating a foreign military as a foreign terrorist organization  we were putting our troops at risk  particularly our troops in Iraq  next door to Iran   she said The Revolutionary Guards oversaw the previous Iranian nuclear program  and some of the top officers were placed under United States and United Nations sanctions The Obama administration entered into a nuclear deal with Tehran and world powers in 2015  Mr  Trump withdrew the United States from that agreement last year in the start of a crackdown against Iran There are signs that Trump era sanctions on Iran are undermining its budget for foreign military activities  meaning less money for Hezbollah and other Iranian allies  The new terrorism designation could expand on this by further undermining the Revolutionary Guards  finances  

WASHINGTON   The House Democratic campaign arm is nearing open warfare with the party s rising liberal wing as political operatives close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to shut down primary challenges before what is likely to be a hard fought campaign next year to preserve the party s shaky majority Progressive Democrats were infuriated last month when Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois  the chairwoman of the campaign arm  the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  moved to protect centrist incumbents by formally breaking committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who go to work for primary challengers Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  Democrat of New York  who owes her seat to a successful primary challenge  went so far as to encourage her 3 8 million Twitter followers to  pause  their donations to the campaign committee in protest  She also started a fund raising push on her official Twitter account for Representatives Jahana Hayes of Connecticut  Katie Hill of California and Mike Levin of California  That initiative  Ms  Ocasio Cortez said on Twitter  raised  30 000 in roughly two hours  She also helped raise money for Representatives Katie Porter of California and Lauren Underwood of Illinois The open hostilities are just the latest in the rising tensions between an experienced party establishment focusing on what is possible in the short run and a group of young liberals chafing at such restraint  House Democrats have divided over single payer  Medicare for all  versus incremental legislation to bolster the Affordable Care Act and over Ms  Ocasio Cortez s Green New Deal versus less ambitious climate change policies  Liberal Democrats and more moderate newcomers from Republican leaning districts have fought over Republican procedural motions And divisions on health care  climate change  military spending and tax policy convinced the House Budget Committee chairman  John Yarmuth of Kentucky  last week to give up on drafting a budget that would have laid down a broad legislative agenda for the new Democrat controlled House Now that tension has migrated to the mechanics of the 2020 campaign Ms  Bustos s rule prohibits Democratic consultants and vendors working for a primary challenger to an incumbent from receiving work from the committee  It comes as ardent liberal organizations like Justice Democrats  emboldened by a pair of high profile wins in 2018   Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ms  Ocasio Cortez   are aggressively gearing up to challenge centrist or old line Democrats with liberal candidates In the latest swipe in a fight that has erupted into open hostilities  a coalition of progressive groups on Friday introduced an online database of go to vendors for insurgent candidates emblazoned with the heading   Despite the D C C C  s bullying  we re still going to work on primaries  One group  the Progressive Change Campaign Committee  said Friday that it was exploring a challenge against Representative Richard E  Neal of Massachusetts  the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee  because he has not committed to holding hearings on the single payer health care system known as  Medicare for all   At the helm of that panel  Mr  Neal has been on the front lines of conducting oversight on President Trump s finances  and last week requested six years of his personal tax returns  We reject the D C C C  s attempt to hoard power  which will only serve to keep that talent pool   and Congress itself   disproportionately white and male   Mara Urbina  the national political director for Indivisible  a progressive grass roots group  said of the campaign committee   Incumbents who engage fully with their constituents shouldn t fear primaries and shouldn t rely on the national institutions like the D C C C  to suppress challenges before voters ever have a say  Party leaders and the campaign arm have stood by Ms  Bustos s moves  arguing that the committee s mandate is to protect the new majority by protecting incumbents   and that putting a longstanding rule in writing simply increases transparency  Primary challenges  even in solid Democratic districts  harm the mission of holding the majority  they argue  because incumbents fighting a primary challenge cannot raise money and help other Democrats in more marginal districts  I support the notion that the primary purpose of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is to elect Democrats in tough districts  so we can either win the majority or hold the majority   said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York  the No  4 Democrat A spokesman for the committee said that Ms  Bustos  who hails from a Midwestern district that voted for Mr  Trump in 2016  was fulfilling a campaign promise she made to Democrats that as the chairwoman  she would support incumbents  And some at the campaign arm are frustrated that the codification of the longstanding policy has received more attention than the enforcement of a new rule that requires vendors to meet certain diversity standards  including employing more racially diverse  veteran  lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender or disabled staff The new policy is unlikely to change  But the ire from the left flank may only grow  Primaries are often the only way that underrepresented and working class people are able to have a shot at pursuing elected office   Ms  Ocasio Cortez said   I think that it can reduce the odds of us getting really strong representation  We need to have kind of a farm system for the next generation  Other House Democrats  such as Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin  a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus  are taking a cooler tone  But on Thursday  he could not resist a jab at Ms  Bustos on the radio program  The Bill Press Show   We were trying to keep this in the family  but unfortunately this morning  I saw Cheri Bustos  after she asked us not to do it publicly  came out and decided to talk about it   he said   The progressive caucus doesn t go out and recruit people to run against incumbents  but I think it looks awful for the Democratic Party to be undemocratic   It s the wrong path for us to be taking   he continued   This was a misguided action  and rather than review it  she s trying to double down on it  The decision has pleased moderates and veterans in the more centrist New Democrat Coalition  in the Blue Dog Coalition  a fiscally conservative group of Democrats  and in the Congressional Black Caucus  who have been angered by some of the incumbents that outside liberal groups have chosen to target  Many of the candidates wooed in the last campaign cycle by Justice Democrats would have run in districts that lean Republican  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had to work hard to beat those challenges back  worried that a triumph by Justice Democrats in the primary would have cost the party a possible victory in the general election Defending the campaign arm s decision  Representative James E  Clyburn of South Carolina  the majority whip  recalled a past primary against Representative Bennie Thompson  Democrat of Mississippi  An African American got in the race against him running to his right and then he looked up and there was this Democratic pollster working for his opponent   Mr  Clyburn told National Journal   He s paying dues to the D C C C   who s giving a contract to that person and then that person ended up working for that opponent  There s something wrong with that

WARSAW   Growing up in a small city in southern Poland  part of a religious family and conservative community  Maciej Gosniowski was told again and again that something was wrong with him  It would be better if I changed myself   he recalled teachers telling him   It would be better if I behaved more like a boy  It would make my life easier  Mr  Gosniowski was beaten by other students who used homophobic slurs he did not yet understand  He does not want other young people to suffer as he did  so he welcomed the decision by the mayor of Warsaw to introduce a declaration last month aimed at promoting tolerance But the backlash to the declaration has left him shaken Poland s governing party  Law and Justice  has seized on the declaration and the issue of gay rights in its campaigning for European Union elections in May and for national elections this fall Where the party once attacked migrants as a threat to the soul of the country  gay people have become its public enemy No  1 in recent weeks ImageThe palace of Culture and Science  which hosts Warsaw s City Council  The mayor introduced a declaration last month aimed at promoting tolerance for the L G B T  community CreditAnna Liminowicz for The New York TimesIt is part of a growing trend across eastern and central Europe  where nationalist and populist parties are increasingly turning to cultural issues   and attacks on gay people   to rally their faithful From Romania  where the government tried and failed to change the Constitution to ban same sex marriage  to Hungary  where homosexuals are vilified as a threat to traditional families  the letters L G B T  are being scorned as part of a broader struggle against what the nationalists and populists call  European values  Jaroslaw Kaczynski  the leader of Law and Justice and the most powerful politician in Poland  used the party s convention in March to declare that this was a war Poland must win to survive  It comes down to  as we know today  sexualization of children from the earliest childhood   he said   We need to fight this  We need to defend the Polish family  We need to defend it furiously because it s a threat to civilization  not just for Poland but for the entire Europe  for the entire civilization that is based on Christianity  The party s rank and file have rallied to the call  I think that Poland will be a region free from L G B T    said Elzbieta Kruk  who is running on the party s list for a seat in the European Parliament   I hope it will be  Other groups have echoed the attacks  often in more extreme language Fans of one of the country s most popular soccer clubs  Legia Warsaw  unfurled a banner during a match last month that used a homophobic slur  No action was taken during the match  The club later said that it did not

 have also joined in The Rev  Marek Dziewiecki  a well known Catholic priest and educator  told a local radio station in a recent interview that the plus in  L G B T Q    stood for  pedophiles  zoophiles  necrophiles   and that the ultimate goal was to  make people into infertile erotomaniacs  When some 1 500 supporters of far right groups came to Czestochowa  Poland s holiest site  this month  the Rev  Henryk Grzadko warned those gathered that Poland was experiencing a  civilizational invasion   It comes down to them waving a rainbow flag and trying to steal our internal values like truth  love  human life  family based on marriage  and morality based on Gospel and Decalogue   he said during his homily at a Mass for the gathering Rafal Trzaskowski  the mayor of Warsaw  who issued the tolerance declaration  said that while he had expected a cynical response from the government  he worried about the sort of propaganda state outlets had produced It was the same kind of bile  he said  that led a man to fatally stab the mayor of Gdansk  Pawel Adamowicz  on live television this year ImagePro and anti L G B T  activists arguing about the Warsaw declaration during a City Council meeting CreditAnna Liminowicz for The New York Times They are basing their policy on fear   he said in an interview at his City Hall office   They started a few years back with refugees when they painted this abysmal picture that we are going to be overrun by hundreds of thousands of migrants that are going to rape our women and introduce diseases into Poland  They are now doing exactly the same thing  But he does not think it will work  In 2015  when Law and Justice came to power  an overwhelming majority of Poles agreed with the idea that more needed to be done to secure Europe s borders from migrants That threat has largely passed  and the issue does not have the resonance it once did  according to a poll released this week by the European Council on Foreign Relations  While migration is important for some voters  it is not the only battleground for votes ahead of the European Parliament elections   the group said in a statement Mr  Trzaskowski  the Warsaw mayor  said he did not believe attacking gay people would prove as effective as the campaign against migrants  The majority of the Polish people will not buy the idea that homosexuals endanger our culture or values   he said ImageHubert Sobecki  right  leads Love Does Not Exclude  a nonprofit that campaigns for the recognition of same sex marriage CreditAnna Liminowicz for The New York TimesAn openly gay candidate  Robert Biedron  formed a new liberal party and has found widespread support for his message  including outside urban centers A recent public opinion poll conducted by Ipsos for the news outlet OKO Press found that 56 percent of Poles did not oppose civil partnerships  two years ago  it was 52 percent At the same time  though  Poles remain steadfastly opposed to adoption by gay couples  with only 18 percent support Oktawiusz Chrzanowski  36  who played a key role in helping draft the Warsaw declaration  and his partner  Hubert Sobecki  said one of the most insidious parts of the government campaign was an effort to paint homosexuality as a danger to children  The most shocking and disgusting thing is how they can claim people in the L G B T  community are pedophiles   Mr  Sobecki said The Warsaw declaration calls for sex education in schools that follows guidelines set out by the World Health Organization  and for a shelter in the city for people cast out by their family and community ImageMr  Gosniowski  left  preparing costumes for a performance  He decided to come out not long after he was beaten in high school and works as one of only a handful of drag performers in Poland CreditAnna Liminowicz for The New York TimesMr  Chrzanowski said he hoped that one day soon all schools would have a  lighthouse keeper   someone students could turn to for advice without fear of judgment Mr  Gosniowski  who decided to come out not long after he was beaten in high school and works as one of only a handful of drag performers in the country  said he was now confident in his sexuality At lunch recently at a Warsaw cafe  he wore a pink sweatshirt and big gold hoop earrings under his long blond hair   a definite style statement in a country where nonconformity can still come at a cost Young people often ask him about coming out safely  I feel I am needed here   he said   People here are scared to walk hand in hand in the street  While the vitriol being directed at gays is alarming  he said  he has also noticed an outpouring of support that surprised him  The two wings of society seem to be spreading apart   he said   I have found more support than ever  But also people who are more hateful than ever   

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints said on Thursday that it would allow children of same sex couples to be baptized  a remarkable reversal of church policy from one of the religious groups that had long sought to be a bulwark against gay rights The decision rolled back a 2015 rule that had ripped congregations apart by declaring that church members in same sex marriages were apostates and subject to excommunication  and that children of same sex couples were banned from rituals like baptisms and baby naming ceremonies The change signals an attempt to heal the rift and represents a broader effort by the church s newest president to bring the church closer to the American mainstream The decision  delivered by President Dallin H  Oaks  stops short of ending the church s teaching that acting on same sex attraction is sinful  It comes as the church  which has long been known as the Mormon Church  prepares for its general conference for all members this coming weekend  While we cannot change the Lord s doctrine  we want our members and our policies to be considerate of those struggling with the challenges of mortality   the First Presidency  the church s highest governing body  said in a statement on Thursday   We want to reduce the hate and contention so common today The church will still consider same sex marriage  to be a serious transgression   the statement said  but  it will not be treated as apostasy for purposes of Church discipline   Instead   it added   the immoral conduct in heterosexual or homosexual relationships will be treated in the same way  The policy adopted in 2015 allowed children of same sex couples to join the church only after they reached the age of 18 and moved out of their parents  homes  They also had to disavow same sex relationships and receive approval from the church s leadership The new policy rolls back those restrictions  and requires that same sex parents give permission for their children to be baptized and acknowledge the commitments the child is making to the church Emotions among Latter day Saints across the country were raw as the news spread on Thursday  In Charlottesville  Va   Meredith Marshall Nelson was at her son s violin lesson when her brother texted her  She began to cry in relief  and recalled how the weekend that the 2015 policy was announced was the first time in her life that she did not want to go to church  It felt so incongruous with the teachings of Jesus   said Ms  Marshall Nelson  33  who is the editor of the Mormon Women Project  a storytelling outlet   He said   Let the children come unto me  and forbid them not   In Rexburg  Idaho  Kristine Anderson said she and her friends were overwhelmed   Everyone s freaking out   she said   There is anger  frustration  happiness  all of it mixed   Everything just broke  in 2015  said Ms  Anderson  who has three young children   I couldn t get out of bed for three days  I cried and cried  I couldn t even look at the church building  it hurt so much  Even though the policy is now history  she remains frustrated   There are so many people who disagreed with the policy the whole time  and we ve been looked at as apostates and heretics  because you are not supposed to disagree with the prophet   she said The decision came nearly eight months after Russell M  Nelson  the president of the church  said that he had received a revelation that the church should no longer be referred to as Mormon  but by its full name  Many observers saw it as a sign that the church aimed to align itself with mainstream American Christianity  On the one hand  the church is trying to figure out how to keep its younger members and how to be a large church in the 21st century   Amanda Hendrix Komoto  an assistant professor of history at Montana State University  said of this moment   But in other ways  it is also trying to retain its distinct identity  Churches across the Christian tradition have long wrestled with their own policies about the religious rights of lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people  and the tension has grown in recent months  The United Methodist Church voted in February to strengthen its ban against gay and lesbian clergy and same sex marriage  a decision poised to split the denomination  Roman Catholics have debated the role of homosexuality in the clergy sexual abuse scandal  ostracizing gay priests In Springville  Utah  Alma Loveland stopped going to her Latter day Saints church around the time that the 2015 policy was announced   In the ex Mormon world  it is always a mix of happy and angry any time the church does anything that is positive   she said   It is always mixed with  O K   but you caused this problem in the first place  It is too early to tell whether or not this reversal may be enough to draw back those to the church who have left the faith altogether  But it is another sign that the church under the leadership of President Nelson  who assumed the role last year  is reconsidering its relationship with the broader American culture While L G B T  advocacy groups  like the Human Rights Campaign  cautiously welcomed the news  they also noted that it was only a first step  Lisa Dame  vice president of Mama Dragons  a group started by Mormon mothers with L G B T  children  said that it  still does not go far enough to really protect the mental health of L G B T  people  because it sends a message that it is still not O K  Affirmation  a group that describes itself as for L G B T  Mormons  families and friends  issued a statement calling attention to  unresolved and hurtful issues surrounding transgender church members   The church teaches that gender and marriage are eternal  and that men and women are married to each other in heaven  For people who are queer  it is not quite clear how they could fit into that eternal heavenly family   Ms  Hendrix Komoto said Latter day Saints leaders have previously supported some gay rights issues  like ending housing and employment discrimination for L G B T  people in Utah  but they remain unmoved about same sex marriage  The church  and some of its wealthy donors and volunteers  notably pushed California to pass its Proposition 8 ballot initiative in 2008  which at the time made same sex marriage illegal in the state Criticism from conservative members of the church was fairly muted on Thursday  But the reversal most likely had widespread support  said Patrick Mason  the chairman of Mormon studies at Claremont Graduate University  who noted that he had never seen a church policy more openly questioned than the 2015 baptism ban  They were hearing not just from left  but from the center and the right   Mr  Mason said of church leaders   These were grandparents and parents saying this policy doesn t do anything for us  Still  for some the decision remains too little  too late  In Millcreek  Utah  all Kathy Carlston could think of when she heard the news was of her late wife  Berta Marquez  who died by suicide last year  The church s exclusionary policy toward same sex relationships had played a role her wife s spiritual and mental state and in her death  Ms  Carlston said in an interview  The reversal  she said  was just a step in honoring her wife s memory  Moving forward without apologizing is just gaslighting   she said of the announcement   They need to reach out and acknowledge the harm they have caused   

THE CLUB Johnson  Boswell  and the Friends Who Shaped an Age By Leo Damrosch O conversation the staff of life   the young T  S  Eliot wrote to his Harvard friend and fellow poet Conrad Aiken in 1914   Shall I get any at Oxford   A newcomer to England  Eliot looked to London as a city that once had been a center of civilization  There  conversation among thinkers fizzing with originality had its acme in a club founded in 1764 by the dictionary maker Samuel Johnson and the portrait painter Joshua Reynolds  They asked seven more friends to meet each Friday at the Turk s Head Tavern in Gerrard Street  to talk  dine and drink till midnight In  The Club   the American literary scholar Leo Damrosch brilliantly brings together the members  voices  They air their opinions with the aplomb of thinkers who relish the English language  roll its tones and innuendos about their tongues and have the alertness to listen as well as speak  For  as Leslie Stephen remarked in 1878  in a vivid chapter on  Johnson and His Friends  in his own biography of Johnson    a good talker  even more than a good orator  implies a good audience  The nine founding members of the Club joined quite early in their careers  Johnson had yet to write his masterpiece   Lives of the Poets   prompted in part by a conversation with King George III  who  in Boswell s account  expressed  a desire to have the literary biography of this country ably executed    Oliver Goldsmith had yet to publish the novel that would make his name   The Vicar of Wakefield   and Edmund Burke had yet to find renown as a parliamentary orator  Neither fame nor public position was required  and yet a surprising number of these friends would rise to lasting greatness  Elections were made by unanimous vote  Those of James Boswell  David Garrick and Adam Smith in the 1770s expanded the group to include the greatest biographer  the greatest actor and the greatest economist of the century ImageSamuel JohnsonCreditQuaker and Special Collections  Haverford CollegeBeginning with the friendship between Johnson  the moralist  and Boswell  his promiscuous future biographer   a connection that was initially forged outside the Club   Damrosch breathes life into  The Friends Who Shaped an Age   in his subtitle s phrase   As this stellar book moves from one Club member to another  it comes together as an ambitious venture homing in on the nature of creative stimulus  In his award winning life of Swift and  more recently  in  Eternity s Sunrise   his study of Blake  Damrosch approaches his subjects as creatures of their  world   a group portrait is a logical sequel  Here are multiple  deeply researched biographies in one  Resonating beyond the well documented links among these leading lights   The Club  captures their distinctly individual voices and invites us to feel the pulsations of contact over a period of 20 years  What made this collaborative pulse so strong across many fields Although it s impossible to explain genius  and although not all members deserved that label  the question is implicit in Damrosch s portraits of the group s defining figures   The Club  accurately recreates a milieu keen on character  egged on by the English taste for unashamed eccentricity  The impact of Johnson s sonorous pronouncements    When a man is tired of London  he is tired of life    is in no way diminished by his compulsive tics  slovenly clothes and a wig singed from bending too close to a candle to examine a text  Damrosch is equal to his characters  considering their comments from our vantage point  especially our present awareness of women s lives Inevitably  certain opinions are alien  even offensive to modern ears  Johnson s invoking the phrase  barbarous nations  to describe the victims of Britain s imperial wars  his dismissal of the American colonists  protest against taxation without representation  and  despite sympathizing with Native Americans whose lands were being wrested from them  his refusal to suggest that these lands should be returned to them Regarding women  all these 18th century British men endorsed a double standard  Women  Johnson said bluntly  must be taught to keep their legs together  The rationale was pragmatic  to secure the line of inheritance that kept property in male hands  We read on because we are drawn by the alluring drama of character  This drama is biographical  not political Character includes ambiguity and defects  There is abundant evidence of Boswell s habit of abusing girls  many of them orphans and desperate for sixpence  Yet Damrosch rightly keeps the focus on Boswell the  impresario   who drew on his training as a lawyer to spark new topics of conversation  and  of course  on Boswell the avid recorder  His  Journal  is astonishingly candid about his failings and humiliations  as when Rousseau s partner  Thrse  who once slept with Boswell while en route from France to England  tells him how clueless he is as a lover   She advises him to use his hands  ImageThe Club  eventually renamed the London Literary Society  has continued to this day but never again lived up to its glory years  Johnson died in 1784  Toward the end  he attended only about three times a year  It s telling that by 1783 membership had swollen to 35  Many of the members were highly gifted  including the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan  author of  The School for Scandal   and the historian Edward Gibbon  No doubt the intimacy of the earlier  smaller group worked better for Johnson In the 19th and 20th centuries  the Club s members were largely politicians and other public figures  The poet laureate Tennyson was there  but not Dickens  The election of T  S  Eliot  in 1942  came rather late in his career as a poet  And then  too  as Damrosch points out  there was no George Eliot  no Virginia Woolf   It never ceased to be a club for men  He compensates for this exclusion by focusing on the women who formed what he calls a  shadow club   The artist Frances Reynolds  Joshua s able but suppressed sister  affirmed that Johnson  set a higher value upon female friendship than  perhaps  most men   Among such friends were the bluestocking Elizabeth Carter and the novelist Fanny Burney  Johnson offered to teach Burney Latin  but her father  a member of the Club  refused  Burney s friend Hester Thrale said that Burney s father thought Latin  too masculine for Misses  Thrale became Johnson s closest confidante and  therapist  when spiritual terrors came to torment him  Aware how unbearable it was for him to be alone  Thrale took him to live with her and her wealthy husband  Henry  at Streatham Place  south of London  There  for the last 15 years of his life  listened to  respected and revered  Johnson could count on Thrale  who was  like him  a passionate moral being and literate companion  He was soothed by domestic affection and enjoyed the stimulus of mixed company  an alternative to the Club Looking at this book s list of chapters  I wondered at first why the portrait of Gibbon comes toward the end  He was elected to the Club in 1774  while writing the first volume of his  History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire   The book was recognized at once as a classic  combining extraordinary breadth with what Gibbon calls  the art of narrating   As Damrosch puts it  Gibbon broke with  tedious chronicles of fact   maintaining a  storytelling momentum  that is  constantly enlivened by memorable incidents and characterizations   This could be a description of Damrosch s own achievement  The best historians  he goes on  invite readers to accompany them  behind the scenes   Damrosch does precisely that here  and the chapter makes a fitting near finale to a book that sustains a shared conversation  a terrific feat in keeping with that of the Club itself  

It was a paroxysm that inscribed new chapters in the annals of genocide and turned a spotlight on the failure of international peacekeepers to come anywhere close to living up to their name Twenty five years ago  on April 7  1994  the dominant Hutus of Rwanda turned with well planned violence on the Tutsi minority whom they held to be traitors  One hundred days later  when the killing finally stopped  the death toll stood at as many as one million  mostly Tutsis but also including some moderate Hutus who had opposed the bloodletting  For more stories about the experiences and costs of war  sign up for the weekly At War newsletter  The scale of the fatalities was shocking  but more was to come as the torrent of killings washed into the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo  igniting years of strife in Africa s Great Lakes region  And  along this bloodstained way  sexual violence became woven into the horrors of war  Women suffered untold rapes and gang rapes  accelerating the spread of AIDS  The offspring of these assaults were stigmatized as  children of the killers  ImageA Hutu man whose face was mutilated by the Hutu Interahamwe militia  who suspected him of

the same year in which Nelson Mandela was installed as South Africa s first black president   the very emblem of a continent s hope and triumph over adversity   Africa was also in the public eye for cataclysmic anarchy and violence But Africa had no monopoly on blame The United States  scarred by the killing and humiliation of its soldiers in Somalia during the Battle of Mogadishu a few months earlier  had no appetite to intervene  President Bill Clinton  who was in office as the killings unfolded half a world away  said years later during a visit to Rwanda   I don t think we could have ended the violence  but I think we could have cut it down  And I regret it  France  a significant player in French speaking Africa  has long faced charges that it supported the Hutu leadership before and even during the massacres  President Paul Kagame of Rwanda has called French soldiers  actors  in the genocide   a charge denied by the former French prime minister  douard Balladur  as  a self

commander  the Canadian Maj  Gen  Romo Dallaire  to raid a Hutu arms cache that had been set aside for use in the atrocities  At the time  Kofi Annan  who later became the secretary general of the United Nations  was in charge of peacekeeping operations  Years later he said of the killing   All of us must bitterly regret that we did not do more to prevent it  History suggests  however  that Rwanda s lessons were an insufficient deterrent  Just a year after the Rwandan genocide  events far away in Europe   in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica   offered another alarming example of the toxic combination of genocidal urges and United Nations caution  8 000 Bosnian Muslims were murdered despite the presence of Dutch peacekeepers And  for its part  an African panel found many culprits for

inspecting the wreckage of a plane crash that killed the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi in April 1994 CreditCorinne Dufka ReutersThe ostensible trigger for the genocide came on April 6  1994  when an airplane carrying the country s Hutu president  Juvenal Habyarimana  and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighboring Burundi was shot down as it approached Kigali  Rwanda s capital  It has never been clearly established who brought the plane down or whether the genocide had been planned well in advance and needed only a spark to ignite its lethal tinder But within hours  the killing had started  Elite government forces  supported by a dreaded Hutu militia  the Interahamwe  which translates roughly as  those who work together   rounded up and executed Tutsi military and political leaders  Roadblocks were thrown up to filter out Rwandans whose official ID tagged them as Tutsis   a distinction introduced in the 1930s by the Belgian colonial authorities  Like their imperial German predecessors  Belgian officials had favored a Tutsi elite until the Hutu majority rose up in 1959 In rural areas  where Hutus and Tutsis had intermingled and sometimes intermarried  pervasive government propaganda in radio broadcasts and newspaper articles urged Hutus to take any weapon they could find   machetes  clubs   to kill or maim their neighbors  Foreigners working in the country

Front  led by the Tutsi Mr  Kagame  who was to become Rwanda s president  The Patriotic Front launched a broad attack to take the capital  Kigali  in early July  The killing in Rwanda itself came to a halt  but not the ethnic recriminations  With the land ruined  crops untended and the population diminished by the killing of Tutsis and the subsequent flight of Hutu refugees into Congo  Rwanda entered a new  gradually prospering but ambiguous era  The following years raised questions about post genocide justice and the price Rwandans paid for well being and stability under Mr  Kagame ImageA

 including Mr  Clinton and Bill Gates  His cities boasted clean streets and low crime  His economy grew rapidly  Admirers compared him to Lee Kuan Yew  the Singaporean leader who fused authoritarian rule with prosperity And  as Mr  Kagame s regime grew ever more entrenched and ever more intolerant of dissent  he often got a pass   Western states that did nothing to prevent the massacres have treated Rwanda with kid gloves ever since  in part out of a frequently acknowledged sense of guilt   the author and journalist Michela Wrong wrote in The Guardian Mr  Kagame was limited to two terms in office  but like his regional peers in Uganda  Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo   and rulers much farther afield   he chafed at the restriction  A referendum in 2015 changed the Constitution  enabling him to remain in office until 2034  In elections in 2017 he won with a staggering 98 8 percent of the vote   Of his two major opponents  Diane Rwigara was disqualified  later to

political rights  including detentions and torture  disappearances and killings  the article concluded   Addressing the poisonous legacies of Rwanda s genocide is the only way to avert future tragedy

Faced with an expanding measles outbreak  Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York declared a public health emergency on Tuesday and ordered a program of mandatory vaccination in parts of Brooklyn Such a health order is rare but not unheard of in American history  medical experts said  It has occurred several times  The Supreme Court ruled more than a century ago that mandatory vaccination was legal  although the court drew a distinction between punishing citizens for refusing and actually vaccinating them by force Nonetheless  both of those tactics have been imposed in the past 120 years   as long ago as a 1900 plague outbreak in San Francisco  and as recently as a measles outbreak in Philadelphia in 1991  Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  The New York vaccination order is written in a way that seems to leave open both possibilities  depending on how strictly the city chooses to enforce it  Mayor de Blasio said New Yorkers in the affected neighborhoods who refuse to let themselves or their children be vaccinated could be fined  1 000  But the order issued by the health commissioner  Dr  Oxiris Barbot  said anyone who has not been vaccinated and cannot prove they are immune to measles or produce a medical exemption  shall be vaccinated   Below the commissioner s signature   outside the actual text of the order   is an added warning saying failure to comply is a misdemeanor and can lead to fines or imprisonment  On Tuesday  Dr  Barbot said persistent refusals would be handled on a  case by case basis  and we ll have to confer with our legal counsel  The defining case in the field  according to Daniel A  Salmon  director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health  is the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in Jacobson v  Massachusetts The court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination on the grounds that  when danger loomed  an individual s freedom could be subordinated to the common good The plaintiff  Henning Jacobson  was a Cambridge  Mass   pastor who had been vaccinated against smallpox as a child in Sweden and claimed it had caused him lifelong suffering  He also argued that vaccination was an  invasion of his liberty  under the 14th Amendment  During a smallpox outbreak  he refused to let himself or his son be vaccinated and was fined  5 Massachusetts was then one of 11 states with compulsory vaccination laws  but it did not allow vaccination by force  By a 7 to 2 vote  the court let the fine stand and said imprisonment could also have been imposed But Justice John Harlan wrote for the majority that individuals could not be forcibly vaccinated Yet vaccination by force was used in 1991 in Philadelphia  said Dr  Paul A  Offit  director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia A measles outbreak that year infected over 1 400 people and killed several children  It had begun in two fundamentalist churches that rejected modern medicine and practiced faith healing  A court ordered that the children in those churches be vaccinated  Their families did not resist  They were a peaceful lot   Dr  Offit recalled   Once it was the law of the city  they realized it and they were pretty placid about it   One church s pastor had vaccinated her dog because the law required it  he said  yet her son died of an infection with Hib bacteria  which is prevented by a vaccine routinely given to children at two months  ImageResidents and police gathered outside a library in Brooklyn where Mayor de Blasio made the announcement CreditJohn Taggart for The New York TimesCity and state health commissioners often have vast powers  Most public health laws were written in the 19th century  when cities were regularly swept by waves of cholera  yellow fever and smallpox that killed thousands In the 1892 cholera outbreak  New York City s health commissioner  Dr  Cyrus Edson  was asked by a congressional committee what the limits of his powers were  He answered that he could even seize City Hall and turn it into a hospital In the 1990s  when a few New Yorkers with multi drug resistant tuberculosis   mostly homeless men   refused to take antibiotics  they were held involuntarily in a locked ward of Bellevue Hospital and forced to take medicine until they were no longer contagious Forced vaccination  however  is more politically sensitive than quarantines or forced treatment  Vaccines are given to healthy persons   sometimes infants   instead of to those who are sick and clearly endangering others Smallpox vaccination was made mandatory in parts of Europe as early as 1806  but the first attempt at forced vaccination in this country occurred in San Francisco s Chinatown in 1900  The city nearly exploded into riots  said Dr  Howard Markel  director of the University of Michigan s Center for the History of Medicine Measles Outbreak Explained  Your Questions AnsweredThe disease was declared eliminated in 2000  So far this year  there have been more than 100 cases  Feb  20  2019As he described it in his book  When Germs Travel   the entire neighborhood was cordoned off by police on March 7  1900  less than 24 hours after local health officials tentatively concluded that a scrap wood dealer found dead in a basement cot in a dime a night boardinghouse had perished from plague Plague was then common in China and in 1899 had reached Honolulu s Chinatown  A  controlled burn  of a few plague infested houses ordered by the city board of health had gotten out of control and burned down 4 000 houses  leaving thousands homeless Anti Chinese prejudice was rampant in California  and the Chinese were terrified that what had happened in Hawaii would be repeated The San Francisco quarantine was lifted on March 9  in part because employers needed their workers  Health inspectors and police began searching the community for the sick  beating anyone who resisted In May  the surgeon general in Washington telegraphed orders that federal health officials should take over response to the outbreak  cordon off Chinatown again  prevent all Chinese and Japanese people from leaving the city  disinfect all their homes   and inoculate them all with an experimental plague vaccine  The national panic was so great that the secretary of the Treasury briefly issued orders that all Asians could be denied transport by common carrier anywhere in the country  The vaccine had been invented just three years earlier by Waldemar Haffkine  an Orthodox Jew who had been driven out of Russia by anti Semitism and had moved his laboratory to India The second quarantine went on for weeks  and Chinatown faced starvation until local merchants donated food  The Chinese press reported that the Haffkine vaccine had killed some Indians and that a few Chinatown residents who accepted it had fallen ill The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association  a civic group  sued  and a federal district judge stopped the vaccinations  saying the order singled out Asians for no medical reason  Ultimately  the vaccination effort was dropped because the governor asked President William McKinley to step in  The local federal health official had started issuing orders so sweeping that they effectively prevented all Californians from leaving the state without his permission Even fining people for refusing to be vaccinated has a complex history  Dr  Salmon said  In Britain  he noted  fines have sometimes been imposed repeatedly for repeated refusals  People lost their houses and became martyrs   he said Also  fines create inequities because some can afford them and some cannot   You end up punishing people based on their ability to pay   Dr  Salmon said There is almost always a backlash  In Britain  the Vaccination Act of 1853 galvanized the creation of an anti vaccination movement  and in the United States  the Anti Vaccination League of America was founded three years after Jacobson v  Massachusetts was decided Earlier reporting on the measles outbreakNew York Declares Measles Emergency  Requiring Vaccinations in Parts of BrooklynApril 9  2019

JERUSALEM   His army nickname was Benny Huta  a Hebrew pun that translates as  Benny Chill   And in his first ever run for office  Benny Gantz never let anyone see him sweat  no matter the live television gaffes  embarrassing leaks or rumors about personal improprieties that occasionally tripped up his candidacy for prime minister His centrist  flag hued Blue and White party did better than any new Israeli faction ever had before  earning more than a million votes and around 35 seats in Parliament on Tuesday  That was the same as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud party did  though smaller right wing factions tilted the election sharply to the incumbent It was quite a showing after just a few months in politics  Now  Mr  Gantz  a three star general and former Israeli military chief  is laying in for a siege against Mr  Netanyahu that his allies expect could last into 2020  Nothing will drive us from our goal   Mr  Gantz said Wednesday night With Mr  Netanyahu expected to form the most right wing and ultra Orthodox government Israel has ever seen  it will probably be a bumpy road even before a coalition is formed The issue of military conscription is likely to put secular and ultra Orthodox parties in his coalition immediately at odds  Mr  Netanyahu s expected indictment is looming  and may come as soon as July  And then there is the wild card of a Trump administration peace plan   one that some of his coalition partners could well find unacceptable   that could be announced at any time ImageA Blue and White campaign poster in Tel Aviv  From left  Moshe Yaalon  Mr  Gantz  Yair Lapid and Gabi Ashkenazi CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesOn Wednesday  Mr  Gantz s partner in Blue and White  Yair Lapid  offered a warning to Mr  Netanyahu and the Likud   We are going to make your lives miserable   We will turn the Knesset into a field of battle   he said   And we will do one more thing  We will show the citizens of Israel how a real  true alternative looks  Yet as a candidate  Mr  Gantz  with his hooded eyes  mild manner and above all his willingness to let Mr  Lapid take over as prime minister after two years of their term  left many voters wondering if he had the fire in the belly   or as Israelis call it  the  knife in the teeth    to defeat Mr  Netanyahu And on Wednesday  he spoke less militantly than Mr  Lapid of his plans as opposition leader  I have come not for power  I came for a goal   he said   I came for Israeli society  I came from a place of great love for Israeli society and a place of great love for the country  For Mr  Gantz  merely holding his seven week old party together would be its own achievement  Blue and White comprises left  centrist and right wing politicians who were able to get behind a

CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesAll four put their egos aside for the campaign   though that was with an outcome in mind that did not involve sitting in the opposition Blue and White will also have to resist what are certain to be the wily Mr  Netanyahu s efforts to divide and conquer  and there are several visible seams Mr  Netanyahu could test  The prime minister could woo the half dozen right wing members with legislation they want  straining the discipline of their new party  He could also offer the defense ministry to Mr  Gantz or either of the other retired generals Mr  Lapid  who built Yesh Atid into a national organization in pursuit of his own ambition to become prime minister  may see himself as a more capable leader of the opposition in Parliament than Mr  Gantz  And other party members with important jobs like Avi Nissenkorn  the chairman of the labor federation Histadrut   Israel s A F L  C I O    may grow impatient as lawmakers in the minority Mr  Lapid  the most seasoned spokesman of the bunch  tackled those doubts head on   I see an ensemble   he said   They will try to break us up  They will not succeed  Analysts have speculated that a Trump peace plan might prompt Mr  Netanyahu to appeal to Mr  Gantz to form a broad national unity government  But Yoaz Hendel  a former Netanyahu spokesman who was No  2 in Mr  Yaalon s Telem Party  said Mr  Gantz would have little trouble resisting such advances  I don t see any reason to help Netanyahu with a Trump plan   Mr  Hendel said   If he has his own coalition  I offer him to do it by himself  I don t see any reason to give him a defense shield  ImageBlue and White supporters on Election Day CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesMr  Gantz ran on a slate dedicated to integrity  clean government and repairing the system  The party offered voters something less than a revolution  But the mild tones of its campaign appealed to a widespread yearning among many Israelis to return to an older  possibly idealized Israel  where leaders were modest to the point of frugality and put the good of the country before party or personal interests Mr  Gantz spoke of being a prime minister for all Israeli citizens  Jews and non Jews alike  itself a noteworthy statement in the current environment  But he ruled out forming a coalition with the leaders of Arab parties  And to appeal to as many voters as possible  he espoused no firm policy positions and said little about fundamental issues like the Israeli Palestinian conflict Born to parents who survived the Holocaust  became Zionist pioneers and helped found a farming community in the early years of the state  Mr  Gantz speaks English with a thick Israeli accent and is understated to the point of appearing bashful He lives unostentatiously in Rosh Haayin  in central Israel  in a suburban neighborhood of neat  semidetached homes built for army officers  His hobbies include attending communal singalongs of Hebrew oldies

in 2016  He s as straight as an arrow   she said of Mr  Gantz   He is not quick to take decisions  but he knows how to take them  In his long career  Mr  Gantz spent two years as Israel s military

WASHINGTON   After President Trump told reporters last week that he would like to nominate Herman Cain to fill a spot on the Federal Reserve board  Mr  Cain posted a video to his Facebook page confirming the news  He quickly referred to the sexual harassment allegations that had torpedoed his 2012 presidential campaign  and were already complicating his possible Fed appointment  You better believe that the people who hate me  who do not like conservative Republicans  are digging up all the stuff that s been in storage from eight years ago   said Mr  Cain  a former restaurant executive who now contributes to a conservative news site and runs a  Super PAC  that supports Mr  Trump  So be it  Let them go back and dig up eight year old stuff   he continued   I will be able to explain it this time  where they wouldn t let me explain it last time  They were too busy believing the accusers  I m not mad  y all  I m just not going to let the accusers run my life  determine my career  Prospective nominees for top government jobs  like the Fed  typically lie low while they wait for Senate confirmation  That has not been the case for Mr  Cain or Stephen Moore  the economic adviser to Mr  Trump whom the president also plans to nominate for a Fed seat Since being floated for the job  both men have kept talking  And talking While they undergo White House vetting ahead of what Mr  Trump promises will be formal nominations  both Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain have offered near daily commentary   largely to conservative audiences   on politics  monetary policy and a wide range of social issues  At several times  they have sought to cast what promises to be a bruising confirmation fight as a war on Mr  Trump s supporters and conservative principles Fed watchers say the media blitzes are unusual  if not unprecedented  and are probably intended to impress Mr  Trump  But they could also alienate the senators who must confirm them On Tuesday  Republican senators indicated they were having serious misgivings about Mr  Cain s nomination  During their weekly lunch  several Republicans raised the issue of the nominations  questioning the wisdom of floating Mr  Cain and Mr  Moore without consulting the Senate first and before both could be vetted  according to a person who was in the room Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  told lawmakers during the lunch that if they had concerns about specific names being floated  they should let the White House know ImageStephen Moore  a former Trump campaign adviser and conservative economist  has offered nearly daily commentary on politics  monetary policy and social issues since his name was floated for a Fed post CreditTom Williams CQ Roll Call Before the president starts floating names for D H S     the Department of Homeland Security    or the Federal Reserve  we need to have a conversation about who is actually confirmable up here   said Senator John Cornyn  Republican of Texas  after emerging from the weekly lunch   We need to make sure these are people who can get confirmed before they are floated  That way we spare everybody the embarrassment  Senator John Thune of South Dakota  the second ranking Republican  who is responsible for gathering votes  told colleagues on Tuesday that getting Mr  Cain confirmed would be virtually impossible  and that the White House should reconsider  according to a person familiar with his comments Asked about Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain on Tuesday  Mr  McConnell said only that the Senate would  look at  anyone the president nominated  We ve got to look at whoever the president sends up   he said   It s his choice to decide  and once he makes the nomination we ll take a look at it  Tim Duy  a University of Oregon economist who has criticized both potential nominations  said the running commentary from both men was not likely to help their chances  There s never been a reality show Fed nominee  and that s what we ve got now   he said  Traditionally   once you ve been nominated  or you re about to be nominated  you go radio silent   and you go radio silent for a reason  You don t want to say things that jeopardize your chance of moving forward  Just hours after Mr  Trump said he wanted to nominate Mr  Moore to the Fed  the potential nominee appeared on Bloomberg TV  where he talked about his views on monetary policy and the Fed s approach  Mr  Moore wrote a Washington Examiner op ed this week arguing that the Fed should cut interest rates  while also blaming low rates for the 2008 financial crisis  Mr  Moore has also appeared at a film screening  debated a more liberal economist on technology policy  spoken to conservative groups and been a frequent guest on conservative talk shows in the weeks since his name was floated  He often presses his case that the economy is experiencing deflation  as measured in commodity prices  though Labor Department data show overall prices are continuing to increase  Show me anywhere where prices are rising and I guarantee you talk to farmers  you talk to the people in the oil patch  they don t see any inflation   Mr  Moore said Monday on the radio program hosted by the Fox News personality Sean Hannity   They see their prices falling  During the program  Mr  Hannity mused that  it s almost like the Fed was helping President Obama politically and then it almost seems like  Trump s president  what do we care if it impacts the economy   That s the feeling I got  Am I wrong  ImageSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  advised his fellow Republicans that if they had concerns about specific names being floated  they should tell the White House CreditSarah Silbiger The New York Times Look   Mr  Moore replied   there may be some truth to that  In an interview on Tuesday  Mr  Moore nodded to his long career as a writer and commentator on economic issues  and suggested his public comments were helping him make the case for his preferred monetary policy while allowing him to work out how it might be carried out  I m already on record in terms of what I m for   Mr  Moore said   I feel like I m not revealing anything that I haven t been   I m the first one to admit   he added   I have a lot to learn about how this all works   what tools the Fed has available to them  On Friday  Mr  Cain told viewers of  The Herman Cain Show   which is posted daily online  that he was undergoing an F B I  background check that spanned  50 years  of his career in business  He said the White House had asked for records from the last three years of speeches he had given   I said   I can t count them  I don t remember them all   Those musings were sandwiched between technology tips for Mr  Cain s viewers    50 percent of what you see on social media is garbage    drawn from a talk he had recently given to a group of Burger King franchisees  and  later  Mr  Cain s complaints that the news media refers to Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  Democrat of New York  as A O C  Why don t they call me H C  in the press   Mr  Cain asked   I would like that  Nobody has that  I want to have my initials in the media also  Ms  Ocasio Cortez is a frequent topic in Mr  Cain s videos and on his Facebook page  where he posts links to stories from his news outlet  Western Journal  He often adds captions like  What s a little criminality among Democrats  In one post last week  referring to a story about the Nation of Islam leader  Louis Farrakhan  Mr  Cain appeared to criticize the Twitter ban of the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones   So  why are things like Alex Jones and telling people to code unacceptable to Twitter   Mr  Cain wrote   but this scumbag bigot is still given a platform  Antonia Ferrier  a Republican consultant and former aide to Mr  McConnell  said the public statements fit a pattern from Mr  Trump s administration  particularly since Mr  Trump has not yet nominated either man  This White House doesn t follow the traditional norms of a nominations process   nor do its nominees   she said   So it really shouldn t be a surprise that these two gentlemen are focusing on the media and the audience of one in the Oval Office   

Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  Last night  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen found herself on the receiving end of what has become a common occurrence in the Trump era  pushed out of office unceremoniously  with her departure announced in a tweet Unlike some of the administration officials fired before her  Ms  Nielsen was hardly taken aback by the news  She d turned in her resignation letter at a meeting earlier that day  and was spotted dining at a waterside restaurant al fresco shortly after the president s message hit Twitter  Read more about the president s purge of officials at the top of the Department of Homeland Security  How routine this kind of dismissal has become got me thinking about all the conventions President Trump has broken in Washington   the breach he s opened up in the unspoken manners  decorum and traditions that long governed the capital Or  as we nerds in D C  like to call them  norms Now  there s a case to be made that actual voters do not care all that much about our nerdy norms  see  Mr  Trump s victory  2016   There s also evidence they do  see  Mr  Trump s fallen approval rating among independent voters   The reality is  until he s back on the ballot  we don t really know whether Mr  Trump s consistent flouting of The Way Things Are Done matters to most Americans The only thing we truly know about norms  Over his nearly 27 months in Washington  Mr  Trump has broken a whole lot of them Here s an incomplete list  largely from the past few weeks  in no particular order Working in the White House  The White House used to be a place Washington s climbers clambered over each other to reach  Now it s the kind of job few want to keep  Nearly 50 officials have left the administration since Mr  Trump took office  according to a New York Times analysis  giving the president the record for both White House staff

circumstances  like a bad thing  In the Trump administration  though  some have seen it as the only way out while saving your reputation  Take Ms  Nielsen  for example  Though her legacy is likely linked with the president s policies on separating migrant families at the border  her dismissal allows her to argue that she objected internally   and lost the fight   over some of the president s most extreme positions on immigration  Mr  Trump is pushing to restart the practice of family separation  Read more about that here  The cabinet  Ms  Nielsen s departure means there will be five

WASHINGTON   President Trump s personal lawyer on Friday asserted Mr  Trump s right as a citizen to keep his tax returns private and told the Treasury Department not to hand the returns over to House Democrats  foreshadowing what has the potential to be a far reaching legal fight that could reach the Supreme Court The lawyer  William S  Consovoy  argued that Democrats who have demanded to see Mr  Trump s tax information had no legitimate legislative reason to request it and that Representative Richard E  Neal s decision this week to ask for six years of the president s personal and business returns flouts  fundamental constitutional constraints   He also called it a  gross abuse of power   Even if Ways and Means had a legitimate committee purpose for requesting the president s tax returns and return information  that purpose is not driving Chairman Neal s request   the lawyer wrote  referring to Mr  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  who leads the House Ways and Means Committee   His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech   Read the lawyer s letter  Mr  Consovoy s views have no direct bearing on the case  The little known tax code provision employed by the Democrats in demanding Mr  Trump s returns says only that the Internal Revenue Service  shall furnish  the information  giving it and its parent agency  the Treasury Department  little leeway in deciding how to respond Democrats anticipate that the Trump administration could present an argument similar to the one made on Friday by Mr  Consovoy  namely that Mr  Neal s request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and  based on past court precedent  must respect Mr  Trump s right to privacy Nonetheless  the length and forcefulness of Mr  Consovoy s letter underscores what is at stake for a president who has defied modern political norms by refusing to voluntarily release his tax returns  If Mr  Neal prevails and gains access to the president s long hidden returns  it would allow Democrats for the first time to peek past Mr  Trump s public claims about his wealth and investments and into the heart of his personal and business finances The I R S  and Treasury Department have given no indication of how they view the request since it was made on Wednesday  Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  told Congress last month he would consult with his legal team and follow the law when a request was made  He will most likely face questions about the request again next week when he returns to Capitol Hill to discuss the department s budget Mr  Trump has indicated in recent days that he is ready to fight to keep his financial information private  Asked on Friday if he was confident he would succeed  Mr  Trump offered an ambiguous prediction  Oh  I don t know   he said   That s up to whoever handles it  I don t know  Hey  I m under audit  But that s up to whoever it is  From what I understand  the law is 100 percent on my side  Mr  Neal made the request through an obscure but frequently used provision of the federal tax code   Section 6103   that allows Congress s tax writing committees to view tax information on any filer  The authority is regularly used by the committee to confidentially measure how changes to the tax code would affect different types of taxpayers  It has been used for more investigative purposes  as well  most recently in 2014  when committee Republicans obtained and publicly released tax information as part of an investigation into whether the I R S  discriminated against conservative entities seeking tax exempt status But there is little precedent for using it to examine the returns of a president without his consent Mr  Neal gave the I R S  until next week to comply  If it does not  the House could go to court to try to enforce the request   a process that legal experts said could take years to sort out   The Supreme Court has flagged twice now that it is unclear as to whether a congressional committee can sue the president and force the executive branch to do something   said Andy Grewal  a University of Iowa law school professor   I think we are a very long way from getting an answer over legitimate legislative purpose  After months of speculation  the back and forth was initiated on Wednesday when Mr  Neal formally requested that the I R S  hand over six years of Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns as part of what he said was a committee oversight investigation of tax law enforcement  Even if Mr  Neal does get access to the information  it would not automatically become public because the committee would have to vote to disclose anything it sees In making his request  Mr  Neal jettisoned issues  like possible tax fraud  that Democrats have warned that Mr  Trump may be hiding  instead saying that he wanted to examine audit procedures for a president Mr  Neal worked closely with House lawyers to prepare the request to hold up against legal challenge  He framed the request as part of the Ways and Means Committee s oversight of  the extent to which the I R S  audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president   Under I R S  policy  the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year  This request is about policy  not politics   Mr  Neal said at the time   My preparations were made on my own track and timeline  entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration  Daniel Rubin  a spokesman for Mr  Neal  declined to comment on Friday s letter Mr  Consovoy said that Mr  Neal s stated justification only thinly veiled what Democrats were really after  political gain  They have demanded for years that Mr  Trump release his tax returns  Mr  Consovoy argued  and they promised to use the House majority to find out whether the president had undertaken financial fraud  Once this Pandora s box is opened  the ensuing tit for tat will do lasting damage to our nation   Mr  Consovoy wrote Though he was defending Mr  Trump s privacy rights as a taxpayer  his arguments also closely mirrored those used by Republicans in Congress who have argued against making the request  If Chairman Neal genuinely wants to review how the I R S  audits presidents  why is he seeking tax returns and return information covering the four years before President Trump took office   Mr  Consovoy asked   Why is he not requesting information about the audits of previous presidents  Mr  Consovoy s argument bears similarity to one made by other Trump lawyers throughout the course of the obstruction of justice investigation led by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  In that case  the president s lawyers repeatedly argued that he did not lose his rights as a citizen by dint of being the commander in chief  Those included his rights to free speech  his lawyers argued  a point echoed in the letter sent on Friday Mr  Grewal said he thought Mr  Consovoy raised a valid objection about the legitimacy of Mr  Neal s investigation  but cautioned that his letter was  part of public relations and advocacy  as opposed to any kind of official action  that would affect the case George K  Yin  a tax law professor at the University of Virginia  disagreed  He said Mr  Neal s argument was cleverly framed  particularly in light of a relevant past use of Section 6103 by Congress in examining whether President Richard M  Nixon had properly paid his taxes  There is an inherent conflict of interest when the agency is responsible for auditing its boss   he said Facing questions about his own tax obligations  Nixon asked Congress to investigate whether he had taken improper tax positions as president  Using materials he handed over and referencing Section 6103  Congress found that despite being audited by the I R S   Nixon had significantly underpaid After Nixon and his immediate successor  Gerald R  Ford  all American presidents until Mr  Trump voluntarily released their taxes  

WASHINGTON   For President Trump  a threat is frequently his first impulse He is forceful  declarative and speaks with unvarnished conviction  He has made the theme of promises made  promises kept the anthem of his re election effort But his threats often remain just that  The most recent example was when Mr  Trump backed down from a vow to close the border with Mexico  instead saying he would give one of the United States  most essential trading partners a year to deal with the migrant crisis  This came only a day after he had threatened to act if Congress did not bend to his will on the issue  The price of Mexican avocados spiked  but the government of Mexico seemed unmoved  Mr  Trump has warned Mexico of an impending border closing at least three times before  in October  November and December  On Friday  before leaving for a trip to the border town of Calexico  Calif   Mr  Trump suggested that his threat against Mexico was still in his holster   I never changed my mind at all  I may shut it down at some point  but I d rather do tariffs   he said Here is a look at some of Mr  Trump s more high profile threats Closing the border with MexicoIn retreating from his threat to close the border  Mr  Trump was withdrawing the warning that he issued strongly last week  But on Friday  he offered up another one  He said that the trade deal that the United States had reached with Mexico and Canada  known as the U S M C A   would not apply if Mexico does not stop Central American migrants from illegally entering the United States  If for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from  the U S  will be forced to Tariff at 25  all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us  If that doesn t work  which it will  I will close the Border   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter  This will supersede USMCA   Mr  Trump added  He also threatened an  economic penalty  on Mexico  for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border  Congress has not yet voted on the trade deal  If it does approve the pact   and the president tried to unilaterally abrogate selective provisions of the agreement   it would provoke numerous legal challenges  as well as an uproar from foreign leaders and members of Congress A bullhorn to RussiaThe president warned Russia in March to  get out  of Venezuela after Moscow dispatched military personnel to the country and offered to send the government of President Nicols Maduro shipments of food and medicine  He has consistently said that Mr  Maduro must step down and has strongly suggested that United States military intervention was on the table  He also urged the Venezuelan military to rebel  None of those threats have been effective  Mr  Trump has accused the Russian government of bolstering Mr  Maduro while the United States has been rallying support behind Juan Guaid  the opposition leader While the United States issued another round of sanctions and visa restrictions last month  Russia has shown no outward signs of backing down  and Mr  Maduro has refused Mr  Trump s calls that he resign Telling General Motors to reopen a plant  or else  he would cut subsidies Mr  Trump has frequently threatened companies  particularly if they were moving jobs overseas  He has directed some of his sharpest language toward General Motors  and Mary Barra  its chief executive  He has demanded that G M  reopen a plant in Lordstown  Ohio  that the company said it closed because consumer demand had shifted away from the smaller vehicles produced at the plant  He had earlier threatened to cut subsidies for the company and to recoup federal money it had received from the bailout at the height of the financial crisis of 2008 The company has not acceded to his demands  and so far has not suffered any penalty from the government Threats against the mediaBeyond regular Twitter posts denouncing the  fake news   Mr  Trump has also threatened to take regulatory and legal actions against news outlets and television programs In October 2017  Mr  Trump suggested that he would revoke NBC s broadcast license after the network published a report he objected to   only to be indirectly refuted days later by Ajit Pai  the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  who said that his agency  does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content   Nonetheless  Mr  Trump revived the threat in September 2018 One program on the network in particular has drawn the president s ire   Saturday Night Live   which Mr  Trump has said  should be tested in courts   investigated by the F C C   or   rather vaguely    should be looked into  In the fall  after the White House suspended the credentials of Jim Acosta  the chief White House correspondent for CNN  Mr  Trump threatened retaliation against other reporters if they did not  treat the White House with respect  Mr  Acosta s press badge was restored and no other White House reporters have had their credentials suspended since Trying to overturn a constitutional rightMr  Trump also threatened in 2018  to end birthright citizenship  a constitutional guarantee that could only be undone by amending the Constitution  In an interview with Axios at the time  the president called the concept  ridiculous  and said  it has to end  After strong pushback from within his party    Paul D  Ryan  the House speaker at the time  said the president  obviously  could not terminate a constitutional right by executive order   Mr  Trump retreated California on his mindThe liberal state has drawn Mr  Trump s displeasure   and Twitter threats   several times during his presidency In November  Mr  Trump blamed wildfires ravaging California on what he deemed  gross mismanagement of the forests   warning the state to  remedy now  or no more Fed payments    The criticism was misleading  as the majority of California s forests are federally managed  and the causes of wildfires are complicated and include climate change  Two months later  in January  Mr  Trump said that state officials had not made adequate remedy and reissued his threat   Unless they get their act together  which is unlikely  I have ordered FEMA to send no more money   referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency The state scrambled to make sense of Mr  Trump s renewed threat  and lawmakers from both parties criticized the move  A month later  a spokesman for FEMA told BuzzFeed it had never received a directive The agency continued to provide assistance to residents affected by the fire  On the same day that Mr  Trump delivered his second warning  FEMA extended the deadline for California residents to apply for disaster assistance to  Feb  15   It had been Jan  31   Federal cost sharing for debris removal actually increased to 90 percent from 75  percent  and the agency provided more than  347 million in grants and loans to affected residents A veiled warning to James B  ComeyAfter he fired James B  Comey  the former F B I  director  in May 2017  Mr  Trump urged him to think twice about speaking with reporters and referred to secret recordings of their conversations  James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter For weeks  Mr  Trump and his aides refused to confirm or deny the existence of such recordings or to clarify if he was simply rebutting Mr  Comey s claims that he had been asked by the president to pledge his loyalty Mr  Comey testified before Congress in June  telling lawmakers   Lordy  I hope there are tapes  Mr  Trump then cleared it up himself on Twitter  denying that he had taped Mr  Comey in the first place   I have no idea whether there are  tapes  or recordings of my conversations with James Comey  but I did not make  and do not have  any such recordings

to encourage people to get a little more exercise  If helps make buses or trains less crowded  even better According to a 2007 study  New Yorkers are among the fastest walkers in the world  On average  it takes only 12 seconds for New Yorkers to walk 60 feet  that s about 3 4 miles per hour  and slightly faster than sitting on the M42 bus  According to a recent report  the M42 has an average speed

After several blocks  we thought we were clear of the other cab  when suddenly it was right alongside us The driver reached out his open window  grabbed the passenger door of our cab and slammed it

office at the end of 2021 because of term limits  seems intent on joining the Democrats  crowded field of White House contenders  Read more about Mayor de Blasio s presidential preparations  To understand this better  I spoke to The Times s J  David Goodman  who has covered City Hall and now writes about the influence of money in politics Our conversation was lightly edited for clarity and brevity What are the signs that Mayor de Blasio is serious about running He s traveling and he s fund raising He s traveled before  but there is a very explicit targeting of early primary states in his cross country travel these days  You look at that and say that s the kind of thing you would do  You have to get there You need to get surrogates and win those local activists over so they don t go with the other candidates  And you need to meet the money that isn t available in New York City If people are going to write you a big check  generally they want to meet with you in person Does running for president enable Mr  de Blasio to do something that he couldn t do otherwise In the 2016 race  he tried to have an influence on the presidential conversation without being a candidate  It didn t quite work He may think that the way to do that this time is to actually be in the race  You saw that last time around with Bernie Sanders  He had far more influence as a candidate than you imagine he would have had if he tried to just have a political action committee and support some candidates in 2016 Maybe that s what Mr  de Blasio is doing Running for president also helps stave off the effects of being a lame duck  He has to leave City Hall at the end of 2021  Already you ve had people talking about the next mayor s race  and it makes the mayor seem a little less powerful What exactly is the influence the mayor wants to have  What does his fingerprint on 2020 look like  That s a good question  He s focused on affordable housing  universal prekindergarten and early education  He s also talked about universal health care The trouble for him is that a lot of his ideas have been taken up  and people go further now What would be the de Blasio signature issue to move the Democratic Party in a way that it s not already moving  I think he has to answer that question I think his argument now is  liberalism works  and I did it in a big city and I ll do it for the rest of the country  And he can make that argument in a way that a senator can t as effectively  someone who hasn t been an executive But that s not how presidential campaigns are won  They re won on ideas and inspiration  The mayor has ideas  I m not sure he s always inspiring Where do you think he would announce I don t have a good answer for that  What do you think Maybe in front of his home in Park

This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting  WASHINGTON   Seven years ago  when a former C I A  prisoner  Majid Khan  pleaded guilty at Guantnamo to being a courier for Al Qaeda  his lawyers were warned that any mention of the word  torture  would lead a court security officer to trigger a mute button so the public  listening on a 40 second delay  would not hear it This week the question of his treatment was front and center  this time in a pre sentencing hearing  Mr  Khan s lawyers asked a military judge on Monday to order prosecutors to produce evidence and witnesses about the secret prison network where the intelligence agency kept Mr  Khan incommunicado from March 2003 to September 2006  The material we seek  that is uniquely in the possession of the government  concerns Mr  Khan s torture   one of his lawyers  Katya Jestin  told the judge   The C I A  torture program in this case  your honor  appears to be the third rail  No security officer hit the mute button  A red light on the judge s bench used to signal a security breach never lit up Seventeen and a half years after the Sept  11  2001  terror attacks  and a decade after President Barack Obama ordered the C I A  to dismantle any remnants of its global prison network  the military commission system is still wrestling with how to handle evidence of what the United States did to the Qaeda suspects it held at C I A  black sites  While the topic of torture can now be discussed in open court  there is still a dispute about how evidence of it can be gathered and used in the proceedings at Guantnamo Bay  Cuba By law  prosecutors cannot use evidence gained through torture   or any other involuntary statements   at the war court  where eight of Guantnamo s 40 prisoners are accused of being complicit in terrorist attacks  Prosecutors have made clear that nothing the defendants said at the black sites will be used as evidence But defense lawyers have continued to press for details of what happened to their clients and to be able to use the information either to fight the charges or to win more lenient sentencing  And they have been aided by changing circumstances  not least the government s declassification of some details of how the prisoners were interrogated by the C I A The issue has been most intensely debated in Guantnamo s two death penalty cases  the 9 11 terror attacks that killed 2 976 people and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 in which 17 American sailors died Defense lawyers in those cases have sought for years to get access to eyewitnesses and graphic details from the C I A  sites  The lawyers want to use descriptions of torture to ask the judge to exclude some of the defendants  own statements after they left the black sites  The defense lawyers also have said they would cite torture to seek dismissal of the charges on grounds of outrageous government conduct  an extraordinary legal defense that is used in civilian courts but is seldom granted If the men are convicted  the lawyers want the details of how the defendants were treated to argue that the United States has lost the moral authority to execute men it has tortured ImageThe lawyers for Majid Khan  a prisoner at Guantnamo  say he was tortured in a C I A  black site CreditCenter for Constitutional RightsThe fight over access to evidence and witnesses from the black sites is one of the factors that has slowed progress in the cases  In the process  it has illustrated how fundamental legal issues about the rights of Guantnamo defendants remain unresolved   and how the passage of time is altering how some of them are handled The conflict is not limited to the death penalty cases  as Mr  Khan s proceedings show The topic of his torture was strictly taboo on Feb  29  2012  when he made his first court appearance since disappearing from his native Pakistan in 2003 at age 23  At that first hearing  Mr  Khan  who lived in suburban Baltimore for seven years and graduated from high school there in 1999  admitted to volunteering to work for Al Qaeda after Sept  11 and plotting with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  the accused architect of the attacks But in the intervening years  the Obama administration declassified details of what Mr  Khan said the C I A  did to him  By his account  he was beaten  hung naked from a wooden beam for three days with no food  kept for months in darkness  and submerged  shackled and hooded  into a tub of ice and water Additional details of his treatment were revealed in the partly declassified introduction to a Senate study of the George W  Bush administration s black site program  In his second year of C I A  detention  according to a cable cited in the study  the agency  infused  a pure of pasta  sauce  nuts  raisins and hummus up Mr  Khan s rectum  because he went on a hunger strike The C I A  calls this  rectal feeding   Defense lawyers call it rape Mr  Khan s lawyers now want to call witnesses and gather evidence to show his sentencing jury what happened to him The litigation over black site evidence has gone on for years  to the dismay of some family members who lost loved ones to Al Qaeda terrorists  particularly families of those killed on Sept  11  2001  when hijackers crashed four passenger planes into the World Trade Center  the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field  What our family members endured during the attacks on the airplanes and in the building was beyond torture   said Terry Strada  whose husband Thomas was killed in the World Trade Center She has campaigned for more transparency about what happened on Sept  11  But she sees the focus in the Guantnamo hearings on what happened to the defendants in the black sites as  stalling and stonewalling the process  In Mr  Khan s case  he has pleaded guilty to delivering  50 000 of Qaeda money to a Southeast Asian affiliate that was used to finance the bombing of a Marriott hotel in Jakarta  Indonesia  in 2003 that killed 11 people  He also admitted to agreeing to assassinate Pervez Musharraf  then the president of Pakistan  a plot that was never pulled off Under a plea agreement  he became what his military attorney  Lt  Cmdr  Jared Hernandez of the Navy  called  Guantnamo s sole high value cooperator  and can be sentenced to 25 years of confinement  He is being credited with time served since his plea deal  meaning he could get out in 2037 His lawyers say testimony about his years in C I A  custody could strengthen a post sentencing clemency petition  They also may ask the judge to grant him credit for those years in the C I A  prisons as pretrial punishment and reduce his sentence ImageAmerican troops standing guard outside Camp Delta at Guantnamo Bay Detention Center  By law  prosecutors cannot use involuntary statements at the war court  where eight of Guantnamo s 40 prisoners are accused of being complicit in terrorist attacks CreditRamon Espinosa Associated PressIn the military tribunal system  prosecutors are the gatekeepers of classified trial evidence  They have forbidden defense team members from independently contacting or investigating most former black site workers  The C I A  is shielding their identities as well as the nations that hosted the black sites  invoking national security  though most if not all the nations have already been identified publicly  The C I A  is not on trial   Jeffrey Groharing  a case prosecutor  told the judge at a hearing at Guantnamo on Nov  15  That same day  in a bid to persuade the judge that the prosecution had met its responsibility to provide information to the defense  Mr  Groharing stood at the war court and read aloud from documents the defense lawyers can use from a C I A  inspector general s investigation One described how  during an interrogation  Mr  Mohammed refused an interrogator s order to drink water  According to the document read by Mr  Groharing  Mr  Mohammed  was taken back to the bathing room  placed on a plastic sheet and a medical officer rehydrated Mohammed rectally  Mohammed clearly hated the procedure  When he was returned to the interrogation room  he then complied and drank water  In another document Mr  Groharing read  an unnamed senior interrogator described an unidentified black site as  good for interrogations  because it was  the closest thing he has seen to a dungeon  facilitating the displacement of detainee explanations  Spectators heard the audio on a 40 second delay from the gallery at the back of court  separated by triple pane glass   It s hard to imagine a more rich and vivid description than those statements   Mr  Groharing said Defense lawyers called the written accounts sanitized versions of the eyewitness testimony they sought Mr  Mohammed s lawyer  David Nevin  said the term rectal rehydration  is a polite way of saying rape with the insertion of a foreign object into the rectum  But how is it done  I d like to know  how is it done  One small detail can change a juror s mind about whether to vote for capital punishment  Mr  Nevin has said Eugene R  Fidell  who teaches military law at Yale Law School  said a showdown over black site evidence was foreseeable  The defense lawyers have to have the tools with which to perform their duty  especially in capital cases  No question   Mr  Fidell said   Somebody should have thought about that before they started torturing these people  He added   This was an accident waiting to happen  The only thing that surprises me is this is 2019 and the problem remains unresolved   

Here s some news you may have missed  Southeastern Africa got hit in March with a cyclone that United Nations officials say was one of the worst weather disasters to ever strike the Southern Hemisphere   Ever  is a long time  The storm swept through Mozambique  Malawi and Zimbabwe  killing hundreds  My friend Greg Carr  who runs the Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique  told me that the lions  elephants and zebras sensed the storm coming and moved to higher ground to avoid the flooding  Among the people and birds that survived  many of the former lost their homes and the latter their nests and eggs ImageBeira  the fourth largest city in Mozambique  was devastated last month by Cyclone Idai CreditMike Hutchings ReutersWhile this historic weather disaster was unfolding  President Trump was urging Republicans not to kill the Democrats  Green New Deal proposal   not because Trump wants to work with it  but because he wants to run against it in 2020 Trump wants to take the Green New Deal  co sponsored by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of the Bronx  and mock its aspiration to urgently decarbonize our electric grid  transportation sector  industries and buildings  while pairing all that with programs to ensure that every American can get a job and have access to health care and  safe  affordable  adequate housing   as well as other social goods AOC s rejoinder   For everyone who wants to make a joke about that  you may laugh  but your grandkids will not  She is right  And given the choice between a  Green New Deal  that envisions scaling justice for all and Trump s  Black New Deal   which protects profitable pollution for the 1 percent  my heart is with the greens  But my head says you can t transform our energy system and our social economic one at scale all at once  We have to prioritize energy climate  Because for the environment  later will be too late  Later is officially over And if Democrats approach this right   with a barrage of political ads paired with a focused green strategy  like the  Green Real Deal  proposed by Ernie Moniz  Barack Obama s energy secretary  and Andy Karsner  George W  Bush s assistant energy secretary for renewable energy   they can win on this issue in 2020 and make Trump the laughingstock Here are the kinds of political ads I d run The Department of Energy s 2017 U S  Energy and Employment Report revealed that solar energy was employing more workers than the traditional coal  gas and oil industries combined  But Trump says he prefers big  beautiful coal  How do your kids feel about that ImageSolar energy is part of California s future CreditDavid McNew Getty ImagesThe heartland of America s wind energy system today is Texas  Oklahoma  Kansas  Wyoming  North Dakota and Iowa  which all voted for Trump in 2016  But Trump says noise from wind turbines  causes cancer   Do you buy that Cyclone Idai devastated some of the greatest wilderness areas in Africa  Trump couldn t care less  Do you  Because another decade of storms like that  and the only lions  elephants and zebras your grandkids will ever see will be in a Disney movie Newsweek just reported that a study published in the journal Nature found that the replenishment of new coral in Australia s Great Barrier Reef  one of the true natural wonders on our planet   fell by a staggering 89 percent following two severe mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017  which were caused by significant spikes in water temperature  The two bleaching events were the worst in recorded history  leading to a catastrophic die off in many regions of the 3 800 individual reefs that comprise the world s largest reef system   Your grandkids may never see a real coral reef  Trump couldn t care less  Do you ImageBleached corals on the Great Barrier Reef in 2017 CreditGergely Torda ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesI d pound Trump with these points  but they will be effective only if married to a  Green Real Deal   For Moniz and Karsner  that would involve every state or city adopting its own version of a plan California approved last year called S B  100 S B  100  which was spearheaded by State Senator Kevin de Len  an unsung hero of the green movement  mandated that power companies steadily increase carbon free electricity on their grid until it reaches 100 percent by 2045  As David Roberts wrote for Vox  de Len kept  the bill simple and direct enough to command broad support    Somehow  everyone saw themselves in S B  100  Labor and business  nukes and renewables  markets and mandates  cats and dogs   somehow the bill hit the sweet spot  It contained enough substance to matter  but not so many bells and whistles that everyone found something to hate  The law sets a steadily rising standard for California power generation companies  50 percent renewables by 2026  60 percent renewables by 2030 and 100 percent carbon free   so as to include energy sources that aren t actually renewable  but don t emit carbon dioxide    by 2045  So wind  solar  geothermal  biomass  large hydro  nuclear power and natural gas paired with carbon capture and storage  C C S   can all play  plus whatever new clean power gets invented  And the steadily rising California standard guarantees they ll all have a growing market to sell into A Green Real Deal would be a nationwide effort to inspire and enable Democrats and sensible Republicans to come up with state and local versions of S B  100 and thereby stimulate America s earth race   not space race   to get to national net zero emissions by 2045  or earlier It could garner a lot of G O P  support in wind states  businesses could make money off it  and it would put Trump totally on the defensive As Moniz and Karsner wrote in an essay on CNBC com   Climate deniers  as well as those with demonstrably impractical  short term  feel good solutions  are moving us sideways when forward motion is essential  ImageStudents demanding action on climate change in Washington in March CreditTom Brenner Getty ImagesA Green Real Deal  they argue in The Santa Barbara Independent  would set  ambitious  but achievable  stretch goals that can be flexibly met and spur innovation and prosperity  Trump is vulnerable to a bipartisan  industry friendly plan like this  Last year  The Atlantic reported that  a coalition of 34 student groups from around the country   including 23 chapters of the College Republican   announced the formation of Students for Carbon Dividends  a bipartisan group calling for national legislation to fight climate change    It marks the first time that a coalition of College Republican groups has publicly backed a climate change policy  Glenn Prickett  founder of Rock Creek Strategies  which advises organizations and companies on how to incorporate the value of nature into economic development  remarked to me   I have been sensing something in the air that I have not felt since the late 1980s   when global warming first became prominent and Time  magazine made Planet Earth the Person of the Year   and that is that people really want the government to take this issue seriously  I have to give AOC credit for helping get it back on the agenda  Prickett added   I spent 25 years talking about what would happen if we don t address this issue  Now I have to correct myself and say what is happening   The impacts are real and they are here   but what is new is that while the politics remain polarized  business leadership is getting behind this issue and we now have the technologies to create scale solutions  I repeat  Later will be too late  So let me end where I began   with Greg Carr in Mozambique s Gorongosa Park  one million acres of wilderness  which has been protecting both wildlife and the 200 000 people living around it First of all  Carr noted by phone   nearly half of Gorongosa Park is now a lake   thanks to Cyclone Idai  but its trees and soils  acted like a giant sponge and absorbed tons of water   so flooding of communities downstream was not as bad as it could have been  Parks mitigate climate extremes   Hurricanes are going to be more of a problem  and more nature is the solution  I am talking to the government about creating another 250 000 acres of wetland conservancy to the south of us to soak up more water  because this will not be our last cyclone

LONDON   The beginning of the end of Theresa May s Brexit strategy was an emotional address to the nation in which she blamed parliament for the delay in Britain s departure from the European Union The televised speech on March 20 was one of the few times in nearly three years as prime minister that she has followed her instincts rather than the counsel of her closest aides  said a source close to May Venting her anger at parliament  which had already rejected her deal twice  she said Britain s departure had been blocked by political infighting for which she was not responsible Her move backfired  spelling the end of attempts to agree terms acceptable to hardline Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party and to Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party  which props up her minority government Twelve days later after another rejection of her deal by parliament  she did the unthinkable  She turned to the opposition Labour Party and its leader  Jeremy Corbyn  for talks to try to secure support for the deal and persuade the EU to give her more time to win parliament s backing For a woman who has spent most of her adult life campaigning for the Conservatives  it was no easy decision  But it underlined May s shifting ambitions in the pursuit of Brexit  After promising not to seek a new term as prime minister at the next election  and offering to quit sooner if parliament backs the divorce deal she agreed last year with the EU  her remaining goal is to get a deal through parliament that would allow her to leave with some kind of legacy Protecting her party s fragile unity  damaged by divisions over Brexit  was no longer the prime aim  Over the last few days people have been asking me what on earth s happening with Brexit   May said in a relaxed video address in a sitting room at her country residence on Sunday  explaining how her deal could not get through parliament   Now there s lots of things on which I disagree with the Labour Party on policy issues  but on Brexit I think there are some things we agree on     It ll mean compromise on both sides  but I believe that delivering Brexit is the most important thing for us  Authority has slipped away from May in other ways too  Exasperated lawmakers have seized control of important parts of the parliamentary agenda  passing legislation to hem her in  She has also been forced to turn to an increasingly irritated EU  where leaders meeting on Wednesday will decide on the length of any Brexit delay  while May sits outside the room and awaits their judgment BAD MOVE  BAD INSTINCTS It was never meant to be like this  But three years after Britain voted to leave the EU  that decision is mired in uncertainty As the prime minister herself says  Britain might never leave   something she believes will betray the voters who backed Brexit in a 2016 referendum  won by a margin of 52 48 percent  It would also spell a failure for her premiership But for many  she must shoulder much of the blame for the unraveling of Brexit  From losing her majority in an election she did not need to call to failing to build a consensus around a deal that pandered to both sides of the debate but persuaded neither  May has too often stubbornly stuck to just one plan It was always going to be an uphill struggle for the resilient but reserved former interior minister who hails from the Conservative Party s heartlands of southern England May took over a party and a country in crisis over Britain s relationship with the EU   an issue that helped claim the scalps of three Conservative predecessors  David Cameron  John Major and Margaret Thatcher May was seen as a steady choice to take over when Cameron quit in the chaos following the referendum She had campaigned  albeit lukewarmly  to stay in the EU but swiftly made honoring the referendum result her mission  The hope was that May could appeal to the eurosceptics and the pro EU lawmakers in her party      ZERO RESPECT For months  she papered over the cracks  offering a clean break from EU institutions for Brexit supporters  and close economic ties for remainers But by trying to please both sides  she never managed to persuade either to swallow the compromises needed to secure a deal with Brussels May won some admiration for soldiering on yet her critics say she lacked the guile to carry her party and see Brexit through Many opposition members of parliament  and more moderate members of her party  say May focused too much on appeasing hardline Conservative eurosceptics and ought to have held cross party discussions quickly to involve more sides     But the failure to do that and this focus on holding the party together  in my view is an unedifying spectacle   said one former aide Her frustration after almost two years of EU talks boiled over in her March 20 TV address   You are tired of the infighting  You are tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows   she said   You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with  I agree  I m on your side   The backlash was swift  with some lawmakers accusing May of encouraging violence against them in an unashamedly populist speech  ELECTION DISASTERIt all started to go wrong less than a year after May became prime minister When she took over  the Conservatives held a slim majority in parliament  May had always said she wouldn t call an election to reinforce her legitimacy but by early 2017 she was riding high in the polls and saw an opportunity to boost her majority and  hopefully  make the Brexit process smoother She triggered a snap election in June 2017 but it didn t go well  May was uncomfortable with a campaign which she thought was trying to make her look presidential but did  not suit her in any way   the former aide said Her poll lead dwindled and while the Conservatives did win the most seats in parliament  May lost her majority and was forced to turn to the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party  DUP  to stay in power  You can look at the election in two ways  You can say   Well  she s the PM  she should have taken control  said it wasn t working and changed it    the former aide said  Or you can say   She got the professionals in  she stood everywhere she was told to stand  said everything she was told to say  wore everything she was told to wear and did the ultimate professional job   The result left her hostage to the DUP and a group of hardline eurosceptics in her own party  which ultimately proved her undoing when it came to trying to secure parliament s agreement on the terms for leaving the EU     BACKSTOP BLUNDERThe DUP opposed any deal that risked a hard border between Northern Ireland  which is part of the United Kingdom  and Ireland  which is in the EU  It also opposed any deal that meant Northern Ireland would be treated differently to the rest of the UK as this would be tantamount to splitting up the union But when May agreed the terms of Britain s withdrawal in December 2017 it included a so called Irish backstop  a mechanism to avoid a hard border in Ireland that also risked keeping Northern Ireland alone in a customs union with the EU The DUP insisted it could not back the deal but she endorsed it anyway in November the next year Keeping the Northern Irish border open was also the main stumbling block for the eurosceptics in her party  as they feared promising close economic ties could trap Britain in the EU s sphere indefinitely When she presented a July 2018 compromise  some pro Brexit ministers balked  It was ultimately swiftly rejected by the EU Foreign minister Boris Johnson and Brexit secretary David Davis quit and his successor  Dominic Raab  also resigned over a later plan to try to square the Irish border circle     NO CARDS LEFTOver the two years of talks  European leaders often complained that they did not know what the British negotiating position was  or what London wanted  By contrast  the bloc s 27 other states presented a united front  By early 2019  May s habit of sticking to set phrases rather than shifting position to appease her critics was increasingly enraging lawmakers   A source close to Boris Johnson said that in his meetings with May  he would say  you can save Brexit  you can be a hero  but she sat silently  sometimes nodding  sometimes saying  No  no Boris  it cannot work like that  And when setbacks happened  May s independence from her party colleagues often turned into further isolation May addressed Conservative lawmakers on March 27 and offered to quit to get her deal through a third time But the DUP stuck to its guns  hardline eurosceptics refused to budge   and May lost again  Labour s Corbyn  a socialist May had often said was unfit to rule  became her last hope for a compromise that parliament could back  In the end  she may simply have been the wrong person for the job  Putting someone in charge of a project they don t believe in doesn t work   said Brexiteer Conservative lawmaker Bernard Jenkin   Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan and William James  Editing by Giles Elgood  

JERUSALEM   As Israelis get ready to go to the polls on Tuesday  a stark  fateful and long deferred choice has suddenly reappeared to confront them after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s unexpected promise to begin extending sovereignty over the West Bank if he is re elected Do voters want to make permanent their country s control over the West Bank and its 2 6 million Palestinian inhabitants  Or do they want to keep alive the possibility that a Palestinian state could be carved out there one day That question has been made newly urgent by Mr  Netanyahu  who is facing a career threatening challenge from a unified centrist party headed by a team of former army chiefs  His shocking announcement about Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank appeared to be a last ditch effort to rally his right wing base and stay in power For supporters of annexation  it is not only this week s vote that is on their minds but the American election in 2020  They call President Trump s staunch support for Israel a  historic opportunity  to proceed with annexation of some  much or even all of the West Bank   but one that comes with a ticking countdown to a possible new administration in Washington Two state proponents  while conceding that there is no way to know for sure how the Palestinians would react  say a sovereignty push would almost certainly lead to a nightmare of one kind or another for Israel  like a rise in violence and international condemnation The incremental entrenchment of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land is often called  creeping annexation   And until now it has occurred slowly enough  and piecemeal enough  to let supporters of a two state solution reassure themselves that such steps could still be undone or accounted for in future negotiations Applying sovereignty  by contrast  would be all but irreversible Whether accomplished quickly or by degrees  it is tantamount to annexation  and it would break with a quarter century old agreement  under the Oslo accords  that the status quo between Israel and the Palestinians must not be altered except through negotiations For years  Mr  Netanyahu positioned himself as a check on both sides in the debate  He placed himself to the right of supporters of a two state solution on the one hand  and to the left of those who want to annex the West Bank and see a so called Greater Israel fulfill the Zionist dream of a Jewish state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Those Israelis were once marginalized as part of the right wing fringe  But with fewer than half of Israelis still supporting a two state solution  it is the peace camp that is now out of step with the majority of society  A fast growing sovereignty movement  called Ribonut in Hebrew  has not only achieved political acceptability but has overtaken much of the powerful Israeli right wing No fewer than 60 bills pushing some form of annexation have been offered for a debate in Parliament since 2015  according to the human rights group Yesh Din  Support for declaring Israeli sovereignty over parts or all of Judea and Samaria has become the litmus test for all leaders of the right   said Michael B  Oren  a deputy minister under Mr  Netanyahu who is not running for re election  using the biblical names for the West Bank ImageThe Israeli settlement Beitar Illit in the West Bank on Sunday CreditRonen Zvulun ReutersAdherents of the sovereignty movement contend that the closer Israel has gotten to a two state solution  whether in pulling out of Gaza or in redeploying its forces out of much of the West Bank   the more death and bloodshed it has brought us  in uprisings  suicide bombings and rocket attacks  as Ribonut says on its website Every other member of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party seeking re election had already embraced annexation  Their leader was the lone holdout Saturday night  under intense pressure in a neck and neck contest with a centrist former army chief  Benny Gantz  Mr  Netanyahu gave in  Lunging further to his political right  he declared on national television that he would indeed begin to  apply sovereignty  in the West Bank  The question you re asking is an interesting one  Will we move on now to the next stage   he told an interviewer   And the answer is  yes  We will move on to the next stage  Asked if he would extend Israeli law over the so called settlement blocs   large Jewish communities built on the West Bank that even many two state supporters assume the Palestinians would give up in trade for other Israeli territory in an eventual deal for their own state   Mr  Netanyahu said he would not stop there  I m going to apply sovereignty  but I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlement points  because from my perspective every such point of settlement is Israeli   he said The morning after  few Israelis were taking Mr  Netanyahu at his word  There is a term for his 11th hour pre election surprises  the  gevalt campaign   as in the Yiddish  Oy  gevalt   used to express incredulity or weariness In 2015  Mr  Netanyahu rallied his base by sowing fears of a big turnout by Arab Israelis that would hand the government to the left  This time  many see him as trying to induce the right wing to come to his aid with a promise to fulfill a settler dream  This is Bibi being Bibi   said Daniel C  Kurtzer  a former American ambassador to Israel under Democratic and Republican presidents  using Mr  Netanyahu s nickname Mr  Gantz  along with three other leaders of his Blue and White Party  two of them also former army chiefs  all forswore any such unilateral moves on the West Bank  They said that Mr  Netanyahu was merely trying to save his political skin  and that no Israelis were foolish enough to believe him Indeed  analysts quickly speculated about the loopholes through which Mr  Netanyahu could slip free of his new commitment  dragging his feet on the promise to avoid interfering with a potential Trump peace proposal  arguing that changing circumstances made it no longer workable  or acceding only to the subtlest incremental applications of Israeli law to the territories  but nothing that equated with formal annexation Michael Koplow  an analyst for the left leaning Israel Policy Forum  likened Mr  Netanyahu s remarks to a famous 2009 speech he gave at Bar Ilan University in which  under pressure from President Barack Obama  he declared his support for a two state solution ImageIn 2009  Mr  Netanyahu  under pressure from the Obama administration  delivered a speech declaring support for a two state solution CreditGovernment of IsraelIt was a high water mark for his openness toward a Palestinian state  and he has effectively been retreating from it ever since  But the Israeli left cited it for years afterward to pressure Mr  Netanyahu to keep a two state option alive Now  Mr  Koplow said  the right will be able to squeeze Mr  Netanyahu over his televised promise to proceed with annexation moves   and I don t think he ll be able to wiggle out of it  Mr  Netanyahu is also much weaker than he was 10 years ago  He faces a likely indictment on corruption charges  including bribery  which could force him from office  He has been widely expected  if the election result gives him the chance  to try to form a governing coalition that would enact retroactive legislation preventing a sitting prime minister from being prosecuted That could set up a trade off with his coalition partners  a get out of jail free card in exchange for concrete steps on annexation  said Daniel B  Shapiro  the American ambassador to Israel under Mr  Obama  The parties he will need to form this coalition can now insist that he follow through on sovereignty  in return for protection from the indictments   Mr  Shapiro said   He ll try to provide the minimum  they ll try to extort the maximum  Mr  Shapiro added   And there s no evident check coming from the Trump administration  as there always had been under every previous administration  saying   Don t do that   In response to the rise of the sovereignty movement  two state supporters have warned loudly of a domino effect that any annexation would set in motion  whether limited to a few big settlements  the Israeli administered portion of the West Bank known as Area C  or the West Bank as a whole  It will be taken by the Palestinians  by the other Arabs and by the international community as an Israeli national decision to slam the door on a two state solution  on a negotiated agreement   said Nimrod Novik  a former senior adviser to Prime Minister Shimon Peres who sits on the executive committee of Commanders for Israel s Security  a group of retired senior military and national security officials who support a two state solution The toppling dominoes  the group predicts  would begin with a wave of West Bank violence  the refusal of Palestinian security officers to continue cooperating with Israel  the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and the necessary re occupation of the entire West Bank by the Israeli military   an operation that would take weeks and require the entire standing army  more or less Even more serious  if Palestinians in annexed territory are not granted citizenship  it could pave the way for the kind of apartheid state that two state supporters have long warned against Sovereignty proponents insist that annexation of settlement blocs like Maale Adumim or Gush Etzion would actually meet little international or Arab resistance because of the expectation that those areas would remain in Israel under a two state outcome But Mr  Koplow said this was deceptive  Once you start down this annexation road  it s not going to stop at the blocs   he insisted   And that s where the real danger comes in  If the Israeli government annexes Maale Adumim  the sky isn t going to fall  And when that happens  the next step is going to be the overreach  There ll be a big push to annex Area C  And once you do that  that s the whole ballgame

MINNEAPOLIS   When Matt Mooney was refurbishing used basketball shoes and selling them out of the trunk of his car in high school  that entrepreneurial streak looked as if it would carry him further than basketball  At the time  he had only one Division I scholarship offer When Tariq Owens was at a renowned prep school  as a bouncy  loose limbed  four star recruit  an N B A  career seemed less like a pipe dream than a reasonable career path  College would serve as finishing school But several years  and universities  later  there they were last weekend in Anaheim  Calif   with fists clenched and arms raised triumphantly overhead  as unlikely teammates   and improbable one season catalysts   in helping Texas Tech reach the Final Four for the first time Mooney and Owens arrived at Texas Tech less than a year ago as a less heralded type of one and done player  having taken advantage of the N C A A  s graduate transfer rule  which allows athletes who have earned a degree and have eligibility remaining to switch colleges without having to sit out a year The graduate transfer rule  the rare N C A A  regulation that gives leverage to the athlete  has been used by hundreds of players since it was relaxed in 2011  And at a moment when athletic admission graft  shoe company payola and questions about whether a transcendent  and unpaid  figure like Zion Williamson should even risk playing college basketball at all  the graduate transfer rule casts the beleaguered N C A A  as reasonable and almost munificent It is also a rule that may not last much longer In two weeks  the N C A A  s primary legislative body  the Division I Council  will vote on a measure that could severely restrict graduate transfers  The proposed rule change would require that colleges accepting graduate transfers be docked a scholarship the next year if the transfer does not earn his secondary degree within a year So as graduate transfers have continued to increase   there were 124 this season in men s basketball  according to the website GradTransferTracker  including a handful who were key contributors on N C A A  tournament teams   and as programs have found value in them as a quick fix that suits both team and player  the new rule is seeking to discourage them by effectively adding a tax on programs that accept such players  That s really draconian   Rodney Fort  a sports economist and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan  said of the rule change   This is like losing a scholarship from an N C A A  penalty  ImageReid Travis  left  made an immediate impact at Kentucky as a graduate transfer  but his coach  John Calipari  right  has advocated limits on them in the past CreditJeff Roberson Associated PressThe proposal  which could go into effect as soon as Aug  1  would apply to only three sports   football  women s basketball and men s basketball   but appears particularly aimed at men s basketball  Football teams  with 85 scholarships  are far more capable of coping with the loss of a single scholarship than a men s basketball squad  which has 13  And there are roughly twice as many graduate transfers each year in men s basketball as in women s basketball Justin Sell  the athletic director at South Dakota State who led the Division I transfer working group that developed the proposal  said that too often graduate transfers in men s basketball and football had little interest in obtaining graduate degrees  We really want to protect against the football player who is done and leaves in December and the basketball player who is done and leaves in March   Sell said   A lot of students are looking to use it to play another year  Who s seriously there for the master s  Sell said that the committee surveyed athletic directors  faculty representatives  senior woman administrators  coaches and athletes over 18 months  Still  the fingerprints of basketball coaches in the working group s recommendation were not hard to miss  The lone men s basketball voice on the committee was St  Joseph s Coach Phil Martelli  who in a widely publicized 2011 case blocked one of his graduating players from transferring by refusing to sign a release  Partially as a result of that case  releases are no longer required   Martelli  who was fired by St  Joseph s last month  declined to comment through a university spokesman  The rule itself seems to have come straight from the mouth of Kentucky Coach John Calipari  who suggested to ESPN in 2016   long before the committee began its work   that  if the kid gets his grad degree in one year  fine  if he doesn t  you ve got to use the scholarship for two years  Sell conceded objections about practicality  many graduate programs take two years to complete  and fairness  the rule does not apply to athletes who compete as graduate students without transferring  were fair  but said his group s intent was to  manage behavior   When you re trying to manage behavior and put together policies and rules in trying to create ethical behavior and integrity  there are challenges to that   Sell said   It s really hard to police integrity  But the rule change leaves no room to assess the motivations of players who  degrees in hand  seek new horizons with their remaining eligibility  The Ivy League  for example  does not allow its teams to play graduate students  that led the former Yale guard Makai Mason   who had missed his junior season with a broken foot   to help Baylor to the N C A A  tournament this spring  The rule also gave the former Stanford player Reid Travis the opening he needed to take his N B A  hopes  and his final year of eligibility  to Kentucky for some postgraduate basketball education ImageTariq Owens  above

spring  I kind of wanted a different experience   said Crandall  who said he had sought out Mooney  whom he had met when Mooney was at South Dakota  for advice on the transfer process  Crandall is working toward a master s degree in organizational leadership at Gonzaga but said he took a lighter course load  two classes per semester  so that he could focus on basketball  Honestly  I m actually enjoying it a lot more than I did undergrad   Crandall said before the Zags lost to Mooney s Red Raiders in the West Region final last weekend   There s a lot more discussion that goes into it  a lot more adult feel  This is more tailored to what you find interesting  Gonzaga s Crandall said he was only vaguely aware of the proposed restrictions on graduate transfers  But he did not like the idea that a rule change might deny future players the path he had chosen  Whether it s good or bad  the N C A A  tries to take a lot of control away from players   he said   You commit to a school and they tell you they want you to play and help you get your degree  so I feel like once you get your degree your obligations are kind of fulfilled  Nearly 40 percent of Division I men s basketball players who arrive from high school will transfer by the end of their sophomore year  according to N C A A  data from 2011 to 2017  Owens and Mooney  now in the Final Four  were in that group Owens left

On a recent afternoon  the Hot Topic store at the King of Prussia Mall  outside of Philadelphia  teemed with teenagers  20 somethings and stroller pushing parents  The shoppers sifted through racks of  Harry Potter  plush dolls   Riverdale  sweaters and  Kiki s Delivery Service  jewelry  seeking the perfect physical manifestation of their   or their child s   fandom Demitri Benton  19  of Reading  Pa   had come to browse the shop s  Deadpool  offerings   It s usually the first or maybe second place I come to   he said   It has so many things that you probably wouldn t be able to find in any other store as far as  like  anime  video games  TV shows  Former mall goths  punks and emo kids may remember the store differently  In the  90s and early aughts  one did not so much enter as descend into Hot Topic  The suburban shopping center staple was dungeonlike  with hellish gates that led shoppers into a dark commercial corridor  Inside  a wall of T shirts emblazoned with the names of rock bands and irreverent sayings was flanked by piles of studded belts and rubber bracelets  Manic Panic hair dye could be purchased in a wide range of parent infuriating hues  Often the shopping experience was set to a blaring soundtrack of Nine Inch Nails and My Chemical Romance  whose frontman   fun fact   once worked at Hot Topic   The massive T shirt display is still there  and so is much of the infernal darkness   Literally I have seen people run to the door  and their parents steer them away and say   They worship Satan  we can t go in there    said Alexis Monkiewicz  a key holder at the King of Prussia location  But these days  the store known for inciting parental panic is also home to a dizzying array of obsessions  There s merch for die hard fans of BTS  Billie Eilish and Black Sabbath stocked alongside collectibles designed for those who love My Little Pony  Care Bears and the Disney princesses  They ve even turned the lights up a bit ImageThe Willowbrook Mall Hot Topic in Wayne  N J   in 2009 CreditRobert Wright for The New York TimesImageThe store has since traded in its fiery red logo for a more sober block lettered one  as seen here at the Westfield Garden State Plaza location CreditPat O Malley for The New York TimesThough Hot Topic has not publicly disclosed its financials since the private equity firm Sycamore Partners acquired it in June 2013 for about  600 million  the brand s endurance in the narrowing market of juniors apparel suggests that the brighter  broader inventory is selling   Sycamore Partners declined to comment for this article   The company s sustained brick and mortar presence may also indicate its health amid reports of record high mall vacancies and closures  Hot Topic currently operates 676 stores in the United States and Canada  up from 662 locations in 2014  in addition to an online store where one can buy goods from hundreds of entertainment franchises In a 2018 report  the youth marketing research firm YPulse found that Gen Z and millennial shoppers deemed Hot Topic the top retail destination for  unique styles   with Nike coming in second   What Hot Topic has managed to do really amazingly   and quietly   is to pivot their products and their brand perception to cater to the next generation and what they re most interested in   said MaryLeigh Bliss  the vice president of content at Ypulse   They have completely kept up with what young consumers want  Steve Vranes  the C E O  of Hot Topic since June 2016  said that he had watched the company s evolution  from afar  through his work in retail before he joined the company  His rsum includes the children s clothier Gymboree and Urbio  a design company that manufactures vertical gardens   I knew it had changed a little bit and had gone from being considered solely as more of a goth brand to really evolving to be a much broader set of products over time   Mr  Vranes said   It s kind of organically continued to change all the time  and I think that s part of why we re successful  We continue to question every single year   What do customers want that they re not getting anywhere else   ImageStudded belts  bright colored hair dye and all sorts of fandom adjacent jewelry are sold at Hot Topic CreditPat O Malley for The New York TimesImageCreditPat O Malley for The New York TimesImageRobert Calvo  an employee  dresses the part CreditPat O Malley for The New York TimesWhat they want  it seems  is merch  and Hot Topic has plenty  According to a company representative  more than 75 percent of Hot Topic s products are the result of agreements with intellectual property owners  including record labels and entertainment studios  to license their official merchandise  That means you can buy an Ariana Grande  Sweetener  T shirt on the artist s website  if you want  Or you can buy it on hottopic com  where you won t get a digital album download with your purchase  but you ll spend less money Hot Topic has always been home to affordable fan gear  Orv and LeAnn Madden  who started the store out of their Southern California garage in October 1989  sold  The Nightmare Before Christmas  stockings and  South Park  stickers when those franchises had but nascent fandoms  Hot Topic was also among the first youth retailers to offer plus size options  which sold so well that the company started a plus size label  Torrid  in 2001  Seeing a growth opportunity  Sycamore Partners spun off Torrid into its own company in 2015   Such investments have been key to Sycamore s success   and caused the ire of some interested parties  Hot Topic Inc  bondholders sued Sycamore in 2017 for what they described as an  insider scheme  to profit from the company s  crown jewel   Hot Topic s wholesale catering to fans likely began around 2004  said Ed Labay  the vice president of merchandise  That was the year  Napoleon Dynamite  became a cultural phenomenon   Hot Topic s  Vote for Pedro  T shirts flew off the shelves   and when  Mr  Labay said   we really started to see these pop culture moments hit in a much bigger way than I think they ever had before  The company experienced another surge in 2008  when  Twilight  fans were treated with in store events and merchandise around the first film s release  But even Edward Cullen couldn t inoculate Hot Topic against the retail apocalypse that has roiled physical stores and shopping centers since the Great Recession  That same year  the company announced a music discovery platform  ShockHound  which never took off and cost the company at least  3 million  In late 2010  The Los Angeles Times reported on a financial dip at Hot Topic that led to staff cuts and store closures   Hot Topic was not immune to the broader consumer spending slowdown during the recession   Mr  Vranes said Ultimately those losses were cause to think bigger  not smaller  In 2012  Hot Topic began a partnership with Her Universe  a women s wear company for  fangirls   then acquired it in 2016  In 2015  Hot Topic Inc  founded BoxLunch  another chain offering licensed and unlicensed fan merchandise  The brand also established a presence at Comic Con in San Diego  Los Angeles and New York  For years  Hot Topic has been a sponsor of a  geek couture  fashion show at San Diego s Comic Con with Her Universe The company still relies heavily on in store sales  In a recent credit analysis  Moody s projected that Hot Topic would see  modest  revenue growth in 2019  in part from the uptick in its e commerce sector  its reasonable prices  the average cost per item is  12  and the promotional surges surrounding big ticket movie releases ImageThe store is still associated with rock and alternative acts  like Marilyn Manson  and employees like Haley Karlich  above  are encouraged to make their fan affiliations known CreditPat O Malley for The New York TimesImageMerchandise for Nickelodeon shows and Disney movies is displayed alongside T shirts for bands like AC DC and the Rolling Stones CreditPat O Malley for The New York TimesThe expansion of Hot Topic s mandate has helped keep the company afloat in an uncertain retail landscape  It is also evocative of a cultural shift  Now people can be a part of many fan communities  even seemingly divergent ones  and be taken seriously   When we were in our early teens  you had to label yourself as something  You were a punk  or a jock  or you listened to hip hop  That was your whole identity   said T J  Petracca  a founder of the roving party Emo Nite  which licenses some of its merchandise to Hot Topic  These days  he said   if you like Drake  you can also like Panic  at the Disco  There s not as much separation as there used to be  The specific density of objects and apparel within the stores conveys that  too  Mr  Labay likened Hot Topic s layout to the inside of  a teen s mind   or a constantly updating social media feed  Mr  Vranes said that the store  is a reflection of all of the changes from a content perspective  and all of the access that fans have to these different properties and bands and artists and shows    His fandom of choice is  Game of Thrones   The internet  especially Tumblr  has helped bring these worlds together  It has also changed the meaning of community for fans across the pop culture spectrum  The ability to connect over the internet  said Susan Kresnicka  who runs the business anthropology firm Kresnicka Research   Insights  changed  what made you feel like an outsider and slightly abnormal in a previous era  into a means of connecting with other obsessed fans   If you can go online and find that there are people all over this world that are fans of this one little idiosyncratic television show that you happen to love with all your heart  you don t feel quite so weird or not mainstream yourself   Ms  Kresnicka said For teenagers who don t have the money to attend concerts or Comic Con  and particularly for those who don t live in urban areas  Hot Topic s stores function as critical meeting places   The presence of Hot Topic in malls is related to the presence of convention   said Louisa Stein  an associate professor of film and media culture at Middlebury College   There s a place you can go and kind of have your fan identity acknowledged in physical space and see other fans in that space with you  The company also frequently holds contests where people can submit T shirt designs for movie and TV merch  The winners  artworks are sold in stores nationwide Image Supernatural   represented by the two T shirts at top left  was at the center of a Hot Topic fan controversy CreditPat O Malley for The New York TimesImageMeghan Sobers Tilli  a Hot Topic employee  stans Metallica CreditPat O Malley for The New York TimesThe conversations between fans and Hot Topic can be highly specific  In the fall of 2018  the retailer caused a stir by listing a T shirt on its website as  Destiel   a portmanteau of two  Supernatural  characters  Dean and Castiel  whose onscreen chemistry is the subject of much fan fiction  as well as contention   The dedication of the  Supernatural  fandom is largely what has kept the show on the air for 14 seasons despite poor ratings  and the show s writers have been known to make cheeky references to fan theories in scripts   Supernatural  is now set to end after its 15th season  Hot Topic was seen to be taking a side in the dispute by naming the shirt Destiel  and fans feverishly discussed whether the show would pursue a more explicit Destiel story line  said Rachel Aparicio  a media and gender studies scholar at Kresnicka Research   Insights  and a  Supernatural  fan herself   It definitely signaled a shift to me in watching how the company is engaging with fandom  and doing it at a level that is very insider with something like that   she said  To wit  On one  Supernatural  episode  Castiel buys a younger character a plush toy and says   I got it at the Hot Topical   Hot Topic then began selling shirts that read   I got it at the Hot Topical    Hot Topic has since pulled the Destiel shirt  When asked  Mr  Labay said he  cannot confirm or deny  that he knows anything about it  Some may call it a niche reference  But for fans  that s the whole point Keep retail weird R I P  Warped Tour  At Least We Still Have Vans July 3  2018

Lori Loughlin  the former TPG executive Bill McGlashan and the former Pimco C E O  Douglas Hodge The new charges carry tougher penalties than the first wave of accusations of mail and wire fraud  The original charges command a fine of at least  250 000  while money laundering involves fines of  500 000 or twice the value of the property involved Some legal experts think jail time is possible for these defendants  Duncan Levin  a former federal prosecutor  told the WaPo that money laundering charges are  one of the most powerful weapons  that the Justice Department can wield in court  and can lead to much longer sentences than simpler fraud charges The new charges may be an attempt to force cooperation  legal commentators added  Some defendants  including the actress Felicity Huffman and the onetime corporate lawyer Gordon Caplan  said this week that they would plead guilty to the lesser wire fraud charges  They haven t been charged with money laundering Mr  McGlashan still plans to

Make your way around Natchez  Miss   and you get the sense that if some people ever got really close to living like European aristocrats in the United States  it happened there  The town  which overlooks the Mississippi River  has perhaps the greatest concentration of splendid antebellum mansions in the country   Economic historians will tell you that Natchez was the richest town per capita in the United States from about 1820 to 1860   said Mimi Miller  executive director of the Historic Natchez Foundation Most of those fortunes were wiped out by the Civil War  but Ms  Miller believes that Natchez itself  with all its grand homes  was spared largely because  Natchez voted against secession   Not that its elite were opposed to slavery   most of their fortunes were built on cotton  and thus on slave labor   but  as Ms  Miller put it  the town s leading citizens recognized that  secession was bad for business   and crazy   Even today  she said  you rarely see Confederate flags there Instead  many proud Natchezians honor their heritage   and  in some cases  subsist   by preserving their big old houses and opening them to the public  some year round  many more during annual spring and fall pilgrimages  ImageMost of Natchez rests on top of a bluff overlooking the Mississippi  but one neighborhood  at its base  is known as Natchez under the Hill CreditSara Essex Bradley for The New York Times Natchez is a blue dot in a red state   Ms  Miller explained  and  like most living  breathing contradictions  it has a complex and compelling back story  You could say the town is even more riddled with history than it is with Old South manors and manners  And since so much of Natchez is counterintuitive  it makes an odd kind of sense that the best place to start exploring its history is the last stop for so many of its residents  the city cemetery  It was established in 1822  on 10 acres  today it comprises around 110  verdant meadows infiltrated with hills and speckled with big old trees  some of which are  true to archetype  dripping with Spanish moss  Not everyone buried there   and no one knows how many people that may be   was rich  of course  But the rich are the easiest to spot  Just look for the really big pillars  like the one for Frederick Stanton  1794 1859   His epitaph   We walk by faith and not by sight   seems ironic considering that his stone  which sits atop a hill  can be seen from just about anywhere on the grounds   Just like his house dominates the town  his marker dominates the cemetery   Ms  Miller noted  That house  Stanton Hall  completed in 1858  occupies an entire city block The pillars naturally draw the eye  but the best stories can be found on more modest markers  There are veterans of the Revolutionary War  and explorers  and artists  and gamblers  and the founder of the state s first newspaper  And there are some who  even in such company  stand out ImageDon Jos Vidal was laid to rest in the  Old Catholic  section of the cemetery CreditSara Essex Bradley for The New York TimesHere Reposeth the remains of Don JOS VIDAL Who was Born in the city of Corua  Spain March 12  1765 DIED In New Orleans on the 22  of July 1828 Natchez was founded by the French in 1716   two years before New Orleans   and appropriated  after the French and Indian War  by the British  But the Spanish  who in turn seized it from the otherwise occupied British in 1779  had the greatest impact on colonial Natchez  even though they only held it for 19 years before ceding it to the Americans  It was the Spanish who laid out Natchez in its current form  They even installed a cotton gin there in 1795   just two years after Eli Whitney invented the machine in Georgia  The Anglo settlers loved the Spanish   Ms  Miller said   They spoke of the Spanish days as the Golden Days  no taxation  liberal land grants   Don Jos  who reposeth beneath a respectable but hardly ostentatious column  was the secretary to Manuel Gayoso de Lemos  the last Spanish governor of Natchez  the town of Vidalia  La   just across the Mississippi  is named for him  The Don is interred in the cemetery s Plat 1  or the  Old Catholic  section  It has  Ms  Miller said   some of the oldest graves   and the most poorly cared for  Read more about visiting MississippiThe Freedom Trail in Mississippi Is a Chronicle of Outrage and CourageSept  10

TimesIN MEMORY OF WILLIAM JOHNSON BORN 1809 IN NATCHEZ MISS  DEPARTED THIS LIFE JUNE 17  1851 He was murdered   Ms  Miller said of the man buried beneath this very large  flat rectangular stone slab  also in Plat 1   Over a land dispute   The Natchez Courier denounced  a horrible and deliberate murder  that was  committed upon an excellent and most inoffensive man  who held  a respected opinion on account of his character  intelligence and deportment   It noted   We observed very many of our most respected citizens at his funeral   Johnson left a wife  nine children  and quite a handsome property  probably twenty to thirty thousand dollars   He owned plantations  a thriving barbershop  and slaves And he was black He was born a slave  The man who owned him  also presumed to have been his father  emancipated him at  age 11  an act Mississippi made very difficult and later banned  William Johnson s status as a free man of color  as one of Natchez s more respected and successful businessmen and as a slaveholder are remarkable  but not unique  What really makes him special is that he kept a meticulously detailed diary  It s a record of loans he made and game he bagged  local events  lots of brawls  and gossip  lots of feuds   In that regard  it s about as scrupulous an eye level account of antebellum Natchez as you will find  But it can also be a harrowing read  knowing what fate had in store for its author  and contemplating the peculiar existence of a black slaveholder  He had tried to train one of his slaves  Steven  as a barber  but it didn t take  To day has been to me a very Sad Day  many tears was in my Eyes to day On acct  of my selling poor Steven   I felt hurt but Liquor is the Cause of his troubles  I would not have parted with Him if he had Only Let Liquor alone but he Cannot do it I believe   Mr  Johnson s significance to history is confirmed by the fact that his house in town is today a museum run by the National Park Service  his significance to his contemporaries is confirmed by the fact that his and his family s graves are surrounded by those of other prominent families of Natchez  all of whom were white  Natchez s cemetery was  like others throughout the South  racially segregated    but unlike those others  Ms  Miller explained  in Natchez s  it wasn t always adhered to   Other African Americans are buried throughout the cemetery  too ImageThe tombstone of Rosalie Beekman  daughter of Aaron and Fanny Beekman  who died in 1862 CreditSara Essex Bradley for The New York Times<U+05E4> <U+05E0>

THE SOLE VICTIM OF THE BOMBARDMENT OF NATCHEZ  BY THE U S  NAVY  SEPT 2d 1862 Natchez wasn t entirely spared during the Civil War  but responsibility for its one instance of bloodshed lies squarely with locals  not the Yankees  On Sept  2  1862  the Union gunboat Essex docked at Natchez to take on some ice for its wounded sailors  No one in town seemed to mind except  a group of retired men  sort of a home guard   they called themselves  the Silver Grays    Ms  Miller said  her voice tinged with contempt   They got upset  and overreacted  and fired at them  The Essex retaliated  and shelled the city of Natchez   Some buildings were hit  miraculously  there was only one casualty  7 year old Rosalie Beekman  the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Germany  We had a large wave of Jewish immigration starting about 1840   Ms  Miller explained   from the French German regions of Europe   Along with an earlier wave of English and Scottish craftsmen  she said  these Jewish immigrants  had the largest impact on the town   They were  for the most part  merchants  the community grew and grew  attracting more immigrants from Central and later Eastern Europe  Their names can still be found embedded in sidewalks and painted on buildings  The handsome domed synagogue they built downtown  Temple B nai Israel  is still in use  though few members of the congregation remain  Many more can be found in several Jewish sections in the cemetery  Rosalie rests in the  Old Jewish  section  which dates to 1844  Her parents  who lived into the 20th century  can be found in a newer section  laid out atop what is called Jewish Hill It s said that as Aaron Beekman and his family were running for shelter from the bombardment  he saw his daughter fall  and urged her to get up  I can t  Papa   she replied   I m killed  ImageNo one knows where Louise came from  but after she fell gravely ill and died  a Presbyterian minister buried her CreditSara Essex Bradley for The New York TimesLOUISE THE UNFORTUNATE There was a lot of unfortunate in Natchez back when  You didn t have to be murdered by a greedy neighbor or shelled by a Union gunboat to die before your time  as another marker near Louise s attests  It commemorates Joseph Eisley s wife and five children  all of whom died of yellow fever within one week in 1853  When Eisley himself passed away  39 years later  someone chiseled his name  in a humbler font  at the bottom of that long list As for Louise  she worked down by the river  where unfortunate dwelt in abundance  While most of Natchez rests atop a bluff overlooking the Mississippi  one neighborhood  at its base  is known as Natchez under the Hill  Today it s just a few blocks of gift shops and fun but not too raucous pubs  back in the day  though  it was much larger  with a rather colorful reputation  As Joseph Holt Ingraham  a New Englander who visited Natchez in the early 1830s  wrote in his 1835 account  The South West  by a Yankee   Like the celebrated  Five Points  in New York   Natchez under the Hill   as it has been aptly named  has extended its fame throughout the United States  in wretched rhyme and viler story  For many years it has been the nucleus of vice upon the Mississippi  Steamships were constantly docking at and shipping out from the landings at Natchez under the Hill  The streets were lined with grog shops  gambling dens and bordellos  and teemed at all hours with stevedores  sailors  gangs and thieves  And prostitutes No one knows where Louise came from or how she ended up in Natchez  but at some point  she fell gravely ill   likely with consumption   and a number of her co workers implored a Presbyterian minister  Joseph Buck Stratton  to pay her a call   I would have shrunk from it   Mr  Stratton wrote in his diary in May 1849   but the friends wished me to be with them and I stayed for their good and my own  to see the Prostitute die   it was a death that gives no tangible ground for hope  Mr   Stratton buried Louise and commissioned her stone  It s not known how many others like her are interred throughout the cemetery  Most  it is presumed  have no marker at all ImageThere aren t many cemeteries where pets  in this case the St  Bernard Eva Marie  are regularly buried alongside their owners CreditSara Essex Bradley for The New York TimesIN LOVING MEMORY OF EVA MARIE OUR ST  BERNARD

and Robert Everett Canon chose for their stone   Bob and Newt   Ms  Miller told me with a smile   Most people just called them  The Boys at the Briars   In 2016  shortly after Mississippi passed a law allowing individuals  businesses and organizations to deny service to LGBT customers  Natchez issued its own statement referencing the new ordinance and declaring  without reservation  that all were welcome in their city  Natchez   Ms  Miller said   marches to its own drummer  Always  The 2019 Spring Pilgrimage runs through April 16 Richard Rubin is the author of  The Last of the Doughboys  and
