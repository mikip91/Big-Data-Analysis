barbaroDirty laundry aired subject dirty laundry charged crime michael schmidtIf meet incredibly high bar bringing federal prosecution mean get take trash throw street let public rummage michael barbaroAnd Mike contemporary example referred assuming talking James Comey michael schmidtI talking July 2016 press conference James Comey held right heat presidential election stands says done investigation Hillary Clinton use private email account think case made But found questionable behavior handled sensitive national security secrets The press conference seen damaging Clinton even though case never made michael barbaroAnd saying Barr view going one replicate drawing Mueller team summaries putting public sphere michael schmidtCorrect use criminal investigations find damaging things may crimes simply release public used someone nicholas fandosThe problem never normal average criminal investigation broad national security implications And implications almost every decision made highest levels government michael schmidtThis pathway deal president conduct And appears Mueller side saying look president United States There conduct think public Congress see And Justice Department may criminal But president And needs examined thoroughly political process Congress pathway dealing president nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr seem disagree fundamentally throughout wants make much report public possible But think absolves Justice Department role saying whether president campaign broke law And grappling Justice Department aversion talk individuals saying broke law But yet knows public Congress probably owed information happen And kind operating somewhere middle two things michael schmidtThe difference investigation Justice Department determined break law process really needs dealt Maybe company needs decide whether get fired conduct instance another issue president president break law But maybe president things power public know Congress know need closely examined Because maybe breaking law conducted president And Congress need deal And starting see Mueller side frustration hey think bad stuff happened But Barr coming disclosing saying president break law casting die public later look president conduct say several weeks finished report thing Bill Barr saying president break law president turning around saying fully exonerated And saying hey America think process needs play michael barbaroRight michael schmidtSo comes vexing question investigate sitting president And done way public utmost confidence And tension much independence investigator Nixon pendulum swung far president direction Starr investigation Clinton went way The investigator much power And Mueller Barr teams fighting fight different understandings dealt And issue looking years latest episode michael barbaroSo inside one presidential investigation two teams embodying tensions basically present since Watergate nicholas fandosCorrect michael schmidtIt much tell public apparent misconduct president dealt And clear pathway whatever Barr viewed one side political laying brakes president Whatever Mueller viewed president enemies trying get And confidence process erodes And messy And hard figure What real facts What really happened michael barbaroBut point talking summary Bill Barr sent Congress still waiting full report tension describing eventually less resolved

The Labor Department released proposal Monday limit claims big companies employment law violations franchisees contractors The proposal seeks define example employees locally owned McDonald restaurant challenge McDonald Corporation compliance minimum wage overtime laws The proposal require day public comment period finalized affect ability millions workers pursue wage claims concept called joint employment Franchisees contractors small poorly capitalized operations complicating efforts recover wages illegally denied Instead efforts often directed large companies employers relationships This proposal reduce uncertainty joint employer status clarify workers responsible employment protections labor secretary Alexander Acosta statement abrupt shift McDonald last week longer lobby minimum wage increases The proposal sharp departure joint employer criteria Labor Department laid 2016 Obama administration Under guidelines company McDonald held liable minimum wage violations committed franchisee even directly supervise workers hire fire Exerting forms indirect control providing software developing policies franchisee relies make larger corporation liable The Obama Labor Department argued corporations joint employers even without exercising control franchisee contractor simply smaller companies economically dependent example upstream company top supply chain provided facilities handled payroll contractor The new proposal substantially restricts situations franchiser McDonald considered liable example laid Labor Department global hotel brand held liable minimum wage overtime violations local franchisee committed even franchisee relied variety material provided hotel chain sample employment applications sample employee handbooks Through proposal Department Labor chance undo one harmful regulatory actions past administration replace rule creates certainty America 733 000 franchise businesses Matthew Haller senior vice president International Franchise Association statement expanded joint employer standard held back tens billions dollars economic output year due proliferation frivolous lawsuits precipitating significant changes way franchise brands interact local owners According new proposal four factors involved establishing joint employment whether upstream company exercises power hire fire employees whether supervises controls schedules whether sets pay whether keeps employment records company engage activities unlikely deemed joint employer Critics accused department laying step step guide employers seeking get hook violations even substantial control workers hired franchisees contractors provided obvious road map employers evade liability Sharon Block former top official Obama Labor Department executive director Labor Worklife Program

comes moment political peril Acosta dogged allegations office negotiated unduly lenient plea agreement sex trafficking case United States attorney South Florida decade ago The defendant financier Jeffrey Epstein accused sex offenses involving girls young pleaded guilty minor prostitution charges Some Democrats called Acosta resignation Republicans called investigations matter Acosta viewed especially vulnerable partly constituency normally rallied support Republican labor secretary business groups management lawyers complained slow step back important Obama era policies offer

Department Health Human Services Some employer concerns subsided Labor Department efforts recent weeks first plan overtime eligibility signals partial retreat Obama era rule court struck joint employer proposal The latest proposal part broader debate playing National Labor Relations Board employers held liable violations committed franchisees contractors Because board oversees right unionize take types collective action joint employer doctrine determines whether companies liable say franchisee illegally fires worker retaliation trying organize union Under doctrine set board Obama administration company considered joint employer exercises direct indirect control workers hired franchisee contractor But board Republican majority considering proposal narrow standard control substantial direct immediate Tammy McCutchen lawyer management side law firm Littler Mendelson top labor official George Bush administration believed two agencies effectively synchronizing joint employment rules companies face comparable standards liability regardless type violation She argued Labor Department essentially returning pre Obama doctrine affirmed many times federal courts The Obama era Labor Department cherry picking find legal precedent position McCutchen But David Weil Obama administration official whose division produced 2016 guidance topic whatever rulings courts
