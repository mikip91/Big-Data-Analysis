Donald Trump s lie filled rage tweets about Puerto Rico this week over disaster aid continue a Trump pattern that mirrors a method that white supremacists have used throughout American history  Particularly present since Reconstruction  this method involves proclaiming that minorities lack the character and capacity to create effective government  and therefore minority led jurisdictions are a hopeless drain on resources He tweeted that Puerto Rico s government  can t do anything right  and that the island s politicians are  incompetent or corrupt  and only  complain and ask for more money   which they spend  foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA   He specifically called the mayor of San Juan  crazed and incompetent  Point of fact  Puerto Rico is part of the United States  It is a territory  Its citizens are U S  citizens  The structure of Trump s comments leaves open the possibility that he doesn t know that  or conversely  knows it but doesn t fully accept it or care about it If this were a one off spat with politicians opposed to his conduct  one might reasonably write Trump s comments off as politics as usual  Instead  this questioning of the competence of black and brown leaders is not anomaly but motif Trump has spent nearly a decade now trying to paint Barack Obama as not only an illegitimate president  but also as an inept  lazy  embarrassing one  He has called him a  sick    weak    incompetent leader  with a  horrible attitude  who  looks and sounds so ridiculous    has disastrous judgment   is  a total failure  and was  perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States  Worse than the white supremacist Andrew Johnson  who did his best to obstruct Reconstruction  opposed the 14th Amendment and was impeached  Worse than Trump s slave owning hero Andrew Jackson  whose Indian Removal Act led to the Trail of Tears  Worse than slave owning John Tyler  who during his time in Congress argued against the Missouri Compromise  which would restrain the spread of the  peculiar institution   Worse than Millard Fillmore  who backed the protection of Southern slavery in the Compromise of 1850  which delayed Southern secession  Worse than Richard Nixon  who was forced from office  Worse than George W  Bush  who lied this country into the war in Iraq  Worse than Trump himself Let s submit that Trump has in some ways been an equal opportunity offender and gone after all his political opponents to some degree   he incessantly called Hillary Clinton  crooked  and Bernie Sanders  crazy  Still  that doesn t fully account for the particular consistency with which he attacks minority leaders and minority led entities as inadequate  ineffective and incompetent According to Trump  former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was  totally unqualified  and would  destroy  the state of Georgia  Abrams is a star  and the way that state s election was handled will do more to destroy it than Abrams ever could According to Trump  former Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum was  a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee  said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country   There is no evidence of theft by Gillum  and Tallahassee isn t the most corrupt city According to Trump  legendary Congressman John Lewis s district  is in horrible shape and falling apart   It is not  PolitiFact rated Trump s claim  mostly false  Even majority black and majority brown countries around the globe have been condemned and dismissed by Trump in this way  Haiti  El Salvador and African countries are  shithole countries   Mexico has a  totally corrupt gov t   and it is sending  animals  and  rapists  across the border Yet he has lobbed praise at strongmen   mostly in Europe and Asia   for being great leaders  Think Russia and North Korea  Western nations have also piqued his anger when they have not been sufficiently ruthless with their minority populations  He said that Britain was  trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem   and Germany  is going through massive attacks to its people by the migrants allowed to enter the country   But Trump still maintains  a great feeling for Germany   That feeling is apparently so great that he keeps lying that his father  Fred Trump  was born there  like he did again this week  Fred Trump was born in New York  To me  this marking of minorities as incapable of good governance harkens back to the Reconstruction period  when white supremacists promoted racist caricatures of newly elected black legislators acting uncouth as a way to fuel an angry backlash  This shows up in newspaper illustrations and in the film  The Birth of a Nation   in which black legislators   eating  drinking and some without shoes   are shown in a state of chaos These white supremacists  many wealthy and powerful  used the threat of  black domination  to scare poorer whites into allegiance  warning them of race mixing  miscegenation and the rape of white women and girls  They also warned about the crude attempt of black people to be civilized and judicious This is very similar to what Trump tweeted this week  trying to pit suffering farmers in the Midwest against suffering Puerto Rican hurricane survivors Trump tweeted that  Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane  more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before  That  of course  was just another lie  As The New York Times reported In fact  FEMA and other agencies have so far distributed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion in aid has been allocated  while  91 billion is the budget office s estimate of how much the island could receive over the next two decades The farmers are mostly old  white men  As Modern Farmer pointed out in 2014 More than 92 percent of the country s 2 1 million farmers are non Hispanic whites  and more than 86 percent of those farm operators are men  The average age of farmers  which has been rising for decades  continued to inch up  In 2012  the average farmer was 58 3 years old  up from 57 1 years in 2007 Puerto Rico is 99 percent Hispanic Trump made his point clear  The mismanagement and incompetence of these brown people amount to stealing resources from these white people  As he tweeted   Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments  and so little appreciation  The brown people were supposed to be thankful that white daddy in  the States  was helping them at all  As Trump tweeted   The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J  Trump  This is the kind of paternalistic white supremacy that doesn t even require open hostility  although plenty often accompanies it  The logic goes this way  Everyone is better off  even minorities  when white people are in charge and calling the shots This is part of what drew so many white voters to Trump  whether they admit it or not  He promised to destroy  erase or replace everything President Obama had done  thereby fixing the glitch in the narrative that the only true and good leaders of America were white leaders  In the white supremacist imagination  even this horrendous white leader is better than the most educated  articulate and erudite black man That logic also says to people like the Puerto Ricans that even in their suffering  minorities are better off being part of this country This reminds me of a letter Robert E  Lee wrote to his wife in 1856 in which he said  The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa  morally  socially   physically  The painful discipline they are undergoing  is necessary for their instruction as a race  and I hope will prepare and lead them to better things  How long their subjugation may be necessary is known and ordered by a wise Merciful Providence  For all minorities in America  the subjugation continues  particularly now that Trump wants to dictate who is worthy of assistance and who should be allowed to suffer Trump Lashes Out Again at Puerto Rico  Bewildering the IslandApril 2  2019The Times is committed to publishing a

By threatening to close the border with Mexico and moving to cut off aid to El Salvador  Honduras and Guatemala   the so called Northern Triangle countries  from which many migrants headed to the United States are coming   President Trump is effectively shooting America in the foot  to paraphrase one expert Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection  noted last week that the near record number of migrant families with children seeking asylum both at and in between official ports of entry on the southern border was stretching his agency to a  breaking point   This was made startlingly clear as photos of hundreds of migrants  including many small children  confined behind razor wire in a makeshift enclosure beneath a bridge in El Paso  spread quickly across the internet  The agency has since closed the holding area ImageKevin McAleenan  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  speaking last week in El Paso about the impact of the increase in illegal crossings along the southwest border  CreditJose Luis Gonzalez ReutersC B P  and Immigration and Customs Enforcement  both of which operate under the Department of Homeland Security  have taken steps to grapple with the increased flow of migrants  a vast majority of them families with children seeking asylum  The agencies have diverted resources and personnel to process and care for the migrants  even agreeing to release some families to American cities far from the border  We are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a C B P  facility   Mr  McAleenan said   But with these numbers  with the types of illnesses we re seeing at the border  I fear that it s just a matter of time  In an attempt to ease the problem  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  signed a compact with officials from the Northern Triangle last week to help curb the complex drivers of irregular migration   including crime and gang violence in the region  Mr  Trump  less than a day later  announced he was ending aid to those countries  Nonsensically  Mr  Trump has insisted that the real problem is Mexico  which he suggested is doing  nothing  to help stop the tide of migrants  That s despite the efforts by Mexican leaders to intercept migrant groups  providing temporary visas to asylum seekers and allowing some making the trek north to remain in Mexico while they await court hearings in the United States As with the president s wall  which would do little to discourage unauthorized migration  let alone illegal drug trafficking  no one with a working knowledge of immigration policy believes that closing the border is a solution to the recent surge  The economic disruption for border communities and the impact on trade would be disastrous  Plus  closing the border won t stop migrants from stepping onto United States soil and claiming asylum  as many of the groups surrendering to border agents in recent months have done in between ports of entry What would help much more is action to address the root causes of the surge in border crossings  from reforming federal immigration laws to aid to improve economic conditions in Central America  And most urgently  Congress needs to come up with a more nimble legal framework to address the glut of asylum claims and more funding for log jammed immigration courts to process them  This moment calls for proactive measures   not incendiary policies that are destined to backfire RelatedMore on aid to Central America Trump Turns U S  Policy in Central America on Its HeadMarch 30  2019Opinion   Anita Isaacs and Anne PrestonWhat Trump Gets Wrong About Central American AidApril 1  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

WASHINGTON   President Trump acknowledged Tuesday that closing the southern border with Mexico could damage the United States economy  but said protecting America s security was more important than trade In remarks from the Oval Office  Mr  Trump reiterated his threat to shut the border if Mexico  America s third largest trading partner  cannot restrict a flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States  But the president s economic team  concerned about the damage from such a move  said it was looking for ways to limit the fallout if Mr  Trump does do so  Sure  it s going to have a negative impact on the economy   Mr  Trump said  adding   but security is most important   Security is more important to me than trade   he said Republican lawmakers  economists and business groups largely disagree with that assessment and warned this week that closing the border could cripple the flow of goods and workers and devastate American automakers and farmers  as well as other industries that depend on Mexico for sales and goods  Closing down the border would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country   Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  said in an interview   I would hope that we would not be doing that sort of thing  Mark Zandi  the chief economist at Moody s Analytics  said that  a full shutdown of the U S  Mexican border of more than several weeks would be the fodder for recessions in both Mexico and the U S  Mr  Trump s economic advisers have briefed him on the potential financial damage from a border shutdown and started looking for ways to mitigate it  including possibly keeping certain trading avenues open Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  said Tuesday in a brief interview that the Trump administration was trying to secure the border without harming the economy  The question is   he said   can we deal with that and not have any economic damage  I think the answer is we can  People are looking at different options  Mr  Kudlow added that the administration was  looking for ways to allow the freight passage   some people call it truck roads   There are ways you can do that  which would ameliorate the breakdown in supply chains   he said But business leaders say there is no way to contain the damage from even a partial shutdown of the 2 000 mile border that the United States shares with Mexico  Nearly  1 7 billion of goods and services flow across the border daily  as well as nearly a half million legal workers  students  shoppers and tourists  the U S  Chamber of Commerce said Monday On Tuesday  officials with the chamber called a partial border shutdown  uncharted territory  and said such a policy would have negative economic consequences  particularly for communities along the border  We don t know whether that is feasible or not   said Neil Bradley  the chamber s executive vice president and chief policy officer Even if it is possible  a partial shutdown would still cause significant disruptions for industries that are highly integrated across the border  including automobiles  machinery and electronic equipment  The North American auto industry will be crippled  in a week  Kristin Dziczek  a vice president for the Center for Automotive Research  an industry research group  said in a tweet Mr  Trump s pledge to close the border comes in response to what officials with the Department of Homeland Security say is an increase in migrant families who are flooding America s immigration system  leading to overflowing detention centers and mass releases of migrants The president told reporters that if Mexico cannot restrict the flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States  and if Congress cannot agree to several immigration restrictions that Mr  Trump has long pushed for   the border is going to be closed  While 76 000 migrants crossed the border in February  that number is nowhere near the migration levels seen in the early 2000s  And a majority of the migrants crossing the border now are Central American families looking for asylum  as opposed to Mexican individuals looking for work  Homeland security officials could quickly deport Mexican individuals seeking employment  but  by law  they cannot swiftly deport Central American families or unaccompanied children Homeland security officials have said they expect the number of crossings to surpass 100 000 this month  And a senior department official said those traveling in and out of ports of entry were already feeling an effect  There was a three hour wait at the port of entry in Brownsville  Tex   according to the official  and there were around 150 trucks backed up and waiting to cross at Otay Mesa  in California On Monday  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said she would divert up to 750 border patrol officials from ports of entry to areas in between the ports to handle large groups of migrants crossing the border  A senior homeland security official also said the administration could start closing traffic lanes at the ports  The crisis at our border is worsening   Ms  Nielsen said   and D H S  will do everything in its power to end it  Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina and one of Mr  Trump s external advisers  has been urging the president to ease off the threat  On Tuesday  Mr  Graham portrayed Mr  Trump s latest broadside as less an eventuality and more a calculated bargaining position  You are taking a bad problem and  by closing the ports of entry  you are creating another problem   he said during an interview   To the extent that he wants to redeploy resources to the points of entry to deal with the ungoverned spaces   that will create economic upheaval  but that will hopefully lead to a solution  Border activity makes up a relatively larger share of Mexico s economy than the United States   meaning Mexico would most likely have more economic damage from a border closing  Mr  Zandi said But that does not mean the United States would be in a winning position  Communities across the country would probably see supply chain disruptions  product shortages  seizures in stock and bond markets and a plunge in already fragile business confidence  Mr  Zandi said  The disruption would be especially sharp in the border states of California  Arizona  New Mexico and Texas  which all have Mexico as their No  1 export market Any closure could have far ranging implications for a wide range of industries   including automotive  electronics and apparel   that source small components and deliver their products on a just in time basis on both sides of the border It could also be devastating for the agriculture industry  Since the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994  American farmers have moved toward specializing in corn  soybeans  chicken  dairy  pork and beef to supply to Mexico  while Mexican farmers have specialized in fresh fruits and vegetables to send to the United States  Any delays in deliveries of these products could lead to near immediate price hikes and empty supermarket shelves  which would hit low income Mexicans and Americans the hardest Christin Fernandez  the vice president for communications at the Retail Industry Leaders Association  said that slowing or halting screenings at major ports near the border would lead to product delays and potentially higher shipping costs  The entire retail ecosystem is sustained on the expectation that America s retailers can provide consumers with the goods they want and need  when they need it  at the best possible prices   Ms  Fernandez said   If our suppliers are feeling the pain  retailers will feel the pain  and  ultimately  it is consumers that will bear the burden  Stock markets do not appear to be pricing in any risk of a border closure  The S P 500 was essentially unchanged on Tuesday  and it remains near a six month high  

WASHINGTON   He flew across the ocean to celebrate NATO s 70th anniversary with the largest and most important member of the military alliance  So to outsiders it appeared to be an awkward moment on Tuesday for Jens Stoltenberg  the NATO secretary general  as he sat stiffly by while President Trump criticized German defense spending and predicted that the United States would get along with Russia  I accept there are differences  but when it comes to defense spending we all agree   Mr  Stoltenberg said in an interview after his meeting with Mr  Trump  putting a positive spin on the situation He said the president had helped push member states to budget an additional  100 billion in defense spending and credited Mr  Trump with  having a real impact   I say that because it is a fact   Mr  Stoltenberg said   Allies are now really stepping up  But not all  Germany will most likely slow the growth of its defense spending   meaning that Europe s economic powerhouse will defy a spending target set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  And other member states are struggling to reach the current goal of spending 2 percent of their economic output on the military by the end of 2024 The scene on Tuesday was just the latest example of Mr  Stoltenberg s unenviable efforts to bridge seemingly irreconcilable positions between Europe and the United States He is the European leader who has shown the most deft hand with Mr  Trump  A trained statistician  Mr  Stoltenberg came to the White House with charts showing how defense spending has risen But his credit of Mr  Trump for the spending increases has annoyed European leaders  He is a little too diplomatic   said Jim Townsend  a former Pentagon official who oversaw relations with NATO and is now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security   Sometimes he has a hard time whacking an ally over the head  Mr  Stoltenberg has sought to balance Mr  Trump against German politicians  who have made clear they are sick of the president s demands  The challenge will only grow throughout this week as Mr  Stoltenberg appears before members of Congress to praise both their support of the military alliance and Mr  Trump s drive for a more equitable share of military burdens Germany this year is putting 1 35 percent of its gross domestic product toward defense spending  and in 2020 will spend 1 37 percent  New budget projections by Berlin show Germany will spend 1 25 percent of its economic output by 2023 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the defense minister  Ursula von der Leyen  have said they remain committed to the 2 percent goal   Germany will keep its promise   Ms  von der Leyen said Tuesday on German public radio Hours later  fueling the pressure  Mr  Trump said member states should spend potentially even more than 2 percent on defense In the Oval Office  Mr  Stoltenberg sat stone faced as Mr  Trump criticized Germany for  not paying their fair share   The president also predicted   I think we ll get along with Russia   ImageGerman armored vehicles and an American helicopter during NATO led exercises  Germany s defense spending levels fall below what President Trump is demanding from alliance members CreditIrakli Gedenidze ReutersSince 2014  NATO has deployed military forces to Eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression  It has also intensified efforts to rebuild European militaries that have eroded since the end of the Cold War But the alliance faces an array of challenges it has not previously confronted  and does not yet know how to tackle   including Russian interference in elections and domestic politics  and China s economic investments in telecommunications networks In the interview with The New York Times  Mr  Stoltenberg suggested the alliance s policy on Russia was consistent with Mr  Trump s desire for better relations  He pointed to the cooperation by his own home country  Norway  with Russia on fisheries and other matters  We now have a strong  common understanding of how to approach Russia   Mr  Stoltenberg said   Those allies who were skeptical of dialogue with Russia have seen that we have delivered on deterrence and defense  The gatherings to commemorate NATO s anniversary were originally planned as a week of events in Washington for heads of state and government  But Mr  Trump s angry speeches  public and private  at other alliance gatherings over the last two years persuaded allies to downgrade the anniversary celebration to a meeting of foreign ministers The goal  according to current and former American and European officials  was to limit Mr  Trump s participation Even Tuesday s meeting with Mr  Trump was not originally on Mr  Stoltenberg s agenda  But then Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had invited the NATO chief to address Congress  a speech that is scheduled for Wednesday European officials said Mr  Stoltenberg had not yet accepted the invitation when Ms  Pelosi announced it  That put him in the position of potentially leaving Washington without seeing the president but addressing the Democrat led House  which has approved a measure that seeks to block Mr  Trump from withdrawing from the military alliance Last week  NATO made the unusual move of extending Mr  Stoltenberg s term a second time  by two more years  meaning he would leave office in 2022  It is an acknowledgment of Mr  Stoltenberg s deft touch not just with Mr  Trump  but also with other difficult alliance leaders  including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary Mr  Trump endorsed the extension on Tuesday   I had no doubt in my mind who I wanted   he said European officials said their worries about Mr  Stoltenberg s cozy relationship with Mr  Trump were pushed aside  largely to avoid giving the president an outsize role in selecting a new NATO leader  Mr  Stoltenberg was scheduled to step down in 2020  at the height of an intense election in the United States In the interview with The Times  Mr  Stoltenberg said he had consulted with Ms  Merkel  and noted that the new budget unveiled by Germany was not final  Germany has submitted a spending plan to NATO that shows defense spending rising by 80 percent between 2014 and 2024  he said  adding that he expected Berlin to live up to that plan  The Germans have told me it will further increase   he said Friction is growing in Germany  The Social Democrats  Ms  Merkel s center left coalition partners who control the finance ministry and were in charge of the latest budget plan  are using the dislike of Mr  Trump in their election campaign ahead of European parliamentary elections in May Julianne Smith  a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin and a former Obama administration national security official  said the Social Democrats were using the military budget to show they were the party  that stands up to Donald Trump   This decision became a bit of a referendum on Donald Trump  instead of a referendum on Germany s hollowed out forces that desperately need these resources   she said

WASHINGTON   President Trump backed off plans to introduce a Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act after Senator Mitch McConnell privately warned him that the Senate would not revisit health care in a comprehensive way before the November 2020 elections Reversing himself in the face of Republican consternation  Mr  Trump said his party would not produce a health care plan of its own  as he had promised  until after the elections  meaning he will only try to fulfill his first term promise to repeal and replace his predecessor s signature program if he wins a second term The president s abrupt about face  announced on Twitter on Monday night after talking with Mr  McConnell  all but ensured that health care will take a central place in next year s campaign  elevating an issue Democrats consider one of their strengths  But it may take the legislative heat off Republicans exasperated by Mr  Trump s unexpected push to devise a wholesale replacement for President Barack Obama s health law in the coming months  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   Mr  McConnell  the majority leader from Kentucky  said on Tuesday   He did say  as he later tweeted  that he accepted that and that he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign  ImageListen to  The Daily   Trump Wanted to Scrap

from his call to replace the Affordable Care Act with a Republican alternative  Alex Burns on why the president s own party talked him out of it  It s Wednesday  April 3 alexander burnsSo last week was as close to a moment of total happiness as President Trump has had in a long time  music archived recording 1President Trump s legal team as well as many of those who are close to the president are saying they feel the Mueller report fully vindicates the president after nearly  archived recording 2There s no way to take this letter other than a huge win for the president archived recording 3To say White House officials are happily telling the American people I told you so  well  that would frankly be a bit of an understatement archived recording  donald trump And after three years of lies and smears and slander  the Russia hoax is finally dead  The collusion delusion is over alexander burnsThat s what makes it all the more surprising that his administration decided to dive right back into one of the most politically damaging fights of his whole presidency  which is health care archived recording 1The Trump Justice Department just announced a major reversal on Obamacare archived recording 2Today  he called the Affordable Care Act horrible and is mounting a push to kill it off archived recording 3Fresh off his Mueller investigation victory  some of his biggest supporters are questioning the timing archived recording 4Here you have a huge messaging win for the president and the White House with this Mueller summary  Why now  Why do this archived recording 5Why now  maybe even why at all michael barbaroAnd how does he dive back into that politically damaging fight alexander burnsHe directs the Justice Department to take sides in a lawsuit that has been making its way through the federal courts  It was brought by Republican legal officials in a number of states  It has been ruled on by one judge in Texas that the Affordable Care Act is invalid archived recordingA federal judge in Texas has just struck down Obamacare  True story  Judge Reed O Connor says the individual mandate  the part of the law that requires you to participate  is unconstitutional  And because it cannot be separated from the rest of the law  which it cannot be  the entire law is invalid alexander burnsIt is seen as a really long shot challenge to the Affordable Care Act  something that  in all likelihood  will probably not result in the law being struck down as a whole  but the White House was going to have to decide at some point whether they were going to defend the A C A  at the highest levels of the legal system or whether they were going to take sides against a law that s on the books that Congress failed to repeal when it had the chance  And that s what they did archived recording  donald trump We think it will be upheld  and we think it will do very well in the Supreme Court  And if the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out  we will have a plan that s far better than Obamacare michael barbaroAnd my sense is that under normal circumstances  the White House almost reflexively defends laws put on the books by Congress alexander burnsIt s a pretty extraordinary step for the president to take sides  not just against a law that s already on the books  but really the biggest piece of social legislation that s been passed in recent history  And he does it at the urging of some of his most conservative advisers in the White House  including the chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  archived recording  mick mulvaney And it s hard to know where to begin when you re talking about how bad the current health care legislation is for small business alexander burns  who  before he was a member of the Trump administration  was a hardliner in the House of Representatives waging war on the Affordable Care Act from Capitol Hill archived recording  mick mulvaney It s almost as if the folks who wrote this piece of legislation last year either have no idea how small business works or they don t care how small business works  Either way  the current health care legislation is a complete disaster for small business  and  alexander burnsThe argument that Mulvaney and others make is that if the president is going to run for re election as a guy who made promises and kept his promises  especially to conservative voters who still care a lot about getting rid of Obamacare  he has got to take every chance he has to go against it michael barbaroAnd given the dynamics of Congress  this is perhaps his best chance alexander burnsMaybe his only chance  because Democrats now control the House  There is really no shot for Republicans to pass a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act  So if they re going to take it down  they re going to take it down in the courts michael barbaroO K   well  what is the response to this announcement alexander burnsWell  Democrats are totally elated archived recording  nancy pelosi This is actually an opportunity for us to speak to the American people with clarity archived recording  chuck schumer It s a stark reminder of the difference between our two parties  Democrats are fighting to expand and improve health care coverage and lower costs while Republicans are trying to take it all away and raise costs alexander burnsThey have spent  at this point  several days on the defensive about some of the claims that they made about what was likely to be in Robert Mueller s report  They are desperate to get away from their own divisive fights about the nature of liberal health care policy  You have had  in the presidential primaries  in the House of Representatives  even in the Senate where Democrats aren t in control  just endless tugs of war between moderate liberals  very liberal Democrats  far left Democrats over what kind of health care system the country ought to have in an ideal world  Should it be European style single payer health care  Should it be a system that just totally does away with private health insurance  All these kinds of divisive debates on the left that have had Democrats tripping over each other  But President Trump weighs in the way he does on the Affordable Care Act  and all of a sudden all those conflicts hit pause archived recording  nancy pelosi Oh  no  please archived recording SINGING  Happy birthday to you alexander burnsAnd the timing on the Democratic side is sort of comical in that it is literally Nancy Pelosi s 79th birthday  archived recordingHappy birthday to you alexander burns  the morning after this Justice Department announcement comes out  And when you have Democrats singing  Happy Birthday  to her  there was this sense in the caucus that she had gotten the best gift a president could have given her michael barbaroWhat is the reaction from Republicans in Congress alexander burnsWell  real dismay and surprise and sort of horror archived recordingEven Republicans appear bewildered by President Trump s promise to make the G O P  the party of health care alexander burnsAnd not just from the few remaining relatively moderate Republicans archived recordingSome Republicans are nervous about that  including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy  According to Axios  McCarthy called the president and told him the decision made no sense  saying the health care battle helped Democrats win the House and several state capitals last year alexander burnsEvery Republican analysis of the midterm elections concluded that they lost the House because of health care more than any other individual policy issue  So if you are Kevin McCarthy  the new House minority leader  you are just appalled at the idea that your members are now going to have to have this fight all over again michael barbaroRight  We had talked about this with you during the midterms   that there had been this huge public shift on Obamacare and that voters who might have previously been against it now do not want it taken away alexander burnsThat s right  It was less of a thank you to Democrats than a punishment for Republicans  that Democrats never got the political boost back in 2010  2012  2014 that they hoped they would get for passing a big new social benefit  But what they did ultimately get was the benefit of voters turning against Republicans who wanted to take those benefits away  So Obamacare as a term  as a law  still kind of a mixed bag politically  but there are elements in that law  like protections for people with pre existing medical conditions  that are enormously popular  And Republicans look back on the last campaign  the one that ended really rather badly for them  and see that as  more than anything else  the fatal political mistake they made michael barbaroSo why would President Trump  the leader of the Republican Party  who had to have watched that same midterm that you re describing  why would he do this if the takeaway of that midterm is that the Affordable Care Act is no longer toxic and might even be liked by a wide cross section of Americans alexander burnsIn the president s public statements  and as far as we can tell based on his personal thinking  he recognizes that health care is a huge political vulnerability for Republicans  that the last thing they did on health care  that big repeal drive  was politically devastating to them  And his proclamation that they need to become the party of health care clearly reflects an understanding that a problem needs to be fixed archived recording  donald trump So we re going to get rid of Obamacare  And I said it the other day  The Republican Party will become the party of great health care  It s good  It s important michael barbaroI guess I can see President Trump s argument there  It feels kind of legitimate  Wouldn t it be smart for Republicans heading into the next presidential election  2020  to recognize that there are things that voters like about the Affordable Care Act  But in order for it to be a benefit for the Republicans and not the Democrats  they need to convince voters that the Democratic plan is a bad one and that Republicans will give them a better one alexander burnsRight  But giving voters a better version of health care provided by the Republican Party has always had to mean more than just getting rid of the system that currently exists  It s this strange kind of bifurcated mental space that Republicans have been living in politically  where they want to run against Democrats for trying to blow up the health care system and replace it with single payer  and  on the other side  they want to get rid of much of the existing health care system and replace it with something to be named later michael barbaroIn other words  they don t really have a plan to replace it alexander burnsThey don t  and they kind of never have  not a consensus plan that s supported by a broad cross section of the party and voters  And that s why when the president came out with this position through the Justice Department and then suggested that Republicans in Congress ought to come up with something great  the backlash from Republicans at the highest levels of the congressional party was swift and severe  The view among congressional Republicans was that this was just sort of a total fantasy coming from the president  The idea that they would not only come up with a plan and come up with a plan that would be popular and meet the standards that the president has laid out in rally after rally  but that they would do it within a year and then run on it in 2020 just seemed like it was cut from whole cloth michael barbaroIs there also a feeling among Republicans toward the president along the lines of  dude  we just want to stop calling attention to this issue  It s a losing issue for us  Stop drawing attention to it alexander burnsOh  absolutely  And if the concern among folks like Mick Mulvaney is that walking away from the fight looks like surrender  the view from a lot of Republicans on the Hill is they ve already lost  They can talk about how they lost  or they can talk about other stuff  and the president is choosing to talk about defeat michael barbaroRight  Instead of talking about what I had imagined Republicans would be talking about for the next couple of months and maybe even the next year  which is the Democratic fight over  Medicare for all   the Democratic fight over whether private insurance should even exist   I had expected that that would be the consuming discussion in the political world and in the political campaigns to come when it came to health care alexander burnsSo did I  and I think so did a lot of Republican candidates down the ballot preparing for 2020  There was always going to be tension in the Republican message about Democratic radicalism on health care  because if you are running in 2020 on the idea that Democrats are going to blow up the current system and replace it with European style medicine  you re kind of implicitly defending the status quo system as it exists under Obamacare  It s an extraordinarily awkward position for Republicans to be in  Can you be opposed to Democratic proposals to make the health care system even more liberal  even more regulated or structured by the government  without essentially defending the system that Barack Obama put in place  We don t know how they re going to walk that line  We don t know to what extent they ll even try  But the president s current approach  which is to say that Democrats will do something drastic and bad to your health care  and I m not quite going to tell you what I m going to do yet  doesn t seem sustainable michael barbaroSo what happens in the last 24 hours or so to this Trump led project to try to strike down  repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act alexander burnsWell  after days of other Republicans expressing public discomfort with where the president was headed  archived recording  mitch mcconnell So I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate alexander burns  Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader  conveyed in no uncertain terms to the White House that this was a non starter in the Senate  that the president was free to do what he wanted to do on health care  but that Senate Republicans were not going to be taking the lead on this  It was not a fight they wanted  period  full stop archived recording  mitch mcconnell So we don t have a misunderstanding about that  We will not be doing comprehensive in the Senate alexander burnsThe president seemed to have gotten the message archived recordingPresident Trump on the retreat archived recording  donald trump No  I wanted to delay it myself  I want to put it after the election alexander burnsAnd his response was to go onto Twitter and to declare that they are totally going to do all the things that he said they were going to do  but at a much later date  after the 2020 election michael barbaroRight  He cited the date 2021  We will do all this right after the election alexander burnsRight after an election when  in his construction  he would be re elected  Republicans would hold the Senate  and they would take back control of the House  So that s not just a delay of game  That is setting a whole bunch of other conditions on what would need to happen to get there michael barbaroWere you surprised  Alex  that the president backed down on this so quickly alexander burnsI was surprised by how fast it happened  I wasn t surprised that he sort of came up with a really big theory of what should happen next and then eventually let it disintegrate  because we ve seen that pattern a number of times  But to pick a fight this big and to stick with it for so little time is the definition of politically counterproductive michael barbaroSo now  we are basically back where we started  The Affordable Care Act is likely to remain the law of the land  So what did we learn from this weeklong ordeal alexander burnsWell  the biggest thing we learned is that the politics of health care have been turned on their head in the last couple of years  and that the Affordable Care Act is no longer a liability for Democrats  and that Republicans  whether they want to acknowledge it or not  have largely abandoned the fight  music  The fact that you had the senior most members of the congressional party saying so clearly to a president they helped elect and have loyally supported  we don t want to touch health care   it would have been sort of unimaginable to someone five years ago that that would happen with a Republican president in office michael barbaroAlex  thank you very much alexander burnsThank you  music alexander burnsTomorrow s my birthday  so this is like a little birthday special michael barbaroYay  Is that on the mic lisa tobinHappy birthday tomorrow michael barbaroWe ll be right back   MUSIC   Here s what else you need to know today archived recording  theresa may Despite the best efforts of M P s  the process that the House of Commons has tried to lead has not come up with an answer  So today  I m taking action to break the logjam michael barbaroIn her latest attempt to rally support for Brexit after a series of embarrassing setbacks  British prime minister Theresa May said she would seek a new delay for leaving the European Union and would begin negotiating a Brexit plan with her political rivals in the Labour Party archived recording  theresa may I m offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan that we would both stick to to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal michael barbaroThe attempt to work across the aisle with the Labour Party suggests that May cannot win enough support within her own Conservative Party to pass her Brexit plan archived recording  theresa may The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum that both the leader of the opposition and I could put to the House for approval  and which I could then take to next week s European Council michael barbaroUnless May secures another delay  Britain is currently scheduled to leave the E U  without a negotiated plan on April 12  That s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow The president s last attempt to replace Mr  Obama s health care program blew up in 2017 when his party controlled both houses of Congress  Democrats seized the House in last year s midterm elections in part on a promise to defend the most popular parts of the Affordable Care Act  so when Mr  Trump revived the issue last week  it distressed Republicans who consider it a political liability Mr  Trump had surprised allies by ordering his administration to ask a federal court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act and then promised a Republican replacement  Democrats  consumer groups  doctors  hospitals and insurance companies have said that 20 million people could lose health coverage if courts accept the administration s argument Mr  McConnell said he spoke with Mr  Trump on Monday afternoon to explain that the Senate would not return to the issue in a broad way before the next election   I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans  view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives   Mr  McConnell said But if that warning was meant to quiet the president  it did not work  Hours later  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter   The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums  cost    deductibles than ObamaCare   In other words it will be far less expensive   much more usable than ObamaCare   he said in a string of three tweets posted Monday night   Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House  Democrats jumped at the opening  Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said at a rally in front of the Supreme Court   Translation  they have no health care plan  It s the same old song they ve been singing  They re for repeal  They have no replace  Mr  Trump appeared to be gambling that he could turn the tables on an issue that has long favored Democrats by portraying them as increasingly extreme  Even as party liberals  including some presidential candidates  embrace the idea of  Medicare for all   Republicans have used it to accuse Democrats of favoring a socialist  government run health care system that would close down all private insurers  I see what the Democrats are doing  it s a disaster what they re planning and everyone knows it   Mr  Trump told reporters on Tuesday at the White House   You re going to lose 180 million people under their private insurance  Wary of such attacks  the Democratic congressional leadership has played down a single payer system run by the government and advanced incremental measures to shore up the health care law and lower prescription drug prices Many Republicans in Congress were happy to assail Medicare for all but not enthusiastic about ditching Mr  Obama s program without a ready replacement  No plan of their own could pass the House  but it would invariably require policy choices that Democrats could attack Image The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesEven some of the president s own advisers were confounded by his move  Soon after the president decided last week to intervene in a Texas court case on the side of invalidating the entire Affordable Care Act without a Plan B  Mr  Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with Ronna McDaniel  the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee  and Brad Parscale  Mr  Trump s campaign manager Both Mr  Parscale and Ms  McDaniel tried to tell the president that they could not understand what he was doing  according to a person familiar with the call Mr  Trump replied that if they did nothing  Democrats would continue to own the issue and the other option was being known as the party that could not figure out how to properly draft a health care legislative package  the person said In several private conversations since last week  Mr  McConnell told the president that he believed Democrats owned the dysfunction associated with the Affordable Care Act and that Mr  Trump was essentially letting them off the hook by inserting himself into the debate again  according to another person briefed on those discussions Mr  Trump denied on Tuesday that Mr  McConnell asked him to back off  saying   I wanted to delay it myself  because Republicans do not control the House   So if we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency   which I hope are two good assumptions   we re going to have a phenomenal health care   he said Seeking to capitalize on the issue  the House will vote this week on a resolution urging the Justice Department to reverse its position and defend the 2010 health care law in court  forcing lawmakers to take a side on the case  The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   said Speaker Nancy Pelosi The resolution  offered by a freshman Democrat  Representative Colin Allred of Texas  says that the Justice Department should  cease any and all efforts to destroy Americans  access to affordable health care  and reverse its position  in the court case  Texas v  United States Some of the president s senior advisers pushed him to join the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the entire current health care law  a more expansive position than the administration had taken previously  when it argued that protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down But others raised concerns  including the White House counsel  Pat Cipollone  Mr  Cipollone said that Attorney General William P  Barr had issues with joining the suit  too  But once the president made clear his mind was made up  the Justice Department went along without complaint  people familiar with the events said Among those objecting was Senator Susan Collins  a moderate Republican from Maine who sent a letter to Mr  Barr expressing her  profound disagreement  with the move  Rather than seeking to have the courts invalidate the A C A    she wrote  referring to the Affordable Care Act   the proper route for the administration to pursue would be to propose changes to the A C A  or to once again seek its repeal  The administration should not attempt to use the courts to bypass Congress  Mr  McConnell sought to calm Republican nerves  saying  there s no point in pushing the panic button  because the court system would take a long time to resolve the dispute  I don t think any of these policies are in any immediate danger   he said Mr  Trump has basically commissioned four Republican senators to devise a replacement for the Affordable Care Act  The group consists of two doctors  John Barrasso of Wyoming and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana  as well as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  a close ally of the president  and Senator Rick Scott of Florida  who was the chief executive of a large for profit hospital firm before he entered politics Mr  Scott said on Tuesday that he was focused on bringing down health costs  especially prescription drug prices   Obamacare has made health care way more expensive   he said   Co payments are up  Deductibles are up  Premiums have skyrocketed  When asked about developing a wholesale replacement for the Affordable Care Act  Mr  Scott responded   I m a business guy   adding   I didn t try to do grand bargains   

President Trump  despite his own history of buying a porn star s silence and bragging about sexual misconduct  on Thursday leveled another broadside at Joseph R  Biden Jr   tweeting a meme that mocked the former vice president for putting his hands on women s shoulders The 15 second meme  accompanied by the text  WELCOME BACK JOE    doctored a video that Mr  Biden released on Wednesday in which the former vice president explained his history of physical contact with women  some of whom say his behavior made them uncomfortable  Mr  Biden has said he tried to comfort people with hugs  kisses and other physical contact when they appeared nervous In the meme  as Mr  Biden delivers his explanation  a pair of hands appears on his shoulders  and then an image of Mr  Biden s head pops up and appears to sniff the back of the former vice president s head  The meme appeared to be a reference to an accusation by a former Nevada assemblywoman  who said in an essay published last Friday that Mr  Biden had touched her shoulders  smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head at a campaign event in 2014  Joe Biden s hugs and kisses were well known in Washington  Now he faces a generational reckoning  Mr  Biden is widely expected to join the 2020 presidential race soon  and some Democrats view him as perhaps the most formidable challenger to Mr  Trump  But in the last week  accusations from several women that Mr  Biden touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable have threatened to upend his fledgling campaign  and on Wednesday  he addressed the claims directly for the first time in a video posted to his Twitter feed Mr  Trump s supporters have seized on the accusations against Mr  Biden  viewing them as an early opening to attack a potential Democratic candidate they already view as perhaps his strongest adversary  On Tuesday  a pro Trump group  the Great America PAC  released a  Creepy Joe  Biden ad  Mr  Trump himself has also already weighed in on the allegations  Joking on Tuesday night about asking for a kiss  Mr  Trump said   I felt like Joe Biden  This is not the first time the president has used a doctored video to taunt an adversary  In July of 2017 he posted a clip on his Twitter account that showed him wrestling with and punching a figure whose head had been replaced by the logo of CNN  the cable news network that he has regularly attacked  

President Trump stopped short of announcing a final trade deal with China on Thursday  saying in an Oval Office meeting with the Chinese delegation that it may take another four weeks or more to secure an  epic  trade agreement Negotiators had originally aimed to secure a deal this week during a visit from Liu He  the Chinese vice premier and special trade envoy  and announce a presidential summit meeting between Mr  Trump and Xi Jinping of China  But after more than a year of tit for tat tariffs  on and off negotiations and threats of additional punishment  the United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues  including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed  and when  We re talking intellectual property protection and theft  We re talking about certain tariffs   Mr  Trump said  referring to issues that remain unresolved People familiar with the negotiations had said that the president was poised to announce a summit meeting with China  But those plans spurred a backlash among some of the president s trade advisers  who argued that announcing a meeting before the deal was struck would weaken the United States  hand and give it less leverage to force changes it is seeking In remarks at the White House  Mr  Trump said that the deal was  very complete  and that the two sides had  agreed to far more than we have left to agree to   I think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to   he continued But he said there would be no summit meeting until a final deal was made   If we have a deal then we ll have a summit   the president said The date and location of a summit meeting have also proved controversial  The United States had initially proposed holding one at Mar a Lago  Mr  Trump s Florida resort  but China has been pushing for an official state visit in Washington or a neutral location in a third country  people familiar with the matter said Lawmakers had publicly fretted about announcing a summit meeting before the deal was inked  suggesting that Mr  Trump was surrendering his leverage in his eagerness to sign an agreement Both Republicans and Democrats have urged Mr  Trump to hold out for a tough deal to combat Chinese practices that American businesses have long seen as problematic  including the coerced transfer of foreign technology as a condition of doing business in the country and the ample government subsidies for Chinese firms  Last week  POTUS told us he would not sign a  good  trade deal with  China he would only sign a  great  one   Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  said in a Twitter post on Thursday morning   I believe him  But to be a  great  deal it must allow us to do in China what they can do in US   it must have real enforcement mechanisms  The United States has pressed China to make commitments on purchasing American goods  opening markets to foreign business and increasing protections for foreign intellectual property in a bid to rebalance an economic relationship that Mr  Trump says is unfair for American workers  It remains to be seen how sweeping and significant any agreement will be  and whether it will achieve the lofty promises Mr  Trump has made about resetting the economic relationship with Beijing But the White House is also facing pressure to resolve the trade war  which has begun to hurt American farming  manufacturing and other sectors  and caused wild swings on Wall Street  Industries including automaking  technology manufacturing and farming have anxiously awaited reduced tariffs and details of a new agreement  which will have huge implications for their businesses The president s tariffs have been successful at bringing the Chinese to the negotiating table  and his advisers have insisted they will not squander an opportunity to press China for substantial economic reforms that past administrations were unable to secure  Still  the Chinese have balked at making any reforms that could be viewed as infringing on their sovereignty or undercutting the Communist Party s control of the economy  If you and I are making a deal  and you have to drag me kicking and screaming the whole way  what are the odds the deal is going to hold   asked Derek Scissors  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute   I don t find that the slightest bit convincing  American negotiators have pushed for an enforcement mechanism that would allow tariffs on Chinese goods to snap back if China violated the terms of the deal  and that would forbid China to retaliate  But Chinese negotiators have resisted such an idea  describing it as a potential infringement on their sovereignty Myron Brilliant  the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  said foreign stakeholders would be scrutinizing the deal to see whether it contained a strong enforcement mechanism that would hold the Chinese accountable to their obligations  That is what would separate this agreement from previous agreements   he said The two sides spent the past two months drawing up more than 120 pages of an agreement covering issues including forced technology transfer and cybertheft  intellectual property rights  currency and nontariff barriers to trade  The Trump administration has also pressed China to commit to hundreds of billions in purchases of American products  including agricultural products  energy and airplanes The administration has been eager to front load China s purchases of American products to help bolster farm country and other important constituencies and try to bring down the bilateral trade deficit before the 2020 election  Mr  Trump s advisers would prefer to keep the tariffs in place as long as possible  an arrangement the Chinese oppose In recent weeks  Beijing has introduced a steady drumbeat of other reforms intended to please American constituencies and win Mr  Trump s favor  China has resumed purchases of American soybeans and announced it would reclassify fentanyl  which has fueled the American opioid epidemic  as a controlled substance  Beijing also approved a sweeping rewrite of a foreign investment law that may help foreign companies avoid unequal treatment  And it approved a request by JPMorgan Chase to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country and floated the idea of expanding access for foreign cloud computing companies China experts have cautioned that the long running economic stresses between the countries are unlikely to be entirely put to rest with this round of negotiations  The negotiations  no matter what anybody says  will not end at the end of this phase   said David Lampton  a fellow at Stanford University s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies   We ve got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to nominate Herman Cain  who abandoned his 2012 presidential bid in the face of escalating accusations of sexual misconduct  for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board Mr  Trump  speaking from the Oval Office  called Mr  Cain  the former chief executive of Godfather s Pizza   a truly outstanding individual  and said   I ve told my folks that s the man  The decision to consider Mr  Cain is the second time in weeks that the president has floated candidates with deeply held political views and past ethical issues to fill a seat on the Fed  signaling his intent to put allies on a traditionally independent body  It comes as Mr  Trump has continued to attack the Fed and his handpicked chairman  Jerome H  Powell  for raising interest rates in 2018  saying those moves slowed economic growth Last month  Mr  Trump said he planned to nominate Stephen Moore  a conservative economist who advised his presidential campaign and has become a vocal critic of the central bank s recent rate increases  as a Fed governor Mr  Trump has staked his presidency on a booming economy and his re election could hinge on whether it continues to surge or falter  The Fed  which has the ability to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates and using other tools at its disposal  will play a crucial role in the economy s trajectory While presidents have long stocked regulatory agencies with partisan appointees in pursuit of ideological goals  the Fed s seven member board of governors has largely been an exception given the role it plays in the United States economy  The Fed s primary job is to guide the economy  typically by adjusting interest rates  It aims for sustainable growth  maximum employment and stable prices  It also regulates banks and oversees the plumbing of the financial system Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short term growth at the expense of inflation and instability  Some modern presidents have opined openly about what the Fed should do  including President George Bush  who declared in a State of the Union address that the central bank should keep rates low But in recent decades  the volume of public commentary greatly diminished as politicians concluded that pressuring the Fed was counterproductive The president has largely abandoned that tradition  Last year  as interest rates rose and the stock market declined  Mr  Trump repeatedly attacked Fed policy as  crazy    wild  and  loco   He asked aides whether he could replace the chairman and lamented privately that Mr  Powell s appointment was one of his biggest regrets The Fed  which raised rates for five consecutive quarters amid a roaring economy with the lowest unemployment rate in nearly two decades  has since paused its campaign  Mr  Powell has repeatedly rebuffed any suggestion that the central bank is being influenced by Mr  Trump s broadsides  saying it is adopting a more  patient  approach to interest rates given signs of economic weakness in the United States and abroad With two open seats on the seven member Fed  Mr  Trump has the ability to drastically shape the central bank for the foreseeable future  The president has already appointed four of the Fed s current governors  who carry 14 year terms  One governor  Lael Brainard  is a holdover from the Obama administration The appointment and confirmation of Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain could put the Fed in uncharted territory  While the institution has strongly rooted values around technical competence and apolitical debate  Mr  Trump s latest choices have been political actors rather than in the weeds experts in any of the main areas in which the Fed makes policy Two governors alone cannot entirely shape Fed policy  but they can have an effect on decisions  The Federal Open Market Committee  which sets interest rates  consists of 12 voting members  including the seven governors  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents  who serve one year terms on a rotating basis  Changes to interest rates must be approved by a majority of the voting members Both Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain are undergoing background checks  and if nominated  must be confirmed by the Senate The choice of such candidates to fill two of the most powerful jobs in economic policy is raising fears among some Fed veterans that the president is installing political allies at the central bank to do his bidding  It s one thing to put cronies into the executive branch  but I think the central bank is another kind of institution that it s so critical in that it holds the reins solely to monetary policy   said Sarah Bloom Raskin  who served on the Fed s board of governors from 2010 to 2014   It has the potential to undermine the credibility of monetary policy  Mr  Cain s nomination is being supported by Larry Kudlow  who heads the National Economic Council and also recommended Mr  Moore for a Fed seat  according to a person familiar with the discussions While he heaped praise on his  friend  Mr  Cain  Mr  Trump earlier in the day continued his assault on the  destructive actions  taken by the Fed and said on Twitter that the economy was very strong despite the central bank s efforts The selection of Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain appeared to be a counterweight to Mr  Powell  But while Mr  Moore has been publicly critical of the Fed and called for Mr  Powell to resign  Mr  Cain s views are less clear As a presidential candidate  Mr  Cain rode a brief surge in popularity to the top of the polls on the back of his  9 9 9  economic plan  The proposal called for scrapping the existing tax code and replacing it with a flat 9 percent income tax  a 9 percent business tax and a 9 percent national retail sales tax  The concept was hailed by some for its simplicity  but it ultimately fizzled with his campaign On monetary policy  his views are equally unorthodox  In a 2012 op ed in The Wall Street Journal  Mr  Cain accused the central bank of manipulating the value of the dollar by raising and lowering interest rates by whim and called for a return to the gold standard  which was abandoned in 1971  For the last 40 years in Washington  regulate has meant manipulate  with the Federal Reserve raising and lowering interest rates and buying and selling assets at its own discretion   Mr  Cain wrote  arguing that a complex society needs fixed standards   A dollar should be defined   as it was prior to 1971 under the postwar Bretton Woods system   as a fixed quantity of gold  Mr  Cain is also a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  a role that is often given to local business leaders  In a 2011 interview with The Atlantic  Drue Jennings  who served with Mr  Cain on the board  said that Mr  Cain was an  inflation hawk  when it came to monetary policy  a moniker attributed to those who view rising prices as a threat to economic growth and favor higher interest rates to keep inflation in check Mr  Trump has made clear he has no interest in a Fed governor who wants to raise rates but  more recently  Mr  Cain has shown that he has evolved on the subject  If I were offered the job  I would try to encourage the Fed not to make inflation a fear factor because deflation  as Stephen Moore had pointed out in a great article that he wrote along with another economist  deflation is more of a fear factor than inflation   Mr  Cain said in a February interview with the Fox Business Network Perhaps most important to Mr  Trump  Mr  Cain has shown that he is loyal to the president  In September  Mr  Cain formed the America Fighting Back PAC  which has a mission of publicly rebutting what he believes is misinformation about Mr  Trump  We re offering a compelling  solid refutation to what you hear from the media and the rest of the left about President Trump and conservative ideas   Mr  Cain said at the time It is unclear whether Mr  Cain will clear the background check  His presidential campaign came to a screeching halt after several women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment or improper behavior The selection of Mr  Cain drew backlash on Thursday from some of those women Ginger White  who publicly said in 2011 that she and Mr  Cain had had an affair  said that he should not be rewarded for such actions  Ms  White said that the affair was on and off for 13 years and that Mr  Cain denied it because he was seeking the Republican nomination for president  We need honesty and integrity in those who are appointed to public office   Ms  White said in a statement released by her lawyer  Gloria Allred   Herman Cain should not be rewarded for his bad behavior  In my opinion  he lacks what should be required for appointment to the Federal Reserve or any public office  Sharon Bialek  who is also represented by Ms  Allred  came forward in 2011 and accused Mr  Cain of grabbing her in a sexually aggressive way when she sought his help after losing her job at the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s  Ms  Bialek said in a statement on Thursday evening that Mr  Cain sexually harassed her and that he was not fit for public service  I did not think that he was a man of character then  and I do not think he is now   Ms  Bialek said   Anyone who uses their position of power to take advantage of a woman does not possess the character  integrity or values required to serve on the Federal Reserve Board  In some ways  Mr  Cain  who preferred news interviews to intensive retail campaigning  presaged Mr  Trump s own outsider campaign four years later  But unlike the president s presidential bid  Mr  Cain s was fatally wounded when he faced charges of sexual misconduct In October 2011  Politico reported that Mr  Cain  as head of the National Restaurant Association  had been accused of sexually harassing two women  who left the trade group after receiving financial payouts and signing nondisclosure agreements  One of the women  who was from Chicago  said that Mr  Cain made an unwanted and rough physical advance Confronted with the claims  Mr  Cain initially did not deny them  He later proclaimed his innocence and sought to cast blame on political rivals and the news media for what he called a smear campaign Other women emerged soon after to say that they  too  had been sexually harassed by Mr  Cain  By that December  he dropped out of the presidential race  

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Tuesday lashed out at Puerto Rico s local lawmakers as  grossly incompetent  and singled out one of his favorite targets  Carmen Yuln Cruz  the mayor of San Juan  as  crazed and incompetent  Mr  Trump s latest invective toward the local leaders of an island devastated by a hurricane in September 2017 came in a torrent of tweets  which began on Monday night and spilled into Tuesday morning  Mr  Trump was reacting after the Senate on Monday blocked billions of dollars in disaster aid for Midwestern states  in part because Democrats said a proposed  600 million in nutritional assistance to Puerto Rico fell short of its needs  Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter  He also stated  incorrectly  that Puerto Rico had received  91 billion in aid from the federal government In fact  FEMA and other agencies have so far distributed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion in aid has been allocated  while  91 billion is the budget office s estimate of how much the island could receive over the next two decades Gov  Ricardo A  Rossell of Puerto Rico  a Democrat  responded to Mr  Trump in a tweet of his own on Tuesday   Mr  President  once again  we are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Mr  Rossell wrote Mr  Trump has long been sensitive when it comes to the subject of Puerto Rico  where the federal government s response to Hurricane Maria was widely criticized as too slow  Aides and allies said Mr  Trump had vented privately that Puerto Ricans had complained too much  and he had also noted privately that Hurricane Maria  which killed 2 975 people as a result of the storm and its effects  was not as bad as Hurricane Katrina  in which fewer people   1 833   were killed Mr  Trump has long hit back at Ms  Cruz  who during the disaster became the most outspoken critic of the federal response On Tuesday  Mr  Trump seemed to imply in his tweets that Puerto Rico was not part of the United States  noting that local elected officials  only take from USA   Hogan Gidley  a White House spokesman  seemed to underscore the view in the White House that Puerto Ricans were not Americans when he twice referred to the island as  that country  during an appearance on MSNBC Mr  Trump s apparent disdain for the island s leadership has led to a breakdown of communication between local officials and the White House For weeks  Mr  Rossell has asked the White House for a private meeting with Mr  Trump to lay out the island s case for why it desperately needs federal funds for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria  But Mr  Rossell s request has gone unanswered  and he has tried instead to communicate with the president publicly  saying in cable news interviews  in official appearances and on Twitter that he fears Mr  Trump has been misled about Puerto Rico s needs Mr  Rossell s fight may be an uphill battle with a president who has made it clear that he views more federal aid to Puerto Rico as throwing money away  Mr  Trump s advisers also view the pleas from local officials as part of a campaign to shift the blame for what they view as severe mismanagement of the supplies and money sent after the storm People familiar with Mr  Trump s thinking said he was skeptical that additional aid would not be used to pay down Puerto Rico s debt  The acting White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  who has made it clear that he believes Puerto Rico will need to find its own way out of the debt crisis  is believed to be encouraging the president s negative view of the island In Puerto Rico  however  Mr  Trump s stance is being viewed through the lens of race  In an interview on Tuesday  Mr  Rossell mentioned  unprompted  that Puerto Rico s population was almost entirely Latino and said that historically  there have been  ethnic undertones  to the treatment of Puerto Ricans by Washington   We don t want special treatment   he said   We just want equal treatment  The governor also has bigger issues to deal with at home  The resignations of two power players in his cabinet became public late on Monday  Julia Keleher  the education secretary  and Hctor M  Pesquera  the public safety secretary  had been among the least popular members of Mr  Rossell s government  Their departures dominated the headlines in the local news media  which made little reference to what is widely seen here as yet another episode of presidential bluster That is not to say Puerto Ricans necessarily disagree with Mr  Trump s criticism of the commonwealth s leaders  even if many locals dislike the president himself  or the disdainful way he sometimes refers to the island  We have a political caste that is opportunistic and extremely corrupt   said Eduardo Lalo  a well known local novelist  humanities professor and opinion columnist who supports Puerto Rican independence   What the president says  of course it s clumsy and tremendously vulgar  and he says it for reasons of his own that are not substantive  But it s also objective  Image We are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Gov  Ricardo A  Rossell of Puerto Rico said in a tweet to President Trump CreditThais Llorca EPA  via ShutterstockThe truth is  he said   Puerto Rico is a colony of the United States  and therefore its hands are completely tied  At a bakery in the comfortable San Juan neighborhood of Ocean Park on Tuesday  the morning crowd was hardly abuzz about Mr  Trump s comments  though people had noticed them One patron  Miguel Rodrguez  54  pulled out his cellphone to show how  moments earlier  a friend had posted on Facebook that she agreed with the president for the first time in praising Puerto Ricans but labeling their leaders  corrupt  Mr  Rodrguez  the owner of a company that installs security systems  scrolled down to the comment he left under his friend s post   We do not lack resources  we have too many thieves   The government wants to keep demanding money from the government of the United States   Mr  Rodrguez said   But much of that help doesn t reach the people  Politically  Mr  Rossell is in an unenviable position experienced by all of his predecessors  Puerto Rico cannot get funding even for its food stamp program without approval from Congress  but it has no congressional representation to make its case in Washington   Representative Jenniffer Gonzlez Coln  a Republican  has no vote in the House   None of the previous governors  however  had to deal with the dire consequences of a devastating hurricane in the middle of a government bankruptcy  Neither Trump nor any president of the United States nor any official in the United States has assumed the responsibility it has with Puerto Rico   Professor Lalo said   The great tragedy of the Puerto Rican people is that for 120 years  it calls Washington and no one picks up the phone  Mr  Rossell  who is up for re election next year  has faced intense criticism on the island for trying to work cooperatively with Mr  Trump even as the president was repeatedly deriding Puerto Rican leaders Last week  the governor amped up his language against Mr  Trump  appearing to refer to him as a  bully  in an interview with CNN  If the bully gets close  I ll punch the bully in the mouth   he said   It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage  He later characterized his comments as a metaphor Mr  Trump has refrained from going after Mr  Rossell by name  preferring to focus his attention Ms  Cruz  his political nemesis since her outspoken comments criticizing the Trump administration s failure to provide swift and meaningful help in the weeks after Hurricane Maria After Mr  Trump called Ms  Cruz  crazed and incompetent  on Twitter on Monday  she fired back  calling him  unhinged   He can huff   puff all he wants but he cannot escape the death of 3 000 on his watch   she wrote   SHAME ON YOU  Ms  Cruz recently declared her candidacy for governor  She and several other candidates are hoping to unseat Mr  Rossell in 2020  He is a supporter of Puerto Rican statehood  she is not  When he doesn t get his way  he tries to pit people against each other   Ms  Cruz said of Mr  Trump in an interview on Tuesday   Three thousand people died under his watch and he has never acknowledged it  He s now trying to weaponize help   and  in his desperation  he s lying about it  Calling Puerto Rican leaders  corrupt  reflects poorly on Mr  Trump s own administration  she added  If he thinks that the money that has come to Puerto Rico is money that we shouldn t have received  then he doesn t trust FEMA   she said   He shows his inability to lead and that he is incapable of understanding how his own government works   

WASHINGTON   During his presidential campaign  Donald J  Trump often complained about how President Barack Obama drew red lines that he never enforced  and how a diminished America let Russia walk into Syria unchallenged  something he said would not happen if the Russian leader respected the United States president Now  in Venezuela  President Trump is facing his own red line moment   again  with Vladimir V  Putin of Russia For the past week  the Trump administration has  escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country  claiming that Moscow is helping to prop up President Nicols Maduro of Venezuela and undermining the hopes of American officials that the Venezuelan military will oust him  The United States has been trying to rally the world behind Juan Guaid  the opposition leader  as Venezuela s legal interim president On Monday morning  speaking at the Army War College in Carlisle  Pa   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said flatly   Russia s got to leave Venezuela  That followed a statement on Friday by John R  Bolton  Mr  Trump s national security adviser  who said that the arrival of roughly 100 Russian military  advisers  in the country  along with new arms  posed  a direct threat to international peace and security in the region   Mr  Bolton also warned that no country should enter the Western Hemisphere  with the intent of establishing or expanding military operations  Such declarations seem to set up a test  Would Venezuela be the place where Mr  Trump  who has often seemed willing to tolerate Mr  Putin s most audacious provocations  finally draws his own red line  And  if so  does he have a plan to enforce it It is notable that Mr  Bolton  not Mr  Trump himself  made the Friday announcement  with its echoes of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine  the first time the United States issued similar warnings telling foreign powers not to intervene in the Western Hemisphere  In offering the unvarnished declaration on Monday   and while Mr  Trump focuses on the southern border   Mr  Pompeo said he was merely repeating the president s sentiments on Venezuela Yet Mr  Maduro is digging in   despite the economic sanctions against his government and the recognition of Mr  Guaid as interim president by the United States and more than 50 other nations  And Mr  Putin may well see an opportunity to replay Syria in Venezuela  propping up another leader that many American officials said had to go   Mr  Maduro instead of President Bashar al Assad of Syria  this time   and frustrating Washington s regional goals The administration so far has been quite cautious when it comes to threatening military action in Venezuela  While there have been ritual reminders that  all options are on the table   there is no indication that any military intervention   which has a long and unhappy history in Latin America   is being seriously contemplated Instead  the administration is beginning to talk about an extended battle of attrition  After the Maduro government declared last week that Mr  Guaid could not hold public office for 15 years  Elliott Abrams  the State Department s special representative for Venezuela and a veteran of many Cold War battles in Latin America  told reporters   I don t imagine that Juan Guaid is deeply worried because the Maduro regime  while it might be around in 15 days  is not going to be around in 15 years   Why is Russia helping Venezuela  He then talked about tightening sanctions on oil sales  dismissed Russian accusations that the United States was trying to mount a coup against Mr  Maduro and warned that it  would be a mistake for the Russians to think they have a free hand here   they don t   But he carefully avoided explaining why Mr  Putin might feel under constraint ImageA Russian military plane recently arrived in Venezuela  The Trump administration has escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country CreditYuri Cortez Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Putin has plenty of reasons for keeping Mr  Maduro in power  Russia is also focused on recovering billions of dollars in debt that Mr  Maduro owes it  some of which is being paid back in oil  Full repayment may never happen For Mr  Trump  this is the newest iteration of his many Russia problems   and the latest example of his reticence to talk publicly about Moscow s malign influence around the world  His silence is jarring  since Mr  Bolton  Mr  Pompeo and Gen  Joseph F  Dunford Jr   the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  talk about it almost every week They have all embraced the administration s year old national security strategy  which recognizes that a resumption of great power competition  not terrorism  is the primary challenge facing the United States today  Mr  Trump s former aides say  however  that he never read the full national security strategy  and they note that when he does talk about it  he almost never discusses Russia s behavior Perhaps that is a reaction to the enormous  bipartisan criticism he received after his seemingly deferential approach to Mr  Putin in Helsinki  Finland  last summer  when Mr  Trump once again appeared to be convinced by the Russian leader s denials that he had interfered with the 2016 United States presidential election Or perhaps it is rooted  as one of Mr  Trump s aides suggested recently  in a desire not to create the kind of public sound bites that Mr  Obama did   and that he came to regret It was Mr  Obama who declared in August 2011 that  for the sake of the Syrian people  the time has come for President Assad to step aside   And it was Mr  Obama who warned that  the use of chemical weapons is a game changer   then elected  once the chemical weapons were employed  to pull back from military action  Just a year ago  Mr  Trump was still citing that decision  declaring in a tweet that  if President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line in The Sand  the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago  The president is not alone in his critique of how the Obama administration handled Syria  One of the most thoughtful analyses of what went wrong came from William J  Burns  Mr  Obama s deputy secretary of state  in his new book on American diplomacy   The Back Channel   It is rife with warnings that could also apply to Venezuela Mr  Burns agreed with what he called Mr  Obama s  long game  calculus   which included  having the discipline to avoid getting sucked into another military entanglement in the Middle East  which would likely only underscore the limits of our influence in a world of predators for whom Syria s battles were existential  But he admitted that the Obama  short game  was lacking because  we misaligned ends and means  promising too much  on the one hand   declaring  Assad must go  and setting  red lines    and applying tactical tools too grudgingly and incrementally  on the other  Reached in London over the weekend  Mr  Burns praised the Trump administration for avoiding military entanglements that are bound to raise cries of American imperialism  even among Mr  Maduro s greatest opponents  But he said it was at risk of repeating some of the Obama administration s mistakes  The focus on building political and economic pressure is sensible   he said  And he noted that the geographic distance between Russia and Venezuela limited Mr  Putin s ability to affect events   Proximity matters   he said   They don t have a way to project their power in ways they demonstrably did in Syria  As a result  much hinges on Mr  Trump s ability to build a hemispheric coalition  a move that is being undermined  Mr  Burns argued  by the tension with Mexico  especially with Mr  Trump s recent threats to close the border and to end assistance to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras Mr  Maduro  too  may be learning some lessons from Mr  Assad  he said   As long as you control the guys with the guns  even the most unpopular and deeply repressive regimes have the capacity to hang on a lot longer than we might assume   

FAIRFAX  Va    A Virginia judge on Monday temporarily sealed divorce records for Stephen Moore  President Trump s presumptive nominee for the Federal Reserve board  adding to the tax and child support drama surrounding the pending nomination A Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County issued a temporary injunction sealing the 2011 divorce records at the request of Mr  Moore s former wife  Allison Moore  The court order does not list Mr  Moore as opposing the request  The judge scheduled a Friday hearing on the merits of keeping the documents under seal Those records  posted online Monday by The Guardian  which first reported details of the divorce  show that a judge found Mr  Moore in contempt of court in March 2013 for failing to pay more than  330 000 in spousal support  child support  attorney s fees and a one time fee to his ex wife  Mr  Moore had failed to pay six consecutive months of child support   and only a small fraction of the nearly  19 000 a month he had agreed to pay his ex wife in the divorce settlement   at the time of the ruling According to the records  Mr  Moore failed to respond to repeated requests from the Virginia court to make payments and did not show up for a deposition in the case  The court ordered him to sell his home to raise money to pay the debt and forced him to set up an automatic bank transfer each month  After Mr  Moore paid  217 000 toward the debt  Ms  Moore asked the court to revoke the order for Mr  Moore to sell his home  which it did The divorce case is the latest twist in the nomination saga of Mr  Moore  who is in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over  75 000 in back taxes  which are related to his child and spousal support payments Mr  Trump said last month that he would nominate Mr  Moore  a campaign adviser who  like Mr  Trump  was a loud critic of the Fed s interest rate increases last year  At the time of the announcement  Mr  Moore had not been formally vetted by the White House  The administration has not yet submitted his nomination to the Senate In her 2010 divorce complaint  Ms  Moore accused Mr  Moore of  emotional and psychological abuse  during their 20 year marriage  and accused him of carrying on an adulterous relationship that he was  neither discreet nor inconspicuous  about  The complaint said Mr  Moore had left receipts for dinners with his mistress around the house and that he purchased a T shirt for his lover with the words  Doing It  In his response  Mr  Moore said he did not contest anything in Ms  Moore s petition Neither Mr  Moore nor Ms  Moore responded to repeated requests for comment over the weekend or on Monday Mr  Moore is a longtime champion of tax cuts  deregulation and other conservative economic policies  He is a former editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal and the founder of the Club for Growth  which advocates lower taxes  He has held shifting positions on monetary policy over the years  including endorsing a return to the gold standard and  when President Barack Obama was in office  criticizing the Fed for leaving interest rates low in an effort to stoke economic growth Since Mr  Trump took office  Mr  Moore has pushed for lower rates  In December  angered by the fourth rate increase of the year  he called for the Fed s chairman  Jerome H  Powell  to step down or be fired Mr  Trump has lauded Mr  Moore s views on the Fed  but it is unclear whether he could win Senate confirmation Last year  the I R S  filed a lien against Mr  Moore related to the  75 000 in back taxes  Mr  Moore  in an interview last week with The New York Times  described that lien as a  huge miscalculation  by the agency It is unclear whether the  75 000 tax lien relates to the child  and spousal support payment delinquencies laid out by The Guardian Mr  Moore said in an interview on Thursday that  for a single tax year  he had claimed both the value of his alimony  which at the time was deductible for all divorces  and the value of his child support payments  which are not  He said the child support amounted to about  18 000  which  given his tax bracket  worked out to about  6 000 in taxes that he owed but did not pay  He blamed the error on his accountant But Mr  Moore said he was not simply hit with a back tax bill  After an audit  he said  the I R S  deemed his return for that year  fraudulent  and disallowed other deductions  With penalties and fees  the amount came to more than  75 000  he said Mr  Moore said he and his current wife had tried for years to resolve the issue with the I R S   including dispute resolution  but had not heard from the agency in nearly two years A prominent critic of Mr  Moore s nomination  the University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers  said he was deeply troubled that Mr  Moore had been held in contempt of court given that he could soon hold a seat on the Fed  For a Fed governor  your credibility is an important asset   Mr  Wolfers said   Putting someone in a position of trust who has been in contempt of court could easily create difficult situations  particularly in an institution like the Fed  which at least during the crisis had to invent new responses on the fly while making sure they were legal  White House officials were adopting a wait and see approach on Monday before deciding whether to go through with the nomination  according to two people familiar with the discussions  who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal White House conversations Mr  Trump  these people said  remains personally fond of Mr  Moore and values his loyalty  but has been surprised by the criticism of Mr  Moore and the negative reaction among some Senate Republicans  who were angered by Mr  Moore s previous comment that the president should fire Mr  Powell for raising interest rates  Mr  Moore has since apologized for that statement Questions have also arisen over Mr  Moore s tenure at The Wall Street Journal  including whether he wrote editorials that referred to groups that paid him to give speeches In May 2013  for example  Mr  Moore spoke at the Civitas Institute  a nonprofit conservative research group in North Carolina  He was paid more than  3 000 for an honorarium and expenses  said Brian Balfour  executive vice president for Civitas  The next month  Mr  Moore wrote an editorial about tax cuts in the state and approvingly quoted Civitas s former president  In July  in another editorial criticizing liberal protesters at the state s capital  Mr  Moore cited a Civitas analysis of financial statements from groups supporting the protests According to a Journal spokesman  editorial board members are  allowed to accept compensation for speeches from nonprofit organizations if they are approved in advance and do not overlap with the member s coverage area  Mr  Moore s predicament did not come up during a round of discussions on Monday at the White House between Mr  Trump and his economic team  according to a person familiar with the discussion  who also requested anonymity  The discussions  this person said  were focused on rebooting a repeal of Obamacare and included a presentation by Kevin Hassett  chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers  warning against the possible damage to the economy of closing the border with Mexico Appearing on CNBC on Monday morning  Mr  Hassett was not asked about the records  but called Mr  Moore  a great guy  Mr  Hassett suggested that Mr  Moore would likely avoid the public spotlight in coming days  When you re getting ready for Senate confirmation  you have to focus 100 percent on that   he said   I expect that s what we ll see from Steve going forward   

Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter WASHINGTON   It s no secret that President Trump really  really dislikes wind power  He s been vocal on the subject for years  ever since a battle with Scottish officials over a plan to build what he called a  really ugly wind farm  within sight of his golf resort in Aberdeen More recently  in rallies and speeches  Mr  Trump has stepped up his attacks on wind turbines  suggesting that their noise can cause cancer  there s absolutely no evidence of this  and predicting power failures when the wind stops blowing  also not true   Here s a closer look at a few of his recent comments You might get cancer   You won t  During a sometimes rambling digression about wind turbines at the National Republican Congressional Committee s annual spring dinner in Washington on Tuesday  Mr  Trump said   They say the noise causes cancer  The suggestion that turbine noises cause cancer is completely unfounded   The American Cancer Society is unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer   a spokeswoman for the group said in an email Separately  some researchers have been investigating claims that noise from wind turbines might cause other health problems like nausea  headaches or sleeplessness  So far  experts haven t found strong evidence of links to those conditions  although that debate is likely to persist  When compared to the research around coal power  an energy source that Mr  Trump has long championed  the difference is stark  There is ample evidence linking the particulate pollution from coal plants to heart disease  respiratory problems  and lung cancer  When Mr  Trump moved to relax restrictions on coal plant pollution last year  his own Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the change could lead to as many as 1 400 additional premature deaths each year by 2030 How Does Your State Make Electricity There s been a major shift in how America makes electricity over the past two decades  Each state has its own story Property values will plummet   Unlikely  At the same dinner  Mr  Trump made this claim   If you have a windmill anywhere near your house  congratulations  your house just went down 75 percent in value   There have been a few smaller studies suggesting that wind farm development may have depressed property values in some areas  But the balance of evidence suggests that this is uncommon  Much larger studies  including an analysis of more than 50 000 home sales across nine states conducted by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2013  have found no evidence that home values are generally affected by nearby wind projects  In any case  Mr  Trump s golf course in Scotland does not appear to have suffered financially after the construction of the wind farm nearby The lights will go out if the wind drops   They won t  At a rally in Ohio last month  Mr  Trump suggested that wind power was too unreliable to be useful   Let s put up some windmills   he said   When the wind doesn t blow  just turn off the television darling  please  There s no wind  Please turn off the television quickly  It s true that wind turbines generate electricity only when the wind is blowing  But that doesn t mean the power in your home will suddenly go out when the wind dies down Across the United States  regional grid operators typically rely on a diverse array of power sources throughout the day so that the lights stay on  During sunny hours  they can draw electricity from solar panels  When it s windy  they can make use of power from wind farms  If power from those renewable sources starts to drop  operators can use power from natural gas turbines or hydroelectric dams to fill in the gaps So far  America s grid operators have been very good at this balancing act  even as coal has declined and renewables have surged in popularity  Last year  wind power accounted for nearly one fifth of the electricity generated in the Texas grid  and people were still able to watch TV there  When power failures around the country do occur  it s almost always because of severe weather knocking out transmission lines  not because wind turbines stopped spinning However  it s also fair to say that if wind and solar power continue to expand   the two sources produced 8 2 percent of the nation s electricity last year and are growing rapidly   grid operators could face new challenges in juggling those intermittent sources Possible solutions for that might include adding batteries or other energy storage to balance supply and demand  or improving weather forecasts so that operators can better predict the output of wind farms  Or building more transmission lines to get access to wind power from distant regions  on the principle that the wind is usually blowing somewhere in the country Experts have concluded that it s technically possible for the United States to manage a lot more wind and solar power than it uses today  For instance  a 2016 modeling study published in Nature Climate Change found that  using existing technology  the country could get 55 percent of its electricity from wind and solar if it built a network of high voltage transmission lines  That study analyzed reams of historical weather data and concluded that the lights would stay on even with daily and seasonal fluctuations in the wind  To be sure  there are plenty of legitimate debates about what the power grid of the future should look like and how big a role renewable energy ought to play in that mix  But the fact that the wind can come and go is hardly a slam dunk argument against using wind power For more news on climate and the environment  follow  NYTClimate on Twitter They

WASHINGTON   The House on Thursday gave final passage to a bipartisan resolution forcing an end to United States military involvement in Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen  sending President Trump a pointed rebuke over his continued defense of the kingdom after the killing of a dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi The 247 to 176 vote  with 16 Republicans joining all House Democrats  invoked the rarely used War Powers Act to curb the president s executive power to wage war without congressional approval  It most likely sets up the second veto of Mr  Trump s presidency  this time to publicly defend a four year conflict that the United Nations has deemed the world s worst humanitarian crisis  with thousands of civilians killed and millions suffering from  famine The Senate passed the resolution in March  54 to 46  The vote in the Senate and in the House makes it clear that the United States will not continue to follow the despotic  anti democratic leadership coming out of Saudi Arabia   said Senator Bernie Sanders  independent of Vermont and one of the lead sponsors of the resolution   The United States should not be led into a war by a despotic  undemocratic  murderous regime  Supporters of the Yemen resolution have faced a grueling road in recent months to get the legislation onto the president s desk  The Senate   led by the resolution s authors  Senators Mike Lee  Republican of Utah  Christopher S  Murphy  Democrat of Connecticut  and Mr  Sanders   first passed the measure 56 to 41 in December  but Paul D  Ryan  the House speaker at the time  refused to take it up His successor  Speaker Nancy Pelosi  did  and the House easily passed it in February  But House Democrats inadvertently derailed the process by supporting a surprise procedural motion offered by Republicans to declare the chamber s opposition to anti Semitism  By attaching an unrelated amendment to the Yemen resolution  the House ended its  privileged  status  which would have forced the Senate to quickly take it up and send it to Mr  Trump The Senate then had to start from scratch The vote on Thursday amounted to a do over  Republicans again tried to derail the resolution with a last minute procedural maneuver to attach an amendment to condemn the movement to boycott  divest from and sanction Israel  a provision that put Democrats in a difficult position But this time  intent on ensuring the legislation would not be knocked off course again  Democratic leaders rallied their rank and file to oppose Republicans  efforts  Representative Ted Deutch  a Florida Democrat and one of the strongest pro Israel voices in the House  stood to condemn the Republican maneuver  This is about politics   he said   This is about trying to drive a wedge into this caucus where it does not belong  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the No  2 Democrat  accused Republicans of  using Israel as a partisan cudgel  and urged his colleagues to oppose the measure  Its intention is not to unite but to divide  Its intention is not to support our ally but to kill this bill through a cynical and dishonest tactic   Mr  Hoyer said as Democrats stood and applauded   Let s stop playing games with this very important and serious issue  To persuade the president to support the legislation  a bipartisan group of lawmakers   including Representatives Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and one of the lead sponsors of the resolution  and Matt Gaetz  Republican of Florida and one of the president s staunchest allies   requested to meet with the president  appealing to his desire  to achieve our shared interest in responsibly drawing down needless conflicts throughout the world  The House resolution employs the 1973 War Powers Act  which gave Congress the ability to compel the removal of military forces absent a formal declaration of war  Those powers  created in the wake of the Vietnam War  have almost never been used  as lawmakers have demurred from intervening in politically sensitive matters of war  peace and support for the troops  When we started talking with folks about doing this  they basically laughed it off   said Stephen Miles  the director of Win Without War  an advocacy coalition that lobbied for the resolution   They said it wouldn t happen  Congress doesn t ever invoke the War Powers Act  It was a really long arduous process of education  In its justification for opposing the resolution  the White House argued that the use of the act  is flawed  because the Pentagon has provided  limited support to member countries of the Saudi led coalition  in Yemen  That argument may have been more resonant years ago   repeated bipartisan attempts in 2016 to rebuke the American role in the Saudi led intervention stalled in both the House and the Senate  beginning with efforts to block the sale of munitions to the Saudis But after the killing of Mr  Khashoggi  a Virginia based columnist for The Washington Post  lawmakers on both sides of the aisle  livid at the administration s equivocal response  signaled a new willingness to reconsider the relationship with Riyadh  Lawmakers have grown increasingly vocal about reasserting their oversight on foreign policy  We are clawing back our constitutional responsibilities   said Representative Jim McGovern  Democrat of Massachusetts And the public has become more aware of the crisis in Yemen  where an estimated 80 percent of the population requires some form of humanitarian assistance or protection and millions are without access to clean drinking water  according to the United Nations  

WASHINGTON   As he threatens to shut down the southern border  President Donald Trump is considering bringing on a  border  or  immigration czar  to coordinate immigration policy across various federal agencies  according to four people familiar with the discussions Trump is weighing at least two potential candidates for the post  former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli  according to the people  who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversations publicly Kobach and Cuccinelli are far right conservatives with strong views on immigration  Cuccinelli was seen at the White House on Monday The planning comes as Trump is threatening anew to close the U S  Mexico border as soon as this week if Mexico does not completely halt illegal immigration into the U S  And it serves as the latest sign that the president plans to continue to hammer his hardline immigration rhetoric and policies as he moves past the special counsel s Russia investigation and works to rally his base heading into his 2020 re election campaign Aides hope the potential appointment  which they caution is still in the planning stages  would serve as the  face  of the administration on immigration issues and would placate both the president and his supporters  showing he is serious and taking action White House press aides  Kobach and Cuccinelli did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment  Kobach previously served as vice chair of the president s short lived election fraud commission  which was disbanded after finding little evidence of widespread abuse A Department of Homeland Security official noted that White House czars have been appointed in the past when there has been an  urgent need  for sustained  inter agency policy coordination  While Homeland Security often plays a leading role when it comes to immigration policy and enforcement  the department is not in charge of officials at the departments of Health and Human Services  State  Defense and Justice  which often play key roles Trump has often complained  both publicly and privately  about how he has not been able to do more to stop the tide of illegal immigration  which he has likened to an  invasion  and described as a national security crisis  Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100 000 arrests or denials of entry in March  More than half of those are families with children Still  Trump has been pushing  He has deployed National Guard troops to the border  forced a government shutdown to try to pressure Congress to provide more money for his long promised border wall  and eventually signed an emergency declaration to circumvent lawmakers  He also moved Saturday to cut direct aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras  where citizens are fleeing north and overwhelming U S  resources at the southern border Those moves have involved a swath of government agencies  The Justice Department manages the immigration courts that decide whether a migrant is deported  Health and Human Services manages the care of migrant children apprehended at the border  agencies within Homeland Security manage the allocation of legal status  immigration enforcement and asylum requests  and the Pentagon and the Army Corps of Engineers manage facets of border wall construction But not all are always on the same page Earlier this year  for example  Health and Human Services closed down a temporary facility being used to house migrant children in Tornillo  Texas  creating a problem for border agents who ran out of bed space when the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border spiked  Homeland Security is not allowed to hold children in detention facilities for longer than 20 days And last year  former Attorney General Jeff Sessions instituted a  zero tolerance  policy at the border without consulting others  causing a spike in the number of migrant children separated from their families The separated children were placed in HHS custody  but there was no tracking system in place to link parents with their children until a federal judge ordered one  causing widespread fear and concern about whether families would ever see each other again It has yet to be decided whether the czar position would be housed within Homeland Security or within the White House  which would not require Senate confirmation A person positioned within the White House could coordinate immigration policy across various agencies  working closely with aides who are deeply involved in the issue  including senior advisers Stephen Miller and Jared Kushner  national security adviser John Bolton and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  who supports the idea Appointing a person based within Homeland Security could be trickier because the department s agency heads are all Senate confirmed positions and  in the case of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U S  Customs and Border Protection  are longtime immigration officials with decades of experience dealing with the border While immigration officials would welcome an adviser focused specifically on policy across the varying agencies  the names being floated are likely to spark backlash and criticism Kobach  an immigration hardliner  ran a failed bid for governor promising to drive immigrants living in the U S  illegally out of the country  He has recently been working for a nonprofit corporation  WeBuildtheWall Inc   which has been raising private money to build Trump s wall Cuccinelli has advocated for denying citizenship to American born children of parents living in the U S  illegally  limiting in state tuition at public universities only to those who are citizens or legal residents  and allowing workers to file lawsuits when an employer knowingly hires someone living in the country illegally for taking a job from a  law abiding competitor  Thomas Homan  the former acting ICE director  has also been mentioned as a potential pick  according to one of the people familiar with the talks     

WASHINGTON   Barbara Bush didn t bite her tongue in recent years when it came to Donald Trump  She just didn t like him  But a new biography of the former first lady finds that her disdain for the Republican president  who transformed the party her own family had embodied for generations into his likeness  dates as least as far back as a 1990s diary entry She referred to Trump in the entry as  the real symbol of greed in the 80s  Mrs  Bush  who was 92 when she died last April   gave Susan Page  author of  The Matriarch  Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty   access to volumes of her diaries  which she began keeping in 1948  The former first lady recounts in a January 1990 entry about reading a news article on Trump speaking at a Los Angeles charity awards dinner for Merv Griffin  Former President Ronald Reagan and his wife  Nancy  attended the gala  and Trump needled the former president over pricey speeches he had given in Japan Mrs  Bush later showed a friend news clips about Trump s separation from his first wife  Ivana  and noted that allies of the soon to be ex Mrs  Trump were saying a  25 million settlement in the prenuptial agreement she signed wouldn t be enough  The Trumps are a new word  both of them   Mrs  Bush wrote   Trump now means Greed  selfishness and ugly  So sad  Her dislike of Trump spiked more recently over the way he belittled her son  Jeb  when the New York businessman and the former Florida governor competed for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination  Trump also had criticized other members of the Bush clan  including George W  Bush over starting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Page  the Washington bureau chief for USA Today  also reveals that Mrs  Bush blamed Trump for causing her  angst  during the 2016 election   she called it a  heart attack    and leading her to question whether she was still a Republican  Asked in the months before she died whether she still considered herself a Republican  Mrs  Bush answered   I d probably say no today  The book  based also on five interviews Page conducted with Mrs  Bush  is due in bookstores Tuesday  It comes nearly a year after the passing of the second woman in U S  history to be the wife of one president and the mother of another The former first lady had drafted a tongue in cheek letter to send after the November 2016 election welcoming former President Bill Clinton to the club of first spouses  Clinton s wife  Hillary Clinton  was the Democratic candidate  and Mrs  Bush thought  as did many voters  that she would be the next president The letter never saw a mailbox  She woke up the morning after the election  and discovered  to my horror  that Trump had won  Weeks later  however  she wrote to Melania Trump  At the time  Mrs  Trump was the subject of intense speculation over whether she would relocate to the White House from her family s penthouse at New York s Trump Tower  Mrs  Bush encouraged the incoming first lady to do what was best for her and for the couple s young son  Barron  Mrs  Trump attended her predecessor s funeral Until the day she died  Mrs  Bush also kept on her bedside table a red  white and blue digital clock  given to her as a joke  that counted down to the end of Trump s term Mrs  Bush  who had been living in constant pain  fell and broke her back shortly before she died  In the hospital  after receiving the news that she was dying  she asked her doctor to keep it a secret  Once back at her Houston home  receiving only palliative care  she sat in the den holding hands with her husband of 73 years  They had the longest presidential marriage in U S  history He gave  Bar   as he called her  permission to die  and she gave her then 93 year old husband permission to live Then they each had a drink  bourbon for Mrs  Bush  a vodka martini for the former president She died two days later

In the post Watergate era  most Americans have taken for granted that a president would not fire an F B I  director investigating him  or replace an attorney general for insufficient loyalty to the president s personal interests  Dangling a pardon before potential witnesses to influence their testimony  Unheard of Whatever one s feelings about the end of the Mueller investigation  the Barr letter makes one thing clear  The guardrails that were established after Watergate against these types of abuses have been smashed  We still need to see the full Mueller report  but unless corrective steps are taken  Mr  Trump and Mr  Barr will have changed  perhaps profoundly  the shape of presidential power  and in troubling ways It s therefore up to Congress and the 2020 presidential candidates to step in and harden the policies that for 40 years prevented improper political interference in law enforcement They can do this by enacting comprehensive legislation to codify rules and practices that were previously voluntary  Those who subscribe to the Barr memo view of expansive executive power might claim that such legislation would violate the Constitution  On the contrary  such legislation would help enforce it First  Congress should restrict when and how the White House intervenes in law enforcement actions  giving teeth to the norms of the post Watergate era  One model for such legislation is a reform born out of President Richard Nixon s abuse of the I R S  to target enemies  Congress made it unlawful for certain officials  including the president  to  request  directly or indirectly   any I R S  officer or employee to  in effect  weaponize a taxpayer audit  Congress could apply that approach by prohibiting a president from intervening in individual law enforcement proceedings   or at a minimum require notification when a president or members of the White House staff do so  Such a rule would have imposed an additional bar  for example  on the president trying to get the Department of Justice to block the AT T Time Warner merger in retaliation for CNN s coverage  or from trying to investigate or prosecute political opponents Second  Congress should ensure that if the president issues or even dangles pardons in an attempt to block an investigation into his own interests  legislators will receive documents regarding the underlying investigation  once it s concluded   This will both ensure accountability and deter bad faith behavior  Representative Adam Schiff s Pardon Abuse Prevention Act provides a good start  it could be supplemented to apply to so called dangled pardons and to force disclosure of discussions with pardon seekers in investigations implicating the president Third  Congress can make it harder for the government to mislead the public  A little known law called the Information Quality Act creates a requirement that federal agencies ensure the quality  objectivity  utility and integrity of information they provide to the American people  Strengthening the act so that it applies to the president would help expose disinformation and make it more difficult for presidents to take executive actions based on false  determinations  and  findings   Finally  Congress should prohibit the president from using federal law enforcement powers to interfere in an electoral campaign  Procedures designed to check some such activity exist in the United States Attorneys Manual  but that merely compiles prudential guidelines  Congress should harden these rules and expand them to cover other law enforcement agencies  such as the Department of Homeland Security   It could require a Civil Service process to approve sensitive actions around campaign season  An even stronger measure could require early stage confidential judicial approval before a law enforcement action that might impact the outcome of an election could be taken  Such reforms would make it harder for a president to abuse power   such as by timing investigations or announcements to affect a political campaign  using the security clearance process to silence critics  sending immigration authorities to polling places or intervening in Secret Service activities to protect candidates and events Campaign season shouldn t bring government to a halt  and law enforcement shouldn t ignore actual wrongdoing in an electoral context  But given the abuses we ve seen in the past two years and others that might easily take place in the future  we ignore additional protections at our peril Some of these ideas already have bipartisan support  Clear statements by Congress implementing constitutional principles would also provide standards by which courts and the American people could judge the president s conduct The Constitution commands that the president  take care that the laws be faithfully executed   At its core  this commands the president to act in good faith  The founders thought this directive was so important they put it in the Constitution not once but twice  in the  take care  clause and the president s oath As the founders understood  the only reason We the People would delegate sovereignty to elected officials is if we were assured they would exercise that power in the public interest  If our legal system were to approve of the president exercising that power instead to protect his own interests  as the Barr letter does  we may find that our democratic experiment won t extend much longer Ian Bassin   ianbassin  and Justin Florence   justingflorence  are co founders of the nonpartisan nonprofit Protect Democracy  They both previously served as associate White House counsels The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what

WASHINGTON   At the heart of President Trump s negotiations with China is a troubling contradiction  The United States wants to use the trade talks to encourage the country to adopt a more market oriented economy  But a key element of a prospective deal may end up reinforcing the economic power of the Chinese state Negotiators are still working out deal terms  but any agreement seems certain to involve China s promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods  For Mr  Trump  this is an essential element that will help reduce the United States  record trade deficit with China and bolster farmers and other constituencies hurt by his trade war But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state  and most will be carried out by state controlled Chinese businesses  further cementing Beijing s role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese  It seems like those types of really simplistic purchasing commitment type of arrangements would actually reinforce state ownership rather than discourage it   said Rufus Yerxa  the head of the National Foreign Trade Council  which represents the United States  largest exporters After months of talks  the two sides are inching closer to an agreement  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  and Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  discussed the remaining sticking points with their Chinese counterparts on Thursday evening and Friday in Beijing  Mr  Mnuchin wrote on Twitter on Friday that the talks had been  constructive  Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by this week  to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He  the Chinese special envoy charged with negotiating the deal  who will begin meeting with his American counterparts on Wednesday The United States and China had been looking to reach a tentative agreement by the end of Mr  Liu s visit  with a signing ceremony between Mr  Trump and President Xi Jinping of China potentially later this month But the two sides are still wrestling with two major sticking points  how an agreement will be monitored and enforced and how many of Mr  Trump s tariffs come off and when  said Myron Brilliant  executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce Mr  Brilliant said there was no question the United States and China were  in the endgame with regard to a deal   However  he said these factors were  complicating the fact that the agreement is 90 percent done at this point  To pave the way toward an agreement  China made several announcements that could benefit American companies  Last week  Chinese regulators approved JPMorgan Chase s request to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country  a change China had discussed since entering the World Trade Organization two decades ago  Chinese officials have also floated the idea of an expanded trial that would allow foreign cloud computing companies to operate more freely On Sunday evening  China s Finance Ministry issued two statements saying that Beijing would continue to suspend tariffs it imposed last year on American cars and car parts in retaliation for Mr  Trump s tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese imports  Those tariffs  which were suspended while the two sides tried to reach an agreement  were supposed to resume at the end of March  but China said it would extend the suspension indefinitely as a gesture of good will ImageChina imported more than  100 billion worth of American goods last year  including large volumes of soybeans CreditChristopher Smith for The New York TimesThe Finance Ministry said   We hope that the U S  and China will work together to step up consultations and make practical efforts toward the goal of ending trade friction  While the two sides are closer to an agreement than at any point in the past  it remains unclear how successful the Trump administration will be in achieving its key goals  The president s trade war was initiated in large part to try to reorient the Chinese economy and force it to become more open to American companies and investment  Using punishing tariffs as leverage  the Trump administration has pressed China to roll back its heavy hand in the economy  including asking Beijing to curtail subsidies to state owned firms and to end its practice of forcing foreign companies doing business in China to transfer their technology to Chinese competitors China has not readily committed to these goals  in part because such commitments are seen as infringing on China s sovereignty and undercutting the power of the Chinese state  What the Chinese have agreed to most readily is purchasing American goods  especially commodities that can fuel their economy While the final list could be different  the United States and China have discussed the purchase of products including corn  soybeans  sorghum  natural gas  oil  coal  chemicals  semiconductors and airplanes  according to people with knowledge of the talks The Trump administration views these purchases as necessary to bolster the president s support across farming and manufacturing communities hard hit by the trade war and to help narrow the gap between what China sells to the United States and what it buys  The administration has been working on various draft lists of what it wants China to purchase  according to people who have viewed them The final purchasing amount is not yet clear  In December  Mr  Mnuchin said that China had made an offer to buy more than  1 2 trillion in American goods as part of the talks  But economists and China analysts have cautioned that such a large amount could be hard for the United States to produce and export The United States exported just  120 billion of goods to China last year  With the American economy hovering near full employment  it lacks the productive capacity to raise exports by hundreds of billions of dollars in the short term  The United States could redirect some of the goods it sells to other countries to China instead  for instance diverting soybeans headed to Europe to China But a deal that would require China to buy even more from the United States is raising concerns that China could expand its leverage over the United States  If it can be negotiated by government fiat  it can be taken away by government fiat   said Kevin Book  managing director at ClearView Energy Partners  an energy focused research firm The deal could usher in a wave of new American exports if China agrees to open its markets more fully  Removing its requirements that American carmakers and financial services firms team up with a Chinese entity to do business in the country  for instance  could give those firms more ability to sell goods and services to China But in other industries  including agriculture  energy and aviation  purchases associated with a trade deal would be made directly by state controlled entities  And while that would mean greater revenues for American companies  skeptics say it could also increase the leverage that China has over the United States in the future  We are handing them the ability to coerce our companies   said Derek Scissors  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute ImageWhile China would like to buy more tech goods  one of the Trump administration s biggest fears about China is that it is leading a state sponsored effort to unseat the United States as the leading technological power CreditKin Cheung Associated PressSuch a purchasing arrangement could also provoke challenges at the World Trade Organization  which bars its members from granting special advantages or privileges to any one country  as well as directing state enterprises to purchase goods from a specific country China has already demonstrated its ability to influence commodity purchases depending on the tenor of relations  analysts said  Once trade tensions flared  China drove its purchases of American oil to nearly zero last year  Mr  Book said  After a breakthrough in talks this year  China ramped up its purchases of United States soybeans  How easy would it be for the government of China to then turn off that tap when it gets into a dispute with the U S    Mr  Yerxa asked Recent events have also raised a question over some components of the purchasing package under discussion  China had planned to buy Boeing 737 Max series planes  But the crash of a 737 Max in Ethiopia in early March  the second deadly crash of the new plane in less than five months  has thrown those plans into question Last week  China suspended the airworthiness certification for the model entirely  a move Richard Aboulafia  vice president for analysis at the Teal Group  described as  pretty aggressive   I think there s a very good chance that this is less about public safety and more about trade negotiation leverage   Mr  Aboulafia said It s also unclear how many purchases of semiconductors  the advanced components that power circuits in laptops  smartphones and other electronics  will ultimately be in the deal While China would like to buy more of the advanced technology  the Trump administration is concerned about allowing Beijing to gain an upper hand in the next generation of technology  The administration has pushed China to roll back its Made in China 2025 campaign  an industrial plan that pumps state money into building cutting edge industries  like advanced manufacturing and aviation China had proposed last year to purchase  200 billion of American semiconductors  according to people with knowledge of the deal  Beijing wanted to buy the semiconductors straight from fabrication lines at American factories and then do the necessary packaging and testing in China  The United States rejected that idea  The two sides have since discussed a smaller number  but it is not clear now how many semiconductor purchases will ultimately be included in a deal The semiconductor industry has publicly warned that additional purchases could result in the Chinese government s gaining more power to control where Chinese companies buy products  While Chinese companies may buy more American components in the short term  the industry warns that Beijing could ultimately use such a system to redirect purchases to Chinese suppliers instead For now  administration officials are still trying to assure lawmakers that their trade deal will achieve the economic changes the United States wants and will require much more than purchases When pressed by lawmakers in February about whether the deal would require more than just additional sales to China  Mr  Lighthizer told Congress   I do not think it should just be a purchase agreement   

ANCHORAGE  Alaska   President Donald Trump s plan to reverse environmental initiatives in Alaska put in place by his predecessor  Barack Obama  took a hit with two rulings in federal court U S  District Court Judge Sharon Gleason on Friday ruled that the administration violated federal law with a proposed road that would split a wilderness area in a national wildlife refuge Hours later  Gleason ruled that Trump exceeded his authority when he reversed bans on offshore drilling in vast parts of the Arctic Ocean and dozens of canyons in the Atlantic Ocean Environmental groups celebrated the rulings as a judicial check on presidential authority  The broader context is that President Trump s lawlessness is catching up with him   said Earthjustice attorney Erik Grafe  who worked on the offshore drilling case   He and his Interior Department have been treating public lands as if they re gas stations   everything opening up as much as possible as quickly as possible for development  specifically oil and gas development  U S  Sen  Lisa Murkowski  an Alaska Republican  said she strongly disagreed with the ruling on Arctic offshore drilling  which asserts that presidents have the power under a federal law to remove certain lands from development but cannot revoke those removals  Only Congress has that authority  the ruling said Murkowski said the ruling could have catastrophic impacts for offshore development  which creates jobs  generates revenues and strengthens national security  I expect this decision to be appealed and ultimately overturned   if not by the Ninth Circuit  then by the Supreme Court   she said Trump is pushing two other oil initiatives in the region   the proposed opening of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to petroleum drilling  and expanding drilling into previously protected parts of the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Trump has made it clear since taking office that he intended to dismantle the environmental legacy of Barack Obama  the first president to visit the Arctic while in office Obama used his authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to ban oil drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas off Alaska s north coast with the intent of protecting polar bears  walrus  ice seals and the Native villages that depend on the animals from industrialization and oil spills Trump reversed the ban through an executive order as part of a promise to unleash the nation s energy reserves  reduce reliance on foreign oil and spur jobs Environmental law and policy experts immediately questioned whether Trump had that authority Gleason ruled that he did not  The wording of President Obama s 2015 and 2016 withdrawals indicates that he intended them to extend indefinitely  and therefore be revocable only by an act of Congress   Gleason wrote In her decision on the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula  Gleason said the proposed road would reverse previous Interior Department policy without providing an explanation Murkowski and other Alaska officials have pushed for the road to give residents of the village of King Cove a land route to an all weather airport for emergency flights  Critics contend other measures are available Izembek is internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl  U S  Fish and Wildlife officials had previously concluded that a road would cause irrevocable damage to the watershed and a land exchange could not compensate for the special qualities of the refuge David Raskin  president of Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges  said Monday it would have been the first time that wilderness protections put in place by Congress had been removed so a road could be built  This would set a dangerous precedent for all kinds of developments in congressionally designated wilderness   Raskin said Gleason is a veteran judge  She was appointed to the Alaska state Superior Court in 2001 and was retained by voters twice before In 2011  Obama made her the first woman appointed to the federal bench in Alaska Gleason has overseen other high profile environmental cases  In 2015  she granted a request by Royal Dutch Shell that activists protesting the company s Arctic offshore drilling plans be ordered to stay away from company vessels Two months later  she ruled that Greenpeace USA would be fined  2 500 for each hour its activists blocked a Shell icebreaking ship from leaving Portland  Oregon  by dangling from the St  Johns Bridge over the Willamette River  

WASHINGTON   Democrats controlling the House are proposing to cut back President Donald Trump s budget hikes for the Pentagon while significantly increasing spending on the domestic programs they favor Tuesday s move ramps up a battle with Trump and puts the Democratic House on a collision course with the GOP held Senate as the two chambers consider separate paths forward on the 12 annual spending bills  Work on the legislation is sure to consume lawmakers for months Trump s budget promised a 5  defense budget increase to  750 billion next year  while cutting day to day operating budgets for domestic agencies by  62 billion  or 10  Trump s proposal is a nonstarter with Democrats and Republicans alike  but there s been no progress on forging a bipartisan agreement that would be required to stave off the return of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration The Democratic proposal is by Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth of Kentucky and powerful Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York The plan would boost funding for nondefense agencies to  639 billion  up from  605 billion now  with  7 5 billion on top of that to cover costs for the U S  Census Defense would get a boost from  716 billion now to  733 billion under the Democratic plan  cutting Trump s planned Pentagon increase of  34 billion in half Yarmuth failed in his efforts to develop a more traditional   but nonbinding   congressional budget plan that would put lawmakers on the record on tax increases  Medicare and agency spending  Divisions among Democrats proved too difficult to overcome  and even the stripped down plan released Tuesday exposed rifts between party liberals and more pragmatic lawmakers The bill is scheduled for a committee vote Wednesday  but liberal Democrat Ro Khanna of California announced Tuesday evening on Twitter that he would oppose the measure  saying it would fund  endless wars  while not adding enough to domestic programs At issue is the roughly one third of the federal budget called discretionary spending that Congress passes each year  which is comprised of Cabinet agency budgets  Larger  mandatory  programs like Medicare and Social Security mostly run on autopilot Yarmuth said the plan is  a responsible framework for the country that ensures we make the needed investments for American families  our economy and our security  Without a deal signed into law by Trump  crunching budget limits   called spending  caps  in Washington speak   would kick in  whacking the defense budget down to  576 billion and nondefense agencies down to  543 billion  Lawmakers set the painful limits back in 2011 as a deficit cutting backstop in case a budget  supercommittee  failed to come up with an alternative The supercommittee collapsed in failure and lawmakers have been dealing with the hangover ever since  passing three different two year deals to set more realistic caps  The most recent catchall spending bill  passed in February to end a 35 day partial government shutdown  marked the end of the most recent agreement Republicans immediately blasted Tuesday s measure  which  unlike prior spending agreements  doesn t included offsetting spending cuts elsewhere in the budget to limit its impact on the deficit  House Democrats are not focused on doing a budget  nor are they focused on addressing our nation s mountainous debt   said Rep  Steve Womack of Arkansas  the top Republican on the Budget Committee   This bill doesn t include offsets or bipartisan input   key components of past caps deals  Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  D Calif   and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   would like to forge another bipartisan agreement to establish higher  more realistic spending levels  We have had some conversation about what we would do about the caps and where we go from here   Pelosi said Tuesday at a Washington event hosted by Politico But no real progress has been made  lawmakers and aides say  in great part because the White House is hostile to the idea Once Democrats translate their proposal into spending legislation  it s sure to attract a string of veto threats from the White House Instead  speculation has mounted that any measure to ease the automatic cuts may be tacked on this summer to must pass legislation to maintain the government s ability to issue bonds to cover its expenses  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump eased up Tuesday on his threats to shut the southern border this week as officials across his administration explored half measures that might satisfy the president s urge for action  like stopping only foot traffic at certain crossings Facing a surge of Central American migrants trying to enter the U S   Trump last week threatened to seal the border this week if Mexico did not immediately halt all illegal immigration into the U S   a move that would have enormous economic consequences on both sides of the border While Trump on Tuesday did not back off the idea completely  he said he was pleased with steps Mexico had taken in recent days and renewed his calls for Congress to make changes he contends would solve the problem  Let s see if they keep it done   he said of Mexico   Now  if they don t  or if we don t make a deal with Congress  the border s going to be closed  100    He also said that he might only close  large sections of the border  and  not all of it   He added that his posturing was  the only way we re getting a response  Later Tuesday  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen held an emergency call with Cabinet members and White House aides  saying   We are going to treat it as if we have been hit by a Category 5 hurricane   according to a person on the call  The person was not authorized to discuss the call publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Nielsen was creating an emergency operations center and named U S  Border Patrol official Manny Padilla as an operational crisis coordinator to manage the response from within the different immigration agencies at the Department of Homeland Security  Padilla is a 30 year Border Patrol veteran and was recently the head of the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas His job will be different from that of the immigration or  border czar  that Trump is considering  the official said Closing the border completely would disrupt manufacturing supply lines and the flow of goods ranging from avocados to cars  making for a  potentially catastrophic economic impact   in the words of Republican Sen  Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader Some inside the administration also worry it would only exacerbate illegal immigration Meantime  administration officials grappled with how they might minimize the impact of a shutdown or implement less sweeping actions White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow  for example  told CNBC he s been looking at potentially keeping truck lanes open  We are looking at different options  particularly if you can keep those freight lanes  the truck lanes  open   he said  As for the hundreds of thousands of tourists and workers who cross the border legally  Kudlow said   that may be difficult  Earlier  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had told reporters that  while   Eventually  it may be that it s the best decision that we close the border   the president was  not working on a specific timeline  and all options remained on the table  The Council of Economic Advisers  she said  was conducting a number of studies on the impact  and  working with the president to give him those options  White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in an appearance on MSNBC that closing only certain entry ports  or parts of all of them  could be among the steps short of closing the entire border It was a shift from Trump s threat late last week to seal the whole border  and quickly   I am not kidding around   he said then  exasperated by the swelling numbers of migrants  thousands of whom were being released into the U S  because border officials had no space for them  Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100 000 arrests or denials of entry in March  a 12 year high  More than half of those are families with children  who require extra care With southern border facilities near a breaking point  U S  officials are busing many migrants hundreds of miles inland and dropping them off at bus stations and churches  Trump has mocked and vowed to end that  catch and release  practice but overwhelmed authorities saw no choice Responding to Trump s threats  Nielsen rushed home late Monday night from Europe  where she was attending G7 security meetings and intended to fly to the border mid week to assess the impact of changes already made  including reassigning some 2 000 border officers assigned to check vehicles to deal with migrant crowds and new efforts to return more asylum seekers to Mexico as they wait out their case Officials were hoping to have as many as 300 asylum seekers returned to Mexico per day by the end of the week near Calexico and El Paso in Texas and San Ysidro in California  Right now  only 60 a day are returned Nielsen has also requested volunteers from non immigration agencies within her department and sent a letter to Congress seeking more money and detention space and broader authority to deport families faster  The request was met with disdain by Democrats Even absent the extraordinary step of sealing a national border  delays at border stations have been mounting due to the personnel reassignments  Homeland Security officials said  When the Otay Mesa  California  entry port closed for the night Monday  150 trucks were still waiting to get into the U S Shutting certain border stations or parts of them would not be unprecedented  Over the Thanksgiving holiday last year  Trump claimed he d already  closed the border  after officials briefly closed the northbound lanes at San Ysidro  California  for several hours in the early morning to bolster security because of concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members Mexican officials announced Monday they d pulled 338 Central American migrants  181 adults and 157 children  off five passenger buses in a southern state that borders Guatemala  and said they had detained 15 possible smugglers on immigration law violations  But that was not unusual for Mexico  which has for years been cracking down on migration In 2014 then President Enrique Pena Nieto launched a program that was described as ensuring orderly migration but in practice resulted in making it much more difficult for Central Americans to transit    Associated Press writers Catherine Lucey and Darlene Superville in

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered a crackdown on counterfeit products on third party online marketplaces  asking for more information on how the United States can better track and curb such sales  The memo signed by Trump said that the value of global trade in counterfeit and pirated goods may rise to half a trillion dollars a year  with about 20 percent of this trade infringing upon U S  intellectual property  The president has decided it is time to clean up this Wild West of counterfeiting and trafficking   White House economic adviser Peter Navarro said on a conference call with reporters Companies including Amazon com Inc  eBay Inc and China s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd have policies that ban counterfeit goods and have pointed to their investments in programs to keep fakes off their platforms The memo did not identify specific companies by name   Amazon invests heavily in proactive measures to prevent counterfeit goods from ever reaching our stores  In 2018 alone  we spent over  400M fighting counterfeits  fraud  and other forms of abuse   an Amazon spokesperson said on Wednesday Alibaba said in a statement that it welcomes the initiative  and the attention it brings to the global fight against counterfeiting   Alibaba has developed best in class systems to protect IP and battle the scourge of counterfeiting   the company said   We look forward to further advancing the working relationship and cooperation that we have with the U S  federal agencies mentioned in today s order  as well as with our global commerce peers  The move comes as Trump and his economic advisers are locked in trade talks with China that the president says aim to reduce the theft of U S  intellectual property The order requires the Homeland Security Department  together with the departments of Commerce and Justice  to provide recommendations in 210 days on how to address the problem through better monitoring and enforcement  Navarro said   Reporting By Steve Holland  Editing by Meredith Mazzilli  

WASHINGTON    Not any longer  And with that  a triumphant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to close the book Tuesday on a divisive Republican debate  convincing President Donald Trump to shelve plans to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters It was a rare public disclosure of private counsel from the Republican leader  And it signaled that  after two years in Trump s Washington  Republicans on Capitol Hill are figuring out how to handle the president and his impulsive swerves on policy Trump insisted Tuesday it was his idea to switch course  I wanted to delay it myself   Trump said during an event at the White House   I want to put it after the election  Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week  backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   he said Speaking later Tuesday at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump said   Republicans should not run away from health care      If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose  Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  The president stunned Republicans last week by announcing he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  insisting the GOP could become the  party of health care   Republicans wanted no part of a do over after their failure to replace the law in 2017  Facing a revolt from the ranks  McConnell told the president he needed him to listen  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Several times McConnell told Trump to listen  the person said  And it worked  Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much  So we don t have a misunderstanding about that   McConnell said Tuesday Trump s shift   he tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections  when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House    made clear that the health care debate will be left for voters to decide during the race for the White House That arrangement suits Democrats just fine  They are denouncing Trump s attempt to overturn the ACA in court and floating various health care plans  including an expansion of government funded Medicare with so called  Medicare for All   setting up a stark contrast between the parties for the campaign trail Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will  hold Americans hostage through 2020  on an issue that affects millions of people  He said that Trump  insists he has a magic plan that we can see if only the American people re elect him  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats  health care battle with Trump is  a values fight  After Trump dropped the issue on Republicans last week  many hoped it would just go away  They had no comprehensive proposal to replace the ACA law and no big plans to unveil one  Publicly and privately  Republicans tried to talk to Trump McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking Rep  Mark Meadows  R N C   a Trump confidant  called shifting the debate to 2021  a very pragmatic decision   He said Tuesday that  spending quality time to develop a comprehensive strategy  would be  critical  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s 2010 health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017 when Republicans controlled both chambers in Congress  He still blames the late Sen  John McCain for joining other senators to oppose a last ditch plan While Republicans gained Senate seats last fall  GOP senators   particularly those up for re election next year   weren t looking for another fight over the law  They saw how the issue played in 2018  when Democrats made it the cornerstone of their successful drive to win back the House Preserving health care protections  and especially for people with pre existing conditions  resonates with voters  According to AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide  nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care at the top of a list of key issues As Democrats have blamed Republicans for trying to end the ACA  GOP backed challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts Last week  the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down  an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured In his late Monday tweets  Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that  will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America  Republicans appeared relieved that  for now  that battle will be fought during the campaign  rather than in Congress The No  2 Senate Republican  John Thune of South Dakota  said the president  has some big ideas and  to his credit  wants to solve problems   But Thune said   you run into that wall of reality   of a divided Congress with Democrats in control of the House  which requires bipartisanship  Trying to convey what the obstacles are to getting what he wants to get done in the next two years is something I think a number of our members conveyed to him   Thune said    Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump took a shot on Tuesday at former Vice President Joe Biden  a possible Democratic rival in the 2020 race for the White House  mocking him over allegations of unwanted physical contact with women In a speech to a fundraising dinner for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump twice alluded to the allegations from two women that are hanging over Biden as he weighs whether to enter the contest to become the Democratic candidate in November 2020 presidential elections A former Nevada state legislator last week accused Biden of kissing her on the back of the head at a 2014 event  and a Connecticut woman said Biden rubbed noses with her at a 2009 event  Biden has said he did not believe he ever acted inappropriately  and his defenders have said he is known for hugging and being physically affectionate In wide ranging remarks that meandered for more than 80 minutes but often circled back to the 2020 race  Biden was the only potential rival Trump mentioned by name   a sign that he would view Biden as a strong challenger  were he to enter and win the Democratic race Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama and had a long career in the Senate before that  He had been expected to announce his bid for the Democratic primary race this month and has led the large field of Democratic hopefuls in opinion polls Trump told the dinner  which raised  23 million for Republicans running for the House of Representatives  a story about wanting to kiss a general he met in Iraq who had promised an expedient end to a campaign against Islamic State militants in Syria  I said   General  come here and give me a kiss   I felt like Joe Biden   Trump said  drawing laughter and applause Earlier  he told the crowd   which was dotted with members of the House   that they would be  going into the war with some socialists  in the next election  It looks like the only non   sort of  heavy socialist is being taken care of pretty well by the socialists   Trump said One of Biden s accusers has been a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders  who has already entered the Democratic primary race  and whose views are to the left of Biden  I was going to call him   I don t know him well   I was going to say   Welcome to the world  Joe  You having a good time  Joe  You having a good time   Trump said Trump struggled during his 2016 run for office with multiple accusations of unwanted sexual contact from women  particularly after videotaped remarks emerged of Trump bragging about groping women Biden  while campaigning for Trump s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton  had said he would like to take Trump  behind the gym  to beat him up for the comments   Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland  Editing by Michael Perry  

WASHINGTON   His border shutdown went from imminent to uncertain  A major health care push was declared and then delayed  Funding cuts were inserted in his proposed budget and just as quickly taken out President Donald Trump has been exploring the art of the climb down Trump pivoted on two big policy fronts this week  easing up on his threats to quickly close the southern border and deciding that a fresh effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act should wait until after the 2020 election The moves came as Republicans  outside groups and aides expressed anxiety about the potential economic and political fallout from Trump s proposals The president s swift backpedaling underscored his off the cuff style and suggested that more such drama is likely ahead as he tries to sync his policymaking with his re election campaign To many  the Washington whiplash was another reminder that Trump tweets first and governs later  Most presidents and even most CEOs  when they make a decision that is going to have financial impact or personnel impact  you seek a lot of input   said Republican strategist Rick Tyler   He doesn t do that  Even his own communications staff says he goes by his gut  The president s pronouncements and social media blasts are often surprise attacks  They can vanish as quickly as they emerge if political expedience warrants a different tack His announcement last week that the GOP was going to take on health care again despite a bruising and unsuccessful effort in 2017 stunned most in his own party and seemed driven in part by a lingering desire to fulfill his oft repeated 2016 campaign promise to repeal  Obamacare  He surprised his own education secretary with the declaration that he was reversing a plan to ax federal aid for the Special Olympics after the proposed cuts sparked a public outcry Few working for him ever want to get out in front of a Trump announcement for fear it will change at the last minute Trump s latest policy twists come after the conclusion of the special counsel s Russia investigation and as the president is turning his attention to his 2020 campaign His loose style also reflects his current leadership team  Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is viewed as a less controlling figure than previous chiefs  seeking to provide Trump with analysis and information  but not trying to restrict his conversations or steer his decisions After threatening last week to seal the border if Mexico did not immediately halt all illegal immigration into the U S   Trump on Tuesday appeared to be laying the groundwork for a delay  saying he was happy with steps taken by Mexico and that he would like to see Congress pass legislation revising the immigration system  Still  he held open the possibility of a border shutdown  saying   I m totally ready to do it  Trump has been threatening the closure privately for months  but his staff has been trying to slow him down with data about the economic impact and suggestions on ways to lessen the financial hit The president acknowledged the economy was on his mind Tuesday but played down those concerns  saying   Let me just give you a little secret  Security is more important to me than trade  On health care  Trump plunged into the fight again last week  prompted by a court deadline  But his motivations were always as political as they were legislative  with the president not wanting to cede a 2020 campaign issue to Democrats  And allies stressed Tuesday that the president had never laid out a timeline for legislation With his tweet Monday night  Trump made clear there would be no vote until after the 2020 election  though he insisted a GOP plan still was in the works His downgrade came after pressure from congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who said he told Trump  we were not going to be doing that in the Senate  Asked if he was acting at McConnell s behest  Trump insisted   I wanted to delay it myself  Heading into 2020  Trump sees border security and health care as key issues for his political base and he is expected to keep pushing them even if he dials back specific threats Speaking Tuesday night at the National Republican Congressional Committee s spring dinner  he declared that Republicans  should not run away from health care   If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose   Trump said    Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Kevin Freking contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   Stephen Moore  President Trump s presumptive nominee for a seat on the Federal Reserve board  said on Tuesday that he had no plans to withdraw from contention for the job despite ethical and financial problems that have surfaced in recent days  It s full speed ahead   Mr  Moore said in a brief interview before an event he was attending at the Trump International Hotel in Washington His potential nomination to the Fed has been clouded by revelations of a current tax lien and child support issues stemming from a previous marriage  Court records show that Mr  Moore  a conservative economist and a longtime adviser to Mr  Trump  was held in contempt of court in March 2013 for failing to pay more than  330 000 for spousal support  child support  attorney s fees and a one time fee to his ex wife  Allison Moore Mr  Moore also owes  75 000 in federal taxes  interest and penalties  according to court documents filed last year  which said a tax lien had been placed last year on his home in Montgomery County  Md Mr  Moore said that the White House was  100 percent  behind him and that he did not expect any other red flags to derail his expected nomination  He declined to address the specifics of the tax lien or the contempt of court citation  It s all been resolved   Mr  Moore said After his divorce became final in 2011  Mr  Moore failed to pay six consecutive months of child support   and only a small fraction of the nearly  19 000 a month that he had agreed to pay his ex wife  according to court documents Mr  Moore failed to respond to repeated requests from the Virginia court to make payments and did not show up for a deposition in the case  In 2013  the court ordered him to sell his home to raise money to pay the debt and forced him to set up an automatic bank transfer each month  After Mr  Moore paid  217 000 toward the debt  Ms  Moore asked the court to revoke the order to sell his home  which it did Mr  Moore previously told The New York Times that his dispute with the Internal Revenue Service was a result of a misunderstanding  He said he had claimed both the value of alimony to his former wife  which is deductible on federal tax forms  and the value of his child support payments  which are not eligible for a tax break  He also referred questions about the tax lien to his wife  Anne Carey Moore  who also said Mr  Moore had inadvertently deducted both alimony and child support payments On Monday  a Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County  Va   issued a temporary injunction sealing the 2011 divorce records at the request of Mr  Moore s former wife  The judge scheduled a Friday hearing on the merits of keeping the documents under seal  and Mr  Moore said he planned to ask the court to seal them permanently A moment before the interview  Mr  Moore was overheard telling an acquaintance that the attention on his personal life had been difficult  It s been a stressful time   he said But the personal drama does not seem to have affected Mr  Trump s plan to nominate Mr  Moore  who recently impressed him with calls for the Fed to cut interest rates  When the president told reporters that he would nominate Mr  Moore  a former editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal and the founder of the Club for Growth  the White House had not performed the kind of vetting that is typical for nominees On Tuesday  Larry Kudlow  director of the National Economic Council  said both he and Mr  Trump continued to support Mr  Moore for the Fed s board of governors  I think he ll make a great governor   Mr  Kudlow said   We are standing fully behind his candidacy  Asked if Mr  Trump was concerned about any of the recent allegations against Mr  Moore  Mr  Kudlow replied   No  not at all  He declined to specify when Mr  Moore would be formally nominated   He s being vetted right now  He s going through the regular process  He ll do fine  Mr  Kudlow  who was a best man at Mr  Moore s wedding  appeared to make light of the situation on Tuesday evening during a screening of a new film at the Trump Hotel After Mr  Moore gave opening remarks and saluted his wife  Anne  Mr  Kudlow expressed confidence in the nomination and offered a comedic caveat  All those good things will come true as long as you let Anne Moore deal with the I R S  The audience erupted in cheers and laughter  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump said Monday he wants to follow up on criminal justice reform with efforts that help federal inmates find jobs after they leave prison Congress passed legislation last year called the First Step Act that gives judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders and boosts prisoner rehabilitation efforts  The effort drew strong support from Republicans and Democrats worried that mandatory minimum laws had generated unfair sentences in many drug related cases Trump said Americans with criminal backgrounds are unemployed at rates up to five times the national average  which stood at 3 8 percent in February He said a  Second Step Act  will focus on  successful re entry and reduced unemployment for Americans with past criminal records   His goal is to cut that unemployment rate for ex prisoners to single digits within five years The president was short on details about what future legislation would include  but the White House said Trump s budget for the next fiscal year proposes more than  500 million to help prisoners succeed after their release  When we say  hire American   we mean all Americans  including former inmates who have paid their debt to society   Trump said Trump was joined on stage by a handful of former prisoners who have been helped through the First Step Act  He asked each of them to speak  sparking a unique level of spontaneity  sadness and cheer in the White House East Room as they recounted their experience  Gregory Allen noted that two months ago he was in a prison cell  and now he was telling his story at the White House  calling it an example of what would  make America great again   Allen said  borrowing from the president s trademark phrase as the audience laughed and applauded  

WASHINGTON   The House voted Wednesday to condemn the Trump administration for pushing a federal appeals court to obliterate the Affordable Care Act  and it urged the Justice Department to defend the law in court The vote  240 186  was nonbinding  but it documented the House s support of the health law  which was passed nine years ago without the votes of any Republicans  With the resolution  Democrats sought to put Republicans on the record for failing to come to the defense of the health law s most popular provisions  such as protecting people with pre existing medical conditions and mandating coverage for  essential health benefits   like mental health coverage  prescription drugs  emergency services and maternity care Eight Republicans voted for it  One Democrat opposed  The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land  and it is the responsibility of the Justice Department and the administration to defend the law of the land in court   Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said   What are they doing  Just the opposite  Why  Because they don t believe in governance  That is why they are happy to shut down government  The resolution  which expresses the sentiment of the House but is not subject to approval by the Senate or by President Trump  states   The actions taken by the Trump administration seeking the invalidation of the A C A  s protections for people with pre existing conditions  and later the invalidation of the entire A C A   are an unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people  Republicans called it an empty gesture  This will do nothing for your health care   said the House Republican leader  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California   But what will it do  It will make a great press release  Representative Greg Walden  Republican of Oregon  said the resolution was a political screed and  doesn t do a darn thing to protect people with pre existing conditions   Democrats would rather play politics with health care and attack the president for political purposes  rather than work with us on what could and should be bipartisan solutions   Mr  Walden said Democrats relished the opportunity to test Republicans  commitment to health care  an issue sure to figure in 2020 elections  I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeatedly claim that they stand for protections for people with pre existing conditions and for other protections included in the Affordable Care Act   said Representative Frank Pallone Jr  of New Jersey  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee   Well  now is your chance to show it  A federal judge in Texas invalidated all of the Affordable Care Act in December  Last week the Trump administration told the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  in New Orleans  that it agreed with the judge s decision  California and other states that support the Affordable Care Act have appealed the decision If the entire law is struck down  millions of people could lose coverage provided through the expansion of Medicaid and through private insurance subsidized by the federal government ImageRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California  the House Republican leader  called the House resolution an empty gesture   This will do nothing for your health care   he said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesRepublicans have voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act  and many were reluctant this week to criticize the position taken in court by the Trump administration  But they said they would be ready to respond if the law falls to a legal challenge  If the court strikes down the Affordable Care Act  Republicans will act to protect those with pre existing conditions   said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas  the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee   We will work to make health care more affordable  guaranteeing that folks can see local doctors or go to their local hospitals  and we will preserve other important provisions  such as no lifetime limits and allowing kids to stay on their parents  plans until age 26  At the same time  Mr  Brady called the existing health law unconstitutional and called the resolution criticizing the Justice Department a  political stunt  The House Energy and Commerce Committee is working on legislation to hold down insurance costs and reverse what Democrats describe as the administration s efforts to sabotage the health law But Senate Republicans have been badly divided as they consider a response to Mr  Trump s announcement late Monday on Twitter that the party was  developing a really great HealthCare Plan  to replace the Affordable Care Act Some  averse to an election year fight on the issue  have said they would wait to see what Mr  Trump might propose  Some have praised him for raising the issue again  Back home  what we have right now is an unmitigated disaster   said Senator David Perdue  Republican of Georgia   As an elected official  it s our responsibility to bring solutions  And what President Trump is saying is that if Congress is gridlocked right now  which it is on this topic  then he wants to start a dialogue about what it is he stands for  And I applaud that  But Mr  Trump pulled back his request for a health law replacement after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  told him no such legislation would be coming before the 2020 election Opinion polls show that Democrats have a political advantage on health care  Asked why voters should trust Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act  after they failed in 2017  Senator Ron Johnson  Republican of Wisconsin  said   I would understand their skepticism  The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the health law s requirement for people to have insurance   the individual mandate   as an exercise of Congress s taxing power  Judge Reed O Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth ruled that the requirement became unconstitutional after Congress brought that tax penalty to zero in the tax cut signed by Mr  Trump in 2017  and he said that other provisions of the law could not survive because they were inextricably linked to the mandate Two Republican state attorneys general  Dave Yost of Ohio and Tim Fox of Montana  filed a legal brief this week saying there was  no basis  to strike down the whole law just because the individual mandate was unconstitutional They said the mandate could be severed from the health law without throwing out other provisions  like the protections for people with pre existing conditions  The Justice Department under Mr  Trump initially said that the mandate and the protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down  But last week  the department went further and said it agreed with the Texas judge who ruled the entire law was invalid  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Wednesday to rein in what the administration calls the  Wild West  of online trafficking in counterfeit goods The memorandum is aimed at stopping the sale of counterfeit products on sites like Amazon  eBay and China s e commerce leader  Alibaba  This president has decided that it s time to clean up this Wild West of counterfeiting and trafficking   said Peter Navarro  director of the White House National Trade Council  The central core of the problem is that right now  third party online marketplaces     have zero liability when it comes to trafficking in these counterfeit goods  That simply has to stop  We are going to attack that on numerous fronts  In a statement released on Wednesday  Amazon said that it  strictly prohibits  the sale of counterfeit products and welcomes more coordinated support from law enforcement to stem the problem  Amazon said that last year it spent more than  400 million fighting counterfeits  fraud and other forms of abuse  We have built industry leading tools like Brand Registry  Transparency and our newly launched Project Zero to protect our customers and help rights owners drive counterfeits to zero   the company said   With these and other tools  we ensure that over 99  of the products that customers view on Amazon never receive a complaint about counterfeits  Navarro said discussion of possible actions the administration will take to deter online trafficking in counterfeit merchandise is premature  He says the directive orders the Department of Homeland Security to work with other agencies on a report identifying the scope of the problem  The report also is to identify the origin of the fake goods and recommend administrative  regulatory  legislative or policy changes to stem the problem Alibaba also released a statement saying it would welcome the administration s work to combat counterfeiting  The company said it has developed systems to protect intellectual property and has worked with brand name companies  law enforcement  consumers and trade associations to battle the problem The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that the value of trade in counterfeit and pirated goods is about a half trillion dollars a year  with roughly 20  infringing on U S  intellectual property  according to the directive The U S  is engaged in a trade dispute with China after the Trump administration made several complaints  including that China was stealing U S  trade secrets and was forcing companies to give them technology to access its market  Trump imposed tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese imports  about half what the United States buys from that country  China retaliated with tariffs on about  110 billion of U S  items  Trade talks are ongoing Navarro told reporters in a conference call  however  that the new memorandum has nothing to do with the U S  China trade talks or Trump s criticism of Amazon owner  Jeff Bezos  Trump has accused Amazon of not paying its fair share of taxes  harming the U S  Postal Service and putting brick and mortar stores out of business A recent Government Accountability Office report examined four categories of frequently counterfeited goods  and  based on a small sample of these goods purchased through various online third party marketplaces  investigators found that more than 40  were counterfeit  Navarro said    AP Retail Writer Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   In President Donald Trump s estimation  the 2020 census will be pointless unless a question is added that asks people if they are citizens That opinion makes him a distinct outlier in government  business and society  where the big census conducted every 10 years produces a gold mine of information on how people live and  of course  how many there are TRUMP   Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question  Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together     tweet Monday THE FACTS  Trump s disdain for conducting the once a decade census without a citizenship question is not shared by his own Census Bureau researchers  Nor is it consistent with the many operations of government and business that make billions of dollars in spending decisions as well as policy decisions based on the most accurate possible count of the U S  population According to January 2018 calculations by the Census Bureau  adding a citizenship question to the decennial census form would cause lower response rates among noncitizens  leading to an increased cost to the government of at least  27 5 million for additional phone calls  visits to the home and other follow up efforts to reach them  The Constitution requires a count every 10 years of  the whole number of persons in each state   long understood to include all residents of the U S The count goes to the heart of the U S  political system  It s used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House and how the electoral votes that decide presidential elections are distributed It also shapes how 300 federal programs distribute more than  800 billion a year to local communities  according to an analysis by the GW Institute of Public Policy at George Washington University  Communities and businesses depend on it  as well  in deciding where to build schools  hospitals  job training centers  grocery stores and more The GW institute s analysis of the effects of an undercount on five programs administered by the Health and Human Services Department  for instance  found that 37 states lost a median of  1 091 in the 2015 budget year for each person missed in the 2010 census Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has argued that a citizenship question is needed   or is  very important   as Trump puts it   to help the government better comply with the Voting Rights Act  But the Justice Department has been enforcing the 1965 law  which was passed to help protect minority groups  political rights  with citizenship data already available from other government surveys Meantime  civil rights groups and states with higher shares of immigrant populations such as California and New York cite a greater harm to the political rights of minority groups if a citizenship question in the decennial census dissuades immigrants from participating  resulting in diminished representation in the U S  House Not since 1950 has the census collected citizenship data from the whole population The Supreme Court this month is hearing the Trump administration s appeal of a federal judge s ruling in New York that Ross  whose department oversees the census  violated federal law by making an  arbitrary and capricious  decision that twisted contrary evidence  A judge in California also has ruled that a citizenship question would violate the Constitution s requirement to count the population    Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

WASHINGTON   For Donald Trump  the rigid rules of golf are flexible  allowing for the kick of a wayward ball into a better location  skipping a putt that looks close enough  What s the big deal That is according to Rick Reilly  a former Sports Illustrated columnist who has just written the book  Commander in Cheat   which alleges Trump is guilty of all sorts of sins on the golf course In an interview with Reuters on Thursday  Reilly laid out a number of accusations to support his view that the U S  president s golf game is  well  not par for the course  particularly for a president who owns a string of golf resorts Among the charges  Playing with pros Tiger Woods  Dustin Johnson and Brad Faxon in November 2017  Trump hit two balls in the water on one hole but didn t charge himself any penalty strokes The pros all saw it happen  but just grinned their way through it  Why didn t they call him out for the violation  Because he s so fun and we want our own stories to tell about the cheating   Reilly said he was told At Winged Foot  a famous golf club in Westchester County  New York  Trump had a reputation among the caddies for kicking his ball into a better position so often that they called him  Pele   the former soccer star  Reilly said While Trump has in the past claimed a golf handicap of 2 8  meaning he typically will average three strokes over par over 18 holes  his handicap is actually about 10  said Reilly  This idea that Donald Trump is a great golfer   he s not   said Reilly   He s good  He s a 72 year old man who s a 10 handicap  That s pretty good  But why isn t that good enough  One time Democrat Hillary Clinton  who Trump defeated in the 2016 election  had her brother  Hugh Rodham  to play a round at Winged Foot but showed up wearing shorts and was told he had to have long pants  Reilly said Rodham ended up wearing Trump s rain pants in order to meet the dress code  and gave them back when he was done  This didn t sit well with Trump when he found out about it  Somebody tells Trump this and he was so mad he made the club buy him a whole new rain suit   said Reilly Reilly said the point of the book is to show what Trump is really like behind the scenes  Golf is a window into a guy s soul and this gives a pretty good view of the guy   he said The White House declined to comment   Reporting by Steve Holland  Editing by Susan Thomas  

WASHINGTON   President Trump has long been focused on measuring his brand  obsessively reviewing television ratings  cataloging his magazine covers and fixating on polls But Mr  Trump may not like how his brand is faring in one important metric  his  E Score   a number compiled by E Poll Market Research that is not publicly available  but which marketing executives  network television stations and advertisers rely on to figure out which personalities appeal to audiences   and which do not Like the Q Score  which measures the appeal of celebrities  the E Score calculates awareness and appeal of individuals in the public eye  But it also tracks how individuals score on more than 40 personality and physical attributes In terms of those attributes  Mr  Trump was most often described as  aggressive   48 percent  and  mean   38 percent   according to his scores from December that were obtained by The New York Times  He also scored high for being  insincere    confident  and  creepy   But he scored between 0 and 4 percent for the attributes of  sexy    impartial    handsome  and  physically fit  About 29 percent of people described Mr  Trump as  overexposed   And his overall strong positive appeal is 14 percent  compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 39 percent Among adults over the age of 55  Mr  Trump consistently held more positive appeal than among those who are younger  Mr  Trump also consistently held more positive appeal with men than with women  across all age groups Marketing  advertising and entertainment executives pay E Poll Market Research an annual subscription of  17 000 and up to access its database  allowing them to analyze the views of American consumers and assess the marketing effectiveness of each celebrity rated  The company  which has about 10 000 profiles in its database and surveys about 1 100 online participants every week  started tracking Mr  Trump when he was a television personality on  The Apprentice   according to a spokesman  Randy Parker  We do not approve of the use of E Poll s data in this story and cannot confirm or deny the information you were given   he said In 2010  during the heyday of  The Apprentice   Mr  Trump s Q Score showed he was more popular with African American and Hispanic audiences than he was with white audiences  according to  Devil s Bargain  Steve Bannon  Donald Trump and the Nationalist Uprising   by the journalist Joshua Green Back then  advertisers viewed Mr  Trump as a symbol of multiculturalism  according to Mr  Green s book  But Mr  Trump no longer has an updated Q Score because he left the entertainment industry  the company Marketing Evaluations stopped tracking him in the winter of 2015  He definitely had the profile of a  love to hate  personality going into the election   said Henry Schafer  executive vice president of the company   He had one of the lowest positive Q Scores and one of the highest negative Q Scores  It looks like he just continued doing that up until today  ImageSupporters at Mr  Trump s rally in Grand Rapids  Mr  Trump scores consistently higher with men than with women CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesMr  Schafer said the key to Mr  Trump s success was  extremely high awareness   even if much of it was negative   You always have a portion of the population that enjoys that kind of reality  and that s his base   he said Officials in the Trump White House also receive E Scores  in part because networks often want to know how those officials are perceived Ivanka Trump  the president s elder daughter  has about 70 percent name recognition  compared with 35 percent for her husband  Jared Kushner  37 percent for Kellyanne Conway  a White House counselor  and 37 percent for Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the press secretary  in a reminder of the overwhelming celebrity power of her last name  Mr  Kushner and Ms  Conway s scores were from May  while Ms  Trump s and Ms  Sanders s score were compiled in December In terms of facial recognition  Ms  Trump scored 47 percent  slightly higher than Ms  Conway and Ms  Sanders  the most public facing administration officials  who both scored a 32 percent for facial recognition Ms  Trump s overall strong positive appeal was 12 percent  compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 21 percent  While Ms  Trump was more disliked than liked among every age group by men and women alike  she consistently had a slight edge with men over women Ms  Trump is most popular among adults over the age of 55 and least popular with adults between the ages of 18 and 24 In a list of attributes that celebrities are graded on  Ms  Trump was most often described as  attractive   32 percent    beautiful   28 percent  and  glamorous   25 percent   She ranked lowest on  funny   1 percent    can identify with   2 percent  and  exciting   3 percent  That was higher than the ratings for Mr  Kushner  whose overall strong positive appeal was 6 percent and whose overall strong negative appeal was 36 percent  Mr  Kushner rarely appears on television and has no social media profile  But he is a constant figure in the news  given his broad portfolios and influence in the White House Mr  Kushner scored highest for the attributes of  insincere   29 percent    creepy   27 percent  and  overexposed   22 percent   He was lowest in terms of  exciting    glamorous  and  emotional   rating 1 percent in those categories Ms  Conway  a regular presence on network and cable television touting Mr  Trump s accomplishments and criticizing the way he is covered  had a strong positive appeal of 9 percent and a strong negative appeal of 43 percent Ms  Sanders  who has phased out the regular White House press briefing  which often had contentious back and forths with reporters  and is now more often seen in friendlier venues like the morning show  Fox   Friends   ranked somewhat higher  with a strong positive appeal of 19 percent and a strong negative appeal of 28 percent The scores show the public views Ms  Sanders as more of an honest broker than Ms  Conway  who became infamous in the administration s early days for coining the phrase  alternative facts  Ms  Sanders scored 15 percent for  trustworthy   compared with Ms  Conway s 8 percent ranking in the same category  Ms  Conway was described by 31 percent of respondents as  insincere   compared with 27 percent for Ms  Sanders  

AUSTIN  Texas   The Texas Senate has approved a resolution supporting President Donald Trump s assertion that there is an immigration  crisis  on the U S  Mexico border The non binding language was introduced on the floor by Houston Republican Sen  Paul Bettencourt on Tuesday Outnumbered Democrats said they were blindsided and complained bitterly during hours of heated debate   but they didn t have the votes to stop it The purely ceremonial resolution stated that the  Texas Senate supports the president in his efforts to move forward with emergency action  on the border Still  lawmakers had previously largely avoided thorny immigration debates  despite Texas  1 200 mile border with Mexico The U S  House and Senate voted against Trump s use of emergency power to build a border wall  but he vetoed the resolution and Congress was unable to override him 

WASHINGTON   Colluding with Russia  The special counsel says no  Cheating at golf  Well  that s something else From pulling a fast one on Tiger Woods to exaggerating his handicap  Donald Trump s alleged misdeeds on and around the golf course are the subject of a new book by former Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly   Commander in Cheat  How Golf Explains Trump   Reilly documents dozens of examples of underhanded golf behavior by the president  transgressions talked about by pro golfers and duffers alike  In golf  he s definitely not exonerated   Reilly told The Associated Press   There s been dozens and dozens of people that can declare him guilty of cheating  One infamous instance came in a 2017 round with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson  who is the current No  1 player in the world  The president s playing partner  Fox Sports golf analyst Brad Faxon  reported that Trump s offenses included putting down a score that didn t account for two balls he hit into the water on one hole  You ve heard so much about it  it s almost like you want to witness it so you can tell the stories   Faxon is quoted as saying No big deal  many would say  It s only a game But outside of formal tournaments  golf is a game of honor in which individual players act as their own referees  keep their own scores and assess themselves penalties for rule violations  Trump s cheating  Reilly said  motivated him to write the book Says Reilly   I don t know much about politics  but I know golf and it really offended me  not as a voter or as a citizen   just as a golfer  Reilly quotes players who accuse Trump  his caddie and Secret Service agents of regularly moving his golf balls out of difficult lies  At Winged Foot Golf Club in New York  the only non Trump property where the president is a member  Reilly writes   The caddies got so used to seeing him kick his ball back onto the fairway they came up with a nickname for him   Pele    That s the world soccer star from Brazil Sports announcer Mike Tirico says Trump once threw Tirico s golf ball off the green into a nearby bunker when they played together Some of the allegations aren t new  Boxer Oscar De La Hoya told The AP in 2016 that Trump cheated against him twice in the space of two holes   Yes  I caught him   De La Hoya said   It was unbelievable  But I guess it was his course  so it was his rules  Trump  by all accounts  is a good golfer  especially for his age  Reilly writes  But the 2 8 stroke handicap he claims is the product of manipulation  A handicap is based on a golfer s most recent 20 scores and allows players of different skill levels to compete fairly against each other  Someone with Trump s handicap typically would shoot scores about three over par  Despite making more than 150 visits to his golf courses since taking office  Trump has logged only one round in the online USGA Handicap Index   and a 96 at that Trump s love of playing belies his past criticism of President Barack Obama s regular play and his own campaign declaration that he d be so busy in the White House   I m not going to have time to go play golf   It helps to know golf  because golf explains Trump   Reilly says  The president peppers his public statements with golf metaphors  tweeting in December about the Federal Reserve   The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch   he can t putt  And Reilly contends Trump s early days on the course provide a window into his zero sum world view Trump honed his game at Cobbs Creek  a public course outside of Philadelphia  which he later described as full of  hustlers  and where he  learned about everything   Reilly describes it as the sort of course where  everybody is trying to grift you   and where Trump learned  I got to cheat them before they cheat me  Bryan Marsal  the chair of the 2020 U S  Open to be played at Winged Foot  told Reilly that Trump began one game with him as a partner by warning   You see those two guys  They cheat  See me  I cheat  And I expect you to cheat because we re going to beat those two guys today  Trump is hardly the first president accused of bending the rules at golf  Bill Clinton was infamous for his  Billigans    taking do over shots openly and without remorse  But Reilly  who s known Trump for decades and played with him for his book  Who s Your Caddy   recounts Trump s score altering and other schemes as  so brazen you almost admire it  Reilly  clearly no fan of the president  said he undertook the project because of Trump s  whopper    repeated over the course of the campaign and in the White House   that he won 18 club championships Reilly could not corroborate a single Trump victory in a club championship  and found the president s tally includes at least one in which Trump never played on the course that day  another in which he counted the inaugural round at a yet to be opened club  and 12 that were  actually senior or super senior club championships  The White House did not respond to a request for comment Reilly said he s issuing Trump a challenge to defend his reputation in a match on a course that he doesn t own refereed by officials   offering  100 000 to the charity of the president s choice  Reilly  whose handicap is a 4 8  says he s confident Trump  can t cover that 2 8  No way     AP Golf Writer Doug Ferguson contributed    Follow Miller

President Trump  in his most recent rebuke of Central American nations for what he says is their failure to address the issue of migration  announced plans to cut off aid to three nations   Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador   known as the Northern Triangle  Critics of the cuts say they will target programs aimed at preventing violence  curbing extreme poverty and hunger  and strengthening the justice system   the very problems residents of those countries give for leaving home and pursuing a more stable future elsewhere  Though the administration has offered little in the way of details about what precisely could be cut  the State Department notified Congress on Friday night that it would divert about  450 million in aid from the region  President Trump also threatened to seal off the southern border of the United States with Mexico if that country  doesn t get with it  So what s really at stake  and what types of programs could these cuts affect in each nation  The United States Agency for International Development describes the multiyear Strategy for Central America  which is responsible for dispersing much of this aid  as focused on institutional reforms and developmental challenges that drive migration  The programs it supports enhance security  improve governance and promote prosperity  Here are some examples of programs financed by American dollars in the three countries targeted by President Trump  ImageCoffee Mill worker Rosa Gonzalez  left  sorts coffee beans on a conveyor belt at Fedecocagua  a coffee mill outside of Guatemala City  as the

aid from the United States  It is used to enhance economic growth  food security  and rural and social development  according to the Washington Office on Latin America  a human rights research group  According to the group s most recent figures  which are for 2017  more than  78 6 million was awarded to programs that support those goals  An additional  28 8 million went toward border and drug control   22 million to governance and human rights  and  48 2 million to improve security and justice that year  The dozens of continuing projects include Feed the Future Guatemala  which focuses on increasing farmers  incomes  improving rural nutrition and strengthening food security  The Agency for International Development estimates it will invest  36 million over a five year period from 2017 to 2022 The Youth and Gender Justice Project  a program aimed at providing support and services to victims of violence  including youth  women and other vulnerable people  The project will receive an estimated  37 4 million from 2016 to 2021  The Community Roots Project  a World Vision program that creates educational  cultural  athletic and employment opportunities for young people in Guatemala  The program is estimated to receive  40 million from 2016 to 2021  The Agency for International Development said in a 2018 fact sheet that its programs in Guatemala have led to an increase in income in high migration areas and reduced impunity for criminals by strengthening the courts  Honduras  American aid to Honduras is mostly focused on security  the justice sector and violence prevention  according to the Washington Office on Latin America  with  65 5 million in aid going to those types of programs in 2017  An additional  116 million went that year to projects that supported education  sustainable farming and business development  Some of the projects include Alliance for the Dry Corridor  or ACS  which promotes agricultural diversity and aims to decrease poverty and malnutrition in western Honduras  The program is estimated to receive  60 6 million from 2014 to 2020 Avanzando con Libros  a project set to receive  9 9 million from 2017 to 2020  It provides books for students and teachers in schools in need Alianza de Caf  which is to receive  2 million between 2018 and 2022  and provides support to small scale coffee farmers to expand the industry and create opportunities in struggling communities  The Agency for International Development  in a 2018 fact sheet detailing its programs in Honduras  said that its investments in the country had contributed to an increase in

USAID funded Justice System Strengthening Project in Sonsonate  El Salvador  last year CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesEl Salvador  In El Salvador  the majority of American aid also goes toward security  the justice sector and violence prevention  though at a much higher scale than in Honduras and Guatemala  according to data from the Agency for International Development  The aid supports projects across the spectrum  including those that strengthen the justice system and create jobs  A sample of these are The Crime and Violence Prevention program  which received approximately  39 8 million from 2013 to 2019 from the United States  It partners with the government of El Salvador to bolster community based crime fighting and support innovative ideas for violence prevention

WASHINGTON   One year out from the start of the 2020 census  Census Bureau officials set out Monday to demonstrate the importance of the head count for all Americans  President Donald Trump offered a different message  saying the count will be  meaningless  if it doesn t include a citizenship question In a tweet Monday  Trump blamed  Radical Left Democrats  for opposing the  all important  question on citizenship The Trump administration wants to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census  But the idea faces court challenges from Democratic leaning states and communities that argue it would make immigrants and their families less likely to respond to the constitutionally mandated tally and thus make the count less accurate The official counting begins on April 1 next year  To mark the date one year out  Census Bureau officials held a briefing Monday to begin raising awareness and project confidence that they re up to the monumental task Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham declined to answer a question about the president s tweet  saying  we really want to restrict our comments to talking about the great job we re doing  where we are and how it s going to help this nation  Dillingham noted that the census for the first time will give people the chance to respond online  People can also respond by telephone and mail  He cited how easy it will be to provide requested information and to assure that the information will be secure and confidential  But probably the message we really want to emphasize is how important it is   Dillingham said   We now live in an information age where accurate data improves the quality of our lives and supports our thriving economy  The decennial census is used to help determine how about  675 billion in federal dollars is distributed each year  State and local governments use it to make decisions about where to locate schools and health clinics and provide social services and improve roads and bridges  The survey results are also used to distribute electoral college votes and congressional district seats The citizenship question has been caught up in litigation in federal courts  where lower courts have ruled that the administration s haste to include the question violated federal law and the Constitution Trump tweeted that without a citizenship question  the  Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together  Against the advice of career officials at the Census Bureau  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross decided last year to add the citizenship question to the survey for the 10 year headcount  saying the Justice Department requested the question to improve enforcement of the federal Voting Rights Act The Supreme Court is hearing the Trump administration appeal of a federal judge s ruling in New York that the decision violated federal law  Since then  a judge in California has said a citizenship question also would violate the Constitution A resolution of the citizenship matter is needed soon to allow the government to start printing the census questionnaire House Democrats are also investigating the decision by Ross to add the citizenship question  A congressional panel will consider issuing subpoenas on Tuesday if it doesn t get a commitment from the Commerce Department that it will provide certain documents and witnesses A Commerce Department official asked Rep  Elijah Cummings  the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform  to hold off on considering or issuing the subpoena  while our good faith dialogue continues  Cummings warned the department on Friday that his committee wanted to know by Monday whether it would produce the documents and witness interviews his committee has been seeking Michael Platt Jr   an assistant secretary at the Commerce Department  said in a letter obtained by The Associated Press the department believes  the rush to issue a subpoena is premature   Platt said the department s staff is working at full capacity on  both its normal business and its multiple Congressional engagements  and I believe your one day response demand is inconsistent with your constitutional obligation to accommodate the department   We respectfully request adequate time to consider your letter and requests   Platt wrote Monday  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is taking his interpretation of special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation well beyond the facts He says he s been fully exonerated based on a four page summary of Mueller s nearly 400 page report and is casting himself as a victim of illegal practices by the FBI because the agency investigated him in the first place But Trump is overstating his case  The FBI has legal grounds to open a probe if investigators have information they believe could lead them to a crime  even if one is not ultimately found  And the summary released by Attorney General William Barr says Mueller did not reach a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice Nor was the Russia probe hatched by Democrats  as Trump asserts  He often cites a so called dossier funded by the Democratic Party  but the probe s origins in fact were based on other evidence Trump s claims came in a week of plentiful exaggerations and misstatements  seen most prominently in a speech to Michigan supporters in which he sought credit for all manner of things  including money to clean up the Great Lakes  The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative actually was already getting that money   Trump had proposed slashing it Meanwhile  Democratic presidential candidate Beto O Rourke misstated the length of U S  involvement in the Iraq war A look at the political rhetoric and the facts RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONTRUMP   People were hurt so badly  so badly  Their lives have been ruined and over   you know  over something that should have never taken place  an investigation that should have never happened  There was no crime  as you know  You re only allowed to do this legally if there is a crime  There was no crime     Fox News interview Wednesday THE FACTS  Trump is wrong to suggest that the FBI acted illegally by investigating him  The FBI does not need to know if  or have evidence that  a crime occurred before it begins an investigation In fact  many investigations that are properly conducted ultimately don t find evidence of any crime  The FBI is empowered to open an investigation if there s information it has received or uncovered that leads the bureau to think it might encounter a crime  Apart from that  the investigation into the Trump campaign was initially a counterintelligence investigation rather than a strictly criminal one  as agents sought to understand whether and why Russia was meddling in the 2016 election    TRUMP   The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans  Many of them  they suffered  with an elaborate hoax     rally Thursday in Grand Rapids  Michigan THE FACTS  He falsely suggests that the Russia investigation was started by Democrats after losing the 2016 election Trump typically points to a dossier of anti Trump research financed by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton s campaign  which he incorrectly claims was the basis for the Russia probe  The research that was ultimately compiled into the dossier was initially financed by anti Trump conservatives  and later by the Democrats The FBI s investigation actually began months before it received the dossier Last year  the Republican controlled House Intelligence Committee found the Russia investigation was initiated after the FBI received information related to Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos  not the dossier  Trump praised the committee s final report at the time    TRUMP   Everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the No Collusion  No Obstruction Trump Campaign began     tweet Sunday TRUMP   After three years of lies and smears and slander  the Russia hoax is finally dead  The collusion delusion is over  The special counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction     Total exoneration  complete vindication     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Mueller did not vindicate Trump in  total  in the Russia probe  explicitly declining to clear him of obstruction Mueller s exact words in the report  as quoted by Barr  say   While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  The summary of principal conclusions by Barr notes Mueller did not  draw a conclusion   one way or the other   as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction   but rather set out evidence for both sides  leaving the question unanswered of whether Trump obstructed justice  Barr wrote in the summary that ultimately he decided as attorney general that the evidence developed by Mueller was  not sufficient  to establish  for the purposes of prosecution  that Trump committed obstruction Barr s summary also notes that Mueller did not find that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 presidential election in Trump s favor  To establish a crime  Mueller must generally meet a standard of proving an offense beyond a reasonable doubt  The summary did not clear the president of improper behavior regarding Russia but did not establish that  he was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference   Mueller said in a passage from the report quoted by Barr The summary signed by Barr gave the bottom line only as he and his deputy saw it  Democrats are pushing for release of Mueller s full report  Barr is expected to release a public version of the document in the coming weeks    TRUMP  speaking about allegations in a so called dossier about contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election   It came out after the election and everybody had a big fat yawn     All of the sudden I hear   Were you involved with Russia  I say   Russia  What the hell does Russia have to do with my campaign      Michigan rally THE FACTS  Russia actually had plenty to do with Trump s campaign According to U S  intelligence agencies and lengthy indictments brought by Mueller s team  Russia orchestrated a multipart influence campaign aimed at hurting Clinton s candidacy  undermining American democracy and helping Trump get elected That effort included the hacking of the Democratic National Committee  Clinton s campaign and other Democratic groups  Russian intelligence officers then coordinated the release of stolen emails and internal documents There were also plenty of people around Trump receptive to Russia s help  though Mueller s report ultimately did not find that those contacts amounted to a criminal conspiracy  according to Barr s summary In the middle of the campaign  Donald Trump Jr  met at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer thinking he would be getting  dirt  on Clinton  Trump Jr  agreed to the meeting  which included Trump son in law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort  despite it being described to him as part of a Russian government effort to help his father    TRUMP   You look at all of the different things  Russia would ve much rather had Hillary than Donald Trump  I can tell you that right now     Fox News interview Wednesday THE FACTS  Not according to Russian President Vladimir Putin  Asked at a news conference with Trump in July whether he wanted Trump to win the 2016 election  Putin responded   Yes  I did   Putin said he favored Trump  because he talked about bringing the U S  Russia relationship back to normal     MIGRANT CHILDRENTRUMP  on the care of migrant children apprehended at the border and the Dec  8 death of Jakelin Caal Maquin  7  of Guatemala   I think that it s been very well stated that we ve done a fantastic job      The father gave the child no water for a long period of time   he actually admitted blame     to reporters Friday THE FACTS  That s a misrepresentation of the circumstances behind the girl s death as Trump seeks to steer any potential blame for it away from his administration  An autopsy report released Friday found she died of a bacterial infection just more than a day after being apprehended by the U S  Border Patrol  The El Paso County Medical Examiner s office said Jakelin experienced a  rapidly progressive infection  that led to the failure of multiple organs Neither the autopsy report  nor accounts at the time by Customs and Border Protection   spoke of dehydration  The Border Protection timeline on her case said she was checked for medical problems upon her apprehension and   The initial screening revealed no evidence of health issues   And through family lawyers  Nery Gilberto Caal Cuz said after his daughter s death that he had made sure she had food and water as they traveled through Mexico  He did not say her death was his fault    IRAQ WARO ROURKE   We will ensure that this country does not start yet another war before every peaceful  diplomatic  nonviolent alternative is explored and pursued  and those wars that we ask our fellow Americans  these service members  to fight on our behalf  17 years and counting in Afghanistan  27 years and counting in Iraq  let s bring these wars to a close     remarks Saturday in El Paso THE FACTS  The U S  has not been fighting in a military conflict in Iraq for  27 years and counting   The Iraq war started 16 years ago By O Rourke s count  U S  involvement would date back to 1992  in an apparent reference to Operation Desert Storm  which ended in February 1991  President George H W  Bush launched that operation in response to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein s invasion of Kuwait  Bush declared a ceasefire in 1991 There was no ongoing military conflict after 1991  In 2003  President George W  Bush  the elder Bush s son  authorized the invasion of Iraq by a U S  led coalition that toppled Saddam s government  Later known as the  Iraq War   that conflict was part of what the younger Bush described as a U S  war against terrorism following the Sept  11  2001  attacks    GREAT LAKESTRUMP   I support the Great Lakes  Always have  They are beautiful  They are big  very deep  record deepness  right  And I m going to get  in honor of my friends  full funding of  300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative  which you have been trying to get for over 30 years  So we will get it done     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Trump s recent budget proposal sought to cut federal financing of that program by 90 percent  His comment actually meant that his administration would   presumably   give up its efforts over the last few years to cut the program  which has been receiving about  300 million a year since 2010 His assertion that this money has eluded supporters of the lakes for three decades is wrong The program is popular with lawmakers from both parties and it was unlikely that the Trump cut would prevail Also  the Great Lakes are not the world s deepest  or even among the 20 deepest     SPECIAL OLYMPICSTRUMP   I have overridden my people  We re funding the Special Olympics     remarks to reporters Thursday THE FACTS  In this instance  unlike in the Great Lakes matter  Trump is acknowledging that it was his administration that had proposed to cut the money  though by blaming  my people  he did not take direct responsibility In any event  spending is up to Congress  not him  What he means is that the White House is dropping its budget proposal to deny federal money for the games    HEALTH CARETRUMP   We will always protect patients with pre existing conditions  always     Michigan rally THE FACTS  He s not protecting health coverage for patients with pre existing medical conditions  In fact  the Trump administration is pressing in court for full repeal of the Affordable Care Act   including provisions that protect people with pre existing conditions from health insurance discrimination Trump and other Republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve those safeguards  but the White House has provided no details  And it s a stretch to think they could get a Republicans only plan passed through Congress with the House under Democratic control President Barack Obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants  regardless of medical history  and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones  Bills supported in 2017 by Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions    TRUMP   The Republican Party will become the party of great health care      Republicans want you to have an affordable plan that s just right for you     Michigan rally TRUMP   If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out  we will have a plan that s far better than Obamacare     remarks Wednesday to reporters THE FACTS  Republicans may aspire to great health care but they don t have a comprehensive plan for it  And there s no indication that the White House  executive branch agencies like Health and Human Services  and Republicans in Congress are working on one Trump s recent budget called for repealing  Obamacare  and setting hard limits on federal spending for Medicaid  which covers low income people  Some Republicans argue that would be better  because the federal government would create a new program of health care grants to states  But when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed similar proposals a couple of years ago  it estimated such changes would result in deep coverage losses  not to mention weaker insurance protections for people with pre existing medical conditions Trump s budget also called for hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare cuts to hospitals and other service providers  a nonstarter with lawmakers in Congress worried about re election next year The Supreme Court has upheld the health care law twice in previous challenges  The five justices who first upheld it in 2012 are still on the court Congressional Republicans are generally trying to steer away from Obamacare spats  Some are trying to focus on areas where they might find common ground with Democrats and the president  such as reducing prescription drug costs    AUTOSTRUMP   We are bringing a lot of those car companies back      They are pouring back in    Michigan rally TRUMP   We re opening up car plants in Michigan again for the first time in decades  They re coming in  really pouring in      And this has been happening pretty much since I ve been president  It s really amazing what s going on     We ve brought back so much industry  so many car companies to Michigan  so we re very happy     remarks Thursday while departing for Michigan THE FACTS  There is very little truth in those remarks The only automaker announcing plans to reopen a plant in Michigan is Fiat Chrysler  which is restarting an old engine plant to build three row SUVs  It s been planning to do so since before Trump was elected  GM is even closing two Detroit area factories  one that builds cars and another that builds transmissions Automakers have made announcements about new models being built in the state  but no other factories have been reopened  Ford stopped building the Focus compact car in the Detroit suburb of Wayne last year  but it s being replaced by the manufacture of a small pickup and a new SUV  That announcement was made in December 2016  before Trump took office GM  meantime  is closing factories in Ohio and Maryland Trump can plausibly claim that his policies have encouraged some activity in the domestic auto industry  Corporate tax cuts freed more money for investment  and potential tariff increases on imported vehicles are an incentive to build in the U S But automakers have not been  pouring in  at all  as he persistently claims  and when expansion does happen  it s not all because of him Fiat Chrysler has been planning the SUVs for several years and has been looking at expansion in the Detroit area  where it has unused building space and an abundant  trainable automotive labor force Normally it takes at least three years for an automaker to plan a new vehicle  which is the case with the three row Jeep Grand Cherokee and the larger Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs that will fill the restarting Detroit area plant and an existing one  Several years ago then CEO Sergio Marchionne said the Wagoneer would be built in the Detroit area Detroit automakers usually build larger vehicles in the U S  because the profit margins are high enough to cover the higher wages paid there versus Mexico or another lower cost country    IMMIGRATIONTRUMP  on diversity visas   They are giving us their worst people     Michigan rally THE FACTS  That s false The diversity visa lottery program is run by the U S  government  not foreign governments  Other countries do not get to sort through their populations looking for bad apples to put in for export to the U S  Citizens of qualifying countries are the ones who decide to bid for visas under the program  Trump routinely blames foreign states The program requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the last five years in a selection of fields  Out of that pool of people from certain countries who meet those conditions  the State Department randomly selects a much smaller pool of winners  Not all winners will have visas ultimately approved  because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly  Those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks  like other immigrants The lottery is extended to citizens of most countries  except about 20  The primary goal is to diversify the immigrant population by creating slots for underrepresented parts of the world    JOBSTRUMP   We have created  since my election  5 5 million new jobs  Nobody would have believed that was possible     Michigan rally THE FACTS  His number is about right  but he s counting jobs created before he became president  And the progress does not defy belief  The economy created about 6 million jobs in the roughly two years before the election  then again in the roughly two years after    VETERANSTRUMP   They ve been trying to get VA Choice for over 40 years  Couldn t do it  I got it  We signed it six months ago     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Not true  He s not the first president in 40 years to get Congress to pass a private sector health program for veterans  he expanded it  Congress first approved the program in 2014 during the Obama administration  The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles  65 kilometers  to a VA facility Now  starting in June  they are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days  28 for specialty care  or their drive is only 30 minutes    TRUMP   Instead of waiting online for one day  one week  two months    now they go outside  they see a private doctor  we pay the bill  they get better quickly     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Also not right  Veterans still must wait for weeks before they can get private care outside the VA system And the expanded Choice eligibility may do little to provide immediate help  That s because veterans often must wait even longer for an appointment in the private sector  Last year  then Secretary David Shulkin said VA care is  often 40 percent better in terms of wait times  compared with the private sector  In 2018  34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians  down from 36 percent in 2017 At a hearing Tuesday  the top health official at VA  Dr  Richard Stone  described the start of the expanded Choice program to  almost be a non event   in part because wait times in the private sector are typically longer than at VA The VA also must resolve long term financing because of congressional budget caps after the White House opposed new money to pay for the program  As a result  lawmakers could be forced later this year to limit the program or slash core VA or other domestic programs    Associated Press writers Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar and Chad Day in

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on car imports from Mexico unless it does more to stop illegal migrants and drug trafficking  his latest warning to America s southern neighbor to tighten border security After backing away from a threat this week to immediately shut the border to stop a surge of migrants from Central America  Trump raised the specter of a 25 percent tariff on cars as a possible tool he could use to force Mexico to halt illegal immigration and drugs  Before we close the border we ll put the tariffs on the cars  I don t think we ll ever have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming into the United States from Mexico at 25 percent will be massive   Trump told reporters at the White House Earlier  Trump said he would give Mexico  a one year warning  to stop drug trafficking  or face tariffs  But he held out the possibility that the measure could be used sooner to address migration issues Trump made stopping illegal immigration a centerpiece of his 2016 run for the White House  pledging to build a wall on the border to stop migrants  When Congress refused to give him the money to pay for the wall  he declared a national emergency to divert funds from other projects The Democratic controlled House of Representatives will sue to block Trump from  stealing from appropriated funds   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday Trump  who plans to visit the border at Calexico  California to view a border wall project  said that media coverage this week had prompted Mexico to act to curb the flow of immigrants to the United States and take other action to ease the pressure on U S  ports of entry  A lot of good things are happening with Mexico  Mexico understands that we re going to close the border  or I m going to tariff the cars   he said TRADE DISRUPTIONSTrump prompted panic among business leaders last Friday with his border closing threat  U S  border officials have estimated that some 100 000 migrants were apprehended or encountered at the border in March  the highest level in a decade  Most are Central American families seeking asylum The Department of Homeland Security has transferred 750 border agents from commercial to immigration duties  triggering long delays for cross border trade The U S  Chamber of Commerce said it welcomed Trump s decision not to close the border  but said Congress needed to do more  Congress should also ensure Customs and Border Protection officials receive the resources they need to reduce the excessive wait times affecting legitimate trade and travel across the border   said Neil Bradley  a top official with the Chamber in a statement Mexican exporters are looking into sending their goods to the United States by air freight to avoid a five mile  8 km  long line of trucks at the border caused by the Trump administration moving federal agents away from customs checks to immigration duties Auto parts and medical equipment makers were among the Mexican companies considering the more expensive air cargo to avoid incurring penalties for late delivery to U S  clients or factory closures  Luis Aguirre  the president of Mexico s manufacturing industry chamber INDEX  said late on Wednesday    Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason  Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu  Yeganeh Torbati and David Alexander in Washington and Lewis Krauskopf in New York  Editing by Howard Goller and Alistair Bell  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump told House Republicans on Tuesday that they need to embrace health care reform and make it the first thing they vote on following the 2020 election Speaking at an annual fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump told GOP lawmakers and supporters they have the advantage on a variety of issues  but conceded that Democrats have the advantage on health care  We have to take that away from them   Trump said  Republicans should not run away from health care   he added   You can t do it  You re going to get clobbered  He told the GOP House members   You are the minority  I hate to say  That s not going to last long   Democrats hold a 235 197 majority in the House with three vacancies The Democrats found success in 2018 by attracting support from women  minorities and college educated voters  particularly in suburban districts  Many wanted a check on the president  That success filtered down to state and local races  with Democrats flipping hundreds of seats in state legislatures and picking up seven governorships To turn that momentum  Trump is focusing on the economy and casting Democrats as outside the mainstream in their support for policies such as  Medicare for all  and the  Green New Deal  to combat climate change  If they beat me with the Green New Deal  I deserve to lose   he said The buzzword for Republicans is  socialism   and Trump turned to it on several occasions Tuesday night Still  he said some of the Democrats  proposals could prove enticing to votes in the short term  He said free health care sounds very seductive  Don t underestimate the power of socialism to get a vote   Trump said  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is  fully behind  Stephen Moore  his choice to help lead the Federal Reserve  despite unflattering details that have come to light about Moore s personal life  a top White House official said Wednesday while also complaining about Washington s  toxic  environment  I spoke to the president yesterday  He completely supports Steve  I certainly do  People are being awful hard on him     This town is a toxic town in some respects   Larry Kudlow  director of the National Economic Council  told reporters   So we are fully behind him  fully behind him  Kudlow said Moore is  a smart guy  who  would be a breath of fresh air on the Fed  and so far it s all systems go  Moore is a former Trump campaign adviser who helped design massive tax cuts the president signed into law in 2017  He has been affiliated with multiple conservative groups  including as the Heritage Foundation s chief economist  leading some economists to say Moore could inject politics into an institution that strives to keep decisions about monetary policy free of political influence Moore has taken a series of controversial stances on the Fed  and has acknowledged the need to learn more about how the central bank works He also has said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell should be fired for rate hikes last year that Moore claims undermined the benefits from Trump s tax cuts  Trump has also publicly come down hard on Powell over those increases  The Fed recently announced it will not raise interest rates in 2019  a decision Powell said was not influenced by the president Trump has yet to forward Moore s nomination to serve on the Fed s Board of Governors to the Senate for confirmation  His required background check has yet to be completed According to published reports and court records  Moore had a lien of more than  75 000 filed against him in January 2018 for unpaid taxes  and has fallen behind on alimony and child support payments to his ex wife After Trump s announcement in March  Moore said his criticisms of the Fed  including his suggestion about dismissing Powell  were likely written  in a time of anger  While the Fed s recent actions have been more in line with the easy credit stance the administration is seeking  Trump has made sharp attacks on the central bank at recent meetings  according to a report Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal  The newspaper quoted an unnamed source present at one of the meetings as saying that Trump told the group that he told Powell during a recent telephone conversation   I guess I m stuck with you  Asked about that comment during his appearance at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor  Kudlow said he thought it was an  expression of love and affection  on the part of the president Under the law that governs the Federal Reserve  a president can only remove a Fed chairman for cause  Courts in cases that involved other agencies that use similar language have interpreted it to exclude policy differences On the separate issue of tariffs  Kudlow said Trump would veto legislation being considered by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley  R Iowa  that  among other things  would scale back the president s virtually unlimited power to impose tariffs on imports he declares a threat to national security  The president is not in favor of that at the moment  Not in favor of that   Kudlow said  He added that the president believes imposing tariffs  or even merely threatening to impose them  gives him the upper hand in trade talks with other countries  China most notably Trump slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports last year and believes China would not currently be negotiating a trade deal with the U S  had he not imposed the levies  Kudlow said A Chinese delegation is in Washington this week for another round of talks  following a U S  team s trip to Beijing last week for discussions    AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is maintaining support for prospective Federal Reserve nominee Stephen Moore following reports the conservative commentator has had legal problems  a White House adviser said on Tuesday  We stand behind him a hundred percent   National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters in Washington President Donald Trump said on March 22 that he would be nominating Moore for a seat on the central bank s board of governors but the president has yet to send a formal nomination to the Senate Kudlow s comments follow reports about a  75 000 federal tax lien against Moore filed in Maryland  and a contempt of court citation in Virginia for overdue spousal and child support from a 2011 divorce The overdue payments to his ex wife were resolved in 2013  according to copies of the divorce records posted online by the Guardian newspaper  which first reported on the matter  The records have been put under seal by a judge in Virginia Moore could not immediately be reached for comment  He has disputed the government s claim he owes back taxes  Moore  who helped write Trump s signature tax plan and was an adviser to his presidential campaign  is widely seen as a Trump loyalist  although he has said he would be an independent voice at the central bank He has appeared to support Trump s criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell  who has overseen four interest rate increases since taking the helm at the Fed in February 2018  Moore suggested in a radio interview last year that Trump had cause to fire Powell for  wrecking our economy  Moore said on Friday he would consider reversing the central bank s December interest rate hike but said he was not necessarily in favour of the half point rate cut recommended by Kudlow Before joining the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank  Moore had worked as an editorial page writer at the Wall Street Journal  He holds a master s degree in economics from George Mason University   Reporting by David Lawder  Additional reporting by Jason Lange and Howard Schneider  Editing by Tom Brown  

WASHINGTON   White House adviser Ivanka Trump is planning a trip to Africa to promote a global women s initiative she s leading President Donald Trump s daughter will visit Ethiopia and Ivory Coast over four days this month  The White House said Wednesday that her schedule includes a women s economic empowerment summit in Ivory Coast as well as site visits and meetings with political leaders  executives and female entrepreneurs in both countries Accompanying her will be Mark Green  administrator of the U S  Agency for International Development  On parts of the trip  they will be joined David Bohigian  acting president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  as well as Kristalina Georgieva  interim president of the World Bank Group  which is hosting the summit OPIC provides loans  loan guarantees and political risk insurance  funding projects that stretch across continents and industries It will be Ivanka Trump s first visit to Africa since the White House undertook the Women s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative in February  In a statement to The Associated Press  she said she was  excited to travel to Africa  to advance the effort Georgieva said in a statement that economic empowerment  can help unleash the enormous potential of women entrepreneurs for job creation and economic growth  especially in Africa  The initiative involves the State Department  the National Security Council and other U S  agencies  It aims to coordinate current programs and develop new ones to assist women in job training  financial support  legal or regulatory reforms and other areas Ivanka Trump says the goal is to economically empower 50 million women in developing countries by 2025 Money for the effort will come through USAID  which initially set up a  50 million fund using dollars already budgeted  The president s 2020 budget proposal requests  100 million for the initiative  which will also be supported by programs across the government as well as private investment  The White House spending plan would cut overall funding for diplomacy and development Ivanka Trump has made women s economic empowerment a centerpiece of her White House portfolio  She has made a number of international trips  with a focus on these issues  including to Japan and India  Her travel to Africa follows a five day tour that first lady Melania Trump made there last year  with a focus on child welfare Like the first lady  Ivanka Trump s efforts could be complicated by the president  who was criticized last year after his private comments about  s   hole countries  in Africa and other regions were leaked to journalists  

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Monday hosted about 300 guests  including convicted felons  at the White House for the  First Step Act Celebration   a party intended to bring attention to a rare piece of bipartisan legislation he passed last year  and which he plans to highlight on the campaign trail The East Room celebration capped a day of events dedicated to overhauling the criminal justice system  an issue that agencies across the government have been asked to elevate The labor secretary  Alexander Acosta  participated in a panel on work force development  Ben Carson  the secretary of Housing and Urban Development  led a session about prisoner re entry  Ivanka Trump  the president s daughter and senior adviser  weighed in at a session dealing with incarcerated women  Kim Kardashian  the reality TV star  was even invited to participate in the panels and the party  but could not attend Months after the legislation passed  and amid foreign policy blunders and a defeat on funding a wall along the southern border  Mr  Trump s administration is putting the issue front and center  As president  I pledged to work with both parties for the good of the whole nation   Mr  Trump said at the East Room gathering  pointing to the legislation as an example of bipartisan work that he said was  so important to me  But some activists who helped work on the legislation   which would expand job training and early release programs  and modify sentencing laws  including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders   have expressed concern that Mr  Trump is more attuned to the political opportunities the law offers him  rather than with ensuring it is enacted effectively Mr  Trump s budget  released last month  listed only  14 million to pay for the First Step Act s programs  The law passed in December specifically asked for  75 million a year for five years  beginning in 2019  The funding gap was first reported by The Marshall Project The Office of Management and Budget  however  noted that the bill passed after the budget had already been finalized and that there was always an understanding that funding for the First Step Act would be revisited  On Monday night  Mr  Trump said that  my administration intends to fully fund and implement this historic law   It was the line that many concerned advocates had been hoping to hear  The answer is a resounding yes  We re fully committed to doing that   Ja Ron Smith  a White House adviser who has worked extensively on putting the First Step Act in place  said in an interview  referring to the funding In a budget justification document  the Bureau of Prisons  which operates under the Justice Department  said that it had not concluded how much money would be required to put the First Step Act into effect  But it went on to say that fulfilling the law was a  priority  and that the Bureau of Prisons  budget for re entry activities  will be prioritized to fully fund the requirements of the act  The document also noted that the prison bureau planned to dedicate  147 million in the 2020 fiscal year to First Step Act related activities  which include the cost of expanding halfway housing  the cost to relocate people and  85 million for the Second Chance Act grant program  which aids states and nonprofits in reducing recidivism Despite the assurances from the president on down that the changes remain a budget priority  questions about funding have advocates on the issue concerned and keeping up public pressure  The First Step Act cannot fulfill its promise of turning federal prisons toward rehabilitation and preparing men and women to come home job ready if it is not fully funded   said Jessica Jackson Sloan  national director of  Cut50  a prisoner advocacy group that worked closely with the White House to get the legislation passed  Ms  Sloan said the group had been meeting with appropriators and talking to White House officials for months  to ensure that the proper funding is requested and appropriated  Others who have worked on the issue said it still remained to be seen whether the White House would push for full funding when it comes time to work out appropriations in a spending bill  and whether there would be an effort to make the Justice Department comply with it  I hope that the president s budget has been amended to specifically fund First Step  but there is so much that needs to be done after that   said Holly Harris  the executive director of Justice Action Network  which has worked with a bipartisan group on criminal justice overhaul efforts   We need the president to lean in hard on his allies in Congress  Ms  Harris noted that her group continued  to be skeptical  that officials at the Justice Department would prioritize the issue  It was not a priority for Jeff Sessions  the first attorney general in the Trump administration  who fought Jared Kushner  the president s son in law  on making it one  But his successor  William P  Barr  said in his confirmation hearing that he would fully carry out and support the law  Mr  Barr has also met with Mr  Kushner at the White House and understands that it is a priority for top officials  White House officials said Mr  Kushner helped persuade the president to get behind the prison reform measure last year  by assuring him that it had the backing of conservatives and that it was also popular with African American voters  whose support for the president was anemic in his 2016 campaign At a campaign rally in Grand Rapids  Mich   last week  Mr  Trump described the First Step Act as legislation that politicians had been trying to do  for so many years  He added a dig at his opposition   While we are pushing and pursuing all of these common sense policies to advance the common good for our citizens  Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism  resistance and revenge  The kickoff party on Monday offered Mr  Trump an opportunity for a photo op with the convicted felons  many of whom were African American  as his campaign advisers want him to expand his appeal beyond his base  Mr  Trump called many of the First Step Act beneficiaries up to the microphone to speak  where they grew emotional and thanked him for signing the legislation Many Democratic lawmakers and prison advocacy groups were happy to work with the Trump administration on the legislation  despite early skepticism about Mr  Trump s commitment to the issue  Some of them  like Representative Josh Gottheimer  Democrat of New Jersey  attended the event at the White House on Monday evening  and were even name checked by Mr  Trump  But what has to accompany that  obviously  is ensuring that the bill is implemented   Ms  Harris said  

ANNAPOLIS  Md    In a countermeasure to a proposed Trump administration rule  Maryland would become the first state to stop participating in a federal family planning program known as Title X  under a bill that received final approval Wednesday in the Maryland General Assembly The Maryland Senate voted 28 16 for the measure  sending the bill to Republican Gov  Larry Hogan  whose spokesman said the governor would review the bill before deciding whether to sign it The rule proposed by President Donald Trump would prohibit family planning clinics funded by the program from making abortion referrals  Critics denounce that as a  gag rule   The Maryland measure would prevent the state s health department from accepting Title X money if it s conditioned on excluding family planning providers and medically approved services  Maryland is very fortunate that our legislators safeguard a woman s right to access family planning services   said Karen Nelson  CEO of Planned Parenthood of Maryland   Our state has to step in far too often to fulfill the responsibility of the federal government  Sen  Bryan Simonaire  a Republican who voted against the bill  said it was bad policy  because it would prevent federal money from flowing into the state that could help faith based organizations provide health services  He described the debate over the bill as  a turf battle protecting one group against another   and expressed support for the administration s rule  It protects Title X health care providers so they are not required to choose between participating in the program and violating their own consciences by providing abortion counseling and referrals  and that s really what s at the heart of this   Simonaire said of the administration s rule change The Title X program  enacted in 1970  makes family planning services available to low income individuals for free or at low cost Sen  Ron Young  a Democrat who supported the bill  said no organizations are being shut out  because they can apply directly to the federal government for funding  It is our policy that family planning should be allowed to discuss the full range of family planning  which is what you can do at the organizations that we support through the state   Young said   If we were to accept these funds  it would be going against our state policy of full planning  The state would fund Maryland s Family Planning Program at the same level as the previous year  Maryland approved legislation in 2017 that created a state funded family planning program in the event of changes at the federal level  Hogan did not veto the bill  but it became law without his signature Maryland recently joined more than a dozen states that have filed lawsuits against the administration over the rule Religious conservatives and abortion opponents contend that Title X has been used to indirectly subsidize Planned Parenthood  the leading abortion provider in the U S Groups such as National Right to Life Committee  an organization that opposes abortion  have praised the Trump administration rule  saying it does not cut funding  but  merely ensures that health facilities receiving Title X funds do not perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning   

The House Intelligence Committee has asked one of the top contractors to President Trump s inaugural to provide it with documents about the event  a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday  opening up a new line of inquiry into the planning and financing of the ceremonies The committee asked for documents from and an interview with Stephanie Winston Wolkoff  who had been a close friend of the first lady  Melania Trump  and who had helped plan the celebrations and parties around the inaugural  the person said  The request was disclosed by a lawyer for Ms  Winston Wolkoff in a letter this week to the inaugural committee It is unclear what was requested  or why the intelligence committee is now involved  But it adds a new layer to the existing federal investigations into the inaugural committee  which was run by Thomas J  Barrack  a close friend of the president  with help from some former Trump political aides  They include Rick Gates  who previously pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  and who has been cooperating with various investigations for more than a year In February  federal prosecutors issued a subpoena to the inaugural committee demanding that it turn over documents about donors  finances and activities  The subpoena sought documents related to all of the committee s donors and guests  any benefits handed out  including tickets and photo opportunities with the president  federal disclosure filings  vendors and contracts Among other issues  federal prosecutors have been investigating whether foreigners illegally funneled donations to Mr  Trump s inaugural committee and a pro Trump super PAC in hopes of buying influence over American policy  according to people familiar with the inquiry The inquiry has been looking at whether people from Middle Eastern nations   including Qatar  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates   used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two funds  Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns  political action committees and inaugural funds A spokesman for the intelligence committee  Patrick Boland  declined to comment on the request it made for documents from Ms  Winston Wolkoff  Representative Adam Schiff  the California Democrat who is chairman of the committee  has said that the panel would investigate any  financial or other leverage  that  foreign actors  might have over Mr  Trump and his administration The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III A lawyer for Ms  Winston Wolkoff declined to comment  The Wall Street Journal reported the request from the intelligence committee on Wednesday Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have been investigating donors to and spending by the inaugural committee since last year Their investigation was prompted by a recording between Ms  Winston Wolkoff and Michael D  Cohen  the president s former personal lawyer and fixer  that the prosecutors found on Mr  Cohen s cellphone  In a separate case brought by those prosecutors  Mr  Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging hush money payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Mr  Trump Ms  Winston Wolkoff has been cooperating with that probe since last fall  earlier than inaugural officials knew  according to the letter from her lawyer A sealed court order prohibited Ms  Winston Wolkoff from disclosing the fact that she received a subpoena from the federal prosecutors in Manhattan  That order  which lasted for 180 days  recently expired  a person briefed on the letter from her lawyer said Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York  in Brooklyn  have also been looking into questions about donations to the Trump inaugural committee  They have been examining Mr  Barrack s ties to the Middle East  among other matters  according to the people briefed on the work The inaugural committee raised  107 million and spent more freely than those of previous presidents  In 72 days  it spent about  100 million  roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Presidents Barack Obama or George W  Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurations Ms  Winston Wolkoff  with a partner  set up a firm that oversaw broadcast rights for the inaugural events and worked on the documentary project featuring interviews with top inaugural committee officials

NEW YORK   News industry leaders are fighting back against the charge by President Donald Trump and his supporters that the administration s summation of special counsel Robert Mueller s report proved that journalists were  so wrong for so long  in their coverage of the Russia investigation The latest to weigh in was Steve Coll  dean of Columbia University s Graduate School of Journalism  who wrote in a New Yorker magazine essay this week that it s wrong to conclude journalism failed because Mueller did not charge Trump with conspiring with Russians to influence the 2016 election  The New York Times and The Washington Post shared a Pulitzer Prize  awarded by Columbia in 2018  for their reporting on the issue  a prize Trump says should be taken away Complicating the issue is the broad definition of the news media circa 2019  encompassing everything from painstakingly sourced investigative stories to overheated tweets to opinionated pundits  It s premature to pronounce this coverage as some kind of epic press failure   said Nancy Gibbs  former Time magazine editor and a Harvard University professor of press  politics and public policy  People angered by the press  role in investigating the president will use Mueller s findings as a lever in any way they can  she said  That doesn t mean that they re right   Gibbs said The phrase  so wrong for so long  was used by White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney during a CNN appearance on Sunday  He said  we need to figure out  what happened with reporting on the story  Sean Davis  co founder of the Federalist online magazine  said the same thing in the lead of a Wall Street Journal editorial earlier in the week that argued  America s blue chip journalists botched the entire story   The president retweeted his story  I m not sure what you re saying the media got wrong   replied CNN s Jake Tapper   The media reported the investigation was ongoing  Other than the people in the media on the left  not on this network  I don t know anybody who got anything wrong  We didn t say there was conspiracy  We said that Mueller was investigating conspiracy  Mulvaney  without offering specifics  said to Tapper that  if that s your recollection of history  that s great  Face it  the media got this wrong   he said   It s OK  people get stuff wrong all the time  Just not at this level  There were obviously disputed individual stories along the way  ABC suspended Brian Ross for a story wrongly alleging that Trump had asked former national security adviser Michael Flynn to discuss foreign policy with the Russians before he was elected  Three CNN journalists resigned over a story falsely linking a Trump aide to a Russian investment fund  The special counsel s office denied a Buzzfeed report that it had evidence Trump had directed lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress over a Moscow office project Yet much of what the public learned over the past two years on the story was the result of relentless digging by reporters In tweets over the past week  Trump repeated his contention that the mainstream media is the enemy of the people  and said the Times  and Post s Pulitzers should be stripped  The Times  in response  tweeted a picture of its Pulitzer winners and noted that every story cited in their prize winning entry has been proven correct Top editors at the Times and Post  Dean Baquet and Marty Baron  and CNN chief Jeff Zucker offered similar statements noting it was their organizations  job to show what people in power are doing  and prosecutors  responsibility to determine what is legal or illegal  A sitting president s own Justice Department investigated his campaign for collusion with a hostile nation   Zucker said   That s not enormous because the media says so  That s enormous because it s unprecedented  Not every top news executive was eager to get involved  representatives for news presidents at ABC  CBS and NBC either turned down or didn t reply to interview requests   We re going to keep doing our job   MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement  The coverage of the investigation did include embarrassments   specious chyrons  tendentious talking heads and retracted scoops  among them   Columbia s Coll wrote   Yet it does not follow that American journalism failed because the best resourced newsrooms in the nation chose to report assiduously on the Mueller investigation and its subjects  only to learn that Mueller did not prove that Trump had conspired with Russia  If there s any media soul searching to be done  it may involve cable news  In the Trump era  Fox News and MSNBC are frequently the most watched cable networks in general  both appealing to different camps Fox News Channel s Sean Hannity has been Trump s biggest advocate on cable news  making him a target for the president s opponents  Yet MSNBC s Rachel Maddow was criticized this week by Slate s Willa Paskin  who said turning on her show  was like discovering a Facebook friend is on the verge of a nervous breakdown   She said that while Maddow s audience was not as malignant as Hannity s   more than one cable news host can disservice their audience at the same time  Harvard s Gibbs recalls watching reporters and pundits sitting side by side on cable panels  with roles confused when pundits were asked what they were hearing and reporters questioned about what they thought Journalists have long believed that readers and viewers understand the difference between reporting and commentary  Coll said  It would be unrealistic to expect them to make such a distinction now   he said  

The Trump administration s decision to cut off aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras to punish their governments for failing to curb migration is a rash response to a real policy dilemma  Cutting off aid will needlessly deepen tensions between Congress and the administration  and it will exacerbate migration from the region without twisting Central American politicians  arms  But we shouldn t pretend that the aid itself was doing much good   in fact  the best move right now would be to significantly change the way aid to Central America is structured  to push those countries to alleviate the political  economic and social pressures driving people north in the first place Immigration fueled tensions between Congress and the White House are likely to reach a new high as a result of the decision to cut off aid to Central America  The president s declaration of a state of emergency to build his wall already triggered a battle over the power to legislate  that fight will now grow to include the power of the purse  The potential cost is greater than heightened acrimony  As each side will surely dig in its heels  sensible immigration and foreign policies  such as bipartisan efforts to address the rising number of asylum seekers or to prevent Guatemala from sliding into authoritarianism  will get lost in the scuffle The decision to cut off aid is bound to drive up migration numbers  American aid to Central America has a lot of problems  Its total amounts are paltry  and it is mostly distributed inefficiently in large blocks by foreign contractors  Nonetheless  that aid is about the only outside support available to Central American governments confronting relentless poverty and violence  And some of the aid does work  There is good evidence that violence prevention assistance to El Salvador has contributed to a decrease in the homicide rate  a likely factor behind the drop in migration to the United States ImagePeople waiting at the border crossing in Nuevo Laredo  Mexico  to apply for asylum sometimes stay at this overcrowded migrant shelter for weeks  even months CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesCutting off foreign assistance is unlikely to persuade Central American governments to take actions that reduce the migratory flow  The amount of aid provided pales in comparison with revenue accrued through migrant remittances  The  500 million sent to these countries in 2017 was less than 3 percent of the money received as remittance each year  And as Venezuela has shown  the United States isn t the only source of support   Mr  Trump s aid cutoff simply opens the door for China or Russia  Governments of the region  especially of Guatemala and  to a lesser degree  of Honduras  are indifferent to the plight of their poor who migrate  Especially as these governments turn increasingly authoritarian and criminal  they are more than happy to rid their countries of real and prospective opponents  For too long  Central American governments and elites have gotten away with abdicating their fiduciary  social and legal responsibilities to their citizens  They have failed to collect tax revenue and to invest in social programs and job creation that alleviate the plight of their poor  And they have aligned themselves with vast organized criminal networks  These networks  acting either independently or in alliance with increasingly sophisticated gangs  are responsible for terrorizing community members into fleeing their countries and for transforming migration into a lucrative criminal enterprise If the Trump administration is serious about forcing the hand of Central American governments  it can t just cut off aid   an alternative policy approach is urgently required  Rather than turn a blind eye to creeping authoritarianism  it should pressure governments to become more democratic and less beholden to corrupt elites and criminal networks ImageEl Salvador s president elect  Nayib Bukele  at the Heritage Foundation in Washington in March CreditEric Baradat Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThere could not be a more opportune or urgent moment to do so  particularly in El Salvador and Guatemala  Mr  Trump should reach out to the Salvadoran president elect  Nayib Bukele  and help him make good on his campaign promise to ensure transparency by establishing a commission to investigate corruption and criminality  Timing is even more critical in Guatemala  Congress has already pushed the country s government to improve accountability by revoking the visas of corrupt public officials and business people  The administration should embrace and further these efforts  especially in the run up to elections this year  in which several factions are trying to block the candidacy of Thelma Aldana  a crusading former attorney general  for president In all of these cases  American aid can be used both as a carrot to promote reform and as a support mechanism to help politicians like Ms  Aldana achieve needed reform  As sometimes happens with this administration  Mr  Trump is half right  American aid is not working  and Central American governments need to be called to account for their mismanagement  But ending that aid will just make everything worse  Instead of being a giveaway  it needs to be structured as an incentive for domestic reform  Not only will that cut down on migration  but it will help give Central Americans what they have been longing for  a safe and prosperous region where they can imagine a future for their children Read moreOpinion articles on

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Thursday he recommended former pizza chain executive and Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board Trump told reporters at the White House that Cain is going through checks  and he imagines he will be in good shape   Reporting by Jeff Mason  Writing by Doina Chiacu  Editing by Chris Reese  

WASHINGTON   After two years of playing coy  the Trump administration is reportedly finally ready to unveil its plan for Israeli Palestinian peace  The plan s details remain confidential  but if it is anything like President Trump s moves so far on the Israeli Palestinian issue  it will be bold Some of those steps have worked out far better than the president s critics anticipated  Moving the United States  embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  for example  failed to elicit the protests in the wider Arab world many predicted  even as Israelis celebrated it as correcting a historical injustice Another of the administration s bold strokes has been to all but eliminate the United States  once considerable aid to Palestinians  And while that has attracted far less attention than the embassy move  it is likely to prove more consequential for American and Israeli interests  and for the president s hoped for deal   and not for the better Until recently  Palestinians were one of the largest recipients of American aid  Then  in August  the Trump administration announced it would not make about  300 million in payments due to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency  or Unrwa  which provides schooling  housing and other services to those it designates as refugees in Gaza and elsewhere  Around the same time  the State Department also revealed that it was cutting about  230 million in other aid to the Palestinians  ending support for programs bringing together Palestinian and Israeli children and hospitals in East Jerusalem  among others This left untouched only assistance to the Palestinian security forces  long popular with both Israeli and American security officials  Yet in October  Congress adopted and Mr  Trump signed legislation that would make the Palestinian Authority  in return for accepting this and any other assistance  subject to the jurisdiction of American courts  This prompted Palestinian officials at the end of last year to reject further aid The Trump administration has good reasons to be frustrated with both the Palestinian leadership and aid organizations  Unrwa has long been accused of failing to adequately monitor its staff and the curriculum in schools that it runs for extremism  and of inflating the number of Palestinian refugees to perpetuate its mission  Mahmoud Abbas  the Palestinian Authority s president  ordered contacts with the United States frozen after the embassy move and has refused to engage with American envoys regarding the Trump administration s efforts to devise an Israeli Palestinian peace plan  The United States has made clear that the decisions on aid are meant to apply pressure on Mr  Abbas to return to the negotiating table   a goal consistent with longstanding American policy Nevertheless  the elimination of American aid to the Palestinians is unlikely to achieve that goal  In fact  in the long run  it will probably undermine both American and Israeli interests The Trump administration is right that American aid to the Palestinians provides Washington with leverage  but it is applying that leverage to the wrong end  Few observers believe that Mr  Abbas is interested in negotiating with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump  having rebuffed their less conservative predecessors or  even if negotiations resumed  that a peace deal could be reached at this time Yet aid can be leveraged to advance American aims in other ways  Past administrations have used it to strengthen the authority of Palestinian officials who favor peace and to deter the Palestinian Authority from pursuing Israel at the United Nations and in international courts  Congress has sought through the Taylor Force Act to compel the Palestinian Authority to cease the reprehensible practice of paying the families of terrorists  by reducing aid to the Palestinians by an amount equal to what the Palestinian Authority pays to families of prisoners and accused terrorists  And many supporters of Israel would have liked to see American funding for Unrwa used to compel the organization to reform  These goals have been undermined by the elimination of aid  You can t tie strings to assistance that has already been cut Aid is not just about dollars  but about engagement that confers influence  Aid programs bring American officials into contact with a wide swath of Palestinian society  which can help ensure that American influence outlasts the current leadership of the Palestinian Authority  It would be rash to assume that the vacuum left by the United States will not be filled by others  such as Russia  whose agenda in the region diverges sharply from Washington s Finally  American aid has been a stabilizing influence in both the West Bank and Gaza  Many U S A I D  programs began in the aftermath of the Second Intifada and were designed to prevent a return to such turbulence  Over the past 15 years  security assistance programs have helped build Palestinian security forces to supplant the semiofficial militias that fueled violence during the Second Intifada  These Palestinian security forces have effectively coordinated with the Israeli Army to combat terrorism in the West Bank By curtailing violence  raising standards of living and keeping children in school  American assistance has contributed to a long period of relative calm  if not peace  It is for this reason that Israeli officials have for years quietly supported its continuation Anyone who supports Israeli Palestinian peace should hope for the success of Mr  Trump s plan  But peace will ultimately require more than the agreement of leaders  It will require a Palestinian security force that can fend off those determined to use violence to derail peace efforts and a civil society that can ensure that peace is not just a top down proposition  Aid to the Palestinians   conditional and coordinated with Israel   should be a part of American policy  It could not only help President Trump s plan succeed but also ensure stability if peace efforts founder Michael Singh   MichaelSinghDC   a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the United States National

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to give Mexico a  one year warning  before closing the southern border  retreating on a threat he made last week that he would close the border in the coming days if Mexico did not halt all illegal immigration  The only thing  frankly  better and less drastic than closing the border is tariff the cars coming in  and I will do it   Mr  Trump said  speaking to reporters after a meeting with the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council   I don t play games  He added   If the drugs don t stop  or largely stop  we re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products  in particular cars   the whole ballgame is cars  And if that doesn t stop the drugs  we close the border   Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Mr  Trump cited the flow of drugs over the border as his red line  But last Friday  he announced on Twitter that  if Mexico doesn t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border  I will be CLOSING the Border  or large sections of the Border  next week  Since then  the White House has backed off that time frame for an action that would carry severe economic consequences if Mr  Trump followed through with it  Nearly  1 7 billion of goods and services flow across the United States Mexico border every day  according to the U S  Chamber of Commerce  About 500 000 legal workers  students  shoppers and tourists also cross the border daily Mr  Trump s latest reversal came after Republican lawmakers and his own economic advisers warned him of the consequences of the move  Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  said   I would hope we would not be doing that sort of thing  Furious lobbying by the president s own economic advisers and a flood of incoming data from outside groups helped to shift the president s thinking on shutting down the border  a person familiar with the situation said Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  Kevin Hassett  the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers  and their deputies communicated to the president how economically disastrous the policy would be  including the effect on daily economic growth starting within 48 hours of the closing White House officials had already been vague about the president s plans to follow through on his threat  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  told reporters this week that Mr  Trump  is not working on a specific timeline   And on Tuesday  during a meeting with Jens Stoltenberg  the NATO secretary general  the president said   I haven t made that intention known   when asked specifically about his threat to close the border this week Talking to reporters at the White House on Thursday  Mr  Trump said he was going to either close the southern border with America s third largest trading partner or  tariff the cars   He said he would  probably start off with the tariffs  But tariffs on cars coming across the southern border would largely drive up costs for American and European automakers   and their customers  Most of the cars and car parts coming from Mexico are intended for multinational automakers  including American car companies like General Motors and Ford It is also unclear the degree to which Mr  Trump could impose auto tariffs under the terms of his newly renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement  While the new deal  called the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  has yet to be ratified  it includes a provision that exempts Mexican cars from tariffs as long as they stay below a certain level of imports  Only imports above that cap  which is quite high  would be eligible for a levy  the agreement states The president is scheduled to travel to Calexico  Calif   on Friday for a photo op at a newly fortified section of the border While Mr  Trump backed off his threats to immediately close the southern border  the Department of Homeland Security has reallocated officials working at the ports of entry to handle a surge of unauthorized crossings by large groups of migrants  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said on Monday  The move has resulted in long delays and increased traffic at ports of entry Ms  Nielsen has also permitted Customs and Border Protection to reallocate as many as 2 000 officials from the ports  The move comes as more Central American families have crossed the border in recent months in search of asylum  leading to overflowing detention facilities and mass releases of migrants into cities along the border  

A coalition of states and advocacy organizations sued the Trump administration on Wednesday over its rollback of school nutritional standards championed by the former first lady Michelle Obama that required students be served healthier meals In lawsuits filed Wednesday  the groups claim that the administration illegally issued rules last year that weakened requirements that school meals contain less salt and more whole grains  The rules were part of the Healthy  Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010  a crucial part of Mrs  Obama s signature  Let s Move  campaign The suits claim the Agriculture Department violated the Administrative Procedure Act  issuing its rules with little public notice and no reasoned explanation and against overwhelming opposition from the public  The courts have already struck down a series of high profile rule changes by the administration for the same reason The coalition of states  led by New York  filed suit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York  Other states that signed on to the suit include California  Illinois  Minnesota  New Mexico  Vermont and the District of Columbia  Additionally  two advocacy organizations  Center for Science in the Public Interest and Healthy School Food Maryland  filed a similar complaint in Federal District Court in Maryland The attorney general of New York  Letitia James  announced the lawsuit outside a Brooklyn elementary school  Public School 67  which serves residents of the Ingersoll Houses  a low income apartment complex run by New York City  Ms  James said 99 percent of those students qualified for free or reduced price meals before 2017  when the city made school lunches free for all students With local officials  parents  a pediatrician and antihunger advocates at her side  Ms  James said the Trump administration  by rolling back nutritional requirements  was  attacking the health and the safety of our children   particularly the poorest  including the two million across the state who live in poverty  For many of our students  the meals they receive at school are the only hot nutritious meals they eat during the day   she said   And access to healthy and nutritious food should never be determined by your ZIP code or your socioeconomic status  Ms  James said the administration abandoned the Obama era nutritional standards without doing any scientific research beforehand  and despite the science underlying the requirements for healthier meals  which she said shows that healthier school meals can improve the overall health and school preparedness of students The advocacy organizations said the agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue s mission to  Make school meals great again  has put the health of more than 30 million students at risk  This is not just wrong  it s illegal   said Anne Harkavy  the executive director of Democracy Forward  which is representing the Center for Science in the Public Interest and Healthy School Food Maryland The Agriculture Department did not respond to a request for comment The Obama era rules  completed in 2012  kick started the administration s campaign to fight childhood obesity  starting with students  lunch trays  The rules required schools participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs to reduce the amount of sodium  serve foods rich in whole grains  increase the amount of fruits and vegetables  and limit saturated and trans fats  They also required that flavored milk be fat free In May 2017  on his first week on the job  Mr  Perdue announced he would roll back the rules  quipping   I wouldn t be as big as I am today without chocolate milk   Mr  Perdue allowed schools to request an exemption from the whole grain requirements  delay the sodium mandate and serve 1 percent flavored milk instead of nonfat In 2018  the Agriculture Department published a final rule that permanently delayed and eliminated sodium targets and cut in half the amount of whole grains that needed to be served  It also allowed schools to continue to serve low fat milk  a standard that is not challenged in the lawsuits The Agriculture Department argued that the Obama era rules were burdensome for school districts  and resulted in increased costs and decreased participation in the federal school lunch program  If kids aren t eating the food  and it s ending up in the trash  they aren t getting any nutrition   Mr  Perdue said in announcing the rollbacks He also said that he heard from students that food was less tasty  The agency wrote in an interim rule that certain states needed the flexibility to  plan and serve meals that are economically feasible and acceptable to their students and communities   and  culturally appropriate   Agriculture Department officials cited requests from states for exemptions to serve tortillas  grits and breakfast biscuits The department maintained that continually granting exemptions was unsustainable  Among those that supported the Trump administration was the School Nutrition Association  which represents school food professionals  saying that the rules were too stringent But the advocacy organizations pointed out that the overwhelming majority of public comments submitted for the 2017 rule supported keeping the original 2012 standards for sodium and whole grains  and that the Agriculture Department s own data acknowledged that nearly all schools participating in the National School Lunch Program were making progress toward meeting the requirements The lawsuits also argue that Congress mandated that science  not taste  guide federal law  For decades  Congress has required that federal nutrition standards align with government issued dietary guidelines and be rooted in other nutritional research  The suits said the department has ignored that requirement Laura MacCleery  the policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest  a food and health watchdog  said the Trump administration s effort sought to  torpedo an enormous success story that was really evolving to achieve a significant improvement in school food  A food policy adviser for New York City  Anna Bessendorf  said on Wednesday that city school meals already met or exceeded the Obama administration s 2012 standards and would continue to do so despite the Trump administration s reversals Parents at Wednesday s announcement who applauded the lawsuit said the daily reality of what the public school cafeterias served to their children was more complicated  Most of the time they hit the nail on the head   said Ayanna Behin  a community education council leader in Brooklyn whose two children  13 and 10  are in public school Nobody on hand said they had seen or heard of evidence of school lunches becoming less healthy since the Trump administration changed course Cartons of sweetened milk are still on lunch trays in New York  and Ms  James and Democracy Forward said they might challenge the milk standard in the future  The question is  will this give permission to school districts that want to backslide   said Liz Accles  the executive director of Community Food Advocates  which worked with Ms  James when she served as the city s public advocate  to push for free lunches citywide

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised NATO countries for increasing their financial contributions to the Western alliance  but he hounded them to pay even more  saying America still shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of protecting Europe The president met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg  who was in Washington to mark the 70th anniversary of the organization formed to counter Russian aggression The two leaders had kind words for one another  But in the past  Trump has called NATO  obsolete  and suggested he might pull the U S  out of the alliance if member nations didn t significantly boost their defense spending  We ve worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair share   Trump told reporters   At some point  it s going to have to go higher  Trump took credit for the increased spending  However  spending by the 29 NATO countries  which dropped after the end of the Cold War  has actually been rising since 2014   before Trump took office  Prior to our getting here  NATO s spending was going way  way down   he said   It was just a one way road down  And since I became president     it s been a rocket ship up  and we have to keep it that way  After Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimean Peninsula  member countries agreed to boost defense budgets and  move toward  spending 2  of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024  The U S  spends about 3 4  of its GDP on defense Since Trump took office  European allies and Canada have added  41 billion to their defense budgets  By the end of next year  this will rise to  100 billion  Stoltenberg said  Germany  however  remains the main target of Trump s ire because it now plans to spend 1 5  by 2024  which is lower than the 2  guideline  Germany is not paying their fair share   Trump said   I have a great feeling for Germany  but they re not paying what they should be paying  We re paying for a big proportion of NATO  which is basically protecting Europe  Stoltenberg has said that the 2  guideline was not invented by the United States and was a target the 29 allies set in 2014 before Trump took office  But he thanked Trump for his  strong commitment to NATO  and for his leadership in getting member nations to increase their commitments  The allies are really stepping up   Stoltenberg said in an interview later with The Associated Press  The clear message from President Trump has helped   is having a real impact  And this is about doing what NATO allies have pledged to do  We still have a long way to go   much to do   but we have really seen very strong progress in defense spending from NATO allies  At times  Stoltenberg has served as a buffer between Trump and some European allies that he has angered Trump  who ran on an  America First  platform  slapped tariffs on the European Union  and pulled the U S  out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal  Trump s eagerness to get along with Russian leader Vladimir Putin   in spite of Russia s meddling in the 2016 U S  presidential election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years  has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat  NATO s single greatest challenge is the absence of strong  principled American presidential leadership for the first time in its history   two former U S  envoys to NATO  Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute  wrote in a report on the 70th birthday for the Harvard Kennedy School s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs Lute and Burns said NATO leaders considered not holding a 2019 summit to mark the 70th anniversary at all because they feared Trump would  blow up a meeting in controversy as he has done each time he has met with NATO leaders during the past two years   The alliance plans a scaled down summit of leaders in December that Trump is expected to attend Allies see Trump as NATO s  most urgent  and often most difficult  problem   they wrote in their report  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump  saying their conclusion was  just simply wrong  and adding that the administration has worked hard to make NATO stronger Stoltenberg is slated to address Congress on Wednesday   a first for a NATO secretary general The NATO foreign ministers  first session Thursday will focus on Russia  The ministers are expected to endorse a package of measures to improve NATO s defenses in the Black Sea Other topics will be NATO s mission in Afghanistan and Turkey s announced decision to buy a Russian surface to air missile system  Turkey is a NATO ally  but the Russian system is not compatible with NATO systems and is considered a threat to U S  F 35 aircraft They also will talk about U S  and Russian plans to withdraw this summer from a 1987 landmark arms control treaty  The U S  accuses Russia of violating the treaty  Moscow says the U S  is not in compliance If the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty is scrapped  neither Washington nor Moscow would face legal constraints on deploying land based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between 500 and 5 500 kilometers  310 to 3 410 miles   Defense officials say the Pentagon plans to begin flight tests later this year of two types of missiles that have been banned by the treaty for more than 30 years  Russia is deploying more and more of these weapons and therefore we call on Russia to come back into compliance with this treaty   Stoltenberg said    Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is suggesting he will defer until after 2020 his push for a Republican health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act Trump tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections   when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House  Republicans were cool after Trump surprised them last week with an unexpected pivot to the issue and his claims the GOP will be the party of health care  They don t yet have a comprehensive plan to replace the law  known as  Obamacare  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017  And while Republicans gained Senate seats last fall  there s no indication that GOP senators want another fight over repealing  Obamacare   particularly not those up for re election next year Health care  especially protections for people with pre existing conditions  resonates with voters and helped Democrats in the November elections According to AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide  nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care as the most important among a list of key issues  A Quinnipiac University poll last week found 55  of Americans supporting the improvement and not the replacement of the nation s health care system With Democrats controlling the House  any attempt to dismantle the law could not pass Congress Still  Trump last week appeared to commit his party to a new push for a plan to replace the health law  We are working very hard on that   Trump said as he was heading out to a Michigan rally He said Republicans  are going to work together to come up with something that s really spectacular  In his late Monday tweets  Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that  will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America  Challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts Last week  the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down  an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured and reignite a winning political issue for Democrats  

WASHINGTON   The Democratic head of a powerful U S  House committee asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of President Donald Trump s personal and business tax returns on Wednesday  in a long awaited move widely expected to lead to a long court battle with the White House The request  in a letter from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig  is viewed by Democrats in the House of Representatives as a vital first step toward oversight of Trump s income taxes and business network  which some lawmakers believe could be rife with conflicts of interest and potential tax law violations  It is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials  To maintain trust in our democracy  the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly  as laws intend   Neal said in a statement IRS and U S  Treasury officials were not immediately available for comment Trump defied decades of precedent as a presidential candidate by refusing to release the tax documents and has continued to keep them under wraps as president  saying his returns were  under audit  by the IRS  Trump s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recently testified in Congress that he did not believe the president was being audited but may have used the audit claim to avoid scrutiny that could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties  Trump was dismissive of the request but continued to make the audit argument in comments to reporters during a meeting with U S  military leaders on Wednesday   Is that all   the president asked when told Democrats wanted to see six years of his returns   Usually it s 10  so I guess they re giving up   he said   I ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name  you re audited  But until such time as I m not under audit  I would not be inclined to do that   Neal based his request on his committee s oversight jurisdiction of the IRS  specifically its alleged audits of Trump and the extent to which the agency has enforced the tax laws against the president  OVERSIGHT PRESSURECongressional Republicans oppose Neal s effort  saying such a move sets a dangerous precedent by turning the confidential tax documents of a U S  citizen into a political weapon  This particular request is an abuse of the tax writing committees  statutory authority and violates the intent and safeguards of     the Internal Revenue Code   Representative Kevin Brady  the committee s top Republican  said in a statement Independent analysts welcomed the move   The Ways and Means Committee s strongest oversight ability is making sure the IRS is operating properly   said Steve Rosenthal  a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank in Washington  It was the third time this week a Democratic led House committee exerted oversight pressure on Trump  Earlier on Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee authorized its chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full investigation report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed a former White House security chief on Tuesday Neal s committee initially planned to request only Trump s personal tax returns  But some Democrats and independent analysts pressed for them to include business returns to better gauge the president s activity in the private sector  The request includes returns for eight entities  Donald J Trump Revocable Trust  DJT Holdings LLC  DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC  DTTM Operations LLC  DTTM Operations Managing Member Corp  LFB Acquisition Member Corp  LFB Acquisition LLC and Trump National Golf Club A Democratic aide said the committee selected a manageable number of business entities that provide a vital window on Trump s business activity  Although Trump has never released his returns  the New York Times last year cited a  vast trove  of returns and financial records saying it showed he engaged in tax schemes including cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions of dollars in taxes  The White House called the report misleading    Reporting by David Morgan  Doina Chiacu and Alexandra Alper  Editing by Peter Cooney and G Crosse  

WASHINGTON   U S  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he told President Donald Trump the Senate would not be doing a comprehensive healthcare bill  even as Trump has sought to revive healthcare as an issue for the 2020 campaign  I made it clear to him  Trump  we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters  McConnell said he spoke to Trump on Monday and pointed out that with the House of Representatives in Democratic hands  it was better for the Republican run Senate to focus on matters like prescription drug pricing that were not a comprehensive effort to revisit healthcare   Reporting by Susan Cornwell  Editing by James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON NEW YORK   U S  President Donald Trump on Monday injected himself into one of the most consequential cases of the current Supreme Court term  saying the nation s 2020 census would be  meaningless  without adding a citizenship question to the questionnaire The comment on Twitter came ahead of an expected Supreme Court ruling by the end of June on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  decision to add the citizenship question violated federal law  Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question   Trump tweeted   Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together  Trump s critics have accused the White House of encouraging an undercount by dissuading Hispanics and other immigrants from participating in the census  disproportionately affecting Democratic leaning states and municipalities Many states  cities and civil rights groups have gone to court over the citizenship question  which is among a series of White House policies signaling tighter control over immigration These include Trump s declaration in February of a national emergency to obtain funds for a wall on the U S  Mexico border  and his threat to close the border as soon as this week  disrupting legal crossings as well as trade The U S  Constitution requires a census counting the number of residents every 10 years Results are used to draw political boundaries  allocate seats in Congress and at the state and local level  and distribute roughly  800 billion of federal funds  The census is the administration s new front on its war on immigration and  sadly  the president s tweet today bears out that concern   said Terri Ann Lowenthal  a former staff director on the House census oversight committee who now advises groups seeking an accurate 2020 count  VERITABLE SMORGASBORD When Ross announced the addition of a citizenship question in March 2018  he said it was in response to a Department of Justice request for data to help enforce the Voting Rights Act  which protects eligible voters from discrimination Only U S  citizens can vote in federal elections  Non citizens comprise about 7 percent of the 328 7 million people living in the United States  Census questionnaires have not included a citizenship question since 1950 The Supreme Court is reviewing a Jan  15 ruling by U S  District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan that Ross broke a  veritable smorgasbord  of federal rules by adding the question  a decision he called  arbitrary and capricious  Furman also said the Voting Rights Act was as a  pretextual  rationale for adding the question  a decision that Ross had  already made for other reasons  The judge said the change would cause many states to lose federal funding  while Arizona  California  Florida  Illinois  New York and Texas would lose congressional seats Furman  an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama  stopped short of a finding that Ross intended to discriminate against immigrants Oral arguments at the Supreme Court are scheduled for April 23 Steven Dillingham  who became director of the U S  Census Bureau in January  declined to discuss Trump s tweet but said the bureau was focused on obtaining a full  complete count He spoke to reporters at a press briefing on Monday  one year before National Census Day marking the 2020 count  LONG PEDIGREE Furman s decision came in a lawsuit brought by 18 U S  states  15 cities and a variety of civil rights groups In urging the Supreme Court to overturn Furman s ruling  Solicitor General Noel Francisco  representing the Justice Department  said Ross had discretion to add the citizenship question  and that there was a  long pedigree  in the census for asking about citizenship or country of birth He also said other democracies including Australia  Canada  France  Germany  Indonesia  Ireland  Mexico  Spain and the United Kingdom ask about citizenship on their censuses Another federal judge  Richard Seeborg in San Francisco  on March 6 also declared the citizenship question illegal Following that ruling  the Supreme Court said it will also decide whether Ross  actions violated the Constitution s Enumeration Clause  which sets out terms for counting people Adding the citizenship question could lead to an undercount of 4 2 million Hispanics alone  the Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media  Politics and Public Policy estimated last month   Reporting by Susan Heavey and Lauren Tara LaCapra in Washington  and Nick Brown and Jonathan Stempel in New York  Editing by Susan Thomas and Bill Trott

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Tuesday his pressure on NATO nations to pay more for their defence is leading to tens of billions of dollars more in contributions  but the allies may need to boost their budgets even more Trump used a well worn script about burden sharing with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in talks at the White House  The meeting came a day before NATO foreign ministers sit down in Washington for what is expected to be a session dominated by concerns about Russia Trump  who has ruffled feathers among European allies by repeatedly saying that NATO nations needed to pay more and ease the burden on the United States  said his tactics have paid off  Since I came to office it s a rocket ship up  We ve picked up over  140 billion   107 billion  in additional money  and we look like we re going to have at least another  100 billion in spending by the nations   by 2020   he said The U S  president said he would like to see NATO members pay more than 2 percent of their gross domestic product for defence  Trump told NATO leaders last year to increase defence spending to 4 percent of GDP  He said the United States pays 4 3 percent of its GDP to NATO Trump singled out Germany for not doing enough  while praising German Chancellor Angela Merkel  Germany honestly is not paying their fair share   he said   They re not paying what they should be paying  They re paying close to 1 percent  The White House  in a statement  said that Trump met with Stoltenberg to mark NATO s 70th anniversary and reaffirm U S  support for the alliance  The White House said the two leaders  reviewed NATO s unprecedented progress to increase burden sharing  and also discussed  ongoing efforts to fight terrorism  and  check Russian aggression   WE LL GET ALONG WITH RUSSIA Trump said a stronger NATO provides a bulwark against Russia  but that he believed relations with Moscow will be fine  As has been his norm  Trump was reluctant to criticise Russia  I hope we have a good relationship with Russia   he said   But I think we ll get along with Russia  Stoltenberg  who is to address a joint meeting of the U S  Congress on Wednesday  singled out Russia for  violating the INF treaty   the Cold War era Intermediate range Nuclear Forces treaty Trump in February announced plans to withdraw the United States from the INF treaty this summer  saying Russia was in violation of it Russia is sowing discord in the alliance by selling to NATO member Turkey the S 400 air defence system  The United States has halted delivery of equipment related to its F 35 fighter jets to Turkey over its S 400 plans  We have very serious concerns about its stated plans to proceed with the acquisition of the S 400 missile defence system and there will be potential consequences  within sanctions law and the F 35 programme if they continue   said a senior State Department official who briefed reporters The United States says that Turkey s purchase of the Russian air defence system would compromise the security of F 35 aircraft  which is built by Lockheed Martin Corp The official  speaking on condition of anonymity to preview the meeting of NATO foreign ministers  said the gathering would discuss all elements of the military threat posed by Russia  including in the Black Sea  as well as the Afghan peace process and members  budget contributions to the alliance The official said the NATO allies would seek to agree on a package of measures to bolster NATO s military presence in the Black Sea  which has become a flashpoint with Moscow over its seizure of Ukrainian ships last year  The focus is on the defence and deterrence posture of the alliance in the Black Sea region   said the official  adding that a plenary session on Thursday would focus on Russia  including what Washington sees as Moscow s breach of the INF treaty   Reporting by Steve Holland and Lesley Wroughton  editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Leslie Adler  

EL PASO  Texas   President Donald Trump s threat to shut down the southern border raised fears Monday of dire economic consequences in the U S  and an upheaval of daily life in a stretch of the country that relies on the international flow of not just goods and services but also students  families and workers Politicians  business leaders and economists warned that such a move would block incoming shipments of fruits and vegetables  TVs  medical devices and other products and cut off people who commute to their jobs or school or come across to go shopping  Let s hope the threat is nothing but a bad April Fools  joke   said economist Dan Griswold at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia  He said Trump s threat would be the  height of folly   noting that an average of 15 000 trucks and  1 6 billion in goods cross the border every day  If trade were interrupted  U S  producers would suffer crippling disruptions of their supply chains  American families would see prices spike for food and cars  and U S  exporters would be cut off from their third largest market   he said Trump brought up the possibility of closing ports of entry along the southern border Friday and revisited it in tweets over the weekend because of a surge of Central Americans migrants who are seeking asylum  Trump administration officials have said the influx is straining the immigration system to the breaking point Elected leaders from border communities stretching from San Diego to cities across Texas warned that havoc would ensue on both sides of the international boundary if the ports were closed  They were joined by the U S  Chamber of Commerce  which said such a step would inflict  severe economic harm  In California s Imperial Valley  across from Mexicali  Mexico  farmers rely on workers who come across every day from Mexico to harvest fields of lettuce  carrots  onions and other winter vegetables  Shopping mall parking lots in the region are filled with cars with Mexican plates More than 60 percent of all Mexican winter produce consumed in the U S  crosses into the country at Nogales  Arizona  The winter produce season is especially heavy right now  with the import of Mexican grown watermelons  grapes and squash  said Lance Jungmeyer  president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas He said 11 000 to 12 000 commercial trucks cross the border at Nogales daily  laden with about 50 million pounds of produce such as eggplants  tomatoes  bell peppers  lettuce  cucumbers and berries He said a closing of the border would lead to immediate layoffs and result in shortages and price increases at grocery stores and restaurants  If this happens   and I certainly hope it doesn t   I d hate to go into a grocery store four or five days later and see what it looks like   Jungmeyer said Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz  chairman of the Texas Border Coalition  said a closure would be catastrophic  Closing the border would cause an immediate depression in border state communities and  depending on the duration  a recession in the rest of the country   he said  Our business would end   said Marta Salas  an employee at an El Paso shop near the border that sells plastic flowers that are used on the Mexican side by families holding quinceaeras  the traditional coming of age celebrations Salas said her whole family  including relatives who attend the University of Texas at El Paso  would be affected if the border were closed  There are Americans who live there  I have nephews who come to UTEP  to grade school  to high school every day   Salas said Meanwhile  the Trump administration said Monday as many as 2 000 U S  inspectors who screen cargo and vehicles at ports of entry along the Mexican border may be reassigned to help handle the surge of migrants  Currently  about 750 inspectors are being reassigned That  too  could slow the movement of trucks and people across the border The effects were evident Monday  Sergio Amaya  a 24 year old American citizen who lives in Juarez  Mexico  and attends UTEP  said it normally takes him two minutes to cross the bridge  It took an hour this time  The Border Patrol agent said it s going to get worse   Amaya said Instead of ensuring the flow of goods across the border  the inspectors are being put to work processing migrants  taking their applications for asylum and transporting them to holding centers Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the reassignments are necessary to help manage the huge influx that is overloading the system  The crisis at our border is worsening  and DHS will do everything in its power to end it   Nielsen said In addition to reassigning inspectors  Nielsen has asked for volunteers from non immigration agencies within her department and sent a letter to Congress requesting resources and broader authority to deport families faster  The administration is also ramping up efforts to return asylum seekers to Mexico Apprehensions all along the southern border have soared in recent months  with border agents on track to make 100 000 arrests and denials of entry there in March  more than half of them families with children    Associated Press writers Colleen Long in Washington  Elliot Spagat in San Diego  Nomaan Merchant in Houston and Anita Snow in Phoenix contributed to this story  

WASHINGTON   The U S  House of Representatives will sue to block President Donald Trump s transfer of money to pay for a border wall along the border with Mexico  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday The Republican president in February declared a national emergency at the border to secure the money that Congress refused to give him for the wall  The President s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds  an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority   Pelosi  the top Democrat in Congress  said in a statement She said a congressional legal advisory group voted to authorize the lawsuit  In a stinging rebuke  the Democratic controlled House passed legislation to terminate the emergency Trump declared at the U S  Mexico border but Trump issued the first veto of his presidency in March to block that measure  The House will once again defend our Democracy and our Constitution  this time in the courts   Pelosi said in a statement   No one is above the law or the Constitution  not even the President  U S  Attorney General William Barr said the president s emergency declaration was legal   Reporting by Doina Chiacu  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   The Republican led U S  Senate on Wednesday changed its procedures to speed up the confirmation of President Donald Trump s nominees for some lower court judgeships and sub Cabinet level positions The move to shorten debate on such nominees from 30 hours to two hours was resisted by Democrats but they could not block it because Republicans hold 53 seats in the 100 seat chamber Senator Mitch McConnell used his powers as majority leader to make the change  which will set a precedent that will apply to district court judges  the lowest rung of the judiciary  but not vacancies in the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts  The Senate has historically provided greater protection for whichever party is in the minority than the 435 seat House of Representatives by allowing longer debating time before votes and requiring 60 yes votes for most approvals  Those conventions have been whittled away by both Democrats and Republicans in recent years as the mood in Washington has become more and more polarized  however  with each party accusing the other of misusing the rules Reducing the time for debate will  begin to unwind this partisan paralysis  for the good of the Senate   McConnell said on Wednesday  Democrats slammed the procedural change  At a time when leader McConnell brags about confirming more judges than anyone has done in a very long time  he feels the need to invoke the terribly destructive and disproportionate procedure   Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Fifty three district court nominees have been confirmed during Trump s first two years in office against 44 confirmed at the same point in the presidency of Democratic President Barack Obama During Obama s presidency  Senate Democrats took steps to more easily win approval of his nominations by requiring only a simple majority vote for administration posts and judges other than Supreme Court nominees  They also limited debate to two hours  but that move expired at the end of that Congress after Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 elections  In 2017  McConnell expanded the simple majority procedure to include Supreme Court confirmations in order to overcome Democratic opposition to Trump s first nominee  Neil Gorsuch The fight over the confirmation of federal judges has been raging for years  as divisive issues before the courts include hot button issues like abortion  the death penalty and money in politics  Republicans are hoping that they can confirm as many of Trump s conservative picks as possible while they control the Senate and White House Democrats were enraged in 2016 when McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland  Obama s pick to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court At the time  McConnell said that choice should be made by whoever won the November 2016 presidential election Since he became president in January 2017  Trump has won confirmation of 37 appeals court judges  compared to 55 appeals court judge confirmations during Obama s entire eight years  Such confirmation votes would not be subject to Wednesday s procedural change  Click here to see a graphic showing Trump s appeals court appointments  https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL    Reporting By Amanda Becker and Richard Cowan  additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Lawrence Hurley  Editing by Sonya Hepinstall

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration on Wednesday will resume negotiations with China toward ending a trade war that has deepened uncertainty for businesses and investors and dimmed the outlook for the global economy The two sides are to meet for the ninth time  with analysts expressing optimism that the world s two biggest economies might be near some kind of agreement  Negotiators met in Beijing last week in talks that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as  constructive   Now  Vice Premier Liu He  a close confidante of President Xi Jinping  is leading a Chinese team to Washington  We have been encouraged by the tone of the negotiations   Myron Brilliant  head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  told reporters Tuesday Brilliant estimated that the two sides are 90  of the way to an agreement but cautioned that  the last 10  is the hardest part  the trickiest part  At the heart of the dispute are the Trump administration s allegations that China steals technology and coerces U S  companies to hand over trade secrets   all part of Beijing s zeal to overtake U S  technological dominance  To pressure China  the United States has imposed tariffs on  250 billion in Chinese goods  The Chinese have counterpunched by taxing  110 billion in U S  imports Forecasters at the World Bank and International Monetary  among others  have downgraded their outlook for the global economy  partly because the U S  China rift is damaging trade and causing businesses to slow their investment until they know how the dispute will end Tensions have eased somewhat since President Donald Trump met Xi in Buenos Aires late last year and the administration ended up suspending its plans to raise tariffs on  200 billion of the Chinese imports to buy time for negotiations We re making headway   Larry Kudlow  Trump s top economic adviser  said Tuesday  describing the talks as  a larger  grander discussion than anything we ve ever had in U S  China relations  Analysts say two major sticking points  in particular  stand in the way of any agreement First  Trump wants to preserve at least the 25  tariffs he has imposed on  50 billion in Chinese imports as a way to maintain leverage over Beijing  China wants those sanctions lifted Second  the two sides must develop a mechanism to ensure that China honors any commitments it makes in an agreement  The administration complains that China has repeatedly failed to keep promises it made in previous trade talks The Chinese are widely expected to agree to buy substantially more American products   likely including soybeans and natural gas   to help narrow the United States  trade deficit in goods and services with China  which hit a record  379 billion last year  America s trade deficit with China has been a chronic complaint of Trump  although many economists say a bilateral trade gap is relatively insignificant Congressional Democrats and others have warned Trump against reaching any agreement that settles for more U S  exports to China without also requiring Beijing to adopt serious economic reforms  Stand firm  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y   said Tuesday   Skip the political photo op and make good on your promise to stand up for American businesses and workers when China takes advantage  Christopher Adams  a former China specialist at the Treasury Department and the Office of the U S  Trade Representative who is a senior adviser at the Covington   Burling law firm  added   There has to be something substantive on the structural issues  Otherwise  the criticism will be severe  Whatever negotiators agree to  analysts say  they are unlikely to end the long standing tensions between America s mostly open  capitalist economy and a Chinese economy in which the Communist Party and the central government command the dominant role Even with a deal  Adams said   a lot of the underlying issues will still be with us unresolved because they re rooted in fundamental differences between the US and Chinese systems

WASHINGTON   A career official in the White House security office says dozens of people in President Donald Trump s administration were granted security clearances despite  disqualifying issues  in their backgrounds  including concerns about foreign influence  drug use and criminal conduct Tricia Newbold  an 18 year government employee who oversaw the issuance of clearances for some senior White House aides  says she compiled a list of at least 25 officials who were initially denied security clearances last year but then had those denials overruled by senior administration officials The allegations were detailed in a letter and memo released Monday by Rep  Elijah Cummings of Maryland  chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee  The documents  which are based on Newbold s March 23 private committee interview  don t identify the officials on the list but say they include  two current senior White House officials  as well as contractors and individuals  in different parts of the Executive Office of the President  According to Ms  Newbold  these individuals had a wide range of serious disqualifying issues involving foreign influence  conflicts of interest  concerning personal conduct  financial problems  drug use and criminal conduct   the memo says The release of the documents sets the stage for another fight between the White House and the Democratic controlled House  and immediately drew criticism from House Republicans who called the allegations overblown and  cherry picked  Cummings  panel has been investigating security clearances issued to senior officials including Trump son in law Jared Kushner  former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former White House aide Rob Porter  That probe has picked up steam after The New York Times reported that Trump ordered officials to grant Kushner a clearance over the objections of national security officials  and after Newbold spoke out to NBC News and other news outlets about her concerns On Monday  Cummings said he will move this week to authorize his first subpoena in the probe  The subpoena will be for the deposition of Carl Kline  who served as the White House personnel security director and supervised Newbold  He has since left the White House for the Defense Department The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday Rep  Jim Jordan  the committee s ranking Republican  said in a statement that Cummings  probe is a  partisan attack  and an  excuse to go fishing  through personnel files  He also said that one person on Newbold s list is a GSA custodian Also  in a response memo circulated to Republican members  Jordan s staff cast Newbold as a disgruntled employee who had only limited knowledge of the reasons security clearances were granted  The Republican document also suggests Newbold s concerns were  overblown   saying that four or five of the clearance denials for  very serious reasons  were a small fraction of about 5 000 employees who work in the Executive Office of the President According to Democrat Cummings  memo  though  Newbold considered the decisions to be part of a  systematic  problem within her office where the decisions of security clearance reviewers were  continuously  overridden Newbold said she raised her concerns up the chain of command in the White House to no avail  Instead  she said  the White House retaliated  suspending her in January for 14 days without pay for not following a new policy requiring that documents be scanned as separate PDF files rather than one single PDF file Newbold said that when she returned to work in February  she was cut out of the security clearance process  The office also announced a plan to  restructure  that would remove her from a supervisory role  she said In response to Newbold s interview  Cummings is asking the White House to turn over the list she created as well as documents related to the handling of security clearances for several senior officials including Flynn  Kushner and Porter Flynn maintained his clearance even after the White House learned that he lied to the FBI about his conversations with Russia s ambassador and that he was under investigation by the Justice Department for his previous foreign work Kushner failed to initially disclose numerous foreign meetings on security clearance forms  and  according to the Times  career officials recommended against granting him a clearance before Trump personally overruled them Porter had high level access with an interim security clearance even though the FBI repeatedly told the White House of past allegations of domestic violence lodged against him by two ex wives Porter resigned after the allegations becoming public    Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report    Read the documents  http   apne ws NuF4iSJ

President Trump than he indicated  according to government officials and others familiar with the matter The investigators had already written multiple summaries of the nearly 400 page report  and

Republicans cut the time between ending debate and a final confirmation vote on executive branch nominees and district court judges from 30 hours to two The change was a provocative step that reignited a bitter partisan fight over presidential nominations that has raged for a decade and spanned presidencies from both parties  Democrats dwelled at length over the blockade that stopped Judge Merrick B  Garland from ascending to the Supreme Court in the final year of Barack Obama s presidency to angrily question how Republicans could complain about the handling of Mr  Trump s nominees  There s no other word but  hypocrisy    said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader The majority leader  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  justified his actions on the Garland nomination  saying Democrats would have done the same thing to a Republican Supreme Court nominee  And he said Democrats started the process in 2003  when they began routinely filibustering a Republican president s nominees Mr  McConnell s move on Wednesday was intended to break the Democratic blockade over dozens of judicial and sub cabinet nominations sent to the Senate by the Trump administration and to appease Mr  Trump  who has been badgering him to take such a step for months  We had hoped the Democrats would negotiate  but their base will roast them alive if they supported  a compromise deal unblocking Trump nominees  said Senator John Cornyn  Republican of Texas  who is a close ally of Mr  McConnell But the one party rule change   which followed maneuvers by Democrats in 2013 to end the 60 vote threshold for most judges and executive branch nominees  and by Republicans in 2017 to end the 60 vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees   knocked down another pillar of Senate custom that separated it from the majority rule House  And it took the chamber one step closer to ending the defining procedural bulwark of the Senate  the 60 vote requirement for moving ahead with most legislation  The Senate has changed so dramatically under McConnell s influence   said Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the second ranking Democrat in the upper chamber   He is corrupting the Senate into an institution that is more like the House of Lords than what the framers intended  We have walked away from amending  debating and legislating  Mr  Schumer declared it  a very sad day for the Senate  Mr  McConnell answered   This is not a sad day  this is a glad day   We know you don t like Donald Trump  but he won an election and he is entitled  to  set up  his government  he continued Under the new rules  the Senate approved the nomination of Jeffrey Kessler to be assistant secretary of commerce  It was then to approve Roy Kalman Altman to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Wednesday s rule change was not as sweeping as the 2013 move  made when Democrats controlled the chamber  to abolish the 60 vote threshold on most nominees  Nor was it as provocative as 2017  when the Republican majority extended that 51 vote confirmation threshold to the Supreme Court after Mr  McConnell spent most of 2016 blocking Judge Garland s nomination But Wednesday s precedent opens the way for Mr  McConnell to speed up the nominating process for sub cabinet level posts and Federal District Court judges  appointments that represent as many as 80 percent of administration nominees  Democrats say that by limiting the time between cutting off debate on a nominee and voting on final confirmation  the Senate loses time needed to vet nominees Senate Democrats   who have been marginalized by Mr  McConnell s hardball style of leadership   said Wednesday s move represented an attack on institutional norms put in place to ensure full debate For Mr  Trump  the change is long overdue  For more than a year the White House  spurred on by Mr  Trump and officials in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs  has prodded Mr  McConnell to invoke what has been referred to on Capitol Hill as a  mini  nuclear option But Mr  McConnell resisted  in part because of the opposition of two moderate Republicans  Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee Their opposition ebbed in recent weeks after sporadic talks overseen by Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer to unfreeze some of the nominations fell apart  Mr  Trump expressed his frustration over the logjam during his hourlong appearance at the Republicans  weekly lunch in the Capitol last week  This is crazy   he said  according to two people in the room   We have all these people  ambassadors  who have put their whole lives on hold  waiting to be confirmed A day later  Mr  McConnell  speaking at a second strategy lunch with his conference  blasted Mr  Schumer and claimed he was avoiding a compromise out of fear that he would be publicly attacked by liberals in his party He singled out Mr  Schumer s own former spokesman  Brian Fallon  who now leads a progressive coalition that lobbies against the appointment of conservative judges  Chuck won t make a deal because he s afraid of Brian Fallon   Mr  McConnell said  according to a person familiar with his remarks Mr  Fallon did not respond to a request for comment  The only thing stopping a deal is Senator Mitch McConnell  because Senator McConnell wants to change the rules   said Justin Goodman  Mr  Schumer s current spokesman Mr  Schumer has privately expressed frustration with his recent interactions with Mr  McConnell  particularly the majority leader s unwillingness to even consider a separate deal for nonjudicial appointments  In a recent leadership meeting  Mr  Schumer complained that Mr  McConnell was offering him a deal that  chopped off four fingers  as opposed to cutting off his whole hand  Senate Democratic aides said Every Senate Democrat voted against the rule change on Wednesday  Two Republican senators  Mike Lee of Utah and Ms  Collins  also opposed it  The Senate s rules protect the rights of the American people by balancing the competing interests of majorities  minorities and individual senators   Mr  Lee said The actual nominations were less controversial than the rule  and a handful of Democrats crossed the aisle to vote for Mr  Altman Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer  who bear no great affection for each other  engaged in an uncommonly emotional duel on the Senate floor   holding in rapt attention two dozen senators who  in near unison  deposited their iPhones on their desks or laps to watch At one point  Mr  Schumer  speaking from a prepared text  turned to confront Mr  McConnell directly  accusing the leader of abusing  the brute power of the majority  to push the change  I m sorry my Republican colleagues have gone along with Senator McConnell s debasement of the Senate   he said Mr  McConnell sat impassively at his desk a few feet away as Mr  Schumer spoke  He stared down at the carpet and fussed with his shirt cuffs  wearing a wry  mocking grin When he stood to defend himself  his face betrayed the strain  gradually reddening into a crimson blush that spanned from cheekbone to jaw  as he accused Democrats  under the leadership of  a fella named Chuck Schumer   for weaponizing the filibuster over the past 15 years  He started the whole thing   Mr  McConnell said  turning to face Mr  Schumer  

WASHINGTON   Amid blowback from Capitol Hill  President Donald Trump switched gears again Wednesday  suggesting he never wanted Congress to vote to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election Trump s new tweets shifted his rationale for the  Obamacare  fight  First he said it was his choice to push off the health care votes  Then he said he never expected there to be any votes at all until after 2020 Trump claimed Wednesday he had never intended to reopen old wounds  But in keeping the issue at the forefront  the president put fresh attention on the GOP s long running and thus far unsuccessful effort to end ACA  I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me   the Republican Party   Trump tweeted  adding   I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election  That s not how congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader McConnell  understood Trump s sudden shift to the issue last week Nor did it stop Democrats from calling attention to the health care issue Wednesday The Democratic controlled House used a near party line 240 186 vote to condemn the Trump administration for joining a federal lawsuit aimed at annulling former President Barack Obama s health care law  Minutes later  the House Democrats  campaign organization launched digital ads in the districts of around 40 Democrats in competitive seats  saying they d  fought back  against GOP efforts to gut the statute s protections The GOP s bitter internal fight over health care in 2017 remains a sore subject for the president  He often retells the story of the late Arizona Sen  John McCain s  no  vote that killed the repeal and replace effort  Republicans  hit hard on health care issues during the 2018 midterm election  had no plans to take up the issue again before the next one Trump s fight was on display when he told Republican senators last week that his White House was developing a plan to replace the Obama health law  The sudden move stunned GOP leaders on Capitol Hill  While Trump wanted them to become  the party of health care   they feared it could be for all the wrong reasons if they were forced into a do over of the tough votes McConnell on Tuesday issued a rare public disclosure of his private counsel to the president  warning that another health care fight would be politically costly and doomed to fail now that Democrats control the House  The usually tight lipped leader said afterward that the president agreed to shelve his health care push until after the campaign  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters Tuesday Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week   backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  mindful that Republican unfulfilled promises to  repeal and replace  the Obama era law stand as a glaring failure of his administration  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   Trump said Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  After Trump said last week he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  McConnell faced a revolt from the ranks McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking    Associated Press writers Zeke Miller  Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram  Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar  Darlene Superville and Kevin Freking contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   The U S  and China opened a ninth round of talks Wednesday  aiming to further narrow differences in an ongoing trade war that has deepened uncertainty for businesses and investors and cast a pall over the outlook for the global economy The latest negotiating session on American soil follows a similar set of talks held last week in Beijing Larry Kudlow  a top White House economic adviser  said  good headway  was made when U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met in the Chinese capital with a delegation headed by Vice Premier Liu He  a confidant of President Xi Jinping Kudlow expressed optimism that the parties would narrow the areas of disagreement further this week  They ll be here for three days  maybe more   he told reporters at a roundtable sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor Others said they ve been encouraged by the tone of the negotiations thus far Myron Brilliant  head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  estimated Tuesday that the two sides are 90  of the way to an agreement but cautioned that  the last 10  is the hardest part  the trickiest part  At the heart of the dispute are the Trump administration s allegations that China steals technology and coerces U S  companies to hand over trade secrets   all part of Beijing s zeal to overtake U S  technological dominance  To pressure China  the United States has imposed tariffs on  250 billion in Chinese goods  The Chinese have counterpunched by taxing  110 billion in U S  imports Forecasters at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  among others  have downgraded their outlook for the global economy  partly because the U S  China rift is damaging trade and causing businesses to slow investment until they know how the dispute will end Tensions have eased somewhat since President Donald Trump and Xi met in Buenos Aires late last year and the administration ended up suspending its plans to raise tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese imports to buy time for negotiations Kudlow said the talks are covering a host of issues that the two sides  have never really covered before  and that progress was being made on all fronts   which is the assessment administration officials from Trump on down have been making publicly for weeks  We re not there yet and we hope this week we get closer   Kudlow said Analysts say two major sticking points  in particular  stand in the way of any agreement First  Trump wants to preserve at least the 25  tariffs he has imposed on  50 billion in Chinese imports as a way to maintain leverage over Beijing  China wants them lifted Second  the two sides must develop a mechanism to ensure that China honors any commitments it makes in an agreement  The administration complains that China has repeatedly failed to keep promises it made in previous trade talks The Chinese are widely expected to agree to buy substantially more American products   likely including soybeans and natural gas   to help narrow the United States  trade deficit in goods and services with China  which hit a record  379 billion last year  America s trade deficit with China has been one of Trump s chronic complaints  although many economists say a bilateral trade gap is relatively insignificant Congressional Democrats and others have warned Trump against reaching any agreement that settles for more U S  exports to China without also requiring Beijing to adopt serious economic reforms  Stand firm   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y   said Tuesday   Skip the political photo op and make good on your promise to stand up for American businesses and workers when China takes advantage  Christopher Adams  a former China specialist at the Treasury Department and the Office of the U S  Trade Representative who is a senior adviser at the Covington   Burling law firm  added   There has to be something substantive on the structural issues  Otherwise  the criticism will be severe  Whatever negotiators agree to  analysts say  they are unlikely to end the long standing tensions between America s mostly open  capitalist economy and a Chinese economy in which the Communist Party and the central government command the dominant role Even with a deal  Adams said   a lot of the underlying issues will still be with us unresolved because they re rooted in fundamental differences between the U S  and Chinese systems     Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is preparing an economic relief package for Venezuela that would put United States dollars directly into the hands of Venezuelans in the event that the government of President Nicols Maduro falls Larry Kudlow  the director of the White House s National Economic Council  disclosed the outlines of the plan on Wednesday as he called on Mr  Maduro to step aside and allow Juan Guaid  the opposition leader whom the United States recognizes as Venezuela s interim president  to take office Plans for a comprehensive aid package for Venezuela come as President Trump is cutting aid to other countries  including Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  out of frustration over the way those nations have handled their migration policies  Mr  Trump has also threatened to cut funding to Puerto Rico  a United States territory  over its handling of federal hurricane relief funds  We have a lot of plans to revitalize the Venezuelan economy and to move very rapidly   Mr  Kudlow said at an event sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor   It would be a rescue plan  It would be a restructuring plan  Venezuela has been crippled for years by hyperinflation and a failing economy that has led millions to flee for Colombia and other countries  The nation has been further disrupted since January  when opposition political leaders refused to acknowledge as legitimate the re election of Mr  Maduro  The United States has thrown its support behind Mr  Guaid  who declared himself interim president that month The administration is coordinating with regional banks in South America and the International Monetary Fund on a plan to stabilize Venezuela s teetering economy  Mr  Kudlow said  The Treasury Department  the National Economic Council and the National Security Council  he said  intend to use technology such as smartphones and apps to get American dollars to Venezuelans  There s many clever ways to get cash in there   Mr  Kudlow said   And the cash will not be bolvars  it will be dollars  The White House did not offer a timetable for the economic package or details about its scale  In recent months  the administration has imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela as part of a pressure campaign to topple the Maduro government  which has been receiving support from Moscow In March  Mr  Trump warned that Russia must  get out  of Venezuela after two Russian airplanes that were transporting military personnel arrived in Caracas  the capital of Venezuela  Russia has offered to send the Maduro government shipments of food and medicine as it struggles to confront soaring prices and widespread blackouts Mr  Kudlow said on Wednesday that more sanctions could be coming as the Trump administration seeks to ratchet up pressure on Mr  Maduro Venezuelans have been bearing the brunt of the political and economic turmoil in the country  Last month  the Red Cross received permission from Venezuela s government and its opposition leaders to roll out a global relief campaign that could help ease the humanitarian crisis Republicans and Democrats in Congress have expressed support for efforts to help revive Venezuela s economy  Senator Robert Menendez  Democrat of New Jersey  and Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  on Wednesday unveiled the Venezuela Emergency Relief  Democracy Assistance and Development Act  or the Verdad Act  to help bolster support for Mr  Guaid The legislation would provide  200 million in aid for Venezuela and  200 million for neighboring countries to absorb refugees  It would also bolster sanctions against the Maduro government  We need to expand humanitarian assistance  address kleptocracy   formally support  Mr  Guaid s efforts to restore democracy  Mr  Menendez wrote on Twitter  

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States and China were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks  while warning Beijing that it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without a pact The two countries are engaged in intense negotiations to end a months long trade war that has rattled global markets  but hopes of a resolution soared after both sides expressed optimism following talks in Beijing last week Speaking to reporters at the White House at the start of a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  Trump said some of the tougher points of a deal had been agreed but there were still differences to be bridged  We re getting very close to making a deal  That doesn t mean a deal is made  because it s not  but we re certainly getting a lot closer   Trump said in the Oval Office  And I would think with  oh  within the next four weeks or maybe less  maybe more  whatever it takes  something very monumental could be announced  Trump said he would hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping if there were a deal Xi assured Trump that text of the China U S  trade could be finalised soon  in a message conveyed by Liu He According to state run news agency Xinhua  Liu He told Trump that Xi believed under his and Trump s leadership  China U S  relations will make new and greater progress Xi said that in the past month or more  the two sides  trade teams had maintained close contact and  achieved new and substantive progress on issues in the text of two countries  trade agreement    I hope the two sides  trade teams can continue working in the spirit of mutual respect  equality  and mutual benefit to resolve each other s concerns  and finish negotiations on the text of the China U S  trade agreement soon   Xi said to Trump through Liu KEEPING LEVERAGE Trump declined to say what would happen to U S  tariffs on  250 billion worth of goods as part of a deal  China wants the tariffs lifted  while U S  officials are wary of giving up that leverage  at least for now  Asked about the benefits of an agreement for China  Trump said   It s going to be great for China  in that China will continue to trade with the United States  I mean  otherwise  it would be very tough for us to allow that to happen  Goods trade between the United States and China  the world s two largest economies  totaled  660 billion last year  according to U S  Census Bureau data  consisting of imports of  540 billion from China and  120 billion in exports to China On China s behalf  Liu cited  great progress  in the talks because of Trump s direct involvement and expressed hope that the talks would lead to  a good result  U S  SEEKS SWEEPING CHANGESTrump has previously threatened to impose punitive tariffs on all imports from China  more than a half trillion dollars worth of products  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  who is leading the talks for the Trump administration  said there were still some  major  major issues  to resolve and praised Liu s commitment to reform in China  Asked about the remaining sticking points  Trump mentioned tariffs and intellectual property theft  He said he would discuss tariffs with Liu in their meeting  Some of the toughest things have been agreed to   Trump said  He later said that an enforcement plan for a deal remained a sticking point as well   We have to make sure there s enforcement  I think we ll get that done  We ve discussed it at length   he said Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are holding talks in Washington with a Chinese delegation this week after meeting together in Beijing last week  The current round of talks is scheduled to go through Friday and possibly longer Hopes that the talks were moving in a positive direction have cheered financial markets in recent weeks  But U S  stocks were mixed on Thursday as investors waited for more developments in the trade negotiations  with the Dow Jones industrial Average slightly higher  and the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slightly lower    N The United States is seeking reforms to Chinese practices that it says result in the theft of U S  intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology from U S  companies to Chinese firms Administration officials initially envisioned a summit between Trump and Xi potentially taking place in March  but some U S  lawmakers and lobbying groups have said recently they were told that the administration was now aiming for a deal in late April OUTSTANDING ISSUESWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last week that the talks were  not time dependent  and could be extended for weeks or even months longer While some reform pledges by Beijing are largely set  including an agreement to avoid currency manipulation  an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China keeps its pledges and the status of U S  tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods must be resolved  China has been very clear  publicly and privately  that they would like to see all the tariffs removed   U S  Chamber of Commerce international affairs chief Myron Brilliant told reporters on Tuesday   The  Trump  administration has been equally clear that they want to keep some of the tariffs in place as a way to have leverage over China fulfilling its obligations under whatever final package is reached

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump eased up on his threats to close the southern border as officials across his administration explored half measures that might satisfy the president s urge for action  like stopping only foot traffic at certain crossings Facing a surge of Central American migrants trying to enter the U S   Trump last week threatened to seal the border this week if Mexico did not immediately halt all illegal immigration into the U S   a move that would have enormous economic consequences on both sides of the border While Trump on Tuesday did not back off the idea completely  he said he was pleased with steps Mexico had taken in recent days and renewed his calls for Congress to make changes he contends would solve the problem  Let s see if they keep it done   he said of Mexico   Now  if they don t  or if we don t make a deal with Congress  the border s going to be closed  100    He also said that he might only close  large sections of the border  and  not all of it   He added that his posturing was  the only way we re getting a response  Later Tuesday  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen held an emergency call with Cabinet members and White House aides  saying   We are going to treat it as if we have been hit by a Category 5 hurricane   according to a person on the call  The person was not authorized to discuss the call publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Nielsen was creating an emergency operations center and named U S  Border Patrol official Manny Padilla as an operational crisis coordinator to manage the response from within the different immigration agencies at the Department of Homeland Security  Padilla is a 30 year Border Patrol veteran and was recently the head of the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas His job will be different from that of the immigration or  border czar  that Trump is considering  the official said Closing the border completely would disrupt manufacturing supply lines and the flow of goods ranging from avocados to cars  making for a  potentially catastrophic economic impact   in the words of Republican Sen  Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader Some inside the administration also worry it would only exacerbate illegal immigration Meantime  administration officials grappled with how they might minimize the impact of a shutdown or implement less sweeping actions White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow  for example  told CNBC he s been looking at potentially keeping truck lanes open  We are looking at different options  particularly if you can keep those freight lanes  the truck lanes  open   he said  As for the hundreds of thousands of tourists and workers who cross the border legally  Kudlow said   that may be difficult  Earlier  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had told reporters that  while   Eventually  it may be that it s the best decision that we close the border   the president was  not working on a specific timeline  and all options remained on the table  The Council of Economic Advisers  she said  was conducting a number of studies on the impact  and  working with the president to give him those options  White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in an appearance on MSNBC that closing only certain entry ports  or parts of all of them  could be among the steps short of closing the entire border It was a shift from Trump s threat late last week to seal the whole border  and quickly   I am not kidding around   he said then  exasperated by the swelling numbers of migrants  thousands of whom were being released into the U S  because border officials had no space for them  Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100 000 arrests or denials of entry in March  a 12 year high  More than half of those are families with children  who require extra care With southern border facilities near a breaking point  U S  officials are busing many migrants hundreds of miles inland and dropping them off at bus stations and churches  Trump has mocked and vowed to end that  catch and release  practice but overwhelmed authorities saw no choice Responding to Trump s threats  Nielsen rushed home late Monday night from Europe  where she was attending G7 security meetings and intended to fly to the border mid week to assess the impact of changes already made  including reassigning some 2 000 border officers assigned to check vehicles to deal with migrant crowds and new efforts to return more asylum seekers to Mexico as they wait out their case Officials were hoping to have as many as 300 asylum seekers returned to Mexico per day by the end of the week near Calexico and El Paso in Texas and San Ysidro in California  Right now  only 60 a day are returned Nielsen has also requested volunteers from non immigration agencies within her department and sent a letter to Congress seeking more money and detention space and broader authority to deport families faster  The request was met with disdain by Democrats Even absent the extraordinary step of sealing a national border  delays at border stations have been mounting due to the personnel reassignments  Homeland Security officials said  When the Otay Mesa  California  entry port closed for the night Monday  150 trucks were still waiting to get into the U S Shutting certain border stations or parts of them would not be unprecedented  Over the Thanksgiving holiday last year  Trump claimed he d already  closed the border  after officials briefly closed the northbound lanes at San Ysidro  California  for several hours in the early morning to bolster security because of concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members Mexican officials announced Monday they d pulled 338 Central American migrants  181 adults and 157 children  off five passenger buses in a southern state that borders Guatemala  and said they had detained 15 possible smugglers on immigration law violations  But that was not unusual for Mexico  which has for years been cracking down on migration In 2014 then President Enrique Pena Nieto launched a program that was described as ensuring orderly migration but in practice resulted in making it much more difficult for Central Americans to transit    Associated Press writers Catherine Lucey and Darlene Superville in

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s Senate GOP allies  frustrated by delays in confirming dozens of lower profile nominees  rammed through a rules change Wednesday that cuts back debate on most of his picks The GOP plan  approved 51 48  indefinitely restored rules in place during the first few years of President Barack Obama s second term  Those rules had lapsed  allowing any senator to force 30 hours of debate on a nominee The rules change limits debate on most nominees to two hours instead of 30  White House selections for the Cabinet  Supreme Court and appeals courts would be exempted from the new rules  Every Democrat opposed the maneuver  joined by two Republicans  Susan Collins of Maine and Mike Lee of Utah The Senate changed the rules after a partisan debate that featured unusually personal finger pointing between the chamber s party leaders  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   and Minority leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y  They have battled over judicial filibusters since the administration of President George W  Bush McConnell  no stranger to obstructionist tactics himself  said the situation had gotten out of hand  with the Senate taking 128 votes to end debate on Trump s nominees during his first two years in office  far more than under other presidents  The comprehensive campaign by Senate Democrats to delay Senate consideration of presidential nominations is now more than two years old   McConnell said   It s time for this sorry chapter to end  Pointing at Schumer repeatedly during a tartly worded speech  McConnell said the battles on presidential nominees date back to Schumer led filibusters of Bush appeals court picks such as Miguel Estrada  whose nomination stalled after a lobbying campaign by liberal judicial activists  He started this whole thing that we ve been wrestling with since 2003  cooked it up  convinced his colleagues to do it   McConnell said Schumer said McConnell was Machiavellian  cynical and hypocritical  and used his speech to recount a series of GOP power plays  This is a very sad day for the Senate  At a time when Leader McConnell brags about confirming more judges than anyone has done in a very long time  he feels the need to invoke the terribly destructive and disproportionate procedure of the  nuclear option  in order to fast track even more of President Trump s ultra conservative nominees to the federal bench   Schumer said Schumer  however  supported this step in a 2013 vote orchestrated by then Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   that eliminated the filibuster on Cabinet nominees and most judicial appointees  The maneuver allows the majority to change the rules on a party line vote Republicans said at the time that Reid and Democrats would come to regret the change  which has given Trump largely free rein to fill numerous judicial vacancies that have piled up over the years  I share some of the responsibility for where we find ourselves today   said Sen  Michael Bennet  D Colo  He said McConnell  said at the time that  you re going to come to regret this decision   and I will say this about him  he was right  I do  Many Democrats  who benefited from prior rules changes under Obama  now say the GOP move will enable Trump and future presidents  so long as their party controls the Senate  to run roughshod over the Senate They say the hurdles required to win confirmation should be difficult as a way to ensure nominees are ethical  qualified and responsive to requests by senators for information  There is no emergency that justifies changing the Senate rules  Sen  McConnell himself admitted the Senate has plenty of time to consider nominees   said Sen  Dick Durbin  D Ill   This is all about avoiding close scrutiny for extreme ideological nominees that Republicans want to pack onto the federal courts for lifetime appointments  But other Democrats  McConnell said  indicated behind the scenes that they could support the rules change provided that it wouldn t take effect until the next administration Democrats also say that GOP complaints over their tactics now ring hollow after the obstructionism Obama experienced over his two terms Merrick Garland  a federal appeals court judge nominated to the Supreme Court by Obama  failed to get a Senate hearing  and Republicans stalled numerous other Obama judicial nominees   both when the GOP was in the minority and then after retaking the Senate in 2015 Armed with the White House and control of the Senate  Trump is now confirming both district and appeals court judges at a dizzying pace and is positioned to reshape the federal judiciary even if he fails to win a second term  

WASHINGTON   Democrats mocked President Donald Trump on Tuesday for pushing back his promise of sweeping healthcare reform until after the 2020 election  and said they were happy to make it a central campaign issue Trump had pledged in recent days to use court action to end Obamacare  the signature law of his Democratic predecessor  Barack Obama  and said his Republican Party would push over the next few months for a better healthcare plan at lower cost for most Americans But Republican leaders in Congress quickly shied away from the issue and pushed him to reconsider In a series of late night tweets on Monday  Trump did just that  saying there would be no vote on any healthcare legislation until after next year s election Democrats gleefully jumped on the delay  saying it showed Trump and his party had no idea what to do with healthcare beyond repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021  Translation  they have no healthcare plan   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said   They are for repeal  they have no replace  Mitch McConnell  the Republican Senate majority leader  said he told Trump on Monday the party was not about to restart work on comprehensive healthcare legislation  noting Republicans were unable to pass a plan when they controlled both chambers of Congress in the first two years of the Trump presidency  I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters  Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in November elections after campaigning heavily on strengthening Obamacare FIRST VOTETrump said on Tuesday he and Republicans would draw up a new healthcare plan ahead of the 2020 election and implement it soon afterward  I think we re going to have a great healthcare package     If we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency   which I hope are two good assumptions   we re going to have a phenomenal healthcare   Trump told reporters He said a Republican plan would mean most Americans pay lower premiums and deductibles for their healthcare than they currently pay under Obamacare  revisiting a promise he made during the 2016 campaign Trump told House Republicans in a speech on Tuesday night that they should campaign on a pledge to make healthcare the first vote in Congress after the 2020 election He said one of the major reasons Democrats won control of the House last year was because Republicans did not have a healthcare plan to put forward to voters  Republicans should not run away from healthcare  You can t do it  You re going to get clobbered   Trump said While Trump s delay gives Republicans more time to knit together an alternative to Obamacare  it all but guarantees a 2020 battle over the divisive issue  Don t let President Trump fool you  America  Republicans are not the party of healthcare  They are the party that wants to end your healthcare   Schumer said at a rally on Tuesday   We Democrats will not stop fighting tooth and nail to protect America s healthcare  today  tomorrow  and on in through 2021  Trump and his fellow Republicans vowed in the 2016 presidential election to  repeal and replace  Obamacare but failed to do so during their first two years in power  despite control of both the Senate and the House  Several of the leading candidates for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination  including a number of current U S  senators  have already made healthcare a major part of their campaign message Trump accuses Democrats of seeking  a socialist takeover of American healthcare   and is certain to take that argument onto the 2020 campaign trail   I see what the Democrats are doing  It s a disaster what they re planning and everyone knows it   he told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday   Reporting by Susan Heavey and Susan Cornwell  dditional reporting by Roberta Rampton  Editing by Susan Thomas  Bill Berkrot and Peter Cooney

WASHINGTON   U S  congressional Democrats on Wednesday authorized a powerful committee chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 election  moving closer to a legal clash with President Donald Trump s administration The Democratic led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to enable its chairman  Jerrold Nadler  to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller s unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides including political strategist Steve Bannon Nadler has not yet exercised that authority  with the timing of any such move uncertain  The committee vote was 24 17 along party lines  with Democrats in favor and Trump s fellow Republicans opposed Attorney General William Barr  a Trump appointee  issued a four page summary of Mueller s main conclusions last month including that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400 page report by mid April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence gathering sources and methods In addition to Bannon  the committee authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn  former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson They are among 81 people  agencies and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates Nadler s panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would ignore a Democratic demand turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline  Democrats have expressed concern Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign Nadler said he would work with Barr  for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials  and will go to court to get permission to obtain the grand jury material  But if that doesn t work out in a very short order  we will issue the subpoenas   Nadler added       The committee must see everything   The potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government s third branch   the judiciary Representative Doug Collins  the committee s top Republican  said Democrats are  desperate for dirt on this president   This is reckless  It s irresponsible  And it s disingenuous   Collins said   It s also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing  making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy  It was not clear how likely the Justice Department would be to hand over subpoenaed documents  It could ignore a subpoena  running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress  and prepare for a potentially lengthy court battle INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACTIONIn another development  the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic led House Intelligence Committee  led by Trump critic Adam Schiff  is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump s inaugural committee Citing people familiar with the request  the Journal reported that the effort signaled that Congress is expanding its probe of how the inaugural committee raised and spent more than  100 million  The report could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters Barr s March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice  Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller s inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump  Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice  Moscow denied election interference  Mueller and U S  intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U S  Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report  If the department still refuses  then it should be up to a judge   not the president or his political appointee   to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record   Nadler said  Trump ally Lindsey Graham  Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  wrote on Twitter that the House panel s demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was  dangerous and ridiculous  The Justice Department declined comment  Priebus declined to comment  A lawyer for Priebus  Bannon and McGahn  as well as a Bannon spokeswoman  did not immediately respond to requests for comment Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries  Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge s permission to get access to Mueller s grand jury material  which is protected under federal law  Nadler said Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far  Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well  noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report s release to Congress   Reporting by David Morgan  Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld  Sarah N  Lynch  Steve Holland and Mark Hosenball  Editing by

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump said on Monday he was willing to wait until after the 2020 presidential election to get Congress to vote on a new healthcare plan  giving Republicans time to develop a proposal to replace Obamacare Congressional Republicans have been unable thus far to draft a proposal to replace Democratic President Barack Obama s signature Affordable Care Act despite frequent vows to do so in recent years Trump s vow last week that the Republican Party will be  the party of healthcare  caught his fellow Republicans off guard after the Justice Department backed a lawsuit intended to wipe out Obamacare  which has helped millions of Americans get health insurance In a series of tweets on Monday night  Trump said Republicans are developing  a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums  cost    deductibles than Obamacare   In other words it will be far less expensive   much more usable than ObamaCare  Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House   he said Trump s move suggests he is willing to debate the future of the U S  healthcare system during the 2020 presidential election campaign than try to reach agreement on a plan sooner   Reporting By Steve Holland  editing by Darren Schuettler  

WASHINGTON   The arrest of a Chinese woman who carried a malware laced device into Mar a Lago  President Trump s Florida resort  has exposed porous security at the private club and escalating tensions between Secret Service agents and the resort s staff members  who vet guest lists and allow people onto the sprawling grounds At times neither side has had full clarity on who was entering Mar a Lago  Secret Service agents must rely on club receptionists and other employees to crosscheck visitors  former officials said Communication breakdowns allow for security breaches   like the one on Saturday  when the woman  Yujing Zhang  32  was arrested with four cellphones  a hard drive  a laptop and a malware infected thumb drive  She said she was there to attend a  United Nations Friendship Event  that had never been scheduled Her arrest revealed gaps in Mr  Trump s security as well as the challenge of protecting a president who spends less time at the remote  fortified Camp David and more time at his busy resort with sometimes hundreds of guests  The normally tight lipped Secret Service was so disturbed by the breach that it issued an unusual statement that effectively blamed the Mar a Lago staff for not tightly tracking the comings and goings of guests  The Secret Service does not determine who is invited or welcome at Mar a Lago  this is the responsibility of the host entity   the agency said in a statement late Tuesday   The Mar a Lago club management determines which members and guests are granted access to the property  The arrest of Ms  Zhang came against a backdrop of increasing interest in Mar a Lago in China  where advertisements on the internet and on social media sell invitations to the club  which also functions as a for profit enterprise that rents itself out  The advertisements promise the prospect of rubbing elbows with the president and his associates at banquets  fund raisers and other events  Access to Mar a Lago is highly prized in China  bestowing respect  influence and the allure of potential business opportunities After Ms  Zhang was stopped  she produced a copy of a Chinese language invitation for the friendship event that was promoted by Cindy Yang  who had previously owned a string of massage parlors where the police shut down a prostitution ring in February  The authorities said the patrons included Robert K  Kraft  a friend of the president s and the owner of the New England Patriots Ms  Yang  who is active in groups backed by the Chinese government and Communist Party  is no stranger to Mar a Lago herself  Last year  she attended a Trump fund raiser at the resort and posed for a photo with the president Federal officials said they were still investigating Ms  Zhang and what kind of malware was on her thumb drive  It was not yet clear whether she was just a striver seeking selfies at the president s resort or whether she had links to Chinese intelligence  Ms  Zhang s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment Hotels owned by the Trump Organization have come under cyberattack before  in 2015  credit card information was stolen from a number of Trump hotel properties  But that appeared to be criminal action  rather than the act of a state Some of the Chinese promoters of these events flaunt their connections to China s ruling Communist Party and the department that promotes its foreign policy abroad  the United Front Work Department When the president is in Palm Beach  as he was on Saturday  agents must construct a government security system on top of what is essentially a private residence  Questions about the process arose about a month after Mr  Trump assumed office in 2017  when resort guests took plain sight photos of Mr  Trump and the Japanese prime minister discussing a North Korean missile launch  Several Democratic lawmakers called for an investigation into how the club was vetting its visitors  The Secret Service relies on the club s security  who has the guest list to tell them who belongs and who doesn t   said Don Mihalek  executive vice president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association  which represents the Secret Service  The Secret Service is not in the club membership business and does not have visibility on who these members are or what they re entitled to   said Mr  Mihalek  a former Secret Service agent who was assigned to Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign and presidential details from 2007 to 2011   That s the standard for any protected site outside of the White House  On Wednesday  Mr  Trump praised the Secret Service and his staff at Mar a Lago for helping to catch the woman   The person at the front desk did a very good job  to be honest with you   he said ImageThe president s frequent visits to Mar a Lago make the resort a visible target for supporters  protesters and  officials fear  others who might try to breach security layers meant to protect Mr  Trump CreditT J  Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesA former employee who worked at Mar a Lago from 2016 to 2018 said that the arrest of Ms  Zhang was not surprising  people have been caught on the property previously  In one notable example  a woman gained access to the Mar a Lago computer system and changed the automatic screen saver to the name of the president  preceded by an expletive  according to the employee  who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of legal retribution The former employee said security at the estate was not particularly strong  particularly when Mr  Trump was not there   a fact that was well known among the staff Joe Kirschbaum  who helped write a Government Accountability Office report on Mar a Lago security  said congressional inspectors received little help from the White House or the Trump Organization  He warned that it was not the responsibility of the Mar a Lago staff to keep Mr  Trump safe  and that the limited amount of information allowed to the Secret Service could create future problems In a letter on Wednesday  several Democratic senators asked Christopher A  Wray  the F B I  director  to assess the security conditions at Mar a Lago  The latest incident raises very serious questions regarding security vulnerabilities at Mar a Lago  which foreign intelligence services have reportedly targeted   wrote Senators Chuck Schumer of New York  Dianne Feinstein of California and Mark Warner of Virginia The president has personally instructed members to pack fund raisers beyond the ticket limit at Mar a Lago  according to one event organizer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations with Mr  Trump The fund raisers  which occur most weekends during the height of the winter season   usually held in hopes that the president or his family members may drop in   are staged in a large ballroom adjacent to the main patio where Mr  Trump eats his dinner Mr  Trump encouraged one organizer to pack the ballroom for a February event beyond the 700 person limit  advising that person to tell his staff at Mar a Lago that he said he would allow the increase  That organizer was told that the Mar a Lago security team had no final say over crowd numbers  but the event still grew to around 730 guests In the end  Mr  Trump did not attend  and it was screened by Mar a Lago officials and a private security company hired by the event s organizers When the president is not at his club  the security bubble becomes easier to break Members and guests must still present identification and check in with the club s security team  but several layers of Secret Service protection are not in place  Laurence Leamer  a Palm Beach resident who wrote a book about Mar a Lago  said in an interview that the scene could be freewheeling   like having dinner at the Outback Steakhouse   adding that the security  seems to me to be incredibly lax  Mr  Trump was at his nearby golf club four miles away when Ms  Zhang showed up at the resort on Saturday  and the process that the Secret Service uses to check visitors when he is in town was in place  officials said  Ms  Zhang was screened by agents before reaching the club s reception area  but confusion over her name and a potential communication barrier led to her entering On Wednesday  the Secret Service was reviewing the Saturday incident with security at Mar a Lago  John Cohen  a former acting under secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who worked closely with the Secret Service on protection details  said the president s  predictable  travel to the resort had made the location vulnerable  That s a nightmare for the Secret Service   he said   A privately owned ranch where the president and his people use the location is much easier than protecting the president when he chooses to go to a private club that s open to members that provides services to those people in exchange for a fee  When people approach a checkpoint at Mar a Lago  the Secret Service is focused on screening them for weapons or explosives  Mr  Mihalek said The agents will also screen for people they label  gate callers   those who have exhibited suspicious behavior   such as waiting for the president at the gate of the White House  From there  an agent will rely on security guards or staff members at the location to verify whether someone is a member or a guest of the club  If I m an intelligence service I m going to pay the membership fee  get someone with a clean background and have them become a member of the community   Mr  Cohen said   I m going to have them bring in guests on a regular basis  and that s going to be my strategy  I now have close proximity to the president s staff and maybe even the president himself

WASHINGTON   As Mississippi s governor toured massive flooding in the state  the Trump administration said Wednesday that it is giving another look to a long dead flood control and drainage project in the Mississippi Delta that had been killed by the George W  Bush administration because of its potential impact on wetlands and wildlife The project  which the late Sen  John McCain once called  one of the worst projects ever conceived by Congress   had called for huge pumps to be built at the confluence of the Yazoo and Mississippi Rivers in Mississippi  It was rejected by the Bush administration in 2008  Had that veto not occurred  we believe that the flooding  particularly in the Yazoo backwater  would have been much less damaging   said Mississippi Gov  Phil Bryant  after touring the region by helicopter Opponents say the pumps could worsen flooding downstream After touring the flooded region  Bryant told journalists that he had spent Monday and Tuesday in Washington  lobbying the administration to override the 2008 EPAs decision to kill the project  On Wednesday  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler confirmed to a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing that his agency is now reconsidering that 2008 decision Communities along the lower Mississippi River have been dealing with flooding for nearly two months  More than 500 000 acres  200 000 hectares  are submerged in the region  including more than 200 000 acres  80 000 hectares  of farmland  Farmers say flooding is harming them financially The U S  Army Corps of Engineers and local agencies are deploying a complex system of levees  dams  floodgates and floodways to try to contain high water and limit damage along the more than 2 000 mile river Floodwaters  have placed a tremendous burden on the lives and property of thousands of Mississippians   Sen  Cindy Hyde Smith  a Mississippi Republican  told Wheeler at Wednesday s hearing Bryant  who has aligned himself tightly with President Donald Trump  said Wednesday that more than 1 100 homes are affected  although some of those are not flooded  but in areas with roads cut off by flooding  Water is so common in the region that some people build small levees around their houses Environmentalists say the pumps would be capable of draining more than 200 000 acres  80 000 hectares  of wetlands   an area larger than all five boroughs of New York City The soggy and frequently flooded lowlands have comparatively few houses but are vital to waterfowl and other wildlife  environmental groups say  The National Wildlife Federation said the pumps would serve primarily  so large landowners can increase agricultural production on marginal lands that have always flooded  Bob Irvin  president of the American Rivers conservation group  said in an email Wednesday that the EPA was moving to revive a  zombie  project  Nothing has changed since the first Bush administration recognized that the Yazoo Pumps project was an environmental disaster and an economic loser   Irvin said The Bush administration had invoked the Clean Water Act  saying it would cause  unacceptable damage  to valuable resources  At the time  it was one of only about a dozen times the federal water law had been invoked to reject a project outright The pump project has been heavily pushed by the Delta Council  a farming and business lobbying group that includes many large farmers in the fertile Mississippi Delta  Before retiring from the Senate  Thad Cochran  long a proponent of the project  made a final attempt last year to put language in a spending bill ordering pump construction to begin despite the EPA veto  it failed Sharkey County Supervisor Bill Newsom  who also manages a cotton gin  is one of many proponents of the pumps  He says farming is the only industry in the region  and says he doesn t want to drain the region s wetlands  just control flooding  We re just simply wanting to have a flood level we can live in   Newsom said last month    Amy reported from Jackson  Mississippi  Associated Press writer Rogelio Solis in Flowood  Mississippi contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON SAN DIEGO   The Trump administration is intensifying measures to curb the flow of Central American asylum seekers crossing into the United States from Mexico  officials said on Monday  including sending more people back to Mexico to wait for their asylum claims to be heard by U S  courts Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  agency will speed up the reassignment of 750 officers to parts of the border dealing with the largest numbers of immigrants  a shift the administration first announced last week Nielsen was cutting short a visit to Europe and flying back to Washington from London to personally oversee enforcement actions  and would visit the border later in the week  a Homeland Security official said late on Monday  She had been due to also travel to Sweden and take part in a meeting of G7 security officials in Paris U S  President Donald Trump threatened to close the border this week if Mexico does not stop a surge of people  often traveling as families from Honduras  El Salvador and Guatemala  Closing the border would potentially disrupt millions of legal border crossings and billions of dollars in trade  His aides doubled down on the threat on Sunday but offered no specific details or timeline   Graphic  https   tmsnrt rs 2CJe9fh One policy put in place earlier this year to return asylum seekers to Mexico  called the Migrant Protection Protocols  MPP   will be  immediately  expanded by  hundreds of additional migrants per day above current rates   Nielsen said in a statement on Monday As of March 26  approximately 370 migrants had been returned to Mexico since the program began in late January  a Mexican official said last week People who have been returned to Mexico to wait are struggling to find attorneys and receive notice of their proceedings in U S  courts  rights advocates said Trump administration officials say the MPP is a way to address the failings of the current system  which they claim encourages illegal immigration  Families that claim asylum are often released into the United States because of limits on how long children can be held in detention  allowing them to stay for years while their cases move through a backlogged immigration court system even though many claims are ultimately denied SHELTERS AT CAPACITYThe administration is hoping policies of deterrence will reduce the number of people who turn themselves in to U S  border agents  overwhelming the capacity of processing centers along the southern border  CBP estimated last month that some 100 000 migrants would be apprehended or encountered at the border in March  the highest level in a decade  forcing agents to temporarily house migrants for processing in an outdoor enclosure under an international bridge in El Paso  Texas  That overflow site was shut down on Sunday after being used for a month The total number of immigrants being released by U S  immigration authorities in El Paso is averaging 500 600 per day  said Ruben Garcia  executive director of Annunciation House  which coordinates migrant releases with U S  immigration authorities  Annunciation House is preparing for that total to rise to up to 1 100 during the current surge  Garcia said Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that Mexico will help to regulate the flow of Central Americans passing through its territory to the United States  He said the root causes of the phenomenon must be tackled  In a move Democrats and Republicans in Congress have said would be counterproductive  the U S  State Department cut aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador after Trump accused them  without providing evidence  of having  set up  migrant caravans

said it was accepting returned asylum seekers for humanitarian reasons although it opposes the policy Shelters in major Mexican border cities such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez are already at capacity because of the increase in asylum seekers in recent months and the U S  policy of allowing only a few dozen people per day to ask for asylum at ports of entry COURT HEARINGSLast week  San Diego immigration judge Scott Simpson heard from the first Central American families that were returned to Mexico under the MPP policy Of four families in court on Wednesday  just one had an attorney  Yanira Esmeralda Chavez  a Salvadoran fruit seller  accompanied by her three boys did not have a lawyer as she made her case to Simpson  The family had been staying at a shelter in Tijuana  and asked to remain in the United States because they feared being sent back to Mexico  I called the numbers on the attorney list that they provided me  but they said they cannot take my case because I am in Tijuana   Chavez said in the hearing   It would be better if I stay in the U S   where I have family members  Simpson gave Chavez two more months to obtain an attorney  and said that her family in the United States could perhaps help her find a lawyer Throughout the day  Simpson expressed his concerns about the policy  saying he was  skeptical  about migrants getting their notices to appear in court  given the court does not have proper addresses for those returned to Mexico   Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati and Jose Gallego Espina  additional reporting by Dave Graham  Sharay Angulo and

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  In recent days  President Trump has used Twitter to warn Mexico that he may close the border  to suggest that The New York Times and The Washington Post be stripped of their Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the special counsel s Russia investigation and to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates in 2018 And if Mr  Trump had his way  Brandon Neely  among others  would be blocked from seeing any of those tweets Mr  Neely  a police officer in Houston  is one of an untold number of Twitter users who have been blocked by Mr  Trump  These users  if they are logged into their accounts  cannot see the president s tweets and are unable to reply to them or see others  responses The president s actions led Mr  Neely  along with six others blocked by Mr  Trump  to sue him  saying he had violated their First Amendment rights  A federal judge in Manhattan ruled against Mr  Trump last year  finding that the president s Twitter feed was a  public forum  and  that his blockings were unconstitutional Mr  Trump appealed the ruling  and the case went before a three judge panel in Manhattan last week  The judges seemed skeptical of Mr  Trump s contention that he was acting in a personal  not official  capacity when he blocked people Circuit Judge Barrington D  Parker asked Mr  Trump s counsel  a Justice Department lawyer  why blocking  points of view the president doesn t like  isn t  just a quintessential First Amendment violation  How the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rules in the Trump case may have larger implications  as elected officials around the country expand the use of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter  Federal judges are grappling with the question of how the First Amendment may apply to those accounts Blocking on social media is not a partisan phenomenon  In 2017  for instance  ProPublica sent letters asking all 50 governors and 22 federal agencies whether they had blocked people on social media  Five Republican governors  four Democrats and four agencies responded with information about people they had blocked  Many agencies and more than half the governors did not respond In New York  the issue has arisen with Representative Peter King  a blunt and occasionally combative 14 term Republican congressman who represents parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island  Recently  one of his constituents collected the names of about 70 people who said they had been blocked from commenting on Mr  King s Facebook page  He s like this big tough guy  but he doesn t want to hear any criticism whatsoever   said the constituent  Jacqueline Hassett  who has been blocked and has met with lawyers about the possibility of suing Mr  King The seven Twitter users who sued Mr  Trump have been unblocked  following the lower court ruling   Anybody blocked by the president can still  in theory  view Mr  Trump s tweets  In an entry on its F A Q  page  Twitter tells users   If the account you ve blocked isn t logged in or is accessing Twitter content via a third party  they may be able to see your public Tweets   Other judges have issued similar rulings  Earlier this year  the Fourth Circuit  in Richmond  Va   upheld a lower court ruling that the Democratic chairwoman of the Loudoun County board of supervisors had violated the First Amendment rights of a constituent by blocking him on Facebook for about 12 hours Elsewhere  a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that three state assemblymen violated the First Amendment when they blocked a liberal advocacy group on Twitter  Jerry Brown  the former Democratic governor of California  produced records in 2017 showing that he had in the past blocked more than 1 500 people on Facebook and Twitter  and Paul Gosar  a Republican congressman of Arizona who in 2017 wrote a post on Facebook titled   So you re upset I blocked you on Facebook  Here s why I don t care  a three part series   said last year in a court filing that he was no longer blocking anyone Jameel Jaffer  the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University  which filed the Trump case and argued the Loudoun County appeal  said that social media accounts may be seen as public forums if they are used to make announcements related to government duties  engage with constituents about policy or if they use government resources   if  for example  staffers create posts  Public officials all over the country are using social media often as the main means of communicating with their constituents   Mr  Jaffer said   We want to make sure those officials aren t insulated from criticism  make sure participants in those digital spaces aren t deprived of the opportunity of hearing other citizens  divergent views and make sure these spaces retain their vitality and integrity and aren t transformed into echo chambers  In many ways  Mr  King s Facebook page reflects his public persona  It includes pictures of him in a Long Island diner with retired firefighters  a video of him at a St  Patrick s Day parade and a description of a meeting with an Israeli diplomatic official The page also includes announcements that he was backing legislation to fund the Sept  11 Victim Compensation Fund  co sponsoring a tax deduction bill and introducing a resolution calling for the extradition of people in Cuba who have been charged with crimes in the United States Mr  King said during a telephone interview that he has the right to block who he wants on his Facebook page because it does not use government resources  he also contends that it is separate from his congressional work  He said that his campaign committee pays to boost his posts  which are meant to function like re election ads  I wouldn t have to give any opponent an opportunity to comment on my campaign brochure   Mr  King said  adding that he only blocks some of his critics  usually those who make inappropriate remarks or comment frequently Mr  King has interacted with commenters  thanked supporters and sparred with critics  When a constituent from West Sayville  Chris Ann Rogers Pellegrino  asked on Facebook in 2017 for a  special outside investigation into Trump Russia ties   and told Mr  King she hoped he was loyal to  the fabric of our democracy  his reply was   My loyalty is to the Constitution  not the liberal zeitgeist  Ms  Rogers Pellegrino said she was blocked almost immediately after posting her message  Another constituent  Danielle Miller  said she was blocked last year after disagreeing with a post by Mr  King that said kneeling protests by professional football players were  rooted in the false narrative of police bias against black men  Several constituents who had been blocked said they were concerned that limiting criticism would create a misleading impression that Mr  King s positions are more reflective of his district than they actually are Christine DiBiase Martorana  from Seaford  said she was blocked after posting she was disappointed in Mr  King s  continued emphasis on Islamic terrorism  and asking for his thoughts  on non Muslim terrorists   Meg Rowe  from Brightwaters  said she was blocked after stating that she was keeping track of how many people Mr  King was blocking  It s infuriating  honestly   said Ms  Rowe  who in 2017 began a Facebook page called  Blocked by Peter King  to document blockings and the removal of posts   We just want some avenue to talk with him  even if we disagree  because it s his job to listen to us   

WASHINGTON   Democrats in the House of Representatives are gearing up to issue subpoenas to try to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election and President Donald Trump s actions related to the inquiry The question is  how successful will they be Attorney General William Barr  who has broad authority under Justice Department regulations to decide how much of Mueller s report to release  sent lawmakers a four page letter on March 24 explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  and has promised to release the nearly 400 page report by the middle of this month  with some parts blacked out  or  redacted  That has not satisfied Democrats  who control the House  The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over the complete report  without redactions  as well as underlying evidence Here is an explanation of the legal hurdles Democrats must clear in their subpoena effort  important judicial precedents and Barr s rationale for keeping parts of the report confidential CAN CONGRESS SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH Yes  Committees of the House and Senate possess the power to issues subpoenas for documents held by the executive branch or other subjects in investigations  Under the U S  Constitution  Congress is a co equal branch of the federal government alongside the executive branch and judiciary If Barr refuses to comply with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to obtain the full report and underlying investigative material  the House could vote to hold him  in contempt  and turn to the courts to enforce the subpoena  Legal experts said that process could take years  Barr s  principal conclusions  letter said Mueller s inquiry did not establish that Trump s campaign team conspired with Russia  Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the Republican president committed obstruction of justice but also did not exonerate him  Barr subsequently concluded that Trump had not engaged in criminal obstruction The letter provided scant details of the findings  though Trump immediately claimed  complete and total exoneration   The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over Trump s presidency  House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into Trump  who is seeking re election in 2020 A situation analogous to the current subpoena fight unfolded during the presidency of Trump s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama  In 2012  the House  then controlled by Republicans  subpoenaed internal Justice Department documents related to a failed federal law enforcement operation to track illegal gun sales  dubbed  Fast and Furious   Obama s attorney general  Eric Holder  refused to comply  The House voted to hold him in contempt  marking the first time in U S  history that Congress took such action against a sitting member of a president s Cabinet The Justice Department later turned over thousands of pages of documents but the matter was not resolved until after Obama left office  with a settlement reached in 2018 WHY DID BARR NOT SIMPLY RELEASE THE WHOLE REPORT Barr told lawmakers in a March 29 letter that he was making  redactions that are required  before releasing the Mueller report  He cited four reasons for redactions  protecting secret grand jury proceedings  safeguarding intelligence gathering sources and methods  shielding material that could affect ongoing investigations  and protecting information that would unduly infringe on personal privacy and reputations Grand juries are groups of citizens who meet in secret and decide whether to authorize criminal indictments or demands for evidence sought by prosecutors  U S  law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret  though there are exceptions that let Congress  and even the general public  see it Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege  which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government WHAT LAWS AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS APPLY Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight Under U S  law  grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret  But if a grand jury matter involves  grave hostile acts of a foreign power  or other intelligence information  the information can be shared with appropriate government officials  The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr  Leon Jaworski  a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal  produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings H R  Haldeman  who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff  sought to block that information from Congress  citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr  The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington  which ruled 5 1 against Haldeman  The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation  and noted that the Democratic led House Judiciary committee had taken  elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials   The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office  Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment  If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material  a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play  Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski  citing executive privilege  The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court  saying the president s interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary s need for evidence   Reporting by Jan Wolfe  Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder  

WASHINGTON   White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Wednesday said the Trump administration would soon issue an executive order that would open the door for more natural gas pipelines and exports of liquefied natural gas  or LNG  The administration  which is pushing a policy it calls energy dominance  has been considering an order that would push back against states  including New York  that have blocked interstate natural gas pipelines  Kudlow said the executive order would open the way for pipelines and LNG at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor news outlet  New York has blocked pipelines that would take natural gas from Pennsylvania to New England  which means the region sometimes needs imports of LNG  Early last year  a tanker carrying LNG from a project in Russia s Arctic arrived in Boston Harbor to satisfy demand during a cold snap  It was unclear how the order would overrule the authority of states to rule on pipelines Several politicians in New York  including Governor Andrew Cuomo  have said they want energy companies to focus more on renewable power sources and energy efficiency  instead of building more gas and other fossil fuel fired power plants and infrastructure New York State in recent years blocked the construction of several pipelines that would transport fracked natural gas from the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania to New England  including Williams Cos Inc s Constitution and Northeast Supply Enhancement and National Fuel Gas Co s  NFG  Northern Access  In those cases  New York regulators denied the pipelines on environmental grounds  Trump has attempted to use an executive order to jumpstart TransCanada Inc s long delayed Keystone XL crude oil pipeline  signing an order just two days after assuming office in 2017  But that did not save the pipeline from getting bogged down in the courts and last week he issued another order seeking to breathe life into the project Meanwhile an independent federal agency has taken some steps that could help gas pipelines in New York The U S  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  determined last year that New York regulators waived their right to decide on a water quality certification for NFG s Northern Access project because the state waited too long  FERC this week denied New York s request to rehear that decision  Williams has made a similar argument about the Constitution pipeline    Reporting by Jeff Mason and Timothy Gardner  additional reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York  editing by Franklin Paul  Jonathan Oatis and Susan Thomas  

MEXICO CITY   U S  President Donald Trump s threats to shut the border with Mexico are now affecting what some might argue is the softest spot in bilateral relations   avocados Fearing that a border lockdown would prevent Mexico from shipping the 80 percent of avocados that the United States consumes  processors and wholesalers have started stockpiling the prized fruit used in guacamole or as spread on toast Avocado prices have jumped nearly 50 percent over the last week alone as a consequence Stefan Oliva  a research analyst at Gro Intelligence  which collects and analyzes agricultural data  said  procurement managers  wholesalers and processors  are  clamoring  for avocados in case the border is shut ahead of the Cinco de Mayo celebration Cinco de Mayo commemorates the 1862 Battle of Puebla in which Mexican troops defeated invading French forces and is celebrated all over the United States  but in Mexico the day is mainly celebrated in Puebla The United States imported nearly  2 1 billion worth in avocados from Mexico in 2018  or more than 900 000 tonnes  he said That is some 10 times the value of avocados it buys from the rest of the world and more than 10 times what the United States currently produces  Gro Intelligence data shows   Even those very  very vague threats are enough to scare wholesalers and processors that are relying on consumers   Oliva said   If there is a border shutdown  they will have to circumvent the border and pay an extreme premium  Trump has taken a step back from his threat to close the border to fight illegal immigration  as pressure mounted from companies worried that a shutdown would cause chaos to supply chains  It could disrupt millions of legal crossings and billions of dollars in trade   nL1N21K0Q8 David Magana  a senior analyst specializing in food and agribusiness at Rabobank  said he had observed a 44 percent jump in the price of avocados over the past week  and that it could go higher still  If the border closes  this would be unchartered territory   Magana said   The prices could rise considerably  Alejandro Saldana  chief economist at Ve Por Ms  a Mexican bank that specializes in lending to the agricultural sector  said that a border shutdown could impact other produce  We could see a real impact on the industrial integration there is between Mexico and the U S    Saldana said   There will possibly be disruptions in manufacturing  particularly because a lot of the goods cross the border    Reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher in Mexico City  additional reporting by Julie Ingwersen in Chicago  Editing by Anthony Esposito and Michael Perry  

NEW YORK   Several U S  states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday to undo its recent decision that allowed fewer whole grains and more sodium in school breakfasts and lunches The states accused the U S  Department of Agriculture of ignoring federal dietary guidelines and scientific research on children s nutrition when it eased rules championed by former first lady Michelle Obama to make school meals healthier New York  California  Illinois  Minnesota  New Mexico  Vermont and the District of Columbia said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue acted in an  arbitrary and capricious  manner  and asked a Manhattan federal judge to void the new sodium and whole grain standards  The Trump administration has undermined key health benefits for our children       with deliberate disregard for science  expert opinion  and the law   New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement Spokespeople for the Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to requests for comment The changes announced last Dec  6 affect the federally funded National School Lunch Program  which was started by President Harry Truman in 1946 and feeds more than 30 million  mostly lower income children They are among a series of White House supported efforts to roll back federal regulatory oversight that President Donald Trump considers burdensome to business and economic growth The changes included cutting in half the amount of whole grains required to be served starting in the 2019 20 school year  affording schools more flexibility to offer noodles  tortillas and other foods containing mainly refined grains They also included a five year delay in the maximum sodium target scheduled for the next school year  and elimination of a sodium target set for the 2022 23 school year Perdue has said his agency was committed to nutritious meals in schools  but the changes acknowledged the  challenges  that schools face serving appetizing yet healthy meals  while ensuring that food would not be wasted  Other changes included allowing schools to serve low fat chocolate milk  rather than fat free milk The new rules set aside requirements under the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010  which Michelle Obama had supported in her fight against child obesity It had set new limits for calories  sodium and trans fats  while requiring more fruits  vegetables and whole grains Excessive sodium intake has been linked to heart disease  high blood pressure and stroke  while relatively higher refined grain consumption has been linked to type 2 diabetes  heart disease and obesity The case is New York et al v  U S  Department of Agriculture et al  U S  District Court  Southern District of New York  No  19 02956

SAN DIEGO EL PASO  Texas   Trucks inched through traffic and some stores reported fewer customers in U S  Mexico border towns on Wednesday as staffing shortages tied to a surge in asylum seekers slowed checkpoints and threats of the border closing scared away shoppers U S  President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to close the border  or parts of it  saying Congress could avert such a shutdown by changing laws to fix what he called immigration  loopholes  Business leaders on both sides of the border have lashed out against the threat  saying a shutdown would hurt supply chains and  1 7 billion in daily trade at some of the world s busiest land crossings  Words have meaning  especially when they come from the White House  The mere threat of a border closure does create

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump took a step back on Tuesday from his threat to close the U S  southern border to fight illegal immigration  as pressure mounted from companies worried that a shutdown would cause chaos to supply chains Trump threatened on Friday to close the border this week unless Mexico acted  He repeated that threat on Tuesday but said he had not made a decision yet   We re going to see what happens over the next few days   Closing the border could disrupt millions of legal crossings and billions of dollars in trade  Auto companies have been warning the White House privately that it would lead to the idling of U S  plants within days because they rely on prompt deliveries of components made in Mexico The U S  Chamber of Commerce  the largest U S  business lobbying group  has been in contact with the White House to discuss the  very negative economic consequences that would occur across the country   said Neil Bradley  the group s top lobbyist  on a call with reporters  Trump praised efforts by Mexico to hinder illegal immigration from Central America at its own southern border  On Monday  the Mexican government said it would help regulate the flow of migrants  I really wanted to close it   Trump said on Tuesday night at a fundraiser for congressional Republicans The Mexican government has not published apprehension statistics  but a senior White House official said it had provided daily updates to the Trump administration  including specific apprehension numbers  They say they re going to stop them  Let s see  They have the power to stop them  they have the laws to stop them   Trump said earlier on Tuesday PUSH BACKTrump has made fighting illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America a key part of his agenda  but shutting down one of the world s most used borders might be a step too far  even for many of his fellow Republicans  Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell joined Democrats in warning Trump against such a move  Closing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country and I would hope we would not be doing that sort of thing   McConnell told reporters on Tuesday A group representing General Motors Co  Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said in a statement that  any action that stops commerce at the border would be harmful to the U S  economy  and in particular  the auto industry   Dozens of U S  vehicle  engine  transmission and other auto parts plants could close because of a lack of components in the days after a border shutdown  It would also prevent thousands of vehicles built in Mexico from landing in U S  dealer showrooms Automakers exported nearly 2 6 million Mexican made vehicles to the United States in 2018  accounting for 15 percent of all vehicles sold in the country  Some  like the Chevrolet Blazer SUV  are only made in Mexico  Retailers are also raising alarm bells  according to officials with two groups that represent hundreds of U S  retail firms  It will be unprecedented self inflicted pain   said David French  senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation   We are still nervous about this and we have been talking to some of our companies about maybe ramping up direct pressure on the White House by getting CEOs to call   SLOWER BORDERSenior U S  Department of Homeland Security officials said on Tuesday a recent redeployment of some 750 officers on the border to deal with a surge in migrants   mostly Central American families turning themselves in to border agents   had already led to a slowing of legal crossings and commerce at ports of entry  Wait times in Brownsville  Texas  were around 180 minutes  which were two times the peaks of last year   said a senior DHS official on a call with reporters   We ended the day yesterday at Otay Mesa  California  with a backup of 150 trucks that hadn t been processed   the official said  Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Tuesday that backups were delaying commercial traffic at the U S  Mexico border at several crossings  He said the government had not drastically changed its migration strategy following the shutdown threats DHS officials said border facilities had been overwhelmed by families seeking asylum  fleeing poverty and violence in Central America  DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Manuel Padilla  a 30 year veteran of the U S  Border Patrol  would now serve as the agency s coordinator on the border response U S  Customs and Border Protection estimated that some 100 000 migrants were apprehended or encountered at the border in March  the highest level in a decade   The system is on fire   a DHS official said Because of limits on how long children are legally allowed to be held in detention  many of the families are released to await U S  immigration court hearings  a process that can take years because of ballooning backlogs  To try to address the problem  the Trump administration in January started sending some migrants to wait out their U S  court dates in Mexican border cities  On Monday  DHS said it would dramatically ramp up that program  despite court challenges The biggest priority for Nielsen is to seek action from Congress to change the immigration laws  said a DHS official  She sent a letter to Congress last week repeating many of the Trump administration s demands  including a request to quickly deport Central American minors that cross the border alone  Under current law  minors who are not from the contiguous countries of Canada and Mexico are placed in the care of sponsors in the United States  which Nielsen called a  dangerous  pull  factor  for migrants  Migrant advocates and some Democrats in Congress oppose the proposed legislative changes  saying they would send vulnerable children back to dangerous situations in their home countries  Trump said he had spoken with  a few  Democrats on Tuesday about the administration s proposals and added   They re changing their minds    Reporting by Roberta Rampton  Steve Holland and David Shepardson in Washington and Mica Rosenberg in New York  Additional

WASHINGTON   The U S  government granted waivers to just 6 percent of visa applicants subject to its travel ban on a handful of countries during the first 11 months of the ban  new data reviewed by Reuters shows Trump administration officials have pointed to the waiver process embedded in the travel ban as proof it was not motivated by animus toward Muslims  as critics have charged  but rather serves to protect the United States In June 2018  after legal challenges defeated earlier iterations of the ban  the Supreme Court upheld a revised version and wrote in its majority opinion that the waiver program supported the government s claims that the ban served  a legitimate national security interest  But new data shows that only 6 percent of people subject to the travel ban were ultimately granted waivers during the first 11 months of the ban s full implementation Between Dec  8  2017 and Oct  31  2018  State Department officers ruled on nearly 38 000 applications for non immigrant and immigrant visas filed by people subject to the travel ban who otherwise qualified for the visas and needed waivers to get them They determined that just 6 percent   or 2 216 applicants   met the criteria for a waiver  Of those  670 had not yet received their visas but were expected to do so  The data was provided in a Feb  22 letter from Assistant Secretary of State Mary Taylor to Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen  The letter was received by Van Hollen s office on Wednesday  and his office provided it to Reuters  This data paints a clear   and deeply disturbing   picture of the Trump travel ban   Van Hollen said in a statement to Reuters   The administration repeatedly swore to the Supreme Court and the American people that this was not a de facto Muslim ban and that there was a clear waiver process to ensure fairness  That couldn t be further from reality  A State Department spokesman said on condition of anonymity that  a consular officer carefully reviews each case to determine if the applicant is covered  by the travel ban and  if so  whether the case qualifies for a waiver  The travel ban blocks citizens of Iran  Libya  North Korea  Somalia  Syria and Yemen  as well as some Venezuelan officials and their relatives  from obtaining a broad range of U S  immigrant and non immigrant visas  Chad was previously covered by the ban but was removed in April 2018  The latest data show a slight increase in the waiver issuance rate  Data from December 2017 through April 2018 showed that waivers were issued in 2 percent of visa applications filed by people subject to the travel ban TREMENDOUS HARDSHIPSThe ban s restrictions vary from country to country   Somalis  for instance  can receive short term visas and Iranians are allowed to get student visas  while North Koreans are blocked from all visas In addition to the almost 38 000 applications considered for a travel ban waiver  around 8 100 by people from countries subject to the travel ban were refused in the 11 month period for reasons unrelated to the ban  and nearly 2 600 applicants were found eligible for visas based on exceptions to the ban and thus did not need a waiver Critics say the waiver process is shrouded in secrecy  with vague standards and little information given to applicants about how they can qualify or apply for one  Two federal lawsuits are contesting the fairness of the process The official criteria for a waiver is a three part test assessing whether denying entry to an applicant would cause  undue hardship   if entry of the person would not pose a threat to the United States  and if entry would be in the national interest  There is no application for a waiver   the State Department says it  automatically  considers applicants for them  They  the State Department  are actually actively telling applicants   We don t want your materials in support of a waiver    said Mahsa Khanbabai  an immigration attorney in Massachusetts who has clients subject to the ban   Even in the cases where they do take them  the extraordinary amount of time that it takes to make a decision causes tremendous hardships for people     Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati  Editing by Kieran Murray and Daniel Wallis

Interior Department  continued to lobby for a major client several months after he filed official papers saying that he had ended his lobbying activities The bill for Mr  Bernhardt s services  dated March 2017 and labeled  Federal Lobbying   shows  along with other newly disclosed documents  Mr  Bernhardt working closely with the Westlands Water District as late as April 2017  the month Mr  Trump nominated him to his current job  deputy interior secretary  In November 2016  Mr  Bernhardt had filed legal notice with the federal government formally ending his status as a lobbyist  Westlands  a powerful California agribusiness group  was one of Mr  Bernhardt s main lobbying and legal clients between 2011 and 2016  During that time  Westlands paid Mr  Bernhardt s firm  1 3 million for lobbying services  A New York Times investigation this year revealed how Mr  Bernhardt made it a priority at the Interior Department to promote policies long sought by Westlands  including a weakening of Endangered Species Act protections for a rare fish  Those changes would have led to the release of vast amounts of water from the delicate ecosystem of the San Francisco Bay Delta for irrigation of commercial farmland A spokeswoman for Mr  Bernhardt  Faith Vander Voort  said in an email that the invoice had been labeled incorrectly and that the documents did not describe lobbying activity   David Bernhardt did not engage in regulated lobbying activities for Westlands Water District from the date he de registered forward   she wrote   Mr  Bernhardt engaged in various legal services that supported the senior employees and Directors of the Board of Westlands Water District  who are public officials  operating in their official capacity  These efforts do not constitute regulated lobbying activity  Westlands Water District did not respond to a request for comment The Senate Energy Committee voted 14 6 on Thursday to send Mr  Bernhardt s nomination as interior secretary to the full Senate for a confirmation vote  In committee hearings  Democrats criticized Mr  Bernhardt as beholden to industry while Republicans praised his depth of knowledge  Two Democrats  Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico  and one independent  Senator Angus King of Maine  voted with Republicans in favor of Mr  Bernhardt s confirmation  Senator Lisa Murkowski  the Alaska Republican who leads the committee  said of Mr  Bernhardt Thursday morning   There are accusations about his ethics  I think it s very clear you ve got some well funded groups that are working hard against him  She added   I am aware of no substantiation of them whatsoever  I would be stunned if they would be substantiated  We have known about this previous work he had at Westlands  The documents  including the March 2017  Federal Lobbying  invoice sent to Westlands by Mr  Bernhardt s former firm  were obtained under California open records law by the office of the California attorney general  Xavier Becerra  and by the environmental advocacy group Pacific Advocates  They were reviewed by The New York Times The invoice itemizes the costs of services described as  Westlands Trip   taken by Mr  Bernhardt in late January and early February 2017 from Washington through Denver  Sacramento and Chicago before heading back to Washington  It includes a charge of  2 432 68 for Mr  Bernhardt s travel  as well as a  25 000 charge  for professional services rendered  in February 2017  During the previous year  a period when Mr  Bernhardt was an official registered lobbyist  Westlands paid his firm a  25 000 monthly fee  Lara Day  a spokeswoman for Mr  Bernhardt s former firm  Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck  reiterated that the description of Mr  Bernhardt s work in February 2017 as  Federal Lobbying  was an error   I can confirm that David was not doing federal lobbying   she said Mr  Bernhardt s spokeswoman  Ms  Vander Voort  also said the work performed by Mr  Bernhardt in 2017 did not constitute  regulated lobbying   Several experts who reviewed the documents offered a different interpretation  They pointed out that the documents appear to show Mr  Bernhardt meeting with  and communicating with  federal officials to advocate for policy matters on behalf of a paying client  which is the basic work of lobbying  The action described by the documents  raises ethical questions   said Virginia Canter  the chief ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  a watchdog group   He obviously was engaged in some sort of federal lobbying activity on behalf of Westlands even after he de registered as a lobbyist  Mr  Bernhardt s activities  if they constituted lobbying  could violate federal laws requiring lobbyists to disclose their activities  according to four independent authorities on the rules  The documents include several emails with Johnny Amaral and Thomas Birmingham  the two officials at Westlands who worked closely on federal lobbying matters with Mr  Bernhardt during the time he was a registered lobbyist  They include an email dated December 2016 from John Watts  an aide to Senator Dianne Feinstein  a California Democrat who works on the state s water policy issues  to Mr  Bernhardt and Mr  Birmingham  The subject line is  Memo  Endangered Species Act consistency of California water language   It addresses two issues  endangered species and water rights  on which Mr  Bernhard had lobbied for Westlands On Jan  2  2017  Mr  Bernhardt emailed Mr  Amaral and Mr  Birmingham with  a short draft letter  addressed to Representative David Valadao  Republican of California   expressing appreciation  for the lawmaker s successful efforts to include legislative language related to a water infrastructure bill on which Mr  Bernhardt had already officially lobbied  and thanking the representative for his work on another bill related to water policy in the Central Valley  The final letter sent by Westlands to Mr  Valadao contained several passages identical to those drafted by Mr  Bernhardt On Dec  8  2016  the water infrastructure bill passed the House and Mr  Bernhardt emailed Mr  Amaral expressing optimism that the bill would easily win in the Senate as well Mr  Amaral responded   You re winning all kinds of bets aren t you  We should be going to Vegas     Mr  Bernhardt replied   There is no way it will fail in the Senate  Over the course of the first half of 2017  Mr  Amaral sent several emails to Mr  Bernhardt and a small group of Westlands officials referring to the group s weekly  team  telephone calls  Another email  dated April 19  2017  from Mr  Amaral  asked Mr  Bernhardt if he could make it to a  team breakfast  the following Wednesday  April 25  Bernhardt responded   Yes   Three days later  Mr  Trump nominated Mr  Bernhardt to be deputy secretary of the Interior Department Mr  Amaral now works for another California water district  the Friant Water Authority  He did not respond to voice mail or text messages sent to his cellphone  Ethics experts said the documents shed light on the close relationship Mr  Bernhardt maintained with his former lobbying client   The fact that he is attending a  team breakfast  with Westlands just days before he s nominated is a shocking level of connection with this lobbying client at a moment he is about to enter government   said Delaney Marsco  ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center  a nonpartisan watchdog group   It goes to this deep  intertwined relationship that he had  ImageCashew

WASHINGTON   Some of Robert S  Mueller III s investigators have told associates that Attorney General William P  Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr  Barr indicated  according to government officials and others familiar with their simmering frustrations At stake in the dispute   the first evidence of tension between Mr  Barr and the special counsel s office   is who shapes the public s initial understanding of one of the most consequential government investigations in American history  Some members of Mr  Mueller s team are concerned that  because Mr  Barr created the first narrative of the special counsel s findings  Americans  views will have hardened before the investigation s conclusions become public Mr  Barr has said he will move quickly to release the nearly 400 page report but needs time to scrub out confidential information  The special counsel s investigators had already written multiple summaries of the report  and some team members believe that Mr  Barr should have included more of their material in the four page letter he wrote on March 24 laying out their main conclusions  according to government officials familiar with the investigation  Mr  Barr only briefly cited the special counsel s work in his letter ImageListen to  The Daily   New Insights Into the Mueller

general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four page summary  Members of the special counsel s team say something was lost michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  The Mueller team sent its report to the attorney general  William Barr  The attorney general sent a summary of that report to Congress  Now  new reporting shows members of Mueller s team feel that Barr s summary did not reflect the report they wrote  It s Thursday  April 4  So take us back to the beginning of last week  What do we know at that point nicholas fandosSo we knew that Bill Barr  taking Bob Mueller s 300  to 400 page report  had gone through it extensively and boiled down what he called the  principal conclusions  to just four pages michael barbaroNick Fandos covers Congress  Mike Schmidt covers national security michael schmidtWe were in this unusual situation where the special counsel  Robert Mueller  had sent his report to the attorney general  said  I found no evidence that the campaign conspired with Russia to impact the election  But he declined to make a decision on obstruction nicholas fandosAnd what he said was Mueller didn t reach what Barr called a  traditional prosecutorial decision   In other words  Mueller presented evidence for the fact that the president may have obstructed justice but didn t go as far as to conclude that he had  He essentially punted to the attorney general s office michael schmidtAnd in this case  by Mueller not reaching a determination  he leaves the door open for Barr to come in to say  O K   Mueller didn t make a determination on this issue of obstruction  He did on collusion  I m going to look at all the facts  And he makes his determination   no case to be made here on both of these issues  The problem  though  is that the perception is that Mueller  the independent investigator who s there to do an inquiry free of politics  has not made a call on this central question  But Barr  the president s appointee  who s been there just for a few months  is making the decision  So the question is  is the fix in  Why is it  if Mueller didn t come to an answer  the attorney general did michael barbaroSo at the beginning of last week  we know that Mueller made the unusual decision not to make a call  And Barr made the unusual decision to make a call  And the question is  why michael schmidtIt s not unusual that Barr made a call  The Justice Department is there to decide whether people broke the law or not  And he was doing that  What s different and unusual here is that Barr and Mueller don t look like they re on the same page  music michael schmidtMueller said  I can t make a determination on this issue  And Barr did  So why is it that they looked at it differently  Why was it that Mueller  the prosecutor here  didn t do the one thing that prosecutors at the Justice Department do  which is make a call nicholas fandosAnd that was the question that we ve spent the last week trying to figure out  What is the difference here  What is the evidence that they re looking at  And why did Mueller and Barr make the decisions that they made around this question of obstruction of justice michael barbaroAnd what have we now learned nicholas fandosWhat we ve now learned is that nobody s happy  The team that was working   or at least some of the team that was working with Bob Mueller feels that Barr stepped in and filled the vacuum in a way that didn t properly capture what their 22 month investigation found  And Barr s team feels that Bob Mueller fell short of doing his job michael barbaroSo let s start with the Barr side  Explain more about why the attorney general and those around him are upset michael schmidtSo in not reaching a decision on obstruction of justice  Barr has to go out on his own and make that determination without the top cover of the independent investigator who went out and was supposed to make a determination on whether the president broke the law michael barbaroAnd what do you mean by  top cover  michael schmidtOne of the reasons you have a special counsel is to insulate an investigation from politics and then  when the investigation is concluded  have a way of holding up the product of the inquiry  the fruits of it  to the public and saying  look  this was done free of politics  We assessed this matter based on the facts  And now you have a result that is exposed  at least in part  to the perception that the president s guy made the decision michael barbaroThe attorney general michael schmidtCorrect nicholas fandosUndercutting one of the key points of Mueller s appointment in the first place michael barbaroAnd you re saying that the people in the Justice Department and that Barr himself are upset to be put in that position michael schmidtWell  the system s not working the way it s supposed to  You had Mueller there for one reason   yea or nay on crimes  And on one of these central questions  he couldn t get there  And by stepping back and saying  I don t know  it allows at least the Democrats to say  what  How was this decision made  How did they get to this  How is it that the president s political appointee was the ultimate decider nicholas fandosAnd it gives them real credence to go and say  we need to see all the evidence  We need to see the whole file here because the president s handpicked man made this decision  Maybe we d reach a different conclusion if we looked at the evidence  Bob Mueller seems to have michael barbaroSo then why did Barr choose to make a call on obstruction of justice if he knew and was upset that this was going to be seen as hyper political and that it would fan the flames of Democrats in Congress nicholas fandosThe problem for Barr was that when he got the report and looked at the evidence  to him  it was a pretty clear case that you would not press this kind of charge  that the president hadn t obstructed justice  Now  you ve got to remember that Barr comes to the job with a pretty expansive view of executive power  As Democrats made famous  he wrote a memo before he was appointed attorney general arguing that certain acts by the president shouldn t be construed as obstruction of justice  They re part of his executive powers  And so he looked at this and  I mean  he can t make the same decision that Mueller did  Somebody has to make a choice about whether or not this is a chargeable offense  And he looked at it and says  well  in our judgment and this team s judgment  it s not michael barbaroSo Barr reads the report and thinks  what are you talking about it s not clear whether or not there was obstruction of justice  There  in his mind  clearly wasn t nicholas fandosBarr does acknowledge that there is evidence  basically  of behavior that could be construed as obstructive  He gives credence to what Mueller is presenting but says  when you add it all up  it doesn t tip into  michael schmidtCriminality nicholas fandos  criminal obstructive territory michael barbaroRight  And while it felt political for Barr to reach a conclusion  to make a call that Mueller wouldn t  I have to think it would have felt even more political in Barr s mind for Congress to be the one to perform that role  And so he was upset to have to make this call  but  it sounds like  felt that he had to michael schmidtI don t know if he s upset as much as he looks at this situation and says  this is not the way it s supposed to be working  Someone needs to make a decision on whether the president broke the law  I ll step in and do that  And I think I can do that based on the facts nicholas fandosAnd Congress can still play a role  I m redacting the report  I ll give it to you with sensitive information blacked out  And then you can make your own judgment  But the public has an intense interest in this  And I ve got to say something  And I decide whether acts broke the law or not  And I don t think this one did michael barbaroDo we know if Mueller s team expected Barr to make this call on obstruction of justice after they declined to do so nicholas fandosWe don t know precisely what the Mueller team expected on this obstruction question  It seems that they were not clear in communicating to the Justice Department what they wanted  It may not have mattered anyway  But what we do know is that after Barr came out with this four page summary  which essentially exonerated the president on collusion and said he did not break the law on obstruction  some members of Mr  Mueller s team felt that he had inadequately and only partially represented the work of their 22 month investigation michael barbaroSo this is the other side of your reporting   that not only was the Barr side disappointed with the Mueller side  the Mueller side was disappointed with the Barr side nicholas fandosWhat we have learned is that since Barr made his public statement about a week ago  members of the Mueller team have told associates that they feel  essentially  that his work   if it wasn t misrepresentative of theirs   didn t give the full picture  which they believe is more damaging to the president than the attorney general s letter lets on  Now  we are not saying that every member of the Mueller team is frustrated by this  We don t know what Bob Mueller himself thinks  He remains one of the black boxes at the center of this investigation  But there are members of the team who were involved in the decision making around these issues that we ve been talking about who have watched and been disappointed and angry about how it s being characterized michael barbaroAnd what is the focus of their disappointment  to the degree you understand it nicholas fandosSo when they read Bill Barr s concise four page letter  they were frustrated that he had not drawn more from their own work  And in fact  what we discovered in reporting this piece out is that they had prepared summaries of their own work that were part of the report that they handed over to the Justice Department a couple of weeks ago and felt that some of that material could have easily been drawn into what Mr  Barr handed over  So not that he shouldn t have made a decision about whether the president obstructed justice or not in a criminal sense  but that concurrent with that  he should have put out more of their evidence or analysis to fill out the public picture  The Justice Department says those summaries had sensitive information in them  classified information  secretive grand jury information that couldn t become public  and ultimately didn t use any of it michael schmidtSo what Mueller s folks are essentially saying is  hey  we wrote these summaries  If you were going to go out and say something about this investigation  and you were going to do something as extreme or as declarative as clearing the president  why is it that you didn t include some of the things that we found michael barbaroAnd specifically  why didn t you include some stuff that we found that was pretty damning  You re making it seem like the president didn t do anything wrong michael schmidtDonald Trump has come out in the days after Barr s declaration and said the Mueller report was beautiful  And it completely exonerates him  If you re an investigator who spent the last two years looking at Donald Trump  and you think there s a lot of questionable behavior there  that is something that is going to irritate you mightily michael barbaroI mean  do either of you think that the Mueller people have a legitimate point here  Or is this a classic case of pride of authorship  They wanted to see their work in the public summary nicholas fandosI don t think that we fully know  What seems clear in our reporting is that there was no specific communication or agreement by the Mueller team to the Barr team   you should use these things  or we want these things to be out  They seem to have had an intention  And they certainly now have a regret about it  But we don t know what interaction there was in the actual decision making process that happened that weekend two weeks ago michael barbaroWell  so why do we think that Barr chose not to include more of what was in these summaries  especially the negative material  in his four page summary michael schmidtI think there s one big  broad reason and another contemporary reason  the broad reason being that Barr and many Justice Department officials and  for many years  prosecutors believe that if they decide not to charge someone  the fruits of the investigation should not be just thrown out there for the public or for the enemies of the person who were investigated michael barbaroDirty laundry should not be aired if the subject of those dirty laundry are not charged with a crime michael schmidtIf you cannot meet this incredibly high bar of bringing a federal prosecution  that doesn t mean you then get to just take the trash and just throw it out in the street and let the public rummage through it michael barbaroAnd Mike  by the contemporary example you referred to  I m assuming you re talking about James Comey michael schmidtI m talking about the July 2016 press conference that James Comey held  It s right in the heat of the presidential election  He stands up and says  we  the F B I   have done this investigation into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email account  We don t think there is a case to be made here  But we found some very questionable behavior in how she handled sensitive national security secrets  The press conference was seen as very damaging to Clinton even though a case was never made michael barbaroAnd so you re saying that Barr s view would be  I m not going to be the one to replicate that by drawing from these Mueller team summaries and putting those out into the public sphere michael schmidtCorrect  We don t use criminal investigations to go out and find damaging things that may not be crimes that we then simply release to the public to be used against someone nicholas fandosThe problem is  this was never a normal or average criminal investigation  It has broad national security implications  And it has implications for almost every decision that s made at the highest levels of the government michael schmidtThis is more about a pathway of how you deal with the president s conduct  And what it appears from the Mueller side is that they re saying  look  this is the president of the United States  There s some conduct here that we think the public and Congress should see  And O K   Justice Department  it may not be criminal  But this is the president  And this needs to be examined more thoroughly by the political process and by Congress  It s about a pathway of dealing with the president nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr doesn t seem to disagree with that  fundamentally  He said throughout that he wants to make as much of this report public as possible  But he doesn t think that that absolves him of the Justice Department s role of saying whether or not the president or his campaign broke the law  And so he s grappling with the Justice Department s aversion to talk about individuals that it s not saying broke the law  But yet he knows that the public and the Congress want and probably are owed more information about what did happen  And so he s kind of operating somewhere in the middle of those two things michael schmidtThe difference here is that if I was under investigation  and the Justice Department determined that I didn t break the law  then there s no other process that really needs to be dealt with me  Maybe my company needs to decide whether I get fired or not for that conduct  In this instance  there s another issue with the president  O K   the president didn t break the law  But maybe the president did things with his power that the public should know about  Congress should know about  and need to be more closely examined  Because maybe it s not just about breaking the law  It s about how he conducted himself as president  And does Congress need to deal with that  And what we are starting to see from Mueller s side is this frustration that  hey  we think there s some bad stuff that happened here  But by Barr coming out and not disclosing that but saying the president didn t break the law  he is casting the die on how the public will later look at the president s conduct  It will say that for several weeks after we finished our report  the only thing that was out there was Bill Barr saying the president didn t break the law  and the president turning around and saying  I was fully exonerated  And they re saying  hey  America  we think more of this process needs to play out michael barbaroRight michael schmidtSo this all comes down to the vexing question of  how do we investigate a sitting president  And how is that done in a way that the public has the utmost confidence in that  And in that is this tension between how much independence the investigator should have  In Nixon  that pendulum swung too far in the president s direction  In the Starr investigation of Clinton  it went the other way  The investigator had too much power  And here  between Mueller and Barr s teams  they are fighting that same fight and have different understandings of how this should all be dealt with  And it s the same issue that we ve been looking at for 50 years  just the latest episode of it michael barbaroSo inside of one presidential investigation  these two teams are embodying all the tensions that have basically been present since Watergate nicholas fandosCorrect michael schmidtIt s how much you can tell the public  and how is apparent misconduct by the president dealt with  And there s no clear pathway on that  So whatever Barr does will be viewed by one side as political and laying on the brakes for the president  Whatever Mueller does will be viewed by the president s enemies as trying to get him  And the confidence in that process then erodes  And it s messy  And it s hard to figure out  What are the real facts here  What really happened michael barbaroBut at this point  we re just talking about the summary that Bill Barr sent to Congress  We re still waiting on the full report  So won t this tension that you re describing eventually be more or less resolved when we learn how much information we ll ultimately have access to nicholas fandosIt may be  And we may see a very different set of facts at the end of the day  But I think the question here is about who sets the narrative for the intervening period of time  It may end up being a month before we see a fuller version of the Mueller report  And for that time  Bill Barr s conclusion that the president didn t break the law is going to be the dominant narrative  And I think that what we re hearing from members of the Mueller team is a concern that by the time their fuller work does come out  the narrative is baked   so much so that even if it shows  for instance  that the president didn t break the law but abused his office or conducted acts that Congress will deem inappropriate for his office  that there s not room to have a full debate around that  that the conclusions about the work that they did for 22 months will have been prejudged at that point  and that it won t quite matter what the report says for the president s political fate michael barbaroNick  Mike  thank you very much nicholas fandosThank you guys michael schmidtThanks for having us archived recording  jerry nadler The committee has a job to do  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct michael barbaroOn Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the use of subpoenas to obtain a full copy of the Mueller report archived recording  jerry nadler That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence michael barbaroThe committee s chairman  Democratic representative Jerry Nadler of New York  said he would not immediately issue a subpoena  But his power to do so will intensify pressure on the attorney general  William Barr  to quickly release an unredacted copy of the report archived recording  jerry nadler I will give him time to change his mind  But if we cannot reach an accommodation  then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials michael barbaroWe ll be right back  music michael barbaroHere s what else you need to know today  A Times analysis of deadly terror attacks involving white extremists has found that at least a third of them were inspired by fellow white men who carried out similar attacks and had either professed admiration for them or interest in their tactics  In one case  a school shooter in New Mexico corresponded with a gunman who attacked a mall in Munich  All together  the two men killed 11 people  The connections between the killers crossed continents and highlight how the internet and social media have spread white extremism  And  archived recording  joe biden I ve always

 quite frankly   life  for that matter   is about connecting michael barbaroThat s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow However  the special counsel s office never asked Mr  Barr to release the summaries soon after he received the report  a person familiar with the investigation said  And the Justice Department quickly determined that the summaries contain sensitive information  like classified material  secret grand jury testimony and information related to current federal investigations that must remain confidential  according to two government officials The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III Mr  Barr was also wary of departing from Justice Department practice not to disclose derogatory details in closing an investigation  according to two government officials familiar with Mr  Barr s thinking  They pointed to the decision by James B  Comey  the former F B I  director  to harshly criticize Hillary Clinton in 2016 while announcing that he was recommending no charges in the inquiry into her email practices The officials and others interviewed declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Mr  Barr explained  although the report is believed to examine Mr  Trump s efforts to thwart the investigation  It was unclear how much discussion Mr  Mueller and his investigators had with senior Justice Department officials about how their findings would be made public  It was also unclear how widespread the vexation is among the special counsel team  which included 19 lawyers  about 40 F B I  agents and other personnel At the same time  Mr  Barr and his advisers have expressed their own frustrations about Mr  Mueller and his team  Mr  Barr and other Justice Department officials believe the special counsel s investigators fell short of their task by declining to decide whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed the inquiry  according to the two government officials  After Mr  Mueller made no judgment on the obstruction matter  Mr  Barr stepped in to declare that he himself had cleared Mr  Trump of wrongdoing Representatives for the Justice Department and the special counsel declined to comment on Wednesday on views inside both Mr  Mueller s office and the Justice Department  They pointed to departmental regulations requiring Mr  Mueller to file a confidential report to the attorney general detailing prosecution decisions and to Mr  Barr s separate vow to send a redacted version of that report to Congress  Under the regulations  Mr  Barr can publicly release as much of the document as he deems appropriate Read Attorney General William Barr s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter  by Attorney General William P  Barr  details the main findings of the special counsel s two year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election A debate over how the special counsel s conclusions are represented has played out in public as well as in recent weeks  with Democrats in Congress accusing Mr  Barr of intervening to color the outcome of the investigation in the president s favor In his letter to Congress outlining the report s chief conclusions  Mr  Barr said that Mr  Mueller found no conspiracy between Mr  Trump s campaign and Russia s 2016 election interference  While Mr  Mueller made no decision on his other main question  whether the president illegally obstructed the inquiry  he explicitly stopped short of exonerating Mr  Trump Mr  Mueller s decision to skip a prosecutorial judgment  leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime   Mr  Barr wrote  He and his deputy  Rod J  Rosenstein  decided that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that Mr  Trump had committed an obstruction offense Mr  Barr has come under criticism for sharing so little  But according to officials familiar with the attorney general s thinking  he and his aides limited the details they revealed because they were worried about wading into political territory  Mr  Barr and his advisers expressed concern that if they included derogatory information about Mr  Trump while clearing him  they would face a storm of criticism like what Mr  Comey endured in the Clinton investigation VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S  Mueller III s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started CreditCreditDoug Mills The New York TimesLegal experts attacked Mr  Comey at the time for violating Justice Department practice to keep confidential any negative information about anyone uncovered during investigations  The practice exists to keep from unfairly sullying people s reputations without giving them a chance to respond in court Mr  Rosenstein cited the handling of the Clinton case in a memo the White House used to rationalize Mr  Trump s firing of Mr  Comey Though it was not clear what findings the special counsel s investigators viewed as troubling for the president  Mr  Barr has suggested that Mr  Mueller may have found evidence of malfeasance in investigating possible obstruction of justice   The report sets out evidence on both sides of the question   Mr  Barr wrote in his March 24 letter Mr  Mueller examined Mr  Trump s attempts to maintain control over the investigation  including his firing of Mr  Comey and his attempt to oust Mr  Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to install a loyalist to oversee the inquiry Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation The fallout from Mr  Barr s letter outlining the Russia investigation s main findings overshadowed his intent to make public as much of the entire report as possible  a goal he has stressed since his confirmation hearing in January  He reiterated to lawmakers on Friday that he wanted both Congress and the public to read the report and said that the department would by mid April furnish a version with sensitive material blacked out  He offered to testify on Capitol Hill soon after turning over the report Mr  Barr  who took office in February  has shown flashes of frustration over how the unveiling of the investigation s findings has unfolded  In his follow up letter to lawmakers on Friday  he chafed at how the news media and some lawmakers had characterized his March 24 letter Mr  Barr and Mr  Mueller have been friends for 30 years  and Mr  Barr said during his confirmation hearing in January that he trusted Mr  Mueller to conduct an impartial investigation  He said he told Mr  Trump that Mr  Mueller was a  straight shooter who should be dealt with as such   Mr  Mueller served as the head of the Justice Department s criminal division when Mr  Barr was attorney general under George Bush  and their families are friends Mr  Barr s promises of transparency have done little to appease Democrats who control the House  The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to let its chairman use a subpoena to try to compel Mr  Barr to hand over a full copy of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence to Congress  The chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York  has not said when he will use the subpoena  but made clear on Wednesday that he did not trust Mr  Barr s characterization of what Mr  Mueller s team found  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct   Mr  Nadler said   That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence  Republicans  who have embraced Mr  Barr s letter clearing Mr  Trump  have accused the Democrats of trying to prolong the cloud over his presidency and urged them to move on Mr  Trump has fully embraced Mr  Barr s version of events  For days  he has pronounced the outcome of the investigation a  complete and total exoneration  and called for the Justice Department and his allies on Capitol Hill to investigate and hold accountable those responsible for opening the inquiry  

A 32 year old woman from China carrying four cellphones and a thumb drive infected with malware gained access to Mar a Lago during President Trump s visit to the Florida resort over the weekend  federal court records show The woman  identified as Yujing Zhang  had arrived at the Palm Beach resort and showed two Chinese passports when she sought to be admitted  saying she wanted to use the pool She was allowed to enter by Secret Service agents stationed outside the resort after the Mar a Lago security manager on duty verified that her last name matched the surname of a member of the club  according to a complaint filed in Federal District Court in South Florida When asked if she was the member s daughter   she did not give a definitive answer   the complaint said  It said she was permitted to enter and was escorted to the front desk in a valet driven golf cart Once inside  according to the account filed with the court  the woman said she was there to attend a United Nations Chinese American Association event later in the evening  But no such event existed  according to the complaint  so the club receptionist alerted the Secret Service  Though she had initially said she had come to use the pool  she was not carrying a swimsuit  the complaint said Ms  Zhang told the agent who questioned her on site that she was there for a  United Nations friendship event  and had arrived early to see the pool and take photos  She showed the agent an invitation to the supposed event   but it was in Chinese and no one present could read it At that point  the Secret Service agent escorted her off the property  The agent continued to question her  and when the agent suggested that she had unlawfully gained access to the club  she became  verbally aggressive  and was detained  the complaint states  From there  she was taken to the Secret Service s office in West Palm Beach During the second interview  Ms  Zhang told the authorities that a Chinese friend named Charles had told her to travel from Shanghai to Palm Beach in order to attend the United Nations friendship event and said that she should try to speak with a member of the president s family about Chinese and American foreign economic relations The agents were unable to learn more about Charles  as Ms  Zhang told them that she had only spoken to him via the Chinese instant messaging app WeChat When the authorities searched her belongings  they found that she was carrying four cellphones  a hard drive  a laptop and a thumb drive that was found to be infected with malware She was arrested at that point and charged with lying to a federal agent and gaining access to a restricted area At the time of the incident shortly after noon on Saturday  Mr  Trump was off site  at the nearby Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach  He did not return to the resort until 4 p m The Secret Service said in a statement that determining who gets access to Mar a Lago is up to the resort s management  entering the resort does not permit access to areas used by the president  which require additional security screening  it said It said agents do conduct a physical screening to make sure no prohibited items enter the property  and did so in the case of Ms  Zhang  After undergoing screening at the second Secret Service checkpoint the individual  per club protocol  was immediately met by club reception   the statement said   The Mar a Lago reception staff then determined that the individual should not have been authorized access by their staff and Secret Service agents took immediate action resulting in the arrest of the individual  Ms  Zhang s lawyer  a federal public defender  did not respond to a request for comment  nor did the management at Mar a Lago Access to Mr  Trump by Chinese nationals became an issue last month  when news media reports surfaced showing that a Chinese American woman in Florida who once owned a chain of Asian massage parlors that had been investigated for prostitution had attended a number of events there  and had been photographed there with the president and other officials The woman  Cindy Yang  collected contributions directed toward Mr  Trump s campaign from her friends  family and employees  and had a website on which she advertised that she could provide access to the Trump administration Ms  Yang had advertised an event for March 30   the day of Ms  Zhang s arrest   called the  International Leaders Elite Forum   described as a  once in a lifetime opportunity  and the first event at Mar a Lago with  the Chinese as the protagonist   The Miami Herald reported  The event was later canceled  Ms  Yang worked with an event promoter named Charles Lee  who runs a group called the United Nations Chinese Friendship Association  which is similar to the name of the event that Ms  Zhang cited  the newspaper reported The criminal complaint filed Monday did not draw any connection between Ms  Zhang and Ms  Yang or any of the Chinese American events scheduled over the weekend Elaborate security measures are set up around Mr  Trump s exclusive  members only club  which he frequently visits on weekends away from Washington  When the president is in town  roadblocks are set up in the street leading up to the resort and uniformed Secret Service agents typically establish a large security screening area across the street  with a large sign notifying visitors that they are entering a restricted area Mar a Lago club members are allowed past the initial screening checkpoint and inside the protective perimeter Security breaches surrounding American presidents have been a major issue in recent years There have been several cases of intruders scaling the White House fence and entering the grounds  In one episode in 2014  a man carrying a knife  Omar J  Gonzalez  managed to overpower a Secret Service agent inside the North Portico entrance and run through the ceremonial East Room before he was tackled Weeks after Mr  Trump took office  another man was able to elude multiple layers of security before being stopped near the entrance at the South Portico  In that case  Jonathan Tuan Anh Tran  who was carrying a backpack  jumped over a fence and came within several steps of the White House while the president was inside the residence In perhaps the most notable example  in 2009  a Virginia couple sneaked into a White House state dinner and shook hands with President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama as they stood in the receiving line  Known later as the  State Dinner crashers   the intrusion by Michaele and Tareq Salahi prompted an internal Secret Service investigation and demands for a congressional inquiry Security agents on several occasions in the past have had to turn away people who tried to enter the Mar a Lago resort  some with the apparent intention of approaching the president In several cases  according to The South Florida Sun Sentinel  which reviewed police incident reports  members of the public arrived and told security agents that they had arranged meetings with Mr  Trump A 27 year old Ohio man flew in to Palm Beach International Airport and was flagged to Secret Service agents in April 2018 after he told people he was planning to smoke marijuana with the president  a 32 year old Georgia man wearing military style fatigues told local sheriff s deputies in February of that year that he had an important message  about the war  to deliver to Mr  Trump Don Mihalek  executive vice president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association  which represents the Secret Service  said the episode showed how much the Secret Service relied on the security at Mar a Lago He said the fact that Secret Service agents apparently relied on the determination by a Mar a Lago security agent that Ms  Zhang was related to a member of the club   simply because she shared the member s last name   was problematic  It s a hard position for Secret Service to be in to potentially deny a million dollar committee member   Mr  Mihalek said   It puts Secret Service in a very difficult position because we don t know who are members and who aren t   You re depending on them to say this is an employee and this isn t an employee  We work off a list of names   he said   Our priority is  are you coming in with explosives or not  Ms  Zhang  who court records say was born in 1986  appeared in court in Palm Beach on Monday  and a bond hearing was scheduled for next week  court records show  

Gail Collins  Happy April  Bret  Since we re past Fools  Day  I will avoid any wisecracks about Donald Trump Where are you on the Mueller report  Ready to consign it to the dustbin of history  Demanding to see the full document  I have to admit I m sort of ready to give up and move on  Although you could definitely talk me back into the fold Bret Stephens  Four thoughts  Gail First  Thank God the president of the United States  whatever else we may think of him  did not collude with Russia to get himself elected  I d rather have a scoundrel in the White House than a traitor Gail  You re setting the bar pretty low there  but you re still right Bret  Second  Thank God we have a report at all   which  considering the vindication it brings Trump  and the vindictiveness it brings out of him    would not have happened if the Trumpists had gotten their way and Mueller had been fired  All of those conservatives who impugned Mueller s integrity and his team s impartiality owe them a giant apology Gail  Not holding my breath waiting  Go on Bret  Third  Thank God for Mueller himself  He didn t pontificate on the Sunday talk shows the way Jim Comey or Adam Schiff did  He didn t pull any punches when it came to prosecuting the likes of Paul Manafort  He ran a tight ship  He demonstrated that even in Washington there is no substitute for character  professionalism and reputation  That s why I suspect that when the full document is released  we ll be able to treat it as the last word on the subject Finally  The news media  especially cable news  needs to do some major soul searching  Too many reporters and pundits got way out ahead of their skis  creating a collusion narrative out of a series of unconnected dots  When historians examine why public confidence in journalism fell to such lows in our era  episodes like Russiagate will be a major part of the story Gail  You didn t have to believe Trump was actively engaged in a conspiracy to point out a whole lot of unnerving stuff going on  For instance  there s still a terrible potential for Russian sabotage via internet that this administration isn t taking seriously Bret  For sure  There was a lot of smoke  There were plenty of dots  The investigation was warranted  The president repeatedly behaved in ways that suggested guilt  from lying about his business ties to Russia to seizing his translator s notes after a conversation with Vladimir Putin to his cavalier attitude about Russia s intentions The media was right to report all this and raise questions  But there was also a lack of skepticism about some of the evidence  and a tone of certitude about where that evidence was bound to lead Gail  I ll give you the whole impeachment thing  That was perhaps over the top  But we re still waiting to hear the results of investigations into Trump   mainly his business practices   that are still going on here in New York Bret  I agree in the sense that I think his behavior as  Individual No  1  in the payoffs to former paramours are felony violations of campaign finance laws  But I m also becoming increasingly convinced that the endless investigations into Trump s past business practices are going to wind up doing more harm to Trump s opponents than they do to him  It makes him look like the victim of an endless inquest into his pre presidential behavior  And it distracts Democrats from talking about the things that Americans actually want from politicians  like better schools and a growing economy Gail  Glad you brought that up  I m way more interested in the attack on Obamacare than his unappetizing history in real estate What s your opinion on where to go with health care  I will start by acknowledging Obamacare is sort of a mess  It began as a mess because certain senators  cough  mutter  Joe Lieberman  were too deeply in the thrall of the insurance companies to let a sane restructuring occur Bret  Music to my ears  Gail  Obamacare is a mess  even if most Americans have learned to live with it  as we do with other messes   If it weren t a mess  Democrats wouldn t keep talking about  Medicare for all  as the next evolution in health care policy I think that s a huge mistake  both as a matter of policy and politics  It requires another major reorganization of a huge part of the U S  economy  Take Bernie Sanders s plan  for example  It s going to cost a bundle   an estimated  32 6 trillion over 10 years   and the taxes to fund it will have to come from middle class Americans  It will mean a declining quality of health care  And it will lead to a two tier system in which wealthy Americans go  off grid  to get high quality medical attention while the rest of the country is stuck in a system that will resemble the V A Trump will also be merciless about this  politically  claiming that this is just the sort of socialism he warned about in his State of the Union speech  And it will frighten a great many voters  including those all important suburban women  who might despise the president for all kinds of reasons but fear the Democrats are veering toward the Bernie Sanders left Gail  All the Democratic presidential candidates are not talking about Medicare for all  Some of the ones who did are trying to backpedal  not really having thought about what it meant before they went there  Three fifths of the adult population from 19 to 64 get their health insurance from employers  and a lot of them like it  They re going to get very nervous if they think they might have to give it up But we need sweeping change  Our current health care system is wildly expensive because it s structured in a crazy way that creates piles and piles of stupendously expensive paperwork  We could create a government run public policy option that would give people the security of Obamacare without the crazy structure  And gradually  if the option was attractive enough  employers might want to get in on it  too Bret  I definitely agree about the paperwork problem  My own views about health care are pretty libertarian  We need radical price transparency so that people are aware of the huge disparities in price between say  a blood test from Clinic A versus Clinic B  We need tort reform so that doctors don t live in mortal fear of being sued by patients  We need more than just gold  silver and bronze insurance options  Healthy young people should also be able to buy cut rate plans that cover only catastrophes  As for Medicare  the long term goal should be to get rid of it  That s obviously distinct from Medicaid  Even crazy right wingers like me believe that government has a moral duty to ensure that poor people have good access to quality medical care from womb to tomb Gail  Doctors do have to pay heavy insurance premiums to protect themselves from lawsuits  But patients also have to be protected from careless or inept physicians  It s tough to find a perfect solution   people have been trying for years  But fine by me if you want to work on it  Bret  I ll be cheering from the galleries Bret  The deeper problem with all of these health care debates is that we re discussing something that inevitably generates bad outcomes even under the best of circumstances  But can we switch subjects from tragedy to farce  I m curious to know your take on the Jussie Smollett story  which is what everyone I know was talking about last week  when they weren t talking about Mueller  Gail  You do have to thank the guy for taking Donald Trump off our minds  Not every day do you have a TV star making up a story of being attacked by MAGA hat wearing racist thugs  Everybody was stunned when the prosecutor dropped all the charges  She basically said  well  this is what we always do with first offenders who don t pose a threat to the community Not sure that would be true of first offenders whose self promoting lies and evasions cost the city six figures in overtime  But it s a good reminder that we have different criminal justice systems for the poor and the nonpoor Bret  I would not have minded if Smollett had gotten off relatively lightly   provided  that is  that he had admitted the charges  shown contrition and begged forgiveness  It s the arrogance and gall that bothers me  Kim Foxx  the Chicago prosecutor  says her office would have had a hard time securing a conviction  Was Smollett s check to the perpetrators and their confession of the crime not enough  The whole thing reeks of a corrupt bargain  and I hope the Department of Justice gets involved  Even Chicago can t afford Chicago style politics By the way  I don t want us to wrap up the conversation without complimenting you on your marvelous column about statues  specifically their scandalous dearth when it comes to honoring women  I m thrilled Billie Holiday will be getting one soon  in Queens  There are many more worthy would be honorees that I can think of  Gerty Cori was the first American woman to win a Nobel in science  Zora Neale Hurston ought to have one  too  if she doesn t already  And Dorothy Parker  provided the statue itself had a ribald sense of humor Who else should we be honoring Gail  Thanks  Bret  Right now  only five of the 150 public statues in New York are of women   we ve got dozens of ethically compromised politicians and run of the mill generals but we re only now working on Susan B  Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton Once we ve gotten the public figures taken care of  it d be nice to celebrate some low profile heroines  I was just reading about Esther Lewis  a widow who had a farm in Pennsylvania in the pre Civil War era  She ran a stop on the Underground Railroad that sheltered runaway slaves  discovered iron ore on her property and created a serious mining operation  educated her four daughters and churned nearly 300 pounds of butter a year  There s somebody I d like to see standing in a town square The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor

The future success of the Democratic Party depends on the crucial   but unsettled   allegiance of the nation s growing Hispanic electorate Fernand Amandi  a Democratic pollster and podcast host based in Miami  addressed the party s Latino quandary in a December interview with The Associated Press The question is not are Democrats winning the Hispanic vote   it s why aren t Democrats winning the Hispanic vote 80 20 or 90 10 the way they are winning black voters In an interview earlier this week  Amandi told me that Democrats  want and hope for this magical osmosis to happen but that s not how politics works  In the 2018 midterms  Democrats showed gains among Hispanic voters in most states  compared with 2014  Party operatives are concerned  however  about the slow rate of growth of these improved Democratic margins  They are equally worried about turnout   at a time when many thought that President Trump s rhetoric and policies would produce impressive gains among Latino voters for the Democratic Party Take turnout  Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic constituencies in the United States  but their level of political participation is not keeping pace with their overall population numbers As the accompanying Pew chart demonstrates  the number of Hispanic voters in midterm elections has grown steadily  from 2 9 million in 1986 to 6 8 million in 2014  At the

  02           06           10           14         By The New York Times   Source  Pew Research CenterIn 1986  the Latino turnout rate was 38 7 percent  in 2014  that rate fell to 27 1 percent  If the 2014 turnout rate had been as high as it was in 1986  Hispanics would have cast 9 7 million ballots instead of 6 8 million   Complete numbers for 2018 are still being compiled  In a preliminary analysis of Hispanic voter turnout last year  Catalist  a Democratic firm that builds voter lists  found significant increases in turnout of three to five percent  comparing 2018 with the 2014 midterms  Texas  Nevada and California saw five percent increases  Florida four percent  New Mexico and New York three percent Turnout rates and levels of support are two key  but quite different  political measures  While Latinos had a turnout rate of 27 1 percent in 2014  their support for Democratic House candidates that year was 62 percent  Their support for Republican House candidates was 36 percent  according to exit polls While Democratic support among Hispanics has improved over the past decade  from the low 60s to the high 60s  there is evidence suggesting that those gains cannot be relied upon in future elections In the midterm elections  Florida became the prime example of such unreliability  as Republicans demonstrated they could buck state and national trends to make substantial gains among Hispanics Republicans won two close statewide races in Florida in 2018  one for senate and one for governor   despite the gradual erosion of Republican support among Cuban Americans in the state and despite the continuing influx of pro Democratic Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017 Simon Rosenberg  president of NDN  formerly the New Democrat Network  a pro Democratic think tank  wrote   In All Important Florida  Democrats Lose Ground With Hispanic Voters  a month after the 2018 election In an election where Democrats had one of their best years ever with Hispanic voters across the country  Florida Democrats saw their Hispanic numbers decline  Nationally  Democrats went from 62 36  26 pts  in 2014 to 69 29  40 pts  this election  In Florida  Democrats went from 58 38  20 pts  in 2014 to 54 44  10 pts  this year As Rosenberg pointed out  this shift occurred despite the fact that Trump did everything possible to alienate Latinos  along with undercutting Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis  the winning Republican candidates for Senate and governor Rosenberg noted that Trump hadrelentlessly attacked immigrants and Hispanics in particular  He grossly mismanaged the aftermath of Hurricane Maria  sending hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans fleeing to Central Florida  He revoked the temporary status of many immigrants in Florida  Given all this  one would have imagined the environment for Democrats to make gains among Hispanics was present in Florida this year  gains which were made elsewhere  Yet we fell back By all accounts  Scott and DeSantis campaigned almost daily in Hispanic precincts  while their Democratic opponents  Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum  took the Hispanic vote for granted  We had no infrastructure   Christian Ulvert  Gillum s director for Spanish language media  told Politico And honestly  Democrats have been playing catch up on Hispanic outreach for two decades  because Republicans have invested in it  You can t close that gap overnight Politico described Nelson s bid for a fourth term as  a uniquely lazy campaign that made laughably ineffectual attempts to engage with Hispanics  Melissa Michelson  a political scientist at Menlo College in California and president of the Latino caucus of the American Political Science Association  described in an email the changing political orientation of Florida s Cuban Americans In a 1989 90 survey  Michelson wrote  68 8 percent of Cuban Americans identified with Republicans  Since then there have been significant changes  Over the years  she continued  Pew has documented a steady decline in Cuban Americans  Republican identification  from 64 percent in 2002 to 56 percent in 2006 to 47 percent in 2013 Despite the decline in Republican support among Cuban Americans  Michelson emphasized thatThere has always been a contingent of Latinos who identify as Republican and are more interested in Republican conservative  or anti Communist  policies than in immigration issues or racism  Recall that 40 percent of Latinos voted for Bush in 2004  Reagan also enjoyed considerable Latino support  I think many Democrats are continually perplexed by this   that there could be Latino voters who are willing to support a president  or candidate  like Trump whose rhetoric and policies are so clearly anti Latino and racist While Scott and DeSantis revived Cuban American willingness to support Republicans  two of the three Florida House seats that had been represented by Cuban American Republicans switched parties in 2018 Revealing a contrast to Florida  Matt A  Barreto  a political scientist at U C L A  and a co founder of Latino Decisions  analyzed turnout and voting patterns in Texas  In a March report  Barreto described a huge pro Democratic turnout increase there  ranging from 105 to 125 percent in eight counties where Hispanics make up more than 90 percent of the population  There were significant gains in counties with white majorities of 83 to 91 percent too  but these upturns were smaller  in the 35 to 55 percent range The ability of two conservative Florida Republicans to make such inroads simply by campaigning diligently suggests that the Democratic hold on Latinos is less firm than many believed So where do Latinos stand politically The NBC News Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 918 Hispanics during 2018 and found that Trump s job approval rating was a relatively dismal 30 percent  21 points below his 51 percent favorability rating among whites  but 18 points higher than his 12 percent approval rate among African Americans The data  provided to The Times by Public Opinion Strategies  one of the two firms that conducted the survey  found that Trump s approval among Hispanics was highest among men and among the affluent   40 percent for both   and among men without college degrees  at 39 percent A 2018 Pew report   Key takeaways about Latino voters in the 2018 midterm elections   found that Hispanics cast a decisive majority of votes for Democratic congressional candidates  69 29   a smaller percentage of votes  however  than African Americans  90 9  and Asian Americans  77 23   Whites backed Republicans  54 to 44 In a state by state breakdown  Pew found that in the Texas Senate race  Latinos backed Democrat Beto O Rourke over Ted Cruz by nearly two to one  64 35  while Greg Abbott  the incumbent Republican governor  lost the Hispanic vote to Democratic challenger Lupe Valdez  53 42 In Florida  Democrats Gillum and Nelson won the Hispanic vote by nearly equal percentages  54 44 and 54 45    but in both cases by margins that were inadequate to produce overall victory The Democratic winner in the Nevada Senate race  Jacky Rosen  did far better among Hispanics  who backed her over Dean Heller  the Republican incumbent  67 30 While many Democrats expected Trump s anti immigrant rhetoric and policies  especially the family separation debacle  to produce a decisive shift to the left among Hispanics  that has not proved to be the case An October 2018 Pew report found that almosthalf of Latinos  48 percent  believe there is about the right amount of immigrants living in the U S   while a quarter say there are too many immigrants and 14 percent say there are too few  Three quarters of Hispanics opposed Trump s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border  while one in five favors construction In an email  Barreto  of Latino Decisions  argued that Democratic support among Hispanics remains solid I do not see anything since November 2018 to suggest Dems are losing any support at all  Trump continues on the same path of bashing immigrants and bashing Latinos without evidence and this only further decreases his favorability among Latinos Asked about the declining share of eligible Hispanics turning out on Election Day  Barreto countered that the growing numbers of eligible Latinos arealmost entirely driven by U S  born young Latinos turning 18 and entering the eligible voter pool In a common pattern  Barreto pointed out   young people have very low rates of voter registration and voter turnout   especially in midterm elections  Because of that  Barreto said that in order to get a better picture  the data should be age adjusted so that turnout levels of older voters of different races and ethnicities could be compared Barreto is also sharply critical of most polling of Hispanics and of exit polls in particular  arguing that the lack of Spanish speaking interviewers results in an undercount of Hispanic turnout as well as inaccurate estimates of Republican and Democratic votes In addition  candidates and political parties have to make a much stronger case to young Hispanics that their vote matters  according to Barreto Otherwise  you will only get incremental growth each year   which still puts Latinos as a larger and larger share of the electorate  but perhaps not as large as we could be Rosenberg  of NDN  argues that the Democratic Party did not start targeting the Hispanic electorate  with modern campaign tactics and communications  until the 2006 8 period  Those efforts immediately bore fruit  Rosenberg contended in an email Remember that in 2004 Bush won Arizona  Colorado  New Mexico and Nevada  Now Colorado and New Mexico are no longer really competitive at the presidential level  Nevada is slipping away from the Republicans  and Democrats elected a Senator in 2018 in Arizona Texas  according to Rosenberg   is about to hit a tipping point   in large part because of the Hispanic vote What conclusions and what questions remain in the wake of these complex and sometimes conflicting trends in the Hispanic electorate First and foremost  Latinos remain a decisively Democratic constituency  with important caveats Brian Schaffner  a political scientist at Tufts and co principal researcher at the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  wrote in an email that nationally  Hispanic support for Democrats has been relatively consistent Schaffner provided the accompanying graph  which shows the level of voting for Democrats in House contests in the six elections from 2008 to 2018 for whites  blacks  Asian Americans and Hispanics  The Hispanic Democratic vote shows a significant 8 6 point increase from 2014 to 2016 and a 13 6 point increase from 2014 to 2018   call it the Trump jump   although the increase in the percentage of Asian Americans voting for Democrats was even larger at 20 2 points Who Votes for DemocratsOf votes for the two major party candidates in House races  the share that went

Source  analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election Study by Brian Schaffner  Tufts UniversityLatinos  partisan loyalties are much less hard and fast than  say  those of either African Americans or white evangelicals  The results in Florida demonstrate that Democrats risk defeat if they fail to campaign heavily in Hispanic communities  and Republicans stand to gain at the margins if they are prepared to invest time  money and energy The major question mark going into 2020  assuming Trump is the Republican nominee  is whether Hispanic opposition to his presidency will prevent a recurrence of the Florida 2018 phenomenon  Will Trump s presence so nationalize the election that down ballot Republicans will face a brick wall when they try to make modest inroads among Hispanics To date  Trump has shown every intention of turning the election into a referendum on himself  and all the baggage he carries  with no regard for the political survival of fellow Republicans  If anything  he appears determined to drive up hostility to him among Latinos  For the past two days  for example  the president has ranted on Twitter  attacking Puerto Rico and its political leaders On Monday  he told his Twitter followers Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works On Tuesday  he was still at it All their local politicians do is complain   ask for more money  The pols are grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA Behaving this way  Trump may succeed in driving up support among  his people   as he likes to call his voters  But if he keeps it up  he will be doing both his Democratic opponent and the Democratic Party as a whole a huge favor as far as the Latino vote goes The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena that Democrats can use to try to force the Justice Department to hand over an unredacted copy of the special counsel s report and underlying evidence The move on Monday by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  the committee s chairman  made clear that Democrats are not satisfied with Attorney General William P  Barr s assurances on Friday that he will produce a full  albeit redacted  copy of the nearly 400 page report to Congress by mid April  As I have made clear  Congress requires the full and complete special counsel report  without redactions  as well as access to the underlying evidence   Mr  Nadler said in a statement   The attorney general should reconsider so that we can work together to ensure the maximum transparency of this important report to both Congress and the American people  The committee s announcement came a day ahead of a deadline set by Mr  Nadler and five other House committee leaders for Mr  Barr to voluntarily hand over the material collected by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III Mr  Barr appeared all but certain to miss it The urgency among Democrats came  in part  because they mistrust Mr  Barr s assessment of the report in a four page letter he sent to Congress late last month  The letter said that Mr  Mueller had not found that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to subvert the 2016 election  and that although Mr  Mueller did not offer a prosecutorial judgment on whether Mr  Trump obstructed justice  Mr  Barr had determined the president s actions were not illegal Democrats control the Judiciary Committee by a sizable margin and most likely will not need Republican support to approve the subpoena  If approved  it would be up to Mr  Nadler to determine when and if to issue it   effectively increasing pressure on Mr  Barr to meet Democrats  demands The committee s top Republican  Representative Doug Collins of Georgia  appeared to oppose a subpoena on Monday  saying Democrats had grown  desperate  despite Mr  Barr providing  transparency above and beyond what is required   Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not  in truth  require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department   Mr  Collins said in a statement Indeed  in his Friday letter to Mr  Nadler and other congressional leaders  Mr  Barr wrote that the Justice Department and special counsel s team were scrubbing the report to redact secret grand jury testimony  classified material and information about other continuing federal investigations  He also agreed to testify publicly in early May about his handling of the case In addition to authorizing a subpoena for the Mueller report  the Judiciary Committee will vote on Wednesday on subpoenas for five key witnesses in its investigation into possible obstruction of justice  abuse of power and corruption within the Trump administration The individuals are Donald F  McGahn II  a former White House counsel who spoke extensively with Mr  Mueller s investigators  Stephen K  Bannon  the president s former chief strategist  Hope Hicks  a former White House communications director  Reince Priebus  the president s first chief of staff  and Annie Donaldson  a deputy of Mr  McGahn who took detailed notes on the president s behavior during key episodes in his administration The five were among 81 individuals  companies and government entities from which the committee requested documents last month to kick start its investigation  Mr  Nadler said he would not have to use the subpoenas if the witnesses changed course and complied voluntarily  

President Trump said last week that he would cut off aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  the home countries of most of the migrants arriving at the United States  southern border to seek asylum The Trump administration has already taken the first step to act on the president s directive  notifying Congress that it wanted to divert the  450 million allocated to the region  By Monday  though  the administration had not offered details about whether any aid   such as military aid or support to combat drug trafficking   might be exempt from the order If the aid withdrawal does go ahead  aid advocates say  it would probably affect  the region s most vulnerable people  including small farmers struggling to adapt to climate change and teenagers pressured to join gangs in a region that is a major drug transit route  according to State Department estimates  Advocates say that  should these threats to lives and livelihoods grow  many more people will take their chances on the road and leave for the United States The decision to end aid is likely to provoke anger in Congress  where lawmakers in both parties have supported efforts to address the root causes of migration  If the money is ultimately withheld  it would affect a wide range of programs designed to improve citizen security  promote economic development and encourage accountable government Security and justiceMr  Trump has complained that the governments of the three countries have done too little to halt immigration  and portrayed the withdrawal of aid as punishment for their leaders A vast majority of the aid  however  goes to nongovernmental organizations  churches  charities and private contractors that carry out projects for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development  According to the Washington Office on Latin America  a human rights research group  the largest portion of aid has gone to improving security and justice systems  and to preventing violence Aid varies from country to country to address their different needs  In El Salvador  where the United States has helped support a broad antiviolence program  57 percent of the  149 million in aid allocated in 2017 went to projects intended to prevent violence  improve security and community policing  and train judges  prosecutors and public defenders In Honduras  where aid reached almost  182 million in 2017  the highest percentage of funds   some 44 percent   went to support programs that improved justice and security  with an additional 30 percent allocated for antipoverty programs among the country s rural poor The aid also supports anticorruption measures by providing funds for international prosecutors who have been investigating graft in Honduras and Guatemala  and a special anticorruption unit in the Salvadoran attorney general s office  In advance of Guatemala s elections in June  the United States has also helped finance the country s electoral agency The United States also supported border security and efforts to combat drug trafficking  though those funds accounted for a smaller percentage of the overall aid  The Pentagon set aside millions to improve drug interdiction and to supply equipment and training to counter trafficking in Honduras Economic aidIn Guatemala  poverty  rather than violence  is the main driver of migration  More than half of the  178 million in 2017 aid went to programs to alleviate poverty  particularly in the country s western highlands  where many children suffer from chronic malnutrition Economic aid is the next largest block of American support in Central America  after security and related programs  The funds support small businesses in Guatemala  schools in Honduras and job training for at risk youth in El Salvador  among other projects  Some of the programs are broader  such as an effort to bring down high power costs by connecting electrical grids and financing new infrastructure In 2017   18 million was allocated to help farmers in Honduras diversify their crops and improve productivity  to reduce extreme hunger and poverty  and  14 5 million to help small business owners  including funds to help create a sustainable system for cacao production In Guatemala that year  more than  10 million was designated to help communities adapt to climate change s effects   such as increased drought and coffee destroying fungus   and  6 3 million to help the Health Ministry prevent maternal and infant deaths  and prevent H I V  infections Changing prioritiesUntil a large wave of unaccompanied minors from Central America arrived at the Texas border in 2014  American aid to the region focused on economic growth and law enforcement  But the surge of child migrants  which was in part spurred by the high murder rates in the Northern Triangle  prompted the Obama administration to request more money from Congress for a broader approach to the region As a result  aid increased to  750 million in 2016 before beginning to drop under the Trump administration  Over all  Congress allocated almost  2 1 billion to Central America from 2016 to 2018  most of it for the Northern Triangle countries  though agencies have been slow to spend all the money Murder rates have fallen in all three countries but poverty remains as entrenched as ever   and it remains difficult to assess how effective the aid has been  particularly over such a short period  Advocates argue that programs need years to take effect The Trump administration has also redirected its emphasis toward security and away from the focus on ethical governance  That shift has taken pressure off Central American governments to become more accountable  and both the Guatemalan and Honduran governments have recently pushed back against anticorruption efforts  

Look at the numbers  and something of a mystery emerges regarding the Trump administration s claims of a surge of uncontrolled arrivals Net migration across the southern border is at historic lows  Border apprehensions of unauthorized arrivals were at the lowest in modern record in 2017 and 2018  Apprehensions are up this spring  but still far below the highs of the 1980s  1990s or early 2000s Yet processing centers and detention centers are filling  some to near capacity  straining to meet even basic medical needs of migrant families  Images from the border show women and children huddling in overcrowded facilities The answer  immigration experts say  is that the crisis isn t primarily caused by the number of arrivals  but by Trump administration policies that disperse them to a handful of centers and that treat families who voluntarily surrender as invaders   creating the appearance of an invasion Far from being unique to the Trump administration  it is merely the latest in a pattern across Western democracies  where anti immigration sentiment is driving demand for harsh policies that may not only fail to reduce arrivals  but to also make the problem look even more uncontrolled and overwhelming The causes of that self reinforcing cycle may run far deeper than policy mismatch or even matters of immigration Economic dislocation and demographic change have provoked feelings of lost control and lost status among some whites  however real or imagined  It is a combination of forces  research suggests  that taps into deep seated instincts to seek safety in a familiar group identity   and to try to reimpose control Those feelings tend to focus on borders  even if undocumented immigration is not actually up  And policies that deliver on desires for a strict response can make the problem appear worse  deepening fears of chaos and of being overwhelmed This feedback loop  building in the United States and Europe since long before the latest upticks in arrivals  may be a major driver of the populist revolt  And it is playing into the growing global conflict between old style national identities  imagined as homogeneous and fixed  and a world that no longer aligns with them  Migration is really tough because  as Catherine Dauvergne said  it s the last bastion of sovereignty   said Jaya Ramji Nogales  an immigration scholar at Temple University s law school   At points in history where the demographic shift is changing  that s an easy thing for people to be scared of  ImageCuban asylum seekers waiting in Ciudad Jurez  Mexico  on Sunday CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesThe Cycle of CrisisSome 30 years ago  the United States constructed a wall on its southern border between the San Ysidro crossing  which links San Diego with Tijuana  and the Pacific Ocean This had an unintended effect  It funneled some migrants onto Interstate 5  which cut through the barriers  When a handful were hit by cars  transit authorities posted now infamous yellow signs showing a silhouette of a dashing family   widely known as  immigrant crossing  signs  That gave the impression of utter chaos at the border   said Douglas S  Massey  a Princeton University immigration scholar   But nothing had really changed   we were just hardening the border and pushing people into different places  The signs fed into a nationwide backlash against unauthorized immigration  Mr  Massey said  leading the Clinton administration to fund more border walls and nearly double border patrol agents But rather than reducing arrivals  this pushed them into desolate routes across the Arizona deserts  Crossing sparse ranch lands rather than dense cities  the migrant flows came to look far more numerous  Mr  Massey said  which made  a big impression and fed the narrative that there was this new invasion  Now  that cycle may be playing out again ImageSigns like this were posted in California in 2006 CreditHector Mata Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesPolicies meant to deter arrivals are putting them into a handful of centers  concentrating numbers in a way that makes them appear overwhelming  The policies have also put asylum claimants and families  who take some time to process  into facilities designed to house unauthorized migrant workers who can be deported quickly At the same time  the increase may appear larger than it actually is because a greater share of arrivals are voluntarily surrendering  hoping to apply for asylum  This is a right guaranteed under international law  but administration policy functionally treats them like undocumented immigrants  and even criminals  That feeds perceptions of a surge and creates the overcrowded conditions at detention centers  The numbers aren t that big  but if you re treating families as criminals and arresting them  holding them  the system can t handle that   said Mr  Massey  the Princeton scholar   It makes it look like there s absolute chaos at the border  but the chaos is because we don t have policies that fit the problem  An Underlying TensionA similar cycle has played out in Europe and Australia  Tightened European Union land borders  for example  led more refugees to travel by boats  When they sank  as many did  the horrifying episodes deepened Europeans  sense of chaos The surge of arrivals to Europe in 2015 and 2016 was an undeniable crisis  but it also hit on much deeper issues  That may help explain why it also fed into fears around immigration in the United States Psychological research suggests that fears about uncontrolled borders may be tied to deeper fears about loss of identity or loss of control Human beings desire the sense of safety they get from a strong  familiar group identity  Though white people in Western countries remain politically and culturally dominant  rising diversity has left some feeling that their status is under threat ImageSyrian refugees arriving in Greece in 2015  Tightened European Union land borders led more refugees to travel by boat CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesThis is perhaps why heavily white areas where children are likely to be less well off than their parents had been are especially likely to support Mr  Trump  according to a Gallup study Fear that one s in group will decline in relative power  whatever the cause  can make people feel a sense of loss of control  leading them to cling more firmly to their ethnicity and to see outsiders as a threat  It also tends to make people more nationalistic and more skeptical of immigration  according to a recent study of voters in the United States  Britain and Poland  which found that this fear predicted support for Brexit and for Mr  Trump The border  as perhaps the most obvious symbol of national identity and territorial protection  is a natural focal point for those fears  And so to many people  it feels true that there is a wave of uncontrolled immigrants and chaos at the border   even if arrivals are low in historic terms and many of the migrants are simply families seeking asylum It may also feel urgently necessary to reimpose order But stricter border policies tend to attract more attention and controversy  and can end up making immigration fears seem even more salient  As the news shows desperate people huddled in makeshift camps  creating the impression of a swamped border  the cycle repeats The Populist Feedback LoopThese sentiments align near perfectly with the drivers of right wing populism  a sense of lost control  a desire to reassert order and a narrowing national identity  And that populist sentiment can feed back into itself Global immigration flows are expected to increase over the long term due to climate change  deepening economic disparities and technology assisted ease of travel  Demographic trends  though easily overstated  are already making Western countries more diverse ImageWaiting at a port of entry in Tijuana on Sunday CreditMario Tama Getty ImagesA populist sentiment that calls for resisting this long underway change is likely to only heighten awareness of it  much like the strict border policies that tend to worsen the appearance of disorder The resulting policies can have the opposite of their intended effect When the Clinton administration stepped up deportations  it relocated American born gangs like MS 13 to Central America  where they flourished in an environment of poverty and state weakness  Today  many Central American families are fleeing that gang violence for the United States  In response  Mr  Trump has cut aid to three countries most threatened by gang violence These policies can bring significant harm to the migrants and refugees that they target  When you have women and children behind fences under a bridge  that s bad optics   Mr  Massey said  referring to makeshift migrant detention practices in Texas that left children sleeping on gravel and under mylar blankets   It s causing a lot of human damage

WASHINGTON   The Senate on Monday blocked billions of dollars in disaster aid for states across the country as Republicans and Democrats clashed over President Trump s opposition to sending more food and infrastructure help to Puerto Rico Opposition came from both parties for different reasons  Most Republicans refused to endorse a recovery bill passed this year by the House  They cited Mr  Trump s opposition to the bill s Puerto Rico funding  as well as their own concerns that the bill lacked money for Midwestern states  like Iowa and Nebraska  that have since been devastated by flooding and tornadoes For their part  Democrats balked at a separate measure drafted by Senate Republicans that included the money for the Midwest  arguing that a proposed  600 million in nutritional assistance for Puerto Rico was not enough  The Republican legislation had no chance in the House The votes on both measures were procedural and needed support from 60 senators to advance to a full floor vote  Neither won the support required  It was unclear late Monday how lawmakers would overcome that impasse and end the delay in disbursing the disaster aid The effort begins anew on Tuesday  when Senate Democrats will propose a measure that would allocate billions of dollars that would help Iowa and Nebraska  as well as Puerto Rico  according to a Senate Democratic aide Mr  Trump has been pressuring Democrats to support a disaster relief measure that does not include the money they want for Puerto Rico  and he went on the attack late Monday on Twitter  The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any  place  in history   he tweeted Puerto Ricans  are great   he added  but  their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works  Varying forms of recovery legislation have been in limbo since December  when an initial version was tacked on to legislation that could have prevented the 35 day government shutdown  And while the House passed a relief package in January  it was ultimately left out of the compromise measure that reopened the government Some lawmakers were optimistic that a resolution could be found quickly  Democrats in both chambers have pushed for a select group of lawmakers to draft legislation that borrows from both measures  I m sure we ll start talking again   said Senator Richard C  Shelby  Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee  He compared the negotiating process to a three legged stool   You ve got the House  you ve got the Senate and the presidency   We re hopefully at a point where we can get some serious negotiations going   he said Still  senators from both parties tried to used the disaster relief votes to their political advantage Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  said that  tonight  my colleagues had the opportunity to choose action over obstruction   Shamefully   he added   Senate Democrats said no  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  said in a statement that  Congress used to set politics aside after major disasters and help victims in their time of need   partisan infighting won t rebuild a single home or school  Even Puerto Rican politicians could not agree on which of the measures to support  Gov  Ricardo A  Rossell  a Democrat  urged lawmakers to endorse the House legislation  But Representative Jenniffer Gonzlez Coln  a Republican  spoke out in favor of the Senate measure  Ms  Gonzlez Coln is the island s sole representative in Congress  but she cannot vote Even before the votes on Monday  Republicans had tried to turn disaster relief into a 2020 presidential campaign issue  To my colleagues across the aisle who have been spending a lot of time in Iowa lately as presidential candidates   Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  said on the Senate floor   how are you going to look Iowans in the eye and justify a vote against moving this disaster relief bill ahead  Democrats have sought to frame Republican opposition as a slight against Puerto Rico  Nutrition assistance is not enough   Puerto Rico needs to rebuild   said Senator Patrick J  Leahy of Vermont  the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee  

To the Editor Re  Trump Directs State Dept  to End Aid to 3 Central American Countries   nytimes com  March 30  The Republicans  latest move on immigration is to halt foreign aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  This move is 180 degrees off the mark  People are leaving Central America because life there is dangerous  Life is dangerous there because local governments cannot govern  Local governments cannot govern because they are outgunned and corrupted by the drug cartels  A solution that is politically feasible for the United States is to create centers of economic power in Central America much as President John F  Kennedy s Alliance for Progress envisioned  The Republicans have just moved in the opposite direction Michael Evan GoldIthaca  N Y  

MOSCOW   The email came out of the blue  from an aide to the mysterious Russian billionaire  Oleg V  Deripaska  who is said to be close to President Vladimir V  Putin and an on again  off again character in the two year investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election Would I be interested in interviewing Mr  Deripaska  the aide asked  It was a bit like being summoned to meet with Greta Garbo or J D  Salinger Of course  I said  aware that Mr  Deripaska normally communicated  if at all  through the phalanx of lawyers and publicity agents he surrounded himself with  I wondered to myself why he had suddenly decided to speak out Soon enough  I found myself sitting alone in a hotel conference room  at a table bearing a gigantic fruit platter  unsure what to expect  This was  after all  a man who had emerged on top in Russia s bloody aluminum wars in the 1990s  and was accused in United States Treasury Department documents of suspected ties to organized crime  money laundering and ordering a contract killing He is a man of about average stature  whose most striking feature is his large  round head  He was intense  and spoke in a robotic English  so as not to worry about mistranslations  he said It soon became clear that he saw the determination of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  that the Trump administration had not colluded with Russia  at least according to a Justice Department summary of his findings  as an opening to rehabilitate his image in the West This despite the fact that Mr  Deripaska had refused to cooperate with the investigation  revealing for the first time that he had received written questions from the Mueller team but had declined to answer them  Do I feel like your president  that I am exonerated   he said at one point   I never felt guilty  It was annoying for me  There was this huge crush on my business  on my companies  when sanctions were put on the companies I founded  ImageLike President Trump  Mr  Deripaska took a victory lap after the special counsel s report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesOver cups of special black tea from his home region  Krasnodar  he complained of the tendency of the American news media to rush to judgment and professed confidence in the United States justice system  which he said would ultimately prove his innocence of any wrongdoing A graduate of a prestigious physics faculty  Mr  Deripaska rose to wealth in the 1990s  strong arming his way to a virtual monopoly over the Russian aluminum industry  When it placed sanctions on him and his companies last year  the Treasury Department cited his links to the Russian government  saying he profits from the country s  malign activity around the globe  Even while keeping a low profile  he pursued a costly lobbying and legal effort to assert his innocence  Initially  this revolved around sanctions on his businesses  and with the help of a global influence buying operation he did persuade the Treasury Department to lift sanctions on his aluminum empire in January Mr  Deripaska now wants to escape the personal sanctions  which hinder his ability to do business in the United States  Last month  he filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of those sanctions  which he claims have cost him  7 5 billion The conclusion that members of the Trump campaign had not colluded with Russians  Mr  Deripaska said  suggested the tide was shifting in campaigns of innuendo and guilt through leaks to the news media  If so  he said  the American justice system might also eventually clear him of other accusations never proven in court  such as ordering a contract murder  I always believe in justice   said Mr  Deripaska  whose lawyers have frequently fought to keep suits from being brought in American courts  saying they have no jurisdiction   For us outside the United States  Mueller signals that the U S  legal system is still alive  it still exists  Mr  Deripaska had faced scrutiny for financial entanglements with a former Trump campaign chairman  Paul J  Manafort  who in July 2016 reportedly asked an associate to offer Mr  Deripaska a private briefing on the presidential race  in hopes of settling a  26 million lawsuit stemming from a failed investment venture  The two had been business associates a decade ago  Mr  Deripaska had denied receiving the offer  but had not addressed these matters in detail while the investigation continued  There was a new reality in the U S  In politics  in social life  you do not respect presumption of innocence   he said  speaking of the sanctions imposed on him last year and leaks to the news media about the Russia investigation   There is no due process  Without any court  the public can consider people guilty of something  Mr  Deripaska was an early focus of the F B I  investigation into Russian meddling  In September 2016  two months before the election  F B I  agents questioned him in an early morning visit to his New York residence He declined to elaborate on the specific  written questions the special counsel later sent to Moscow  but said they generally tracked news media reports about prosecutors  suspicions  He did not answer on the advice of his lawyers  he said  Besides  he said   Why should I  ImageOnce business associates  Paul J  Manafort and Mr  Deripaska had fallen out by the time Mr  Manafort joined the Trump campaign in 2016 CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesMr  Manafort agreed to work for the Trump campaign for free  but did seek compensation elsewhere  In an email reported by The Washington Post  Mr  Manafort suggested to a former employee  Konstantin V  Kilimnik  that his dispute with the Russian tycoon might be resolved by offering  private briefings  about the campaign  Mr  Manafort also transferred internal Trump campaign polling data to Mr  Kilimnik  who the special counsel said had ties to Russian intelligence These circumstances still have congressional investigators alarmed   You might think it s O K  that the campaign chairman of a presidential campaign would offer information about that campaign to a Russian oligarch in exchange for money or debt forgiveness   Representative Adam B  Schiff  the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  said at a hearing last week   I don t  In the interview  Mr  Deripaska denied  as he had when The Washington Post first reported the offer of private briefings in 2017  ever having received from Mr  Manafort either an offer or any information about the campaign  For me  it s just absurd   he said   I had no interest in the U S  election  Why on earth  if I have no interest  would somebody offer private briefings to me   He last met Mr  Manafort in 2011  he said  It s not even sociable   he said of the reported offer of briefings   It looks like this  You haven t seen this guy  you know you have this huge sum of a dispute  and then you are like   Let s go and drink a cup of coffee   Mr  Deripaska said that he indeed suspended his multimillion dollar lawsuit against Mr  Manafort  but not because Mr  Manafort had asked him to do so or because he had received anything from the campaign chairman in return  My lawyers felt that might put me at risk  which anyway happened later  when Manafort appeared in the campaign   he said  referring to the eventual sanctions that came in 2018   They didn t want to bring more attention   to the business dispute with a man who had become prominent in American politics  he said  He later refiled the lawsuit In fighting to lift the personal sanctions  Mr  Deripaska must overcome years old accusations of ties to organized crime related to his path from the ashes of the former Soviet Union s aluminum industry to a billionaire with global reach  and allegations he is a front for the Kremlin on foreign policy matters Mr  Deripaska called these accusations  balderdash  and his lawsuit challenged the sanction on constitutional grounds  He also denied he is close to Mr  Putin  insisting he only deals with the government on matters of business regulation The conclusion of the special counsel s investigation  he said  gave him hope for success   I reaffirm to myself that the U S  systems  that U S  institutions  still exist   

There are three kinds of lies  lies  damned lies and Republican claims about health care O K   it s not news that politicians make misleading claims  some more than others  According to a running tally kept by Daniel Dale of The Toronto Star  as of Monday morning  Donald Trump had said 4 682 false things as president But G O P  health care claims are special  in several ways  First  they re outright  clearly intentional lies   not dubious assertions or misstatements that could be attributed to ignorance or misunderstanding  Second  they re repetitive  Rather than making a wide variety of false claims  Republicans keep telling the same few lies  over and over  Third  they keep doing this even though the public long ago stopped believing anything they say on the subject This syndrome demands an explanation  and I ll get there eventually  Before I do  however  let s document the things that make G O P  health care lies unique  For an even deeper look at what s on Paul Krugman s mind  sign up for his weekly newsletter  First  as I said  I m not talking about mere dubious claims  When Trump officials insisted that the 2017 tax cut would lead to a decade of miraculous growth  their claim made no sense in terms of the underlying economics  and it flew in the face of decades of evidence  But it was a prediction  not a statement of fact  and it s conceivable  barely  that Trump s people actually believed it But when Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  went on TV Sunday to declare that  every single plan  Trump has put forward  covered pre existing conditions   that was just a lie Here s what the Congressional Budget Office said in its assessment of the Republicans  American Health Care Act  which would have caused 23 million to lose coverage  and would have passed if John McCain hadn t voted  No    People who are less healthy  including those with pre existing or newly acquired medical conditions  would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive nongroup health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law  if they could purchase it at all  But Mulvaney s pre existing conditions lie  along with his lie about nobody losing coverage if the lawsuit against Obamacare succeeds  was normal by G O P  standards  Which brings me to the second reason this particular form of lying is exceptional  Republicans just keep telling the same lies  over and over  Again and again they have promised to maintain coverage and protect pre existing conditions   then offered plans that would cause tens of millions to lose health insurance  with the worst impact on those already suffering from health problems The funny thing   which is my third point   is that almost nobody seems to believe these lies  On the eve of last year s midterm elections  the public trusted Democrats over Republicans to protect Americans with pre existing conditions by 58 percent to 26 percent  A margin this big tells us that even Trump supporters knew their man was lying on this issue So what s behind the persistence of R H L S    Republican health care lying syndrome Well  public opinion here is clear  Americans want everyone to have access to health care  There isn t even that much of a partisan divide  An overwhelming majority of Republicans don t believe insurance companies should be allowed to deny coverage or charge more to those with pre existing conditions This public near unanimity is one reason Medicare is so popular  Getting older   and thus joining a group with much higher average health costs than the rest of the population   is  after all  the ultimate pre existing condition But there are only two ways to cover people with pre existing conditions  and both are anathema to conservative ideology One is to have taxpayers pay the bills directly  which is what Medicare does The other combines regulation and subsidies  Insurance companies must be prohibited from discriminating based on medical history   a prohibition that must include preventing them from issuing bare bones policies that will appeal only to those in good health   but that won t do the job by itself  Healthy people must also be induced to sign up  to provide a good risk pool  which means subsidizing premiums for those with lower incomes and  preferably although not totally necessary  imposing a penalty on those without insurance If the second option sounds familiar  it should  It s what countries like the Netherlands and Switzerland do  it s also a description of  you guessed it  Obamacare But Republicans cannot admit that the only way to protect pre existing conditions is to emulate Democratic policies  The party of Eisenhower  or even the party of Nixon  might have been able to do such a thing  but the party of Fox News cannot Nor  however  do Republicans dare admit that they have no interest in providing protection that a vast majority of voters demands  So they just keep lying You may  by the way  have heard talk about G O P  members of Congress opposed to Trump s new health care push  But they share his goals  they re just questioning his timing  The whole party still wants to take away your health care  It just hopes to get through the next election before you find out The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our

WASHINGTON   To celebrate the 70th anniversary of NATO  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gathered ministers from all the nations in the military alliance on Wednesday night in the same hall where Harry S  Truman signed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization pact in 1949   No military alliance in the world can remotely do what we do   Mr  Pompeo said  hailing NATO s success But the forces pulling that alliance apart were evident everywhere The bonds among the core nations that signed the original treaty  which was displayed next to Mr  Pompeo  are fracturing  New members that were once Soviet states are turning authoritarian  This week  the Pentagon blocked delivery of equipment for the alliance s most modern weapon  the F 35 fighter jet  to Turkey because the NATO nation would not back down on buying Russia s most sophisticated antiaircraft system Vice President Mike Pence declared at the celebration that Germany risked becoming a  captive of Russia  because of its embrace of a direct energy pipeline to Russia And missing altogether was President Trump  whom European and American officials alike wanted to keep away from the anniversary for fear he would again raise the idea of pulling out of NATO if other member states did not pay a greater share of the defense burden It was  one European diplomat said with mild overstatement at one of the many receptions on Wednesday  a little like showing up at a birthday party and discovering you were attending a wake No one had to pick through this minefield more carefully than Jens Stoltenberg  the Norwegian diplomat currently leading the alliance  Mr  Stoltenberg deftly dealt with Mr  Trump on Tuesday by thanking him at the White House for urging NATO countries to spend more on their own defense  which is estimated to result in  100 billion in new spending by the end of 2020 Mr  Stoltenberg clearly knew his audience  Increasing allied contributions is pretty much the only thing Mr  Trump discusses about NATO  In the president s public comments  he has seemed uninterested in what the alliance is doing to push back against Russia or to take on new threats   like the daily onslaught of cyberattacks  from the annoying to the crippling  aimed at NATO members each day It was only when Mr  Stoltenberg got to Capitol Hill  to address a joint session of Congress  that he publicly delineated what he saw as Russia s many offenses   including the annexation of Crimea  the nerve gas attack in Britain and Moscow s violations of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  the agreement from which the United States is now withdrawing  NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence   Mr  Stoltenberg said  But on Thursday  he left it unclear what form that deterrence would take  In comments to the foreign ministers from the alliance s 29 nations   up from the dozen who signed the original treaty   Mr  Stoltenberg said that even if the standoff with Russia resembled a renewed Cold War  no intermediate range nuclear weapons would be deployed on European soil to counter Moscow s weapons But no amount of celebration or warning could paper over bitter divisions that have erupted within NATO over the past few years  only some of which have to do with Mr  Trump Mr  Pompeo expressed exasperation at the argument he hears so often in Europe  which is that its leaders simply will not spend money on defense at anything close to the levels Mr  Trump   and before him President Barack Obama   had in mind  Now is not the time to repeat tired excuses that our citizens don t support increased defense spending or security spending   Mr  Pompeo said  carefully avoiding repeating Mr  Trump s threats to leave the organization unless other member states step up He did not need to  Last year  Mr  Trump periodically told his aides that he no longer saw value in staying in the alliance  And there was a sense at the 70th anniversary this week that the damage was done   even if he did not make good on the threat In a coming report from the Council on Foreign Relations   titled  Trump s Foreign Policies Are Better Than They Seem    Robert Blackwill  a former national security aide and ambassador to India in the George W  Bush administration  argued that the president s record with the alliance was mixed at best but that he had probably done more harm than good In an interview  Mr  Blackwill praised Mr  Trump for pressuring the allies to spend more and for backing up expanded NATO defenses along Russia s border with American troops and surveillance technology But he said none of that would mean much  if the allies lose confidence that the U S  will come to their defense under Article 5   the provision of the treaty that deems an attack on one to be an attack on all  Mr  Trump s biggest misstep  Mr  Blackwill said  was  undermining deterrence    which he said was often as much a function of psychology as military might Aware of the damage already done  Mr  Pompeo repeated the American commitment to Article 5 in a brief speech to the NATO ministers on Thursday  Yet few in the hall seemed to believe him  recalling that Mr  Trump refused to mention the treaty commitment during a visit to the alliance s new headquarters in Brussels last summer  and only grudgingly did so later  Never before has NATO had a U S  leader who didn t appear to believe deeply in NATO itself   R  Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute  two former American ambassadors to the alliance  argued in an op ed in The Washington Post In a  detailed report about the multiple crises engulfing NATO  the two former envoys pointed up a greater vulnerability that has more to do with how the alliance is focusing its resources rather than how it is raising them For years  NATO s planning and doctrine have seemed hopelessly rooted in old images of Russian military invasions into the Fulda Gap  the German lowlands where tanks could pour in  The alliance s cybercenter  north of Brussels  was focused entirely on defending its own networks that have been under constant assault for years Until a few years ago  NATO s cyberdefenses ran from 9 a m  to 5 p m  on weekdays  the idea that state sponsored hackers might wait to attack on weekends to cripple the alliance s communications or defenses ran afoul of budgets and work schedules  Until recently  there was little discussion of offensive cybercapabilities  nor doctrines of deterrence Only now is NATO beginning to think about the vulnerabilities of civilian and military communications that rely on 5G mobile phone networks  The alliance has been slow to think about how artificial intelligence and the potential of quantum computing could change the challenge of defending member states  This week s meetings in Washington were the first in which threats from China were considered at any length Next week  the NATO center of cyberexcellence in Tallinn  Estonia  will run an exercise envisioning a fictional nation   Berylia   under a combination of attacks on its power grid  its communications networks and its election systems  In the real world  that is what has happened in Ukraine  which is aspiring to join NATO  But Ukraine was not central to the discussions at the 70th anniversary  We ve become blinded by the constant focus on the 2 percent standard   Senator Christopher S  Murphy  Democrat of Connecticut  said during the NATO meetings  He was referring to the current goal of member states of spending 2 percent of their economic output on the military by

As President Abdel Fattah el Sisi of Egypt prepares constitutional changes that could keep him in power until 2034 and enhance military control over the country  President Trump is preparing to welcome him to the White House  This is the second time Mr  Trump will bestow this diplomatic gift on Mr  el Sisi  one of the most authoritarian leaders in the Middle East After taking power in a 2013 coup that ousted the country s first elected president  the Islamist Mohamed Morsi  Mr  el Sisi  a former army chief  promised his people that he would build democracy and leave office in 2022 after completing a second term Instead  he has built a reputation for brutality and repression  torturing and killing hundreds of Egyptians and jailing perhaps as many as 60 000 others  including students and American citizens It is not unusual for American presidents to work with strongmen to advance national interests  But if Mr  Trump welcomes Mr  el Sisi to Washington now  without pressing him for reforms rather than acquiescing to his power grab  he will be crushing hopes that Egypt could become democratic any time soon Mr  el Sisi made his move in February when the rubber stamp Parliament gave preliminary approval to a package of amendments to Egypt s 2014 Constitution  which was adopted after the 2011 Arab Spring uprising ended the 30 year rule of President Hosni Mubarak  leading to Mr  Morsi s election In addition to extending presidential terms to six years from four  and allowing him to run two more times  the amendments would grant the armed forces expansive authority to intervene in the government  give Mr  el Sisi more control over appointing senior judges and provide military courts broader jurisdiction to try civilians A final parliamentary vote is due by mid April  then the amendments are supposed to be submitted to a referendum  But officials are stifling all dissent No members of the political opposition have been allowed to participate in the government s national dialogue sessions on the changes  Several people who posted videos on Facebook criticizing the amendments have been arrested  Two Egyptian actors who criticized Mr  el Sisi on a panel with a congressman in Washington last week were subsequently expelled from their union  which accused them of treason There s been no pushback on any of this from Mr  Trump  who has shown great affection for autocrats  fawning over Mr  el Sisi on his first White House visit  in 2017 Mr  Trump might be able to salvage the April 9 visit if he warns that some of the  1 3 billion in annual American military aid could be at risk if the Egyptian leader doesn t pursue a democratic path  For many years  the United States has been reluctant to use aid as leverage  concerned that doing so could jeopardize Egypt s peace treaty with Israel  along with American access to the Suez Canal  overflight rights and counterterrorism cooperation  But peace with Israel  international use of the canal and cooperating in the fight against terrorism are in Egypt s own interest  and they are unlikely to be abandoned if America stands up for democratic principles Under pressure from Congress  which set certain conditions for aid  the Trump administration in 2017 temporarily withheld  300 million  That helped persuade Egypt to acquit employees of several American and European institutes who were charged for doing democracy related work and to suspend implementation of a law cracking down on such groups  Millions more dollars from 2018 and 2019 are being held in abeyance pending certification that Egypt met congressional conditions  congressional sources said  If Mr  Trump will not call Mr  el Sisi to account  Congress can try  American aid should not come in a blank check  Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee  has placed a hold on  105 million of aid to get Egypt to compensate April Corley  the American injured in 2015 when Egypt s armed forces  using American weapons  mistakenly shot up a tourist group  Mr  Leahy also wants more clarity about Egypt s secretive military campaign against an Islamic State group in Sinai  Barring a principled response to Mr  el Sisi  the United States will be further complicit in shoring up his military dictatorship  disenfranchising most Egyptians and fueling the kind of instability that is certain to produce a new generation of extremists  That is not in Egypt s interests  nor America s RelatedMore on President el Sisi s rule in Egypt Opinion   The Editorial

Two hallmarks of American economic policy under President Trump are a reflexive aversion for regulation and go it alone nationalism But in technology policy  that stance is changing In September  the Trump administration abandoned its hands off approach and began working closely with the 36 nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to create international guidelines for the design and use of artificial intelligence The administration has also started to discuss a new law to protect privacy in the digital age  seeking consensus domestically and common ground internationally  It has fielded more than 200 public comment filings from advocacy groups  corporations and individuals  There is a real desire in the United States to see leadership at the federal level   said David Redl  a senior Commerce Department official helping to guide the administration s privacy effort On both issues  the administration has  moved from indifference to engagement   said Julie Brill  a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission  who now helps oversee regulatory affairs for Microsoft   It certainly has been welcome  The shift is a pragmatic recognition that regulations that will affect the nation s tech industry and its citizens are coming  and that if federal officials want a say in them  they must participate ImageSurveillance cameras near a portrait of Mao Zedong in Beijing  China is using personal data and artificial intelligence as tools of a surveillance state CreditAndy Wong Associated PressChina   which is not a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development   has gone its own way  using personal data and artificial intelligence as tools of a government backed surveillance state  If the United States were another digital island  experts warn  there would be a real danger of a fragmented global marketplace Privacy can be seen as the first step toward regulating artificial intelligence more broadly  Vast volumes of data  often personal information  are the fuel of modern A I  systems Several American states  led by California  have passed or proposed privacy laws  threatening to fragment the marketplace in the United States  too  They are following Europe  where a sweeping privacy law took effect in May  harnessing the popular backlash against American tech giants like Facebook and Google  Europe is saying   We re in charge   defining the global rules in the next iteration of the digital economy   said Daniel Weitzner  a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a policy adviser in the Obama administration The new European privacy law  known as the General Data Protection Regulation  lets people request their data online  restricts how businesses obtain and handle information  and opens a door to class action style lawsuits and huge fines Just how strict or effective enforcement will be remains to be seen  But other nations are adopting similar rules  and tech companies are retooling their data handling software to comply  Last year  Europe and Japan agreed to allow personal data to flow freely between the two economies  since Japan s rules were deemed the equivalent of Europe s Mounir Mahjoubi  the French secretary of state for digital affairs  pointed to the European Japanese pact as the  first impact worldwide  of the European standard ImageGoogle s chief executive  Sundar Pichai  testifying to a House committee in December  He was among the tech leaders who attended a private forum on  industries of the future  at the White House that month CreditTing Shen for The New York TimesMr  Redl of the Commerce Department said the administration had been prompted to seek a new privacy law by action in Europe and state legislatures  Though it has solicited public comments  the administration has not yet drafted a proposed law  and passage would require bipartisan support in Congress But the goal  Mr  Redl said  is a federal law that will  harmonize  data privacy rules in the United States and mesh enough with the European standard to avoid a more splintered marketplace One sign of the administration s more cosmopolitan approach to technology policy was a small  private forum on  industries of the future  at the White House in early December  Most of the guests were tech company leaders  including Sundar Pichai of Google  Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Ginni Rometty of IBM At that session  White House technology advisers discussed the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s artificial intelligence guidelines and the importance of shaping the outcome  That impressed the tech executives as a newfound embrace of international engagement  according to a person briefed on the meeting  who would speak only anonymously The White House confirmed that its side had brought up the organization s guidelines at the meeting  In February  President Trump signed an executive order on artificial intelligence that called for not only more investment but also regulation to  foster public trust in A I  systems  In a statement last week  Michael Kratsios  deputy assistant to the president for technology policy  said   We re focused on promoting an international environment that supports A I  research and development and ensures the technology is developed in a manner aligned with our nation s core civil liberties and freedoms  The administration s emphatic cooperation on artificial intelligence guidelines contrasts with an earlier arms length wariness of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  In 2017  for example  the administration  given its nationalist trade agenda  insisted that the term  free trade  not appear in a ministerial statement  according to two people involved in drafting the language  who would speak only on the condition of anonymity ImageMichael Kratsios  second from left  assistant to the president for technology policy  in 2017  The administration wants to ensure that artificial intelligence  is developed in a manner aligned with our nation s core civil liberties and freedoms   he said last week CreditStephen Crowley The New York TimesThe organization s A I  initiative has involved meetings and presentations around the world  Groups from engineers to human rights activists are represented on the advisory panels that help draft recommendations  which are tentatively scheduled for ministerial approval in May Their guidelines are  soft law    suggestions  not requirements  But the Paris based organization has a track record of influencing global policy The most recent  eight page draft lays out rights and responsibilities  Those responsible  it says  include any individual or organization that makes or operates A I  technology   and these  A I  actors  should do systematic risk assessments of  privacy  digital security  safety and bias  People affected by an A I  generated prediction or recommendation  it says  should have the right to challenge the outcome  based on plain and easy to understand information  on how an automated decision was made The draft recommendations call for global A I  standards that are  trustworthy  and allow for data to flow fairly freely across borders so that it is  interoperable   The latter is a vital point for the American side  National laws and approaches will differ  they say  but they should not hobble the global data economy No one is entirely satisfied in the collective  give and take of developing guidelines  Marc Rotenberg  executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center  a nonprofit digital rights research and advocacy group  is one of the expert advisers  He is a champion of more forceful guidelines like a prohibition on Chinese style scoring of individuals based on their personal information and online behavior But Mr  Rotenberg described the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s effort as  the right synthesis to pursue   combining  economic development and a fundamental human right to privacy   The guidelines  he said  should be  a very important policy framework   

CIUDAD JUREZ  Mexico   From her home in Honduras  Maria Magdalena Ferrufino Nuez learned that Mexico s new president was helping the migrants who were heading north in search of a better life  I heard that he was welcoming the caravans   said Ms  Ferrufino Nuez  55  who traveled with her son toward Ciudad Jurez  where she is waiting in a shelter for a chance to apply for asylum in the United States The spring months usually see an upswell in migration in the region as Central Americans   fleeing poverty and violence or seeking to reunite with family members in the United States   take advantage of the temperate weather to travel north  But this year  a record number of migrant families is overwhelming officials and facilities on not only on the American side of the Mexico United States border  infuriating Trump administration officials  but also on the Mexican side The backup of migrants in Mexico has been commonly blamed on restrictions the Trump administration  has imposed on the American asylum process  But this crisis appears to be also  in part  of the Mexican president s making According to migrants  local officials and migration scholars  this increase in northward migration has been partly spurred by the policies of President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador of Mexico  who had campaigned as a defender of the poor and the downtrodden  and took office in December  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  During his tenure  he has sought to strike a contrast with his predecessors by presenting a kinder  gentler face toward migrants  Deportations have plummeted under his watch  and his administration has sought to incorporate more migrants into Mexican society by being more generous with humanitarian visas and work permits ImageBorder Patrol officers checking travel documents on the Paso Del Norte Bridge  which connects El Paso and Ciudad Jurez  Mexico  at the border CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesAt the same time  he has also helped the Trump administration s efforts to impede people seeking asylum in the United States With more migrants moving north  and greater restrictions on entry into the United States  the number of migrants waiting along the Mexican side of the border has swelled  From Tijuana  on the western end of the border  to Matamoros on the eastern end  thousands of migrants have overflowed shelters  drawn down the emergency resources of local governments and civil society and tested the generosity and patience of residents In Ciudad Jurez  northbound migrants   from Central America  the Caribbean and elsewhere   started arriving en masse late last year  The city s two longtime shelters quickly overflowed  Churches pushed aside pews to make room for mattresses  and a public school gymnasium was converted to a dormitory  There are now nine shelters   still not enough to house newly arriving migrants  who are pouring in at a rate of more than 100 a day  local and state officials said  Nobody knows where this is going to go  how many people are going to come  how many more people we re going to help   said Rogelio Pinal Castellanos  the director of human rights in Ciudad Jurez And the situation would only get worse should Mr  Trump follow through on his threat to close the border in retaliation for what he says has been an inadequate effort by the Mexican government to stem unauthorized migration The surge of migrants winding up in Ciudad Jurez and other border cities corresponds to a rise in the number of undocumented migrants trying to enter the United States American officials say about 76 000 migrants without authorization were intercepted  or surrendered  along the southwest border in February   a 31 percent increase over January s number  Interdictions of undocumented immigrants  most of them from Central America  were on pace to surpass 100 000 last month  the Trump administration claims  and could reach one million by the end of September  These are levels not seen since the early 2000s ImagePresident Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador of Mexico  left  at a news conference in January  He has spoken repeatedly about incorporating more migrants into the Mexican work force CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesThe surge in undocumented migrants has come despite a series of aggressive policies by the Trump administration designed to discourage migration  including the constricting of the asylum process For years  migrants seeking asylum only needed to present themselves at a port of entry into the United States to begin the process  But the Trump administration has begun to use a system known as  metering   which limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at certain ports of entry The practice has given rise to informal waiting lists managed by the Mexican authorities  or even by the migrants themselves  There are currently more than 3 300 asylum seekers on the list in Ciudad Jurez  The number that can formally cross each day ranges from several dozen to none  and the wait can stretch for months  On Sunday only 10 were allowed to cross  The day before  zero In a trend that began during the Obama administration  an increasing percentage of migrants are traveling in family units with children  Some say they bring their children in part because they know they will have a better chance of being released from American detention more quickly  We heard in Guatemala that if you were traveling with children  it was much easier to cross   said a woman  30  who has been staying with her 5 year old son at a Jurez shelter waiting for her turn to apply for asylum in neighboring El Paso  She gave her surname as Ramirez  but asked that her full name not be published because she did not want to imperil her case  She said she was fleeing a violent gang in Guatemala While President Lpez Obrador has chosen  in some ways  to help the United States carry out its immigration agenda  he has also sent a message to potential migrants that they are now more welcome than ever in Mexico In the first three months of the Lpez Obrador administration  there were 44 percent fewer deportations than during the last three months of President Enrique Pea Nieto s administration ImageCuban asylum seekers waiting in Ciudad Jurez  Mexico  listening to an update on the number of asylum claims being accepted by the United States CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesMr  Lpez Obrador has also talked repeatedly about  incorporating more migrants into the Mexican work force In January  the Mexican immigration agency set up a special task force on the southern border to expedite the issuing of yearlong  renewable humanitarian visas for Central Americans approaching as part of a large migrant caravan But after more than 13 000 migrants applied for the visa in two weeks  the government abruptly ended the program Many migrants who had applied for the visa said they intended to use it to ease their passage to the northern border  and then cross into the United States  either legally or illegally  I heard that they were giving an excellent entry permit  and because of that we came with the idea of making it to the United States   said Donald Tejada  28  a coffee plantation worker from Honduras who applied for the special visa in late January And though the migrant caravans account for only a small  albeit high profile  fraction of the total number of migrants who traverse Mexico  the Lpez Obrador administration has largely allowed them to move unimpeded across Mexican territory At least two large migrant caravans   one numbering about 2 000 people and the other about 800   are currently traveling through southern Mexico toward the United States  according to local news reports  Yet another left San Salvador  the capital of El Salvador  on Saturday  also heading north ImageAsylum seekers walking along the United States border in El Paso  Texas  before turning themselves in to the Border Patrol to make their case on Sunday CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesOn Sunday  the Mexican migration agency said it would resume issuing humanitarian visas on Monday to migrants  in a limited manner  in the southern state of Chiapas  giving priority to women  children and people older than 65  The agency also said it would start issuing the visas through Mexican Consulates in Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras beginning in May But the Lpez Obrador administration has been under considerable pressure from President Trump to help curb illegal migration into the United States  And following a meeting last week with Trump administration officials  Mexico s interior minister  Olga Snchez Cordero  said security forces would be deployed to form a containment cordon across southern Mexico to help control migration The Lpez Obrador administration is also under pressure from the northern border cities and states that have been shouldering the burden of care for the thousands of migrants Officials in the state of Chihuahua  which includes Ciudad Jurez  said they have repeatedly lobbied their federal counterparts for money to help support the migrants waiting to cross into the United States  arguing that their presence is partly a result of inconsistent national migration policy But they have received little assistance  We don t have the capacity to receive so many people for so much time   said Enrique Valenzuela  the coordinator of the Chihuahua government s population council  which oversees migrant issues for the state   Facing a situation that we didn t cause  the costs have been high and are increasing  Part of Mr  Valenzuela s work is to urge patience among the migrants waiting to apply for asylum  But  he cautions  the longer they have to wait  the more likely they will be to try to cross illegally And the more that people cross illegally  the more that the Trump administration will reassign personnel from the legal border crossings  causing slowdowns at ports of entry  further limiting the procession of asylum seekers and fueling a vicious cycle Andrew Selee  the president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington  said that both the Trump and Lpez Obrador administrations are learning the limits of their own political rhetoric  The great irony here is that you have one administration north of the border that rhetorically thinks only in terms of enforcement and one south of the border that rhetorically thinks in terms of getting rid of enforcement   he said   And neither one is possible   

ANCHORAGE   Working through two winters in the biting arctic cold  roustabouts bored three miles deep into the coastal plain of northeast Alaska in search of oil  In the spring of 1986  they packed up and left  uttering not a word about what they had found and leaving only a short section of steel pipe to mark the spot For more than three decades  the findings from the  40 million exploratory well have been one of the oil industry s most closely guarded secrets  Outside of the oil giants that paid for it  only a handful of people know what was discovered there Now the secret has become much more than a curiosity  The Trump administration  undoing decades of environmental protections  plans to sell drilling leases in the area  which is part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and has long been believed to contain North America s biggest untapped onshore trove of oil Anyone interested in drilling in the area urgently wants to know  Was the well   the only one ever drilled there   a dry hole or a potential gusher No one will say officially  but The New York Times found an answer in clues hidden 4 000 miles from the Arctic tundra  in the archives of a Beaux Arts style courthouse in Cleveland  The discovery well was worthless   said Sidney B  Silverman  a retired lawyer who was involved in a long since forgotten lawsuit filed there in 1987  Read more about how the Trump administration is clearing the way for oil exploration in the Arctic refuge  Mr  Silverman  who is now 86 and divides his time between Long Island and South Florida  reached that conclusion while representing shareholders of Standard Oil of Ohio as it was being acquired by British Petroleum  Both companies had a stake in the Arctic test well and were poised to benefit from further development ImageSidney Silverman  a retired lawyer  learned about the findings in a confidential deposition in the 1980s  but hasn t spoken out until now CreditEve Edelheit for The New York TimesIn merger documents  BP had placed only a  nominal  value on the potential reserves in the refuge  and Mr  Silverman and other lawyers suspected that Standard Oil s shareholders were about to be cheated They quickly learned otherwise BP allowed Mr  Silverman to conduct a confidential deposition about the well with a BP executive  David Jenkins  Reached by The Times  Mr  Jenkins said his memories were vague  but he recalled the deposition   which was sealed by the court   and telling Mr  Silverman that  there was never any evidence at all  at that stage  that there was anything material within the refuge  Mr  Silverman  similarly  remembered being convinced that  either there was no oil and gas there  or the oil couldn t be produced at an economic value  Some of the documents in the case are missing from the court file  perhaps lost over the decades  But in more than 1 000 pages of legal and regulatory filings  The Times discovered other hints that the findings were disappointing  Under oath  a Goldman Sachs banker who worked on the merger testified that BP had led him to believe that the test well results were  not particularly encouraging  John Warden  a lawyer who represented BP  said that he had only dim memories of the case but that the well results  became a nonissue   Told of The Times s reporting  he added   It looks to me like you have gotten it right  Mr  Silverman hinted at the findings in a memoir he self published 10 years ago  but has never before spoken out directly about what was said in the deposition  He said he was breaking his silence because of the Trump administration s decision to open the refuge   protected by Congress for decades   for oil development  This is important for the whole country   he said One dry hole does not necessarily mean there is no oil to be found  especially since some decades old seismic tests indicate that the area may hold as much as 12 billion barrels  worth  And knowledge of the area s subsurface geology is valuable  But confirmation that the results of the only test well were discouraging could embolden opponents of drilling and prompt second thoughts among potential lease bidders  Knowing that information would help you in an extremely competitive bid   said Larry Persily  a former federal gas official responsible for Alaska  who noted there had been billion dollar lease sales in the state  While the well is all but  a pimple on a speck  of the Arctic s massive landscape  he said  it is a prevailing mystery   And we love mysteries  ImageWhen the oil companies were finished with the test well  they hauled everything away   even  according to one account  the rock cuttings CreditTom Cook Papers Anchorage MuseumOil and gas development in the Arctic refuge  or ANWR   an expanse about the size of South Carolina that is home to caribou  polar bears and other wildlife   has been a goal of Republicans in Congress and many Alaskans for a half century But efforts to open the refuge s coastal plain  known as the 1002 Area  foundered for years as opponents argued that exploration would irreparably harm one of the country s largest pristine landscapes Republicans saw an opening with the election of Donald J  Trump  In 2017  the Republican controlled Congress passed a measure to sell oil leases in the refuge  Since then  the Interior Department has moved rapidly to sell leases for the 1002 Area before the 2020 election  when Democrats could regain the White House and block the sales The exploratory well was drilled under an agreement among BP  Standard Oil  Chevron and two Alaska Native corporations created to improve economic conditions among the indigenous population  The deal also allowed the oil companies to pursue further exploration on Native lands within the 1002 Area  if the federal government offered leases for the rest of the coastal plain At a congressional hearing last week  Richard Glenn  an executive with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation  one of the Native partners  played down the data s significance   You can t determine the quality of any single basin by one well   he said The corporation declined to comment for this article  as did BP  Chevron said in a statement that the results of its activities in the area remained confidential Joe Balash  the Interior Department official overseeing the leasing efforts  told reporters in December that the potential oil riches should attract plenty of interest despite the enduring mystery surrounding the well   a site known as a  tight hole   an industry term for wells with confidential findings  In the oil and gas industry  there s secrets and then there s secrets   Mr  Balash said   This is the tightest hole  I think  that has ever been drilled  A Legal CircusA year after the exploratory well was completed  a fleet of lawyers descended upon the Cuyahoga County Courthouse in Cleveland  BP  which already held a minority stake in Standard Oil of Ohio  had offered  7 4 billion to buy the rest of it  and the lawyers were there to lodge claims that Standard Oil s shareholders were being shortchanged The deal and the ensuing litigation led to a legal spectacle  with lawyers  executives and bankers shuttling from London to New York  often on Concorde jetliners  and then on to Cleveland and California  The case generated financial headlines around the world Eager to distinguish himself from the other lawyers  Mr  Silverman seized on the lack of detail in BP s offer about what had been found at the test well  known as KIC 1  In a filing  he and his team suggested that the omission had led to a significant shortfall in the value of the deal Soon after  BP s lawyers let Mr  Silverman question Mr  Jenkins  the oil executive  The proceeding was unusually secretive  No copies were made of the transcript  and the original is said to have been stored in a safe at a law firm representing BP Mr  Jenkins  who is 80  lives near London and still works in the oil industry  said he had found a notation about the meeting in his 1987 appointment book  He did not remember details of the KIC 1 findings  he said  but recalled that  there wasn t anything in that well that was particularly encouraging  Mr  Jenkins holds out the possibility that there is oil in the refuge   But not where the KIC well was drilled   he said Mr  Silverman  who ultimately agreed to a settlement  said he had been satisfied by what he learned during the deposition   I assure you right now that if that property were valuable  if it had any value  I would not have agreed to that merger  Mr  Silverman and the other lawyers agreed to a small increase in the offer price and BP stock warrants for Standard Oil s shareholders  allowing them to potentially share in future profits Just as a settlement seemed imminent  lawyers for a large shareholder  the California Public Employees  Retirement System  known as Calpers  lodged a challenge  also asking whether the price reflected the drilling results To allay those concerns  lawyers for Calpers were allowed to see information about the well findings  Yeoryios Apallas  a former California deputy attorney general who represented Calpers at the hearing  said that after reviewing a document that showed details of the test well  he concluded  there was no reasonable basis on which to question the fairness of the price  The case was over in about three months  Mr  Silverman and the other plaintiffs  lawyers shared  22 million in legal fees as they completed one of the era s largest mergers In the decades since  as the debate flared in Congress over whether to open the refuge to oil exploration  Mr  Silverman and others involved in the case quietly kept the secrets of the test well  To date  there has been no drilling in ANWR   Mr  Silverman wrote in his 2009 memoir   A Happy Life  From Courtroom to Classroom   Environmentalists think their efforts have preserved the wilderness area   he wrote   I know better  but must remain silent  ImageMr  Silverman wrote about the lawsuit in his memoir   A Happy Life  From Courtroom to Classroom  CreditSidney SilvermanKeeping the SecretThe oil companies drilling KIC 1 were so concerned about secrecy that  by one industry account  they even shipped the rock cuttings from the well out of Alaska  In 1988  the companies and one of their Native corporation partners sued Alaska to keep the well data confidential After a four year legal battle  the sides reached a tentative agreement that would allow only a few state officials to see the findings  But the state wanted to be sure the data was significant enough to warrant concealing it   that  as the companies contended  it would help in valuing subsurface mineral rights nearby  So  Mark Myers  a state petroleum geologist at the time  became one of the few people outside of BP or Chevron to see it In a conference room at BP s Anchorage offices  Dr  Myers said  he was allowed to comb through the information  which included geological and geophysical data from the well  He was not allowed to take notes  When he finished  he reported only that the findings were significant Since then  the state s files have remained locked away at the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in Anchorage  To this day  Dr  Myers  who went on to lead the United States Geological Survey and Alaska s Department of Natural Resources  and now works as a consultant  has not said whether the results were positive or negative  even as many news reports have speculated about them Proponents of opening the refuge to exploration have long cautioned that the KIC 1 findings are only one data point  While no other wells have been drilled within the refuge  many have been drilled near it A year after KIC 1 was completed  Tenneco and several partners drilled a well off the coast about seven miles to the northeast  The well was intended not to discover oil  but to learn more about any potential oil bearing rock formations  The results were not encouraging  according to Douglas R  Choromanski  who helped analyze data from the well  called Aurora Other wells have been drilled just west of the refuge  closer to the huge oil field at Prudhoe Bay that spurred Alaska s oil boom in the 1970s  Some have tapped into significant oil reserves  and some have not Dr  Myers said that given new understanding of where oil reserves may be found  much of the focus on the refuge has shifted to the western side  away from the KIC 1 well  A 3 D seismic testing program has been proposed to help pinpoint any oil reserves in the 1002 Area A full airing of the KIC 1 findings  though  could come if the Interior Department moves forward with selling leases  Under state rules  lease sales near the well are likely to set off a public release of the data ImageSteel pipe marks the location of the  40 million KIC 1 exploratory well from 1986 CreditFran Durner Anchorage Daily NewsIn the meantime  the secrecy surrounding the results   and their location   remains a source of gossip  rumor and political intrigue In February  Alaska s new Republican governor  Mike Dunleavy  fired Hollis French  a Democrat on state s oil and gas conservation commission  In a letter the month before  the governor accused Mr  French of several transgressions  including disclosing to a journalist details of where the KIC 1 files were kept and the protocols for gaining access to them  Mr  French was not accused of revealing the actual data At a disciplinary hearing  another commissioner  Dan Seamount  said that after he concluded that Mr  French had divulged the data s location   in the dead of night we moved the information to somewhere more secure   fearing that many people wanted to get to the findings and that  all it would take would be a bulldozer and 15 minutes    My policy is to tell no one where the data reside  not even what country it resides in   Mr  Seamount said   It is arguably the most valuable well information in the world   

WASHINGTON   Tricia Newbold  the Trump administration s latest whistle blower  did something unexpected only hours after a House committee released her deposition that the White House had overruled career staff members who denied officials their security clearances  She went back to work  As you can imagine   Ms  Newbold  a 39 year old employee of the White House Personnel Security Office  wrote in an email during her commute on Monday   I am extremely nervous for how people at work will treat me  But according to people close to her  she was not afraid to tell them about the things she had seen  Ms  Newbold s decision to accuse her own office of rampant mismanagement of the security clearances of at least 25 employees came after months of what she characterized as personal discrimination and professional retaliation from Carl Kline  the office s former director  after she spent roughly a year trying to raise issues internally In a White House where aggressive leak investigations are conducted in service of President Trump  who has aides sign nondisclosure agreements  Ms  Newbold s account represents the rarest of developments  a damning on the record account

to the wall and she did what she had to do  Described as both  no nonsense  and  intense  by people who have interacted with her during the clearance process  Ms  Newbold has served under four presidential administrations  beginning with the Clinton White House in 2000  Eventually she worked her way up to adjudications manager  a job that required her to help make determinations about the security clearances of administration employees  Her office is filled with holdovers from other administrations  and it is meant to be nonpartisan Yet in the Trump administration the office was filled with people who had little experience in vetting employees in the interest of national security  Ms  Newbold said in a nine hour deposition with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform last week  There was no resolution   Ms  Newbold told the committee  according to a lengthy summary letter the panel s Democratic chairman published of her interview  which contained verbatim quotes   And I feel that right now this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office  Ms  Newbold told the committee that at least two senior administration officials had been granted security clearances   which gave them access to classified information   despite possible disqualifying issues  She also told the committee that she had compiled a list of at least 25 individuals  including contractors and senior advisers  who had a  wide range  of disqualifying information  including drug use  financial problems and criminal conduct In February  The New York Times reported that the president overruled several senior officials in order to reinstate the security clearance of Jared Kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  despite issues raised during his clearance process John F  Kelly  the president s former chief of staff  wrote a contemporaneous internal memo about how he had been  ordered  to give Mr  Kushner the top secret clearance  In her interviews with the House committee  Ms  Newbold said that Mr  Kelly and Joe Hagin  the former deputy chief of staff  had been attentive to the national security issues she had tried to raise Mr  Hagin resigned last June and Mr  Kelly in December  Mr  Trump has the legal authority to grant a clearance  but in most cases  the Personnel Security Office makes a determination about whether to grant one after the F B I  has conducted a background check Democrats on the committee are also demanding information from the White House about Ivanka Trump  the president s eldest daughter and adviser  who was granted a security clearance shortly after Mr  Kushner got his  In an interview with ABC News in February  Ms  Trump insisted her father had no hand in either her clearance or her husband s Ms  Newbold  who has a rare form of dwarfism  also accused Mr  Kline  the former director of personnel security  of retaliating against her when she repeatedly pointed out to him that actions he was taking  including overriding recommendations to issue clearances to two senior officials  were violating protocol  Ms  Newbold said that Mr  Kline oversaw a workplace where files   including extensive and sensitive background check documents   were not secured properly  and stopped the performing of credit checks for potential employees  She told the House committee that she had  never seen our office so ill staffed and with such lack of experience  Last fall  Ms  Newbold filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  accusing Mr  Kline of moving office files to a shelf several feet above her  deliberately out of her reach  beginning in December 2017  That month  she hired Mr  Passman  her lawyer  As little as I am  I m willing to fight and stand up for what I know is right  and they ve always respected that about me   Ms  Newbold told the House committee last week   It s humiliating to not be able to independently work and do the job that you need  In January  Ms  Newbold was suspended for two weeks without pay after NBC News reported that Mr  Kline had approved a security clearance for Mr  Kushner despite staff objections  The office s new director  Crede Bailey  said at the time that Ms  Newbold had refused to  support new procedures your supervisor implemented  Within the past two weeks  Mr  Passman said she was also removed from her supervisory role at work  On Monday  the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether she could expect to continue in her job  In the evening  Ms  Newbold s lawyer said she had gone back to work without incident Also on Monday  Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the committee s chairman  called for a subpoena for Mr  Kline  who now works at the Defense Department  to learn more about his work when he was the director of the office and about his interactions with Ms  Newbold  In a letter to Pat Cipollone  the White House counsel  Mr  Cummings said that the Trump administration had refused to provide information about  the problematic practices of the White House Security Office over the past two years  Republicans on the committee quickly sought to minimize what Ms  Newbold actually knew about the senior officials whose clearances were overturned  In a memo released on Monday  they said Mr  Cummings used only  cherry picked excerpts  from Ms  Newbold s deposition  and said she had acknowledged that the president had the  authority to grant access to national security information to anyone he chooses   The Republican members also pointed out that she had positive things to say about Mr  Bailey  her current supervisor Mr  Passman said Mr  Bailey s two week suspension of Ms  Newbold was  unwarranted   but added that  he s not personally attacking her like Kline did  It did not surprise Mr  Passman or other people close to Ms  Newbold that she returned to work   her choice to continue  kind of speaks for itself  about the kind of person she is  her older sister  Melissa Rahming  said in an interview on Monday   She s not afraid for what she s said   Ms  Rahming said  adding that her sister had  held her integrity this entire time  Daniel Jacobson  a former associate counsel in the Obama White House  called Ms  Newbold a  serious security professional  and a  total straight shooter  in a tweet on Monday  

Forty years after the 1979 revolution  Islamism is exhausting itself as a legitimizing force for the Islamic Republic of Iran  Studies sponsored by the Iranian government show that resentment toward the state s religious symbols is at an all time high  According to the research arm of the Iranian parliament  around 70 percent of Iranian women do not strictly follow the official diktats for wearing a veil  Anticlerical sentiments have turned violent  Regardless of their ties to the government  clerics are routinely attacked and stabbed in the streets by angry anti regime individuals Iran is responding by cautiously downplaying Islamism and emphasizing nationalism and foreign threats to win over disgruntled citizens  Iran s leaders acknowledged the societal shift away from Islamism by making unprecedented references to nationalism and showing their determination to incorporate patriotic sentiments into the state ideology during the 40th anniversary celebrations of the revolution in February Iran s supreme leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  has repeatedly appealed to Iranians to back the government  even if they do not endorse its Islamist ideology  for the sake of their country and for their own security The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  which was established to preserve the Islamic Republic and the ideals of the 1979 revolution  now portrays itself as the guardian of the nation and the symbol of Iranian power against foreign aggression  Images of the ancient Persepolis ruins and references to the pre Islamic Persian past have become omnipresent in the state controlled media The change in government strategy came as Iranians demonstrated a new yearning for nationalism  challenging the self proclaimed religious political system  Impromptu grass roots gatherings at the Tomb of Cyrus  the founder of the Persian Empire known for his tolerance toward conquered nations and other religions  surprised observers and prompted crackdowns by security forces Iranian leadership s anti Americanism is increasingly at odds with the Iranian people s long held desire for an end to their international isolation  People have openly rallied against the regime s use of religion  anti Americanism and its support of the Syrian government and proxy groups at the expense of their well being  During countrywide protests in 2018  many Iranians shouted   Let go of Syria  think about us  Popular pressure also played an important role in getting Iran to sign the 2015 nuclear deal  Iranians hoped that the deal would be a step toward forcing the regime to further open up to the world  In his book  National Security and Nuclear Diplomacy   President Hassan Rouhani acknowledges that the leadership paid close attention to the government s classified public surveys before making critical decisions with regard to the nuclear program Iran s supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guards commanders made no secret about their reluctance to accept the deal and what could follow  In his campaign for re election in 2017  Mr  Rouhani promised that after securing the nuclear deal  he would resolve other outstanding issues  implying establishing relations with the United States The election of Donald Trump  followed by his withdrawal from the nuclear deal and renewed American sanctions against Iran  has brought Mr  Rouhani s reformist momentum to a halt  Instead  a sense of betrayal by the United States and of a threat to the country s territorial integrity appears to be emerging among Iranians Iranian hard liners have sensed the beginning of a change in the popular mood  Two weeks ago  Kayhan  a daily newspaper known for its close ties to the supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guards  declared  The End of the Western Illusion  as  the greatest achievement  of the last Persian year  which ended on March 20  Iranian elites who once galvanized society and received votes with the promise of better relations with the United States now simply repeat the angry anti American rhetoric of their conservative rivals These days  Javad Zarif  Iran s once smiling foreign minister and the chief nuclear negotiator  sounds more like the former hard line president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  Even Ali Akbar Salehi  the M I T  educated head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and nuclear negotiator  recently said that everyone from the proponents to the opponents of the regime  and from the revolutionaries to the anti revolutionaries have come to believe that the United States is our enemy  In taking away Iran s nuclear leverage  reimposing the sanctions and heavily arming its regional rivals  the United States has intensified anxieties about national security in the republic  Consequently  a national security discourse that brings the elites and the masses together is being constructed  and the Trump administration is providing credibility for it The Islamic Republic of Iran has survived not just because of its security apparatus but also because its leaders have been able to manage public sentiments and intra elite conflicts  And Iran s leaders have found that President Trump s hostility toward Iran is helping to rally otherwise resentful citizens behind the regime and create a new cohesive Islamist nationalist ideology This could have a demobilizing effect on Iran s underground but still vibrant civil society and further boost the Revolutionary Guards  influence over foreign policy  There is less and less popular and elite opposition to Mr  Khamenei s claim that if the Revolutionary Guards did not fight terrorists in Damascus  it would be fighting them in Tehran  It is likely that many will consider investment in the regime an investment in their own and their homeland s security  What was once considered regime security is increasingly seen as national security For four decades  the American and Iranian governments have simultaneously pursued a system of reward and punishment against Iranian citizens for opposite goals  Washington has hoped to foment public uprisings leading to regime change  Tehran has sought compliance and regime durability Sanctions and isolation together with regime repression have often bred popular discontent  turning elections into political movements  and students and women into courageous protesters  Tapping into these sentiments  President Barack Obama conditioned better opportunities for the nation on a nuclear agreement in his messages on Nowruz  the Persian New Year  President Trump set a new bar for Iranian citizens in his Nowruz message on March 20  regime change Washington s unreliable policy toward Iran is jeopardizing the Iranian people s favorable view of the United States  Sanctions may have passed their optimal point of channeling public grievances against the regime  beyond which they only alienate Iranian citizens from the United States  The statements of American officials that they target the Iranian regime and not the people are a bad joke  To ordinary Iranians  they are targeting the people American policies are effectively empowering the hard liners and pushing Iranian citizens toward the regime  Exhausted by 40 years of state repression and international pressure  Iranian citizens may very well shift their anger from sponsors of the former to the latter and signal a reluctant preference for those who wear the garb of Persian nationalism and national security Mohammad Ayatollahi Tabaar  an associate professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A M University  is

WASHINGTON   House Democrats formally punted on releasing a budget blueprint on Tuesday  instead unveiling a bill that would increase military and domestic spending caps by more than  350 billion over the next two years The proposal frustrated fiscal hawks on both sides of the aisle and Democrats on the party s left flank who balked at the prospect of increasing military spending  It also meant that House Democrats  without a blueprint to counter the one the Trump administration released last month  had effectively opted out of outlining their own budget priorities in the face of a divided government and division within their caucus Several Democratic lawmakers and aides argued that with a Republican controlled Senate and White House  it would be futile to release a budget resolution  a nonbinding document that usually serves as a statement of priorities as opposed to actual policy  There is little chance that the budget proposals put forward by the Trump administration and the Senate Budget Committee could prevail in the House  By moving this bill forward  we will bring responsible governing back to the budget process  avoid uncertainty and the unrelenting threats of a government shutdown  and meet our obligations to the American people   said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky  the chairman of the House Budget Committee and a chief sponsor of the bill But the decision highlighted the friction within the Democratic Party over how to approach spending and what to prioritize in a budget document   and contradicted the new majority s promise for regular order  House Democrats are in disarray   Representative Steve Womack  Republican of Arkansas and the ranking member on the House Budget Committee  said in a statement   Their agenda is so full of contradictions that they re unable to govern  Republicans  with a majority in both the House and the Senate  failed to pass their own budget resolution last year  which Democrats denounced at the time Even before the Democrats  endeavor was released  Republicans had criticized it as hypocritical  with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader  echoing a mantra often used by Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Show me your budget  show me your values   They have no budget   Mr  McCarthy said last week at a news conference   Does that mean they have no values  But Mr  Yarmuth and other Democratic lawmakers said the legislation introduced on Tuesday would shift the focus to a more pressing issue  the spending caps enacted in 2011 under the Budget Control Act  which would automatically cut military and domestic spending by billions of dollars without action from Congress While Congress has made bipartisan deals to raise the caps for the current fiscal year  a failure to do so for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years would cut programs by  125 billion  I think the caps bill is exactly what s needed   said Joel Friedman  the vice president for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities   The Yarmuth solution is a better use of everyone s time and energy because of the political landscape we re facing  Lawmakers have generally waived the restrictions  first struck as part of a deal between congressional Republicans and President Barack Obama  in order to accommodate spending increases  Removing the caps would also jump start the process of funding the government in 2020  which Democratic leadership has said it wants to do well before the Sept  30 deadline  The budget resolution doesn t change the Budget Control Act numbers   said Mr  Yarmuth  who has spent the past few weeks meeting with members and discussing what a budget resolution would look like   The vast majority of the caucus thinks that s the No  1 priority  Fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill called for the release of a full budget  bemoaning the partisan decline of what they said was a fundamental responsibility for both parties  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the deal  which would also allow for funding increases to carry out the 2020 census and support tax enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service  would increase spending by roughly  2 trillion over the next decade  The way we ve been running our government is irresponsible   said Representative Stephanie Murphy  Democrat of Florida and a chairwoman of the Blue Dog Coalition  a fiscally conservative group of Democrats   It may take some political courage and some responsible governing  but we have to get back to a time when we set our priorities in a budget   We should be able to pass a bipartisan budget  and there was a time when we were able to do that   she added in an interview Democrats on the party s left flank said Mr  Yarmuth s proposal allocated too much money to military spending   money they argued should be directed toward domestic programs  You cannot be opposed to Trump s foreign policy of militarism and then vote for the budgets that carry it out   Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and a vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus  said in an interview   The defense increases are totally unjustified  In a statement released late Tuesday  Mr  Khanna  a member of the Budget Committee  said he would encourage those  who are committed to a progressive agenda to join me in opposing defense funding for endless wars  It is unclear how Mr  Yarmuth s legislation will fare before a committee meeting on Wednesday afternoon Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the majority leader  said he thought that Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  would try to delay a deal on the spending caps until the end of the year to have more leverage in negotiations  It shouldn t be difficult   Mr  Hoyer told reporters  But  he added   I think that s what the administration has concluded  that they ll have more leverage at the end of the year

WASHINGTON   The Justice Department defended Attorney General William P  Barr s handling of the special counsel report on Thursday  saying that it had to be scrubbed of sensitive information  amid revelations that some members of the office have said he failed to adequately portray their findings and the extent to which they could damage President Trump  Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter  the attorney general decided to release the report s bottom line findings and his conclusions immediately   without attempting to summarize the report   with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process   a Justice Department spokeswoman  Kerri Kupec  said in a statement At issue is a four page letter that Mr  Barr wrote to lawmakers on March 24 outlining the main findings of the nearly two year investigation by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  Quoting sparingly from the nearly 400 page report delivered to him two days earlier  the attorney general revealed that Mr  Mueller had declined to decide whether the president illegally obstructed the inquiry and that Mr  Barr himself had stepped in to conclude that Mr  Trump did not commit an obstruction offense  Some of the Mueller investigators said that the attorney general failed to adequately represent their findings  Some of Mr  Mueller s investigators have told associates in recent days that Mr  Barr could have released more of their own work  government officials and others familiar with their frustrations told The New York Times for an article published on Wednesday Mr  Trump attacked the article  falsely asserting on Twitter that Times reporters relied on  no legitimate sources   a longstanding tactic of his to try to dismiss news reports that portray him negatively Read Attorney General William Barr s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter  by Attorney General William P  Barr  details the main findings of the special counsel s two year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election Mr  Barr has told lawmakers that his letter was an update of his progress in reviewing the report and that the document was not intended to fulfill a requirement under Justice Department regulations that he send a summary to Congress at the end of any special counsel investigation  Though Ms  Kupec said Mr  Barr was not trying to summarize the report  she was referring only to the regulatory requirement for a summary Ms  Kupec also said that the report and its release were subject to the regulations  which stipulate that Mr  Mueller prepare a confidential document of his findings intended only for the attorney general  She also said that sensitive information had to be blacked out first  noting that  every page of the  confidential report   was marked with a warning that it may contain secret grand jury testimony  Mr  Barr and other law enforcement officials are also reviewing the document for classified material  information about continuing investigations and derogatory details about third parties not directly related to the inquiry The attorney general has said he is aiming to send to lawmakers a redacted version of the report by mid April  Under the regulations  he is free to release parts or all of it if he decides it is in the public interest The special counsel s report included summaries of the major findings  and some team members believed Mr  Barr should have included more of their material in his March 24 letter  according to the government officials  But the attorney general  does not believe the report should be released in a  serial or piecemeal fashion    Ms  Kupec said  citing a letter that Mr  Barr wrote to lawmakers on Friday Justice Department officials have also said they determined that the summaries contained sensitive information that needed to be reviewed before they were released Democrats have demanded full access to the report  The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to let its chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  use a subpoena to compel Mr  Barr to turn over a complete copy of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation Mr  Nadler said on Thursday that the reports about frustration among members of the special counsel team would not alter his plan to give Mr  Barr a bit more time to hand over the report voluntarily before issuing a subpoena  It is his duty to release the entire report   Mr  Nadler said of Mr  Barr   We were demanding he do so and he hasn t done so  But given the frustrations expressed by some of Mr  Mueller s investigators  Mr  Nadler asked Mr  Barr in a letter on Thursday to turn over all communications between the special counsel s office and other Justice Department officials about the report  including discussions about the disclosure of the report to Congress or the public and about Mr  Barr s March 24 letter Mr  Nadler also said that Mr  Barr had undermined his own desire to release the report all at once when he outlined the principal conclusions  in a fashion that appears to minimize the implications of the report as to the president  And Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee  said on Thursday that he would ask the Senate to pass a resolution calling for the Justice Department to provide transparency on the results of the special counsel s work But Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  has taken a far different tack  He told reporters on Thursday that he had no interest in  retrying  the Mueller investigation and trusted Mr  Barr to fairly present its findings  I don t think Barr misrepresented the Mueller conclusions   Mr  Graham said   I don t have any interest in taking all the work product and re litigating it  That s enough for me   

On Friday  Lucy Flores  a former Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada  accused Joe Biden of touching her inappropriately as they waited to take the stage at a 2014 election rally  He put his hands on her shoulders  she said  then nuzzled her hair and kissed the back of her head  She didn t accuse Biden  who is reportedly close to announcing his presidential candidacy  of sexual harassment or assault  just of making her uncomfortable   I m not suggesting that Biden broke any laws  but the transgressions that society deems minor  or doesn t even see as transgressions  often feel considerable to the person on the receiving end   she wrote In response  Biden released a statement saying that while he s often been physically affectionate as a politician   not once   never   did I believe I acted inappropriately  Then  on Monday  Amy Lappos  a former aide to the Democratic congressman Jim Himes  told The Hartford Courant  that Biden pulled her toward him to rub noses during a 2009 fund raiser   There s absolutely a line of decency   Lappos said  adding   Crossing that line is not grandfatherly  It s not cultural  It s not affection  It s sexism or misogyny   Biden s campaign hadn t yet begun and was already in crisis  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Flores  Lappos and Biden are probably all telling the truth  There are countless photos of Biden behaving in the ways that Flores and Lappos describe  squeezing women  rubbing their shoulders  leaning in too close  All this was open  not furtive  presumably because it never occurred to Biden that he was doing anything untoward I don t necessarily blame him  In the past few years  women have been calling out daily indignities that previous generations grew up quietly tolerating  lingering hugs from a boss  embarrassing intimate questions  crude office jokes  Individually  these are small acts  and most men probably don t understand how cumulatively draining they can be  Women  after all  have only recently begun to articulate it I received plenty of unwanted shoulder massages when I was younger  and for a long time I assumed there was something wrong with me when they made me flinch  It was affirming to finally realize that other women also hated routine invasions of their personal space  But if it wasn t always obvious to me that the men were at fault in these awkward encounters  it might not have been obvious to them  either So I don t think Biden s avuncular pawing is a  MeToo story   Lappos specifically said the way he grabbed her  wasn t sexual    But if Biden was more oblivious than predatory  his history still puts him out of step with the mores of an increasingly progressive Democratic Party  On Sunday  The New York Times reported that some Democrats are bracing  for an extended reckoning about Mr  Biden and gender if he enters the race   The inevitably of such a reckoning should make Biden reconsider getting in Biden s issues with gender  after all  go far beyond chronic handsiness  His waffling on reproductive choice troubles many feminists  as The Times reported last week  Biden s  back and forth over abortion would become a hallmark of his political career   He was the chairman of the hearings on Clarence Thomas s Supreme Court nomination  where Anita Hill  who accused Thomas of sexual harassment  was demeaned and dismissed  Though Biden has expressed sorrow for how Hill was treated  he s never directly apologized to her Beyond gender  on issue after issue  if Biden runs for president he will have to run away from his own record  He   and by extension  we   will have to relive the debate over the Iraq war  which he voted to authorize  He ll have to explain his vote to repeal the Glass Steagall Act  which  by lifting regulations on banking  helped create the conditions for the 2008 financial meltdown   Biden has called that vote one of the biggest regrets of his career   In 2016  Hillary Clinton was slammed for her previous support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act  which contributed to mass incarceration  Biden helped write the law  which he called  in 2015  the  1994 Biden crime bill  None of this means that Democrats need to disavow Biden  He is by most accounts a man of great personal decency  As vice president  he pushed Barack Obama s administration in the right direction on issues including gay marriage and campus sexual assault  It s not surprising that he leads most polls of 2020 Democrats  he is well known and well loved RELATEDMore from Opinion on Joe Biden Opinion  Lessons From a Complaint Against Joe BidenApril 1  2019Opinion   Michael Tomasky  The Biden Paradox  and How to Solve ItMarch 12  2019Opinion

Trump is unwarranted  In recent years  neither party has done well when they ve chosen candidates who were meant to appeal to some elusive cadre of swing voters but lacked a robust grass roots base  On paper  the war heroes John Kerry and John McCain looked electable  Obama and Trump did not  To those desperate to unseat Trump  the centrist  establishment Biden might seem like the safest choice  but it would actually be risky to pick a candidate who will need to constantly apologize for himself Particularly when he doesn t know how to do that very well  In response to Flores  Biden could have told her that he was sorry for making her uneasy  Instead  he focused on his intentions rather than her experience  a faint echo of the way he d ignored Hill s experience decades ago  No one should judge the whole span of Biden s career by the standards of 2019  but if he s going to run for president  it s fair to ask whether he s the right leader for this moment  He is a product of his time

WASHINGTON   Senate Democrats blocked a Republican disaster aid bill  saying more money is needed to help hurricane torn Puerto Rico  But President Donald Trump opposes additional funding and says the U S  territory is getting more disaster money than some states The move tossed long sought relief for victims of hurricanes  floods and Western wildfires into limbo and escalated a fight between Democrats and Trump  who said Tuesday that he is the  best thing  that ever happened to Puerto Rico Trump claimed additional funding would come at the expense of U S  farmers and states  and attacked the island s political leaders  alleging they  only take from USA   Puerto Rico s residents are U S  citizens White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said it was  ridiculous  to question Trump s commitment to the people of Puerto Rico  but called the island  that country  in an interview with MSNBC  Gidley claimed the error was  a mistake  Monday s 44 49 vote fell short of a majority  much less the 60 votes required to overcome a Democratic filibuster  sending GOP leaders back to the drawing board and seeming unlikely to kill disaster aid efforts outright  since there is much political support to send aid to Southern farmers  wildfire ravaged California towns and Midwestern flood victims  Our work on this subject is far from finished   Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   said on Tuesday Trump allies such as Sens  David Perdue  R Ga   and Rick Scott  R Fla   are among the strongest backers of the legislation  We will get this done eventually   Perdue said  promising relief to struggling farmers in his state The path forward is unclear  but a leading option is for the Senate to pass a more narrowly drawn bill simply to get the issue into a House Senate conference committee  House Democrats insist the talks must produce a final measure with help for Puerto Rico Democrats say Trump has been slow to release already appropriated funding for Puerto Rico and has shown little urgency in helping the island  Trump criticized the island s government at a meeting with Senate Republicans last week and suggested Puerto Rico has gotten too much disaster help compared with states such as Texas  using inflated numbers to make his case  Just as we leave no soldier behind on the battlefield  we help our fellow Americans when there s a disaster  wherever the disaster strikes  We do not abandon them  Period   said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y Trump complained in a pair of tweets Tuesday about the island s leadership and said  91 billion destined for Puerto Rico is  more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before    all their local politicians do is complain   ask for more money  He said the politicians there are  grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA   The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J  Trump   the president continued   So many wonderful people  but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted  Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments  and so little appreciation  Puerto Rico Gov  Ricardo Rossello responded with his own tweets  stating in part   Mr  President  this  place  you refer to   PuertoRico  is home to over three million proud Americans that are still recovering from the storm and in need of federal assistance  We are not your adversaries  we are your citizens  Rossello also asked that all senators approve the disaster aid bill and disputed Trump s numbers  claiming that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved only  300 million in permanent work projects  not  91 billion The  13 5 billion Senate measure mostly mirrors a  14 2 billion measure the House passed in January  combining aid to Southern farmers  California communities devastated by last summer s wildfire  and hurricane hit states such as Florida  Georgia and North Carolina  Hurricane damaged military bases in Florida and North Carolina would receive rebuilding funds Democrats want to add almost  700 million more to unlock further disaster aid for Puerto Rico and several states  including help to rebuild badly damaged water systems  Democrats are also trying to force the administration to release billions of dollars in rebuilding funds that have already been approved McConnell said the Senate measure is the fastest way to get aid to the South and the Midwest  along with nutrition aid to Puerto Rico  where food stamp benefits have already been cut  It is the only bill on the table with any provision for the Midwest flooding   McConnell said   And it s the only bill on the table that could earn a presidential signature in time to deliver urgent relief on the nutrition assistance in Puerto Rico  Political momentum for the measure   strongly backed by Trump s allies in Georgia  Florida and North Carolina  among other states   has only been heightened by massive flooding in Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Iowa  whose nominating caucuses are the first test for Democrats hoping to challenge Trump next year  The GOP measure would make Midwestern states eligible for more aid  and by blocking the bill  Democratic presidential contenders in the Senate are likely to face criticism Trump has yet to veto a spending bill despite some tough talk  and he has signed off on  600 million to ease food stamp cuts in Puerto Rico Trump s  91 billion estimate  said a White House spokesman  includes about  50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements  along with  41 million already approved  Actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed slowly from federal coffers

WASHINGTON   In the first address to Congress by a NATO head  Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday acknowledged serious divisions within the alliance and called for bigger defense budgets to cope with global challenges such as Russian assertiveness  the core reason NATO was created in Washington 70 years ago this week  We have to be frank   Stoltenberg said before a joint meeting of Congress   Questions are being asked on both sides of the Atlantic about the strength of our partnership  And  yes  there are differences  The NATO secretary general credited President Donald Trump with compelling allies to spend more on defense  without noting that Trump also has questioned the value of the alliance and suggested that some members are freeloaders Trump s criticisms have upset a delicate balance within an alliance that has long counted on Washington to be its leader  Stoltenberg s speech provided a diplomatic counterpoint to Trump s sometimes derisive rhetoric  and the enthusiastic reception he received from both parties in the House was testament to an enduring pro NATO consensus in Congress  The secretary general delivered to Congress a powerful affirmation of the value of the NATO alliance   said Rep  Mac Thornberry  a Texas Republican James Stavridis  a retired Navy admiral who was NATO s top commander from 2009 to 2013  called the Stoltenberg address a high point in recent U S  European relations  Given the president s evident and frequently vocalized skepticism of the alliance  it is clear that Congress   on a bipartisan basis   wants to put the full weight of the legislative branch behind NATO   Stavridis said   We will never find a better pool of allies in the world than the Europeans  and this address underscores the importance of the trans Atlantic bridge  which has been creaking a bit lately  Trump s criticisms are not NATO s only source of friction  The alliance also is at odds with long time member Turkey over its planned purchase of a Russian air defense system that is not compatible with the allied air defenses  The Trump administration is threatening to stop delivery to Turkey of the newest U S  fighter jet  the F 35  if the Turks go through with their plan to buy Russia s advanced S 400 system instead of the American Patriot system Escalating that fight  Vice President Mike Pence scolded Turkey at a NATO 70th anniversary event following Stoltenberg s speech  He said the Russian S 400 system  poses great danger to NATO   and suggested that Turkey needs to decide between NATO and Russia  Turkey must choose   he said   Does it want to remain a critical partner of the most successful military alliance in the history of the world  or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making reckless decisions that undermine our alliance  Stoltenberg made a point of highlighting the benefits to the United States of having NATO allies  He noted  for example  that in response to the attacks of Sept  11  2001  NATO invoked Article 5 of its founding charter to come to the aid of a member under attack  He said allies also provide the U S  with valuable military support in peacetime  from tracking submarines in the Arctic to providing bases in Europe from which the U S  can project power  Our alliance has not lasted for 70 years out of a sense of nostalgia or of sentiment   he said   NATO lasts because it is in the national interest of each and every one of our countries  Stoltenberg on Thursday will lead a meeting of NATO foreign ministers  hosted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  to mark 70 years since the alliance s founding charter  the North Atlantic Treaty  The alliance has grown from its original 12 members to 29  with the Republic of North Macedonia about to become the 30th member country Stoltenberg  a two time former prime minister of Norway  is the first head of NATO to address a joint meeting of Congress  He touted the alliance s long record of partnership but also noted it has a history of coping with internal divisions  including strong opposition by France  Germany and other members to the 2003 U S  invasion of Iraq  Open discussions and different views is not a sign of weakness   he said   It is a sign of strength  So we should not be surprised when we see differences between our countries  Today there are disagreements on issues such as trade  energy  climate change and the Iran nuclear deal  These are serious issues with serious disagreements  Trump has sharply criticized other NATO members  including Germany  for not meeting spending targets  On Tuesday  he praised the generally upward trend among the European allies  but hounded them to pay even more because he believes America still shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of protecting Europe In a meeting at the White House  Trump and Stoltenberg had kind words for each other  But in the past  Trump has called NATO  obsolete  and suggested he might pull the U S  out of the alliance if member nations didn t significantly boost defense spending  We ve worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair share   Trump told reporters   At some point  it s going to have to go higher  Trump took credit for the increased spending  However  spending by NATO countries  which dropped after the end of the Cold War  has actually been rising since 2014  before Trump took office  After Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimean Peninsula  member countries agreed to boost defense budgets and  move toward  spending 2  of their gross domestic products on defense by 2024  The U S  spends about 3 4  of its GDP on defense Since Trump took office  European allies and Canada have added  41 billion to their defense budgets  By the end of next year  this is scheduled to reach  100 billion  Stoltenberg said  Germany remains the main target of Trump s ire because it plans to spend 1 5   below the 2  guideline  by 2024 Stoltenberg has said the 2  guideline was not invented by the United States and was a target the 29 allies set in 2014  The allies are really stepping up   Stoltenberg said in an interview with The Associated Press    Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann and Susannah George in Washington and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report  

BRUSSELS   The United States and its allies are stepping up cooperation in response to Russian aggression  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday while playing down differences among members as the military alliance marks its 70th anniversary Foreign ministers from NATO countries are meeting in Washington this week for the occasion  determined to show a united front in the midst of a long military stalemate in Afghanistan and tensions with Russia returned to Cold War era levels But as NATO deploys thousands of troops and equipment to deter Russia and seeks solutions to fast evolving new threats such as cyberattacks and hybrid warfare  its biggest challenge arguably lies within  Damaging infighting over defense spending and authoritarian tendencies exhibited by some allies undermine NATO s values  according to experts  The strength of NATO is that despite these differences  we have always been able to unite around our core tasks  That is  to protect and defend each other   NATO chief Stoltenberg said in Brussels before the trip Stoltenberg has talks with U S  President Donald Trump planned for Tuesday  He is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday A big source of the internal strain is Trump s recurrent demand that countries devote an amount equal to at least 2 percent of GDP to defense spending   though that metric takes no account of how well the money is spent   as well as the U S  president s reluctance to criticize strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin  NATO s single greatest challenge is the absence of strong  principled American presidential leadership for the first time in its history   two former U S  envoys to NATO  Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute  wrote in a report for the alliance anniversary Trump  they said  is seen by allies as NATO s  most urgent  and often most difficult  problem  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified last week before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in Washington  He was asked if he was familiar with the report by Burns and Lute Pompeo said he hadn t read the report but he had known Lute since he was a young military office and had  great respect for him   But on the subject of Trump and NATO  Lute was  just simply wrong   Pompeo said If the conclusion he drew that President Trump is the biggest impediment to NATO  he s just simply wrong   he added   We have worked diligently to make NATO stronger  I am convinced that we have done so  Trump made a memorable impression on leaders from Canada and European nations during his first NATO summit in May 2017  During a speech outside NATO s new Brussels headquarters  he publicly humiliated them  Trump also cast doubt on whether they could count on Washington to fulfill NATO s collective defense clause The speech was delivered by a memorial made from a twisted piece of the World Trade Center towers felled by al Qaida s airliner attacks on Sept  11  2011  Since the founding Washington Treaty was signed on April 4  1949  NATO has only once activated the clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on them all  after the 9 11 attacks Trump also delayed a summit last year with fresh demands on burden sharing  That time  at least  his dressing down about the U S  spending more on defense than the other NATO members combined happened behind closed doors Trump s routine tirades have fueled suspicion his aim mostly is to drum up business for the U S  defense industry But the attitude of Trump   who walked away from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate change agreement his allies in Europe value while making tariff threats against them   also is similar to authoritarian or populist streaks showing up in NATO members Turkey  Hungary  Italy and Poland  The political and trans Atlantic unity that underpins NATO has been weakened  Only bad guys benefit from trans Atlantic division and a U S  retreat from its global leadership role   Anders Fogh Rasmussen  Stoltenberg s predecessor as NATO s top civilian official  said in an email exchange with The Associated Press  We see the consequences of U S  retreat  with autocrats and dictators filling the vacuum   he added Burns and Lute say this retreat from democracy  individual freedoms and the rule of law is  a potentially cancerous threat  Still  NATO has survived formidable challenges over the decades  including the Cuban missile crisis and the missile race in Europe  It s also remained intact after internal divisions over the Suez Canal  the Iraq war  and France s departure from the alliance s command structure  Officials say they are confident NATO will endure now  too The White House said last month in a statement about Stoltenberg s talks with Trump on Tuesday that the two would  discuss the unprecedented success of NATO  including the recent increased commitments on burden sharing among European allies and ways to address the current  evolving challenges facing the alliance  Trump is not scheduled to appear at the upcoming talks of NATO foreign ministers  but he is expected to attend a leaders  summit in London in mid December  I hope we will not see a repeat of President Trump s antics in Brussels last year  It s time for the world s democracies to show their unity   Rasmussen said    Deb Riechmann contributed from Washington  

WASHINGTON   A Democratic led congressional committee voted on Tuesday to subpoena a former White House security clearance chief over whistleblower allegations that the Trump administration inappropriately reversed career officials  decisions to deny security clearances to some of the president s advisers Elijah Cummings  chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee  led the push to subpoena Carl Kline  who was White House personnel security chief for the first two years of Trump s presidency and now works for the Department of Defense  The committee voted to approve the subpoena for Kline  with 22 Democrats voting in favor and 15 Republicans against In a letter sent to White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Monday  Cummings said Kline had not responded to the committee s requests that he testify voluntarily Cummings said the White House and Kline s lawyer on Monday responded he would voluntarily testify but would not answer questions about specific security clearance cases or violations  Cummings said on Tuesday these conditions were unacceptable  Tricia Newbold  a career security official at the White House for 18 years  has said the Trump administration overruled security experts to give questionable security clearances to more than two dozen people  who congressional sources said included Republican President Donald Trump s daughter Ivanka Trump and son in law Jared Kushner  In a letter to the White House on Monday  Cummings said Newbold detailed the cases of three anonymous  senior White House officials  whose clearances career officials recommended should be denied  though the White House went ahead and granted clearances to two of the three unnamed individuals  Two sources familiar with the congressional investigation said that two of the senior officials whose clearances Newbold said were initially denied were Ivanka Trump and Kushner The White House on Tuesday shot back at Democratic moves to issue a subpoena for Kline  These requests are absolutely ridiculous   White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in an interview on MSNBC  adding that the White House would not cooperate with Cummings  demands on security clearances    Reporting by Mark Hosenball  editing by Jonathan Oatis  

WASHINGTON   The Latest on disaster aid bill in Congress  all times local  6 15 p m Senate Democrats have successfully blocked a GOP disaster aid bill  saying it doesn t do enough to help hurricane torn Puerto Rico The move escalates a fight between Democrats and President Donald Trump  who opposes further rebuilding aid to the U S  island territory  which was slammed by back to back hurricanes in 2017 The  13 5 billion GOP measure would have sped badly needed disaster relief to southern farmers  wildfire ravaged California towns and Midwestern flood victims  Democrats say more money is needed to help Puerto Rico rebuild its water system and finance additional disaster relief  and they say Trump has acted indifferently toward Puerto Ricans and their struggles The move by Democrats sends GOP leaders back to the drawing board but appears unlikely to kill disaster aid efforts outright since there is such sweeping support   2 p m A fight between President Donald Trump and Democrats over hurricane relief for Puerto Rico is imperiling a widely backed disaster aid bill that s a top priority for some of the president s Southern GOP allies Trump feels antipathy toward Puerto Rico s government and Senate Republicans are taking a hard line in denying Democratic demands for more aid for the U S  territory  which was devastated by back to back hurricanes in 2017 Democrats are poised to block the GOP bill in a showdown Senate vote on Monday afternoon  It s a risky move  but top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York appears confident that a successful filibuster will drive Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell toward compromise  

AUSTIN  Texas   Democratic presidential candidate Julin Castro on Tuesday called for the U S  to end criminalizing illegal border crossings under an immigration plan that marks the first policy rollout of his 2020 campaign The former San Antonio mayor unveiled his proposals at a time when President Donald Trump is threatening to shut down the southern border with Mexico  Castro  who is still searching for a toehold in a crowded Democratic field  is also now going further on immigration than his 2020 rivals who have all widely condemned Trump s border crackdowns and rhetoric  The truth is  immigrants seeking refuge in our country aren t a threat to national security  Migration shouldn t be a criminal justice issue   Castro wrote in a blog post laying out his plan Castro is the grandson of a Mexican immigrant and the only Latino candidate in the field   He has made reversing Trump s hardline approach to immigration a central part of his campaign since entering the race in January  and like other candidates  has called for pathways to citizenship and stopping construction on a U S  Mexico border wall But his new immigration platform now includes specifics that would include making being in the U S  illegally a civil  and not criminal penalty  Trump s  zero tolerance  policy on illegal border crossings called for prosecuting every adult  even if it meant splitting families Castro is also calling for reconstituting U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement by splitting the agency in half and putting enforcement duties elsewhere  Other candidates have been less detailed about their plans for ICE  which some in the party s liberal flank have called to abolish Castro announced a rally in his hometown of San Antonio later this month at the same time Trump is expected to make a fundraising swing through Texas     

WASHINGTON   U S  Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to deter Russia from meddling in U S  elections by threatening stiff sanctions on its banking  energy and defense industries and sovereign debt The  Deter Act  is the latest effort by U S  lawmakers to increase pressure on Moscow over what they see as a range of bad behavior  from its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria s civil war to attempts to influence U S  elections The measure was introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen  a Democrat  and Marco Rubio  a Republican  They offered a similar measure last year  when it also had bipartisan support but was never brought up for a vote by the Senate s Republican leaders  who have close ties to President Donald Trump Trump has gone along with some previous congressional efforts to increase sanctions on Russia  although sometimes reluctantly  Backers of stronger action against Russia believe such measures will have better prospects in 2019  given control of the House of Representatives by Democrats  who are less reluctant than Trump s fellow Republicans to push back against the White House According to details of the legislation  first reported by Reuters  it would require the U S  Director of National Intelligence  DNI  to determine  within 30 days of any federal election  whether Russia or other foreign government or anyone acting as an agent of that government  had engaged in election interference If the DNI found such interference occurred  the act would require  among other things  that mandatory sanctions be imposed within 10 days on  among others  Russian banks and energy companies The act would mandate that sanctions be imposed on two or more of the following Russian banks  Sberbank  VTB Bank  Gazprombank  Vnesheconombank and Rosselkhozbank It also would order the prohibition of all transactions subject to U S  jurisdiction in Russian sovereign debt  Russian government bonds and the debt of any entity owned or controlled by Russia s government The sanctions would include blocking   freezing without seizing   any assets in the United States of those targeted for sanction  including senior Russian political figures and business leaders Russia denies trying to influence U S  elections  But U S  intelligence and law enforcement agencies have found that Moscow sought to intervene in the 2016 vote to boost Trump s chances of winning the White House An investigation by U S  Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not establish that members of Trump s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election  according to a summary released by U S  Attorney General William Barr last month The Deter Act is targeted at Russia but notes that U S  intelligence has identified China  Iran and North Korea as other major foreign government cyber threats  It also asks that Trump s administration present Congress with a strategy on preventing interference in U S  elections for each of those countries and other countries of significant concern The senators timed the bill s release to come after the end of Mueller s investigation  which has cast a shadow over the first two years of Trump s presidency  and just before an address to Congress by Jens Stoltenberg  secretary general of the NATO alliance  who has focused on the threat posed by Russia   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle  Editing by Peter Cooney and Bill Trott  

WASHINGTON   The Democratic led U S  House Judiciary Committee said it will vote on Wednesday on whether to authorize subpoenas to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election Lawmakers will also consider subpoenas for underlying evidence from Mueller s investigation and from five former aides to President Donald Trump  including White House counsel Donald McGahn and political adviser Steve Bannon  The committee said on Monday that they may have documents related to the Mueller probe Democrats have become increasingly frustrated over U S  Attorney General William Barr s plan to share only a redacted copy of the nearly 400 page investigative report with Congress  The committee will vote on a resolution to allow House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler to issue subpoenas at his own discretion The Mueller report describes his office s 22 month probe  which did not establish that members of Trump s campaign conspired with Russia but also did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice  according to a four page summary Barr released on March 24  Barr said Mueller s team had not found enough proof to warrant bringing obstruction charges against the president Trump and the White House have hailed the conclusions as a victory for the president  But Democrats have taken issue with Barr s intervention   Congress  not the attorney general  has a duty under the Constitution to determine whether wrongdoing has occurred   Nadler wrote in a New York Times Op Ed on Monday   It is not the attorney general s job to step in and substitute his judgment for the special counsel s  That responsibility falls to Congress   and specifically to the House Judiciary Committee   as it has in every similar investigation in modern history  A week ago  Nadler and the Democratic heads of five other House committees gave Barr until Tuesday to provide the full Mueller report and underlying evidence  Barr said he would issue his redacted version by mid April or sooner Trump on Monday took aim at Democrats in the aftermath of the Mueller probe   No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report  it will never be good enough  Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing   the president said on Twitter  Republicans on the judiciary panel say Congress does not need the unredacted Mueller report to do its job and accuse Democrats of setting arbitrary deadlines as part of a partisan campaign to undermine Trump ahead of the 2020 election   The attorney general has already demonstrated transparency above and beyond what is required   Representative Doug Collins  the top Republican on the judiciary committee  said in a statement  But Democrats say Republicans helped set a precedent for Congress to obtain underlying investigative material during their investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state  The committee said the Justice Department gave Congress more than 880 000 pages of internal investigative records from the Clinton probe as well as classified and sensitive law enforcement information from an early Russia probe that Mueller took over  In addition to McGahn and Bannon  the committee will consider subpoenas for former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks  former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson The five former Trump aides were among 81 individuals  agencies and other entities that received document requests on March 4 as part of the committee s obstruction and corruption investigation of Trump and his associates   Reporting by David Morgan and David Alexander in Washington  Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld in New York  Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   The U S  Justice Department on Thursday defended its handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report examining contacts between President Donald Trump s 2016 campaign and Russia as it faced increased pressure to make the document public The department said Attorney General William Barr must strike confidential information from the nearly 400 page document as reports surfaced in the news media that members of Mueller s team were unhappy with the way Barr had characterized its main conclusions House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler  already pressing Barr to release the entire unredacted report to Congress  expanded his demands  Nadler  a Democrat  called on Barr to immediately release summaries of the document prepared by Mueller s team  He also asked Barr to hand over communications between the special counsel s team and the department about the report The department said those summaries include secret grand jury information that cannot under law be made public Barr  appointed by the Republican president  has pledged to release a redacted version of the report by mid April Barr said last week that Mueller s 22 month inquiry did not establish that Trump s campaign conspired with Russia in the election  Barr also said Mueller also did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump had illegally interfered with the Russia investigation  which has cast a shadow over his presidency While Mueller did not exonerate Trump  Barr said he then concluded there was not enough evidence to show that Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice The New York Times and the Washington Post reported that some investigators were unhappy with the way Barr had described their findings  in a sign of tensions between some members of Mueller s team and administration officials overseeing the report s release Every page of Mueller s report contains a warning that it might contain confidential material  so Barr decided first to release the report s main findings as quickly as possible  Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said  The Department continues to work with the Special Counsel on appropriate redactions to the report so that it can be released to Congress and the public   Kupec said in a statement The Judiciary Committee authorized Nadler on Wednesday to subpoena the department to obtain Mueller s full report  moving closer to a legal clash with the Trump administration Congress  not Barr  should determine what gets made public  Nadler said  He has yet to issue a subpoena   We are entitled to that information and we need that information   Nadler told reporters on Thursday FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress he had not seen Mueller s report   Additional reporting by David Morgan and Sarah N  Lynch  Editing by Will Dunham and Ross Colvin  

MILWAUKEE   With their recent selection of Milwaukee for their party s 2020 convention  Democrats left little doubt that they believe their path to the White House runs through the Midwest in general and Wisconsin in particular Their optimism spiked in November  when Democrats defeated Scott Walker  the state s two term conservative governor  And they were energized and optimistic again this week for an intensely politicized State Supreme Court election they hoped would show Wisconsin trending steadily blue Then reality hit  A conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory on Tuesday  underscoring instead how competitive Wisconsin politics remain For Democrats  an intense effort to rebuild their Midwestern  blue wall  for 2020 is showing gains in Michigan and Pennsylvania  both of which President Trump captured in 2016  On Tuesday  Democrats flipped a key Pennsylvania State Senate seat that Republicans had long held outside Pittsburgh  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  But in Wisconsin  the apparent loss of the State Supreme Court race   Judge Hagedorn leads by nearly 6 000 votes and a recount is possible   underscored what strategists in both parties said in interviews this week  The state is a tossup in 2020 and its political identity is very much in flux  Republicans know they need this state and are going to fight like hell to keep it in President Trump s column   said Joe Zepecki  a Democratic strategist in Wisconsin  He said that Mr  Walker s loss in November may have fired up the conservative base just as Hillary Clinton s 2016 loss did for Democrats last November  They re coming with everything they ve got   he said of Republicans   That means we have work to do  Wisconsin s reputation as a battleground state is well earned  In the three closest presidential elections of recent times   2000  2004 and 2016   Wisconsin was decided by the narrowest average margin of any other state  less than one percentage point in each election Mr  Walker lost his re election bid for governor by less than one percentage point  after warning all year of a coming blue wave  Over the weekend  Mr  Walker offered a pep talk to Republican activists in Milwaukee about the stakes in electing Judge Hagedorn  a former lead counsel to his administration  who defended contentious election issues such as a voter ID law  Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field  Democrats wanted to defeat Judge Hagedorn and gain a liberal Supreme Court majority  Mr  Walker warned  so they could seize control of redistricting after 2020 and  get rid of one  maybe two seats that we currently have in the House of Representatives  Democrats  haven t forgotten about how close the election was  in 2016  Mr  Walker told party activists gathered for breakfast at the American Serb Hall in Milwaukee   They re not going to make that mistake again  ImageA conservative judge  Brian Hagedorn  appeared to win a narrow  upset victory for the State Supreme Court on Tuesday  underscoring how competitive Wisconsin politics remain CreditRick Wood Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  via Associated PressMark Jefferson  executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party  said Judge Hagedorn s apparent victory showed the power of the party s engaged conservative base  The grass roots took offense to the attacks on Hagedorn s Christian faith   he said  referring to news accounts that the judge founded a Christian school that allows firing teachers in same sex relationships But others say Mr  Walker s midterm loss is probably a more relevant bellwether for 2020 than the Supreme Court race  because turnout was more than twice as high  and Mr  Walker is a polarizing  partisan figure in Wisconsin  much like the president Barry White  a lawyer who voted for Mr  Walker in 2010 but snubbed him in 2018 in favor of his Democratic opponent  Tony Evers  said he had wanted to make a bigger point  His ballot was  a repudiation of Trump and Republicans that insist on carrying his water   Mr  White said   It was the only message I could send  Mr  White lives in the Milwaukee suburbs  the state s most populous Republican region  Mr  Evers s gains there last year were a key to his narrow victory  In an interview  Mr  Walker said that should be a lesson to Mr  Trump   To win  he s going to have to improve his numbers in the suburbs   he said   With the passion the opposition is going to have  he s going to have to make some inroads  Last fall  Mr  Walker matched his vote totals from 2014 in the three suburban counties outside Milwaukee  But a surge of Democratic votes in the demographically changing suburbs meant his vote share dropped in 2018 by 12 percentage points in Waukesha County and by 16 points in Ozaukee County  It s the paradox of Trump s strategy of appealing to his base constantly   said Charles Franklin  director of the Marquette Law School Poll of the state   It also helps gin up the feelings of your opposition  I think that it s a gift to Democrats that keeps on giving  One of those voters is Tiffany Duncan  a 26 year old employee of a printing company  who skipped the 2016 election because she didn t like either major party candidate  But she definitely plans to vote in 2020   for whichever Democrat takes on Mr  Trump   I didn t think Trump was this crazy   she said as she walked to Caf Bavaria in Wauwatosa Village Still  Mr  Franklin said  the state is so evenly divided  its chances of determining an Electoral College majority for either party  puts us at ground zero  In a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than Mr  Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president  meaning his path to a second victory in the state is both uphill and narrow Many of today s uncertain voters   who are Republicans or Republican leaning independents   may come home to the party  especially once there is a Democratic nominee to contrast with the president John Carlson  a 59 year old engineer in Milwaukee  is one of those gettable voters for both parties  He went for Mr  Trump in 2016 but is uncertain if he will do so again  Democrats could win him over  he said    if the Democrats came up with somebody reasonable  which I m not expecting them to do  Republicans are framing the Milwaukee convention as an opportunity to motivate their own base  expecting Democrats to showcase a parade of far left figures and policies  National Republicans have already begun a coordinated effort to paint Democrats as wild eyed radicals steering the country toward socialism ImageIn a Marquette poll in January  49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than President Trump  Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times Democrats were energized in 2018  like any party is out of power during the first midterm  but then decided to go off the rails once they seized control of the House   said Rick Wiley  a former political director of the Republican National Committee  whose roots are in Wisconsin  The president energizes base Republicans and has had great success with working class voters   he said in an email   Those same working class voters won t check the box on a progressive socialist nominee  Mr  Jefferson of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he was upbeat about Mr  Trump despite public polling  I expect to see the same thing this cycle as 2016  where all polling suggests it s an uphill battle and on Election Day things look a lot different   he said   I think the Democrats are once again overplaying their hand and a little too confident  When Mr  Trump holds rallies aimed at Wisconsinites  he visits media markets across northern and western regions  largely agricultural and rural  where in 2016 he outperformed earlier Republican nominees In the Supreme Court race  Judge Hagedorn  the conservative  got a major boost in the Green Bay and Wausau markets  enough to overcome a deep deficit in Dane County  which includes Madison  the state s bluest stronghold In the 18 counties in the Green Bay media market  where TV ads linked Judge Hagedorn to Mr  Trump  voters swung by 18 points toward the conservative compared with a State Supreme Court election last year won by a liberal judge  according to an analysis by Craig Gilbert of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel The Saturday before Election Day  there was no shortage of avid Trump supporters at Roar Off the Shore  a tasting of craft beers and cheeses east of Green Bay in Kewaunee County  which is on the thumb of the Wisconsin mitten Though the county s populace is small  Mr  Trump s ability to run up the score in such places was repeated all across rural America in 2016  He won Kewaunee County  a dairy region  by 28 points compared with Mitt Romney s six point margin as the 2012 Republican nominee  I m tired of politicians  he s not a politician   said Randy Boor  57  who works in a factory that makes commercial cookware  He judged Mr  Trump s chances of carrying the state in 2020 as even better than in 2016  We ve got a guy there that s delivering   he said   He wants to do the frickin  job  You know how much could get done if he wasn t being opposed by all these idiots  Another beer taster  Dave Soborowicz  a 47 year old plumber  had driven across the state from Eau Claire to attend the event with his brother  who wore a Trump hat  But Mr  Soborowicz was less enamored of the president and unsure if he would vote for him the next time   He s so bloated in his head that he thinks he s still going to get his frickin  wall  when he s been defeated   he said Mr  Soborowicz said business was good for him as a plumber but he wasn t ready to give Republicans and the president credit   All I know is it was a bad winter   he said   so we were very busy   

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee approved subpoenas Wednesday for special counsel Robert Mueller s full Russia report as Democrats pressure the Justice Department to release the document without redactions The committee voted 24 17 to give Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler  D N Y   permission to issue subpoenas to the Justice Department for the final report  its exhibits and any underlying evidence or materials prepared for Mueller s investigation  Nadler has not yet said if he ll send the subpoenas  which would be the first step in a potentially long fight with the Justice Department over the materials The Judiciary panel also voted Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trump s former top advisers  stepping up a separate  wide ranging investigation into Trump and his personal and political dealings On the Mueller report  House Democrats had given Attorney General William Barr until Tuesday to provide an unredacted verson to Congress  along with underlying materials  The Justice Department ignored that deadline  with Barr telling committee chairmen in a letter last week that he was in the process of redacting portions of the almost 400 page report and it would be released by mid April   if not sooner  The vote further escalates the Democrats  battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see  a fight that could eventually head to court if the two sides can t settle their differences through negotiation  Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr In the letter last week  Barr said he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material  in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that  would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties  Democrats say they want access to all of that information  even if some of it can t be disclosed to the public  Nadler said he will give Barr time to change his mind on redactions  but if they cannot reach an agreement they will issue the subpoenas  in very short order   He also said he is prepared to go to court to get the grand jury information  This committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job  not the attorney general s  to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his office   Nadler said The five former Trump advisers who could receive subpoenas are strategist Steve Bannon  communications director Hope Hicks  chief of staff Reince Priebus  White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson  Donaldson served as McGahn s chief of staff before both left the administration The five were key witnesses in Mueller s probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month  along with dozens of other people connected to Trump  Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Mueller s investigation  were sent outside the White House   meaning the committee should have access to them because they may not be covered by executive privilege The top Republican on the Judiciary panel  Georgia Rep  Doug Collins  said at the vote that the five subpoenas are misguided because two of the individuals have already provided 3 000 documents to the committee and that the other three have indicated a willingness to cooperate Collins said the authorization for all of the subpoenas is  reckless  and that Democrats shouldn t be asking for documents that the Justice Department can t legally disclose to the public  The committee rejected a GOP amendment that would have blocked the subpoenas from applying to grand jury information  We have a pre emptive chairman who has gone out with pre emptive subpoenas today on a report that has already been promised him   Collins said   This is nothing but political theater  Trump himself has largely deferred to Barr on the report s release while also saying he wouldn t mind if the full version was made public  Still  he has criticized Democrats for seeking the unredacted information  He tweeted Tuesday that  there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy  Nadler or House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff  who has also called for the full release Mueller notified Barr that he had completed the investigation March 22 and sent him the report  In a four page summary of that report released two days later  Barr wrote that the special counsel did not find that Trump s campaign  conspired or coordinated  with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election  He also said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation  instead setting out  evidence on both sides  of the question Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter  declaring that Mueller s evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe  Democrats criticized Barr s assessment  saying they instead want to see what Mueller wrote  

WASHINGTON   A Democratic controlled House panel voted Tuesday to subpoena documents and a witness related to the Trump administration s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census The vote was 23 14  with Rep  Justin Amash of Michigan being the only Republican to join with Democratic lawmakers in the vote Democrats say they want specific documents that will determine why Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross decided to add the question  They say the Trump administration has declined to provide those documents despite repeated requests  The vote is the latest example of the ways Democratic lawmakers are using their majority to aggressively investigate the inner workings of President Donald Trump s administration Ross said the decision in March 2018 to add the question was based on a Justice Department request to help it enforce the Voting Rights Act In response to Tuesday s vote  he said his department  has been nothing but cooperative with the committee s expansive and detailed requests for records  Ross said the department has turned over 11 500 pages of documents and noted that he testified at a recent hearing  But Democrats countered that many of the pages were so heavily redacted that they provided little or no useful information  We don t want thousands of pieces of paper  We want the specific priority documents we asked for   unredacted and in full   said Rep  Elijah Cummings of Maryland  the panel s Democratic chairman Democratic lawmakers said Ross considered adding the citizenship question from his first days in the administration  They fear it will reduce census participation in immigrant heavy communities  harming representation and access to federal dollars  They want more information about the back and forth between administration officials before the decision was made Trump recently tweeted the census will  be meaningless  without the citizenship question Republicans said the census investigation is an example of  partisan oversight of the Trump administration   Why don t Democrats want to know whether you are a citizen or not   asked Ohio Rep  Jim Jordan  the top Republican on the panel Two federal judges have already ruled against the question and the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue before survey forms are printed It would be the first time since 1950 that the full  once a decade census asked people about their citizenship  

WASHINGTON   A major disaster relief bill stalled on Monday in the U S  Congress amid a political debate over aid for Puerto Rico  with President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans resisting Democrats  insistence the island receive additional assistance The Republican controlled Senate took two procedural votes on Monday that both failed  The first was on a Republican bill offering  13 5 billion in disaster relief for states that included  600 million in nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico The second was on a  14 2 billion bill  with additional assistance for the U S  island territory  passed by the Democratic controlled House of Representatives in January  before severe flooding hit the U S  Midwest The failure of both bills sends lawmakers back to the negotiating table as the Trump administration s response to Hurricane Maria  which devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017  receives increased scrutiny  including from more than a dozen Democrats vying to take on the president in the 2020 elections Republicans are poised to attack those Democratic candidates for holding up emergency aid to flood hit states  including Iowa  which is the first state to hold its presidential nominating contest every four years Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossell  a Democrat  said over the weekend that while the nutrition assistance in the Senate bill would be  vital to the well being of our citizens   it still  falls short  of what is needed on the island of more than 3 million that has struggled to rebuild after the hurricane Trump has repeatedly accused Puerto Rico and its leaders  including Rossell and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yuln Cruz  a vocal Trump critic  of mismanaging recovery funds and said the island should not receive additional assistance   Puerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being   Trump told reporters last week   They don t know how to spend the money and they re not spending it wisely  Rossell has insisted the island is only asking for the same help given to U S  states and repeatedly sought a meeting with the president  but his efforts have been rebuffed  Rossell said in a recent CNN interview that Puerto Rico had struggled to obtain billions of dollars in assistance from the Trump administration that was already approved by Congress The island is navigating the largest government bankruptcy in U S  history  with  120 billion of combined bond and pension debt when it declared bankruptcy in May 2017 after more than a decade of recession  PETTY GRUDGES Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy  who has authored an alternative disaster assistance bill  accused the president of picking  winners and losers   Instead of standing with our neighbors  our fellow Americans  the president has chosen to hold petty grudges that are way beneath the office of the presidency   Leahy said on the Senate floor The topic of Puerto Rico and its recovery from Hurricane Maria surfaced repeatedly at a Monday forum of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates organized by labor unions and other liberal groups Although Puerto Rico nationals are U S  citizens and send a non voting resident commissioner to the House  they are prohibited from voting in general presidential elections  But they can cast ballots in the nominating contests starting early next year Julin Castro  a former San Antonio mayor  told the forum of his decision to kick off his campaign by visiting the island   The reason I did that was to highlight the total failure of this administration but also to tell the people of the island you re Americans and we re thinking of you too  Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders  who are also vying for the White House  have both visited Puerto Rico as well  Yuln Cruz is a co chair of Sanders  campaign   Reporting by Amanda Becker and Richard Cowan  Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton  Susan Cornwell and Steve Holland  Editing by Peter Cooney

WASHINGTON   A bipartisan group of U S  lawmakers on Wednesday faulted the Trump administration for failing so far to impose sanctions over China s alleged human rights abuses against its Muslim minority and called for punitive measures against a senior Communist Party official and Chinese companies  A letter to President Donald Trump s top advisers signed by more than 40 lawmakers said China s actions in its western region of Xinjiang  may constitute crimes against humanity  and urged tighter U S  export controls to ensure that U S  companies are not assisting the Chinese government s crackdown there  either directly or indirectly It also asked the United States to strengthen financial disclosure requirements to alert American investors about the presence in U S  capital markets of Chinese companies that are  complicit in human rights abuses   The letter specifically cited Hikvision and Dahua Technology  which produce audio visual equipment that can be used for surveillance China faces growing condemnation from Western capitals and rights groups for setting up facilities that U N  experts describe as mass detention centers holding more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims Beijing has said its measures in Xinjiang  which are also reported to include widespread surveillance of the population  are aimed at stemming the threat of Islamist militancy  The facilities or camps that have opened are vocational training centers  the government has said The letter  which was sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  urged them to swiftly slap sanctions on Xinjiang s Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo  a member of the Chinese leadership s powerful politburo  and other Chinese officials  complicit in gross violations of human rights  The Trump administration has been weighing sanctions against Chinese officials  including Chen  since late last year  and though it has ramped up criticism it has held off on imposing the measures  China has warned that it would retaliate  in proportion  against any U S  sanctions  We are disappointed with the administration s failure so far to impose any sanctions related to the ongoing systemic and egregious human rights abuses in Xinjiang   the lawmakers said   While the strong rhetoric condemning the Chinese government s actions  in Xinjiang  from Vice President Pence and others is certainly welcomed  words alone are not enough  The group of signatories was led by U S  Senator Marco Rubio and U S  Representative Chris Smith on the Republican side and Senator Bob Menendez and Representative James McGovern on the Democratic side They called on the Trump administration to apply sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act  The federal law allows the U S  government to target human rights violators around the world with freezes on any U S  assets  U S  travel bans and prohibitions on Americans doing business with them   Reporting by Matt Spetalnick  Editing by Tom Brown

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee will prepare subpoenas this week seeking special counsel Robert Mueller s full Russia report as the Justice Department appears likely to miss an April 2 deadline set by Democrats for the report s release The Judiciary panel plans to vote on subpoenas Wednesday  a day after the deadline  The chairmen of several House committees asked for the full  unredacted report last week after Attorney General William Barr released a four page summary laying out the report s  principal conclusions   Barr said in a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary committees on Friday that a redacted version of the full 300 page report would be released by mid April   if not sooner  The planned committee vote  announced Monday morning  would not automatically issue subpoenas but authorize House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler  D N Y   to send them if he decides to do so  As I have made clear  Congress requires the full and complete special counsel report  without redactions  as well as access to the underlying evidence   Nadler said in a statement   Attorney General Barr has thus far indicated he will not meet the April 2 deadline set by myself and five other committee chairs  and refused to work with us to provide the full report  without redactions  to Congress  The vote comes as Democrats are escalating their battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see   a fight that could eventually end up in court  Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and will almost certainly be unhappy with the amount of information provided by Barr when the department releases the report in the coming weeks The panel will also vote Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to a number of President Donald Trump s former top advisers  including strategist Steve Bannon  Communications Director Hope Hicks  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  White House Counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson  Donaldson served as McGahn s chief of staff before both left the administration The five were key witnesses in Mueller s probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month  Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Mueller s investigation  were sent outside the White House   waiving executive privilege rights that would block document production  To this end  I have asked the committee to authorize me to issue subpoenas  if necessary  to compel the production of documents and testimony   Nadler said Nadler sent requests to 81 people connected to Trump s political and personal dealings as he launched a wide ranging investigation into possible obstruction of justice  public corruption and abuses of power Barr said in the letter Friday that he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material  in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that  would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties  Democrats say they want all of that information  even if some of it can t be disclosed to the public  They are citing precedents from previous investigations involving presidents and also information disclosed about the Russia investigation to Republicans last year when they held the House majority If the committee does issue subpoenas  the path forward is uncertain  If the administration decides to fight  lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena   a fight that could  in theory  reach the Supreme Court  Generally such disputes are instead resolved through negotiations The Democrats could also formally ask Mueller to send the Judiciary committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump  But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  backed by the majority of her caucus  has said she s not currently supportive of impeachment Barr wrote in his summary that the special counsel did not find that Trump s campaign  conspired or coordinated  with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election  He said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation  instead setting out  evidence on both sides  of the question Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter  declaring that Mueller s evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe Democrats say they want to know much more about both conclusions and they want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr Republicans have said the Democratic demands are overreach  Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not  in truth  require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department   said Georgia Rep  Doug Collins  the top Republican on the Judiciary committee  

MEXICO CITY   Mexico will help to regulate the flow of Central American migrants passing through its territory to the United States  but the root causes behind the phenomenon must be tackled  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday Speaking after U S  President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to close the U S  southern border if Mexico did not halt illegal immigration immediately  Lopez Obrador said he would not have a confrontation with the United States  I prefer love and peace   Lopez Obrador told reporters at his regular morning news conference The leftist president has consistently refused to get drawn into a war of words with Trump over the border A senior Mexican trade official warned later that closing down the U S  Mexico border would cause pain on  both sides  Most of the people caught at the frontier trying to enter the United States illegally come from three violent and impoverished countries  Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador Lopez Obrador has tried to persuade Trump to address the problem by fostering economic development in Central America  But on Saturday the U S  State Department said it was cutting off aid to those three countries

market for 80 percent of Mexico s exports   nL1N21H06L Asked if it was time to put pressure on the Central American countries to do more to tackle the problem  Lopez Obrador said the causes of migration were  not being attended to  and that people needed to be offered more opportunities there  Obviously  we have to help because Central American migrants pass through our territory and we have to bring order to this migration  make sure it s legal   he said  That s what we re doing  But serenely  calmly  without a commotion and with great prudence and responsibility  Mexico began issuing temporary humanitarian visas to some members of a migrant caravan in southern Mexico  giving priority to children and the elderly  the National Migration Institute said Monday  It said it would provide transport back to Central American countries  Cuba and Haiti  on a voluntary basis  Earlier this year  Mexico handed out humanitarian visas liberally  but reined in the program after a surge in applications  The institute said from next month it was planning to encourage people to apply for visas in their home countries It was not immediately clear if the government was limiting the number of visas it issues U S  CONGRESSIONAL OBJECTIONSIt has quickly become clear that any plan to cut aid to Central America would face strong objections from members of the U S  Congress  who must approve it One of Trump s fellow Republicans  Representative Mike McCaul  the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee  said cutting aid would worsen the situation  If we cut all this funding     I think it s going to make things tragically worse  not better   he said during a presentation at a think tank in Washington Putting a stop to aid to Central America made the job of stemming the flow of migrants tougher  said Senator Ben Cardin  a senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  And closing the border   that makes no sense at all   he told CNN   We need Mexico s cooperation to work with us  and cutting off the border just tells Mexico   We re doing it alone   Following a meeting on Monday with Lopez Obrador at the Presidential Palace in Mexico City  the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  Eliot Engel  invited the Mexican president to visit the committee for a meeting in Washington  an aide to Engel said  Excellent meeting with President  lopezobrador  on importance of U S   Mexico relationship  I emphasized need to partner in assisting Central America   Engel said on Twitter Mexico s Ambassador to the

CARACAS  Venezuela   The Latest on Venezuela s Crisis  all times local  10 10 p m Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid says he knows he runs the risk of being arrested for pushing to oust President Nicolas Maduro  But a defiant Guaid said Tuesday that he is undeterred  The 35 year old opposition leader spoke publicly moments after an assembly loyal to Maduro stripped him of his immunity from prosecution The move by the National Constituent Assembly paves the way for his prosecution and potential arrest for supposedly violating the constitution when he declared himself interim president Guaid has backing from more than 50 nations  including the United States  which reject Maduro as illegitimately elected Maduro blames Washington for trying to install a puppet government to seize Venezuela s vast oil reserves    8 p m Maduro loyalists stripped Venezuela s Juan Guaid of immunity Tuesday  paving the way for the opposition leader s prosecution and potential arrest for supposedly violating the constitution when he declared himself interim president But whether the government of President Nicolas Maduro will take action against the 35 year old lawmaker remains unclear  Guaid has embarked on an international campaign to topple the president s socialist administration amid deepening social unrest in the country plagued by nearly a month of power outages He declared himself Venezuela s interim president in January  and vowed to overthrow Maduro  So far  however  Maduro has avoided jailing the man that the administration of U S  President Donald Trump and roughly 50 other nations recognize as Venezuela s legitimate leader The Trump administration has threatened the Maduro government with a strong response if Guaido is harmed and Florida Senator Marco Rubio   who has Trump s ear on Venezuela policy   said before the vote that nations recognizing Guaid as his country s legitimate leader should take any attempt by Maduro s government to  abduct  him as a coup  And anyone who cooperates with this should be treated as a coup plotter   dealt with accordingly   Rubio said on Twitter  

WASHINGTON   The United States and China  expect to make more headway  in trade talks this week  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday as the top U S  business lobbying group said differences over an enforcement mechanism and the removal of U S  tariffs were still obstacles to a deal  We expect to make more headway  I can t report any of the details  but it s a larger  grander discussion than anything we ve had before in U S  China trade relations  and there s a certain amount of optimism   Kudlow said in remarks at the U S  Chamber of Commerce Kudlow  who directs the White House National Economic Council  acknowledged that there are still issues to be resolved  and the Trump administration will focus heavily on ways to hold China to keep its reform promises and curbing intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers and lowering tariff and non tariff barriers U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to resume talks with Chinese vice premier Liu He on Wednesday  just days after the two sides reported progress in talks last week in Beijing  The Chamber  the largest and most influential business lobbying group  sees increasing chances that Washington and Beijing will reach a deal to end a nine month tariff war   We re getting to the point where it s clear that both governments want a deal   Myron Brilliant  the Chamber s head of international affairs  told reporters   The presidents want a deal  and they need to get through the end game issues  This is a critical week  The United States and China have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars  worth of two way trade since July 2018  raising costs  disrupting supply chains and roiling global markets U S  President Donald Trump s administration is pressuring Beijing to meet a long list of demands that would rewrite the terms of trade between the two countries  including changes to China s policies on intellectual property protection  technology transfers  industrial subsidies and other trade barriers Trump on Tuesday afternoon repeated his now familiar refrain that China trade talks were going  very well  as he met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House Absent significant process this week on the  tricky  issues of tariffs and enforcement  the goal to complete a deal this month may be missed  Brilliant said The Trump administration and American companies want structural IP and market economy issues addressed  with a way to ensure China follows through on its promises  Brilliant said  U S  officials favor tariffs as a way to maintain leverage on China and ensure those obligations are met  But it is unlikely that China would agree to an enforcement mechanism that included re imposition of unilateral U S  tariffs without the current tariffs being removed  Brilliant said The continued threat of tariffs hanging over commerce would mean a deal would not end the risk of investing in businesses or assets that have been affected by the trade war   Reporting by David Lawder and Chris Prentice  editing by James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   The NATO secretary general gave a strong defense of the 70 year old military alliance between Europe and the United States  using a high profile appearance before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to urge allies to stand up to a more assertive Russia While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not looking for a new Cold War with Moscow  the alliance s leader  Jens Stoltenberg  said it was important to not be  nave  about the Kremlin s intentions  Proffering a long list of Russian actions that threaten NATO allies  including the annexation of Crimea  the use of a nerve agent in Britain and Moscow s interference in democratic elections  Mr  Stoltenberg cited  a pattern of Russian behavior  that calls for the alliance to be more united than ever in its response  NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence   Mr  Stoltenberg said at the Capitol  He was in Washington for a meeting of foreign ministers from NATO member states But his remarks came in the middle of a poorly timed squabble between two of the alliance s fractious members   the United States and Turkey   with Russia as the potential beneficiary  Earlier this week  the Pentagon announced that it was halting the delivery of parts for F 35 fighter jets to Turkey because Ankara is pursuing plans to buy S 400 missile defense systems from Russia American officials do not want Turkey to purchase the Russian system and have warned that it could collect information on United States stealth fighter jets The Turkish foreign minister  Mevlut Cavusoglu  was adamant in a separate alliance event in Washington on Wednesday that Ankara will not budge   It s a done deal   he said   Turkey doesn t have to choose between Russia and any others  and we don t see our relationship with Russia as an alternative to others  But the Trump administration  so far  is being equally adamant  Turkey must choose   Vice President Mike Pence said at a NATO anniversary event   Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history  or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making such reckless decisions that undermine our alliance  Mr  Stoltenberg  in his speech before Congress  did not directly reference the F 35 squabble  But he characterized fights among alliance partners as  democracy   Open discussions and different views is not a sign of weakness   Mr  Stoltenberg said   It is a sign of strength  He also reaffirmed NATO s core mandate of collective defense   that an attack on one member state is viewed as an attack on all 29  But in doing so  Mr  Stoltenberg aired a principle that President Trump has questioned  exposing the new rift that has developed between his administration and the United States  most important allies Wednesday s speech was the first time that a secretary general of the alliance has been invited to speak on Congress s most high profile stage  and the platform afforded to Mr  Stoltenberg was in many ways a sign of lawmakers  concerns over Mr  Trump s commitment to NATO Mr  Stoltenberg  a careful diplomat  made no criticism of Mr  Trump  and instead credited the president with prodding the alliance to spend more on defense  Still  the overall theme of Mr  Stoltenberg s speech was to make the case for NATO  the value of which Mr  Trump has often questioned Lawmakers gave Mr  Stoltenberg a series of standing ovations  Legislation that has bipartisan support is making its way through Congress  and would explicitly prohibit any president from withdrawing the United States from the alliance without Senate approval In his speech  which was peppered with political and personal details  Mr  Stoltenberg said the military alliance has been good not just for Europe  but for the United States as well  He reminded lawmakers that the only time NATO has invoked Article 5   the pact of collective defense following attacks   was after the terrorist strikes against the United States on Sept  11  2001  The strength of a nation   Mr  Stoltenberg said   is not only measured by the size of its economy or the number of its soldiers  but also by the number of its friends   And through NATO  the United States has more friends and allies than any other power   he said   This has made the United States stronger  safer and more secure   

To the Editor Re  Trump Directs State Dept  to End Aid to 3 Central American Countries   nytimes com  March 30  President Trump s decision to cut off aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras is the worst and most counterproductive decision that could possibly be made to deal with the immigration situation on our southern border  I served as an officer in the Agency for International Development s Alliance for Progress program in Latin America under President John F  Kennedy in the 1960s  The program s economic  social and humanitarian assistance was instrumental in improving the economies  health  education and safety of those peoples  It gave them hope and reason to remain in their countries rather than seek a better life elsewhere  Our aid to Central America is intended to achieve precisely the same goals  Large scale immigration from Central America is caused by uncontrolled gang violence  crime and corruption in those countries  Without our assistance  these conditions will grow only worse and lead to more suffering and more immigration Michael D  ButtermanMiamiThe writer  a lawyer  does pro bono immigration work  

WASHINGTON   NATO can look at the possibility of other Latin American states joining Colombia in becoming alliance partners  Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday  while appearing to rule out U S  President Donald Trump s suggestion that Brazil could one day become a full member of the North Atlantic security body  Until 2017  NATO didn t have any partners in Latin America and then in 2017 we got our first partner  which was Colombia  and to be a close partner of NATO is something that is good for NATO and the partner country   the NATO leader told Reuters in an interview ahead of a NATO ministerial meeting in Washington  So of course  it is a possibility to look into the possibility of having also other countries in Latin America become partners which then provides a platform  a framework for close political and practical cooperation   he said At a joint White House news conference last month  Trump said he had told visiting far right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro he would designate Brazil a  major non NATO ally  and possibly go further by supporting a campaign to make Brazil  maybe a NATO ally   something that would imply full membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO membership is currently limited to countries of western Europe  Turkey  Canada and the United States  although NATO partner countries include Australia and New Zealand  as well as European non members Sweden and Finland Ask if a country such as Brazil could become a member  Stoltenberg said  No  Partners are not members  But partners are very close partners  We work very closely with them  practically and politically  and that s a very good way to strengthen cooperation with NATO and countries that are not members of the alliance  Asked about Brazil becoming a partner  he said  Well someone has to propose it and it also has to be a request from Brazil  but     we just agreed with Colombia to make Colombia a close partner with NATO and of course it s absolutely possible to have more partners in Latin America  but it has to be an expressed wish from Latin America and of course  it s  something we have to discuss then among the 29 allies  Earlier Stoltenberg addressed the U S  Congress and delivered an impassioned defense of the partnership he called  the most successful alliance in history   which has often been derided by Trump since he took office in 2017 Colombia reached an agreement in 2017 to become the only Latin American nation to join NATO as a  global partner   a relationship short of  ally  status  which means it would not necessarily have to take part in collective military action Other NATO global partners apart from those mentioned by Stoltenberg include Afghanistan  Iraq  Japan  South Korea  Mongolia and Pakistan  Becoming a  major non NATO ally  in itself implies a status upgrade that would give a country preferential access to purchases of U S  military equipment and technology Supporting Brazil for alliance membership would be a considerable step further  one that Trump recognized would mean he would  have to talk to a lot of people  NATO membership is governed by Article 10 of its 1949 founding treaty  which limits invitations to European states  subject to the approval of existing members and meeting alliance criteria   Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington  Editing by James Dalgleish  

LOVE YOUR ENEMIES How Decent People Can Save America From the Culture of Contempt By Arthur C  BrooksArthur C  Brooks begins  Love Your Enemies  with a scene  a moment of grace  that occurred on the National Mall in Washington on Sept  16  2017  during a rally of Trump supporters  A counter demonstrator from Black Lives Matter  a man named Hawk Newsome  was  quite unexpectedly  invited to address the Trump supporters  Quite unexpectedly  he won them over   a little bit  anyway  Newsome ended by saying   If we really want to make America great  we do it together   The Trumpers cheered  and the better angels of our nature flapped about the Mall for a little while  The mystic chords of memory reverberated from one side of the American divide to the other Was that moment a model for the future  Or just an accident Love your enemies  In this America   Maybe this seems impossible to you   Brooks writes   You might say   There are some people who are simply beyond the pale  There are millions of awful people in this country who advocate ideas we cannot tolerate  They deserve our contempt  not our love   I have heard this sentiment from serious journalists  respected academics and mainstream politicians  I have thought it myself  That attitude is both wrong and dangerously radical  Anyone who can t tell the difference between an ordinary Bernie Sanders supporter and a Stalinist revolutionary  or between Donald Trump s average voter and a Nazi  is either willfully ignorant or needs to get out of the house more  Brooks beholds America s 21st century tribal feuds   which on a national scale add up to nothing less than a religious war  a clash of faiths and value systems   with a clear  intelligent eye and a hospitable attitude that is rightly focused on the spiritual dimensions of the problem  Only transcendence can open the way to better solutions down the road  The real swamp just now is in the American mind ImageAs for Brooks s mind  it is filled with unusual ingredients  He is the rational first mate Starbuck to the Ahab of American political looniness   a voice of civic urbanity  The outgoing head of the American Enterprise Institute  an influential conservative think tank in Washington  he is an advocate for free enterprise and a serious Catholic  a convert in his midteens  who has gone up into the foothills of the Himalayas to seek counsel from his friend the Dalai Lama  He draws not only upon neurology and behavioral science but also upon the ideas of Dale Carnegie s  How to Win Friends and Influence People   A policy analyst with a Ph D  who has studied applied microeconomics and mathematical modeling  he spent years of his somewhat hippie lefty youth playing the French horn with  among others  the Barcelona Symphony The essence of our woes  according to Brooks  is that ours is a  culture of contempt    My point is simple  Love and warmheartedness might not change every heart and mind  but they are always worth trying  and they will always make you better off   Brooks cites the interesting friendship of two professors at Princeton  the white conservative Robert George and the black socialist Cornel West  Their mutual respect and affection  despite their disagreement on practically everything  embodies  to Brooks  the answer to the culture of contempt  George says of West   When I call Brother Cornel  Brother Cornel   I mean he s my brother   As with these two professors  Brooks suggests  America s path forward lies in its learning to transcend self destructive  obsessive politics in order to think clearly and to use the intelligent competition of ideas to advance the country  Love Your Enemies  can be seen as an informal handbook of attitudes and behaviors  Castiglione for the Twitter age  The reader may be left torn between admiring it as an example of Kafka s  A book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us   or dismissing it with Hemingway s  Isn t it pretty to think so  That this is an age of contempt and ridicule is certainly true   Donald Trump vs   Saturday Night Live   and a lot that is far more scurrilous than that  But contempt and ridicule are ancient American political art forms   ones now brought to ferocious intensity by the internet and social media  The smartphone paradoxically engenders new levels of mindlessness It may be that American contempt and ridicule had their most entertaining expression a century ago in the work of H  L  Mencken  a master of bracing satirical bombast who was disgracefully unjust and cruel in many of his opinions  Mencken would probably have dismissed Brooks as a sentimentalist    an evangelist   in Mencken s scornful term  A useful and welcome evangelist  I d say  

WASHINGTON   People inside and outside the Trump administration scrambled on Monday to figure out what aid it plans to cut from three Central American nations and how that is a good idea given that much of the money aims to curb migration The State Department said on Saturday it would carry out President Donald Trump s repeated threats to end U S  foreign assistance programs with El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras Without providing evidence  Trump said on Friday the countries had  set up  caravans of migrants in order to export them to the United States  A surge of asylum seekers from the three countries  known collectively as the Northern Triangle  has sought to enter the United States in recent days Congressional aides and U S  officials said they were trying to establish what money would be eliminated  and even some of Trump s fellow Republicans questioned the wisdom of curbing the aid  much of which aims to reduce violence  gang activity and the illicit drug trade   all factors that send migrants north  If we cut all this funding  and a lot of it  quite honestly  is seriously law enforcement that we re doing down there     I think it s going to make things tragically worse  not better   said Representative Michael McCaul  the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee The State Department did not elaborate beyond its weekend statement that it was  carrying out the President s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle  and would engage Congress  The U S  fiscal year runs from Oct  1 to Sept  30 Speaking on condition of anonymity  one congressional aide said it was his understanding the administration planned to reprogram   or dedicate to other purposes   about  450 million in fiscal year 2018 funds In addition  according to the aide  the department planned to review fiscal year 2017 and 2018 funds that have been obligated  but not spent  and redirect those to other purposes The aide and others said  however  that Congress had yet to receive any formal notices from the State Department about exactly which funds are involved  what they were originally for or where the department wants to reprogram them Asked if the department knew what programs would be cut  a second congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said   If they do  they haven t told us yet  My sense is they are trying to figure that out   TOTALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE A former U S  official in contact with those still in the government said emails were flying around the State Department among officials trying to figure out what was going on  Nobody knows what this is   he said  adding that by midday on Monday  no instructions had been sent to U S  aid missions in the region on how to implement the decision The situation was reminiscent of a 2018 New Year s Day tweet in which Trump appeared to decree an end to U S  aid for Pakistan  sending officials scrambling to suspend security aid without even knowing how much they were freezing Critics argued the administration s planned Central America aid cutoff would be tantamount to cutting off its nose to spite its face  It s totally counterproductive   said Rebecca Bill Chavez  who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Western Hemisphere Affairs during former President Barack Obama s administration and who is now at the Inter American Dialogue think tank in Washington  If the intent is to slow migration  this is going to have the opposite effect   she added Speaking on ABC News   This Week  program on Sunday  acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the United States needed more help from the  Northern Triangle  countries and Mexico  where the migrants typically enter the United States  You can make all the promises you want but when you re still sending 100 000 people across the southern border  actions speak louder than words   Mulvaney said   We want to work with the Northern Triangle countries but we need their assistance  Democrats were scathing about the planned cuts  Most of this aid is intended to address the causes of migration   reduce poverty  violence  gangs  improve rule of law  and reform justice systems   said Senator Patrick Leahy  the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee   It is shooting ourselves in the foot to cut off the assistance    Reporting by Arshad Mohammed  Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan  Additional reporting by Jonathan Landay and Lesley Wroughton  Writing By Arshad Mohammed  Editing by Peter Cooney  

Good Thursday   Want this by email  Sign up here  Advocacy group grades banks as failing on gunsGuns Down America  a gun control advocacy group  has graded 15 banks based on their support for the gun industry  Tiffany Hsu of the NYT reports  Most received dismal appraisals    Six of the banks  including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo  received failing grades  Citigroup earned the highest one  a B    The group used a 100 point scale that weighed factors like  a bank s loans to and investments in gun makers  and  discounts and deals it offers to N R A  members    Citi got an 84  JPMorgan got a 48  BB T  the lowest ranking bank on the list  got a 20  in part for loans and financing that it arranged for gun makers like Smith   Wesson    We re not interested in shaming banks or running a campaign focused on how evil they are   Igor Volsky  the group s executive director  told Ms  Hsu   Our end goal is to change the way banks make decisions when doing business with the gun industry    Ms  Hsu writes that  several banks contacted for comment said that they had not been consulted and that the group had relied on arbitrary metrics   My arrest this morning is outrageous and arbitrary Carlos Ghosn was arrested for a fourth time today  as prosecutors hit him with new charges of using company funds for personal ends  The former Nissan chairman claims that it s part of an effort to silence him This time  he was accused of using a Nissan subsidiary in Oman to send millions of dollars of payments to one of the carmaker s foreign business partners  which then passed it on to a company Mr  Ghosn controlled Mr  Ghosn did this three times between 2015 and 2018  resulting in  5 million in losses to Nissan  according to prosecutors He may be held in solitary confinement for at least 20 days  the FT reports  citing unnamed people close to his family  It adds that it is highly unusual in the Japanese legal system for someone released on bail to be rearrested Mr  Ghosn blamed  some individuals at Nissan  for his  outrageous and arbitrary arrest   saying they were attempting  to silence me by misleading the prosecutors   He had tweeted yesterday that he planned to hold a news conference next Thursday to tell  the truth about what s going on  That tweet and arrest raise an interesting question  Did he violate the terms of his bail  which restrict his internet access

party on Amazon s cloud servers  according to Bloomberg    In one instance  Mexico City based digital platform Cultura Colectiva openly stored 540 million records on Facebook users  including identification numbers  comments  reactions and account names  The records were accessible and downloadable for anyone who could find them online     In the Cultura Colectiva dataset  which totaled 146 gigabytes  it was difficult for researchers to know how many unique Facebook users were affected    The researchers also   had trouble working to get the database closed     A Facebook spokesperson said that the company s policies prohibit storing Facebook information in a public database  Once it was alerted to the issue  Facebook worked with Amazon to take down the databases  It has been over a year since the Cambridge Analytica scandal showed how widely Facebook had shared user data with third party app developers  The social network began to audit that data sharing last year  but the research report shows the struggle the company still faces More  Facebook is paying the British newspaper The Telegraph to publish sponsored articles that play down concerns about its practices  New research suggests that its algorithms target ads by race and gender even when advertisers request a broad audience  And have Mark Zuckerberg s tech regulation proposals been treated unfairly Trump joins the trade talksPresident Trump is expected to meet China s trade envoy  Liu He  in Washington later today  That could be a sign of progress on some of the sticking points surrounding a potential deal  according to Bob Davis of the WSJ The U S  and China have been at odds over tariffs imposed on  250 billion of Chinese goods  Washington sees them as a way to ensure that China sticks to the deal  Beijing wants them removed as soon as it s signed  China has few other hard demands  and U S  businesses have urged the Trump administration to remove the tariffs There could be workarounds  The U S  trade representative  Robert Lighthizer  has  been using the tariff issue to push for another U S  priority   that China agree to a no retaliation clause in a trade deal   Mr  Davis reports  The plan  which could let the U S  unilaterally impose levies on Chinese goods if China does not comply  could  help him persuade Mr  Trump to approve the agreement and lift a substantial amount of tariffs   Mr  Trump is looking to announce on Thursday the date of a summit with Mr  Xi   an unnamed Trump administration official told Mr  Davis   That s a big signal the two sides are on the cusp of a deal  trade experts say  and a resolution of the tariff issue  But  the situation is fluid  and plans could change   the official added ImageSenator Ron Wyden  Democrat of Oregon CreditZach Gibson Getty ImagesShould we tax unrealized capital gains Senator Ron Wyden  the top Democrat on the Senate s tax writing committee  has an idea that could radically change how America taxes the 1 percent  according to the WSJ Mr  Wyden proposed taxing gains in asset values annually  at the same rate as other income  Gains are currently taxed only when investors sell an asset  and at a top rate of 23 8 percent  rather than the 37 percent for ordinary income The senator said his plan would  eliminate serious loopholes that allow some to pay a lower rate than wage earners  to delay their taxes indefinitely  and in some cases  to avoid paying tax at all  Challenges to the plan include how to value gains in complex assets  how to handle declines in value  and how to apply it to illiquid holdings like real estate The proposal  is a breathtakingly terrible idea   Sen  Pat Toomey  Republican of Pennsylvania  told the WSJ On some tech issues  Trump is going globalPresident Trump s aversion to regulation and his go it alone nationalism are wavering in the face of technology questions  Steve Lohr of the NYT reports    In September  the Trump administration abandoned its hands off approach and began working closely with the 36 nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to create international guidelines for the design and use of artificial intelligence     The administration has also started to discuss a new law to protect privacy in the digital age  seeking consensus domestically and common ground internationally  It has fielded more than 200 public comment filings from advocacy groups  corporations and individuals  The administration has  moved from indifference to engagement   Julie Brill  a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission who now helps oversee regulatory affairs for Microsoft  told Mr  Lohr  The shift is a pragmatic recognition that regulations that will affect the nation s tech industry

Good Wednesday   Want this by email  Sign up here  How the Murdochs built the world s most influential media empireA lengthy investigation by the NYT Magazine reveals how much power the Murdoch media empire wields around the world   and the fissures that have grown within the family that controls it The Murdochs hold sway over right wing politicians worldwide  President Trump is famously an avid consumer of Fox News  And The Sun  a British tabloid  was one of the most influential voices in favor of Britain s withdrawal from the E U Their power is strongest in Australia  Murdoch properties in the country have both pushed to repeal a carbon tax and helped topple a series of prime ministers Seeing Fox News as an arm of Mr  Trump s White House misses a larger picture   It may be more accurate to say that the White House   just like the prime ministers  offices in Britain and Australia   is just one tool among many that this family use to exert influence over world events  The  clan is fracturing  Lachlan Murdoch  who is now C E O  of the Fox Corporation  which controls the family s remaining holdings  fought the effort to sell most of the company to Disney  He suspected his brother  James  of putting himself above the family  The two now barely speak to each other Several siblings wanted to get out altogether  James and two sisters  Elisabeth and Prudence  offered to sell their holdings in Fox to Lachlan  Rupert Murdoch is said to have encouraged the move  but Lachlan ultimately backed off   raising questions about his commitment to the company Goldman Sachs warms to Saudi Arabia againDavid Solomon  the Wall Street bank s chief  was spotted in Saudi Arabia recently  according to Bloomberg  It s the latest sign that American businesses are ready to work with the kingdom again  months after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi   Mr  Solomon is  the first head of a global U S  bank known to have traveled to the country  since the outrage over Mr  Khashoggi s death last year  according to Bloomberg   It shows a change in attitude within American companies toward Saudi Arabia  Last fall  Mr  Solomon was one of several executives to spurn the kingdom s investment conference    Inside Goldman Sachs  senior executives have indicated Saudi Arabia offers a more promising environment for growing the investment bank s business than other parts of the Middle East  according to one senior Goldman banker    Goldman is among the banks advising Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund on Aramco s  69 billion purchase of a stake in Sabic ImagePresident Trump and Jay Powell in slightly happier times CreditCarlos Barria Reuters I guess I m stuck with you  President Trump is still complaining about the Fed and its chairman  Jay Powell  to anyone who will listen  the WSJ reports   even to Mr  Powell himself   At three meetings this past week  Mr  Trump told Republican senators  supporters and staffers that if not for the central bank s rate increases   economic output and stocks would be higher and the U S  budget deficit would be rising less    On a March 8 phone call  an unnamed source said  Mr  Trump told Mr  Powell himself   I guess I m stuck with you    Mr  Trump cast some blame for choosing Mr  Powell as Fed chairman on his Treasury secretary   Mnuchin gave me this guy   Mr  Trump said at one gathering   The president s complaints came even as the Fed

dealSenior American and Chinese officials are to meet today in Washington for the latest round of trade talks  Much progress has reportedly been made  but the I M F  and the W T O  both say that missteps could prove costly for the global economy  Officials have resolved most of the issues standing in the way of a deal to end their long running trade dispute   according to the FT  Later today  Liu He  China s vice premier  is to meet Robert Lighthizer  the U S  trade representative  and Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  to continue discussions Crucial details need to be hashed out   The two sides remain apart on two key issues   the fate of existing U S  levies on Chinese goods  which Beijing wants to see removed  and the terms of an enforcement mechanism demanded by Washington to ensure that China abides by the deal   the FT adds Striking an effective agreement is important  according to Christine Lagarde of the I M F   Nobody wins a trade war   she said in Washington yesterday   That is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system   And the W T O  said that a slowdown in global trade would continue through this year   It is increasingly urgent that we resolve tensions   said Roberto Azevdo  the body s director general If there is a breakthrough  President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could sign a deal as soon as this month  Otherwise  the two countries could extend the negotiations until the G 20 meeting in Japan in late June  the FT says Theresa May will work with the opposition on BrexitPrime Minister Theresa May said yesterday that she planned to cooperate with the opposition Labour Party to avoid a disorderly Brexit  Stephen Castle and Ellen Barry of the NYT report With only 10 days left until Britain is set to leave the E U   Mrs  May is effectively turning her back on Brexit hard liners in her own party  She will instead try to develop a plan with cross party support  She added that she would ask European leaders for an extension Canceling Brexit is not an option   Closer economic ties with the bloc through a customs union or membership in its single market are up for discussion and even a referendum confirming any deal has not been excluded  Mrs  May s aides said   Mr  Castle and Ms  Barry write But the Labour Party s cooperation   and E U  approval for another delay   are not certain Brussels is expected to put strict conditions on an extension  They might include  the need to hold European Parliament elections and a possible  gentleman s agreement  over Britain s

MADISON  Wis    Conservative Brian Hagedorn s strong showing in Wisconsin s Supreme Court race cheered state Republicans Wednesday  with their first positive result in a statewide election since 2016 suggesting reasons for optimism next year in a critical presidential battleground Hagedorn led liberal backed Lisa Neubauer by 5 962 votes   less than half a percentage point   in a race that could still go to a recount  But it came after a string of losses by Republicans in special and statewide elections since Donald Trump carried the state While Republicans were excited  they were also cautious about what Hagedorn s showing means for President Donald Trump s re election  Nobody should assume because Republicans won this race that they will continue to win everything else   Republican strategist and former state GOP leader Brandon Scholz said   This is one election where all the pieces came together at the end  2020 is an entirely different  politically charged animal with the presidential race  Republican U S  Sen  Ron Johnson  who has been leading GOP efforts to rebound following the 2018 election  credited Hagedorn s showing with a ground up engagement with conservatives who were angry with attacks in the race and national Democratic priorities  This is the recipe for success   he said   That s what I ve been preaching since the day after the November 2018 election  We have to energize  rely on the grassroots  Hagedorn benefited from a late infusion of  1 2 million from the Republican State Leadership Committee  Conservative talk radio  including former Republican Gov  Scott Walker for three hours the day before the election  also worked to drive up turnout Republicans compared attacks on Hagedorn to those on U S  Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh  National political fights over the release of Robert Mueller s investigation into Trump and ongoing court battles over a lame duck legislative session in Wisconsin also fueled interest in the race  GOP strategists said Hagedorn said attacks against him over long ago blog writings  including calling Planned Parenthood a  wicked organization  and denouncing court rulings that favored gay rights  motivated his supporters Democrats took the result as a sign that despite a string of wins  including ousting Walker in November  nothing can be taken for granted  Not that Democrats needed it  but it s another wakeup call that every single election here is going to be highly competitive   said Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki   This is not a red state  This is not a blue state  This is the deepest shade of purple there is on the spectrum  Neubauer didn t immediately say whether she would request a recount  which would face a tough challenge in overturning such a large margin and which would come at her expense  She immediately appealed to supporters for money in case she pursues the recount  Counties have until April 12 to report final vote totals  and Neubauer has three days after that to request a recount The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been the deciding force in several partisan battles over policy in recent years  and is itself clearly partisan   conservatives hold a 4 3 edge  Democrats had hoped Neubauer would capture a seat currently held by a liberal justice  maintaining that spread but positioning them to win the majority in another election next year Unless Hagedorn s apparent victory is undone by recount  conservatives instead will enjoy a 5 2 majority and won t be at risk of losing it until at least 2023  The high court already looks likely to decide early disputes between new Democratic Gov  Tony Evers and majority Republicans in the Legislature Turnout was nearly 27   well above the 22  of last year s state Supreme Court race  Hagedorn overcame Neubauer s huge margins in the liberal strongholds of Madison and Milwaukee by running up the vote in Green Bay and more rural parts of northeastern and north central Wisconsin  Those are both parts of the state that helped fuel Trump s win in 2016 Wisconsin recounted its presidential vote in 2016 at Green Party candidate Jill Stein s expense  In that recount of nearly 3 million ballots  only 131 votes were changed   in favor of Trump  Neubauer  in a recount of just 1 2 million ballots  would have to pick up 45 times as many votes The 2016 presidential recount cost local election clerks  2 million   more than the  1 7 million Neubauer raised during the entire campaign through March 18  However  those costs included overtime for clerks who had to count nearly 2 9 million votes under a tight deadline due to the Electoral College Given the recent tight elections  Republicans are taking nothing for granted going into 2020  Johnson said  We have to run almost perfect elections going forward   he said  If  Democrats  are energized  we re going to have issues  Nobody will be overconfident  We know what s at stake        Associated Press writer Ivan Moreno contributed to this report from Pewaukee  Wisconsin

WASHINGTON   Keeping up pressure for political change in Venezuela  15 U S  senators introduced bipartisan legislation on Wednesday to provide  400 million in new aid  internationalize sanctions and ease penalties on officials who recognise a new government The Republicans and Democrats introduced the Venezuelan Emergency Relief  Democracy Assistance and Development  VERDAD  Act more than two months after President Donald Trump s administration recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela s legitimate leader  seeking the departure of President Nicolas Maduro Senator Bob Menendez  ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee  led the bill  He said the act would  put teeth behind  support for the Venezuelan people and provide tools for a peaceful solution to the crisis in the OPEC nation  This legislation will offer needed humanitarian assistance and support for Venezuela s long path to democratic order   said Republican Senator Marco Rubio  another sponsor  who has worked closely with Trump on Venezuela The bill would provide  200 million in new aid for Venezuela and  200 million for neighbouring countries taking in refugees It would also revoke U S  visas for relatives of sanctioned Venezuelans  remove sanctions on officials not involved in human rights abuses if they recognise Guaido  and require work with Latin American and European governments to implement their own sanctions It also requires U S  agencies to lead efforts to recover  corrupt financial holdings  of Venezuelan officials and accelerate planning with international financial institutions on Venezuela s economic restructuring The bill would not provide temporary protected immigration status  or TPS  which would allow 70 000 Venezuelans already in the United States to remain  TPS proposals have faced some opposition in the Trump administration  which takes a hard line on immigration Menendez told reporters on a conference call he hoped separate legislation seeking TPS could move concurrently with the VERDAD Act He said the bill stood an excellent chance of moving ahead in the Senate  given its bipartisan support   It sends Maduro a message  as well as Russia and China that are helping to prop up Maduro   Menendez said The bill s sponsors included eight Republicans   Rubio  Ted Cruz  John Cornyn  Todd Young  Lindsey Graham  John Barrasso  Bill Cassidy and Josh Hawley   and seven Democrats   Menendez  Dick Durbin  Ben Cardin  Tim Kaine  Jeanne Shaheen  Michael Bennet and Chris Coons That level of bipartisan support is not typical of major legislation in the current  fiercely partisan  Congress   I think we have very good prospects here   Menendez said   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle in Washington  Editing by Steve Orlofsky and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   The U S  government is considering additional sanctions against Iran that would target areas of its economy that have not been hit before  a senior Trump administration official told reporters on Monday The official said the administration aimed to follow through with new sanctions around the first anniversary of the U S  withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers  which President Donald Trump announced last May  We just want a continued chilling effect   the official said   We want businesses to continue to think doing business with Iran is a terrible idea at this point  Trump announced last May that the United States would pull out of a 2015 international agreement designed to deny Tehran the ability to make nuclear weapons and he ordered sanctions be imposed again on the country The deal  agreed by the United States  France  Britain  Germany  Russia  China and Iran  sought to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb in return for the removal of sanctions that had crippled its economy The official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the administration hoped to take the additional measures in the coming weeks  The more we can do around the anniversary  the better   the official said  while adding that it takes time to put such sanctions together and that the U S  Treasury Department was working on them One of the tools the United States has employed includes sanctions on oil imports from Iran  Washington has granted waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers  but could change that The official said the United States had the ability not to give those waivers at all   That  I think  is where we re headed   the official said Reducing the number of waivers would limit oil exports from Iran  the fourth largest producer in OPEC  The United States set an earlier target of driving Iranian oil exports to zero  and the official said that goal had not changed U S  domestic oil production would help offset such a change  the official said China  India  Japan  South Korea and Turkey are likely to be given waivers after they expire in May that could cap Iran s crude oil exports at about 1 1 million barrels per day  U S  based analysts at Eurasia Group said earlier this year  That would remove Italy  Greece and Taiwan from the current waivers list   Reporting by Jeff Mason  additional reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore  Editing by James Dalgleish  

SEOUL  South Korea   South Korea s military began searching for Korean War remains at the heavily armed inter Korean border on Monday after North Korea ignored its calls to carry out a previously planned joint search South Korean soldiers will remove mines and proceed with excavation work at an area south of the military demarcation line that bisects the rivals  said Choi Hyunsoo  spokeswoman for Seoul s Defense Ministry The joint recovery of war remains was one of many peace agreements reached between the Koreas last year as they took steps to improve bilateral relations amid larger nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the United States But North Korea has shown less enthusiasm about upholding inter Korean agreements following the collapse of February s high stakes summit between leader Kim Jong Un and U S  President Donald Trump over mismatched demands on sanctions relief and disarmament The breakdown has been a major setback for South Korean President Moon Jae in  who held three summits with Kim last year and lobbied hard to revive nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang following a provocative run in North Korean nuclear and missile tests that led to fears of war on the peninsula Moon  who will travel to Washington later this month for a summit with Trump  called for Pyongyang to respond to efforts to keep the atmosphere of dialogue alive and diplomatically resolve the nuclear standoff  We surely will not return to the past and cannot return to the past   Moon said in a meeting with senior aides on Monday The Koreas had agreed to jointly search for war remains from April 1 to Oct  31  which was part of a military agreement reached on the sidelines of Moon s third summit with Kim in Pyongyang last September  The North in recent weeks has been unresponsive to South Korean calls for military talks to discuss details about carrying out the search  Our side will prepare to immediately switch to a joint search if North Korea later responds   Choi said Under the September military agreement aimed at reducing conventional threats  the Koreas also established buffer zones on land and at sea and no fly zones above their border  They also removed some front line guard posts and conducted a joint survey of a 70 kilometer  43 mile   long waterway near their western border under plans to allow civilian vessels from both countries to pass freely But Seoul s Defense Ministry said last week that the civilian use of the river estuary will be  postponed  because of the lack of discussions with the North The Koreas have also fallen behind on their plans to disarm a jointly controlled area at the border village of Panmunjom and let tourists freely cross concrete slabs forming the demarcation line there  North Korea recently withdrew its entire staff at a frontline liaison office with South Korea before sending some of them back to the office Some analysts say North Korea is trying to pressure South Korea into backing its position with the U S  more strongly  Following the breakdown of the Trump Kim meeting  North Korean state media have urged the South to distance itself from Washington and resume joint economic projects that have been held back by sanctions Experts say the breakdown of the Trump Kim talks raised further doubts about Moon s claim that Kim is genuinely interested in dealing away his nuclear weapons and about Moon s role as mediator  which has become less crucial with Washington and Pyongyang directly communicating  

LOUISVILLE  Ky    Sen  Tim Kaine endured being denied the vice presidency despite running on a ticket that won the national popular vote  But the Virginia Democrat on Monday downplayed the prospects for doing away with the Electoral College  which sealed Republican Donald Trump s election to the White House Kaine said abolishing the Electoral College would require a change to the U S  Constitution   with the  really onerous requirement  of being ratified by an overwhelming majority of states  It s not going to happen because smaller states really like the Electoral College   Kaine told an audience at the University of Louisville The idea has gained traction among Democrats since Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election  She netted nearly 3 million more votes than Trump  yet lost the Electoral College and therefore the White House to him  Kaine was Clinton s running mate Some candidates in the crowded race for next year s Democratic presidential nomination have already jumped aboard the push to scrap the Electoral College  tapping into Democratic anger over the election process  Trump became the second Republican in five elections to win the presidency through the Electoral College while losing the popular vote The Electoral College  a group that comes together every four years to technically elect the president  is enshrined in the Constitution  You might do it differently if you were starting from scratch   Kaine told the campus audience   But it s not going to get the support of this overwhelming majority of states  So I tend to focus on the things that I think I can really make a difference on  And I think that s not that productive a use of a whole lot of energy  Meanwhile  several Democrat controlled states are pushing for a national popular vote  But rather than pass a constitutional amendment  those legislatures are joining the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact  a group of states that pledge to give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote The compact would only go into effect when it includes states representing 270 electoral votes  the majority needed to win the White House Kaine  a former mayor and governor  delved briefly into the sting of losing the 2016 election  I had never lost a race  I can t say that anymore  I can say I ve never lost a popular vote on any ballot that I ve been on   he said  drawing applause from the audience   And I ve never lost the Virginia vote  Kaine recalled that his first visitor after he returned to the Senate following the 2016 loss was Republican John McCain  who lost to Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election  He said   Tim  I m the only person here who knows exactly how you feel    Kaine recalled    You and me are the only two that have been on a national ticket and lost      And I m just here to tell you  that the answer to what you re feeling is just go right back to work   And I said   You found me here  didn t you   On another issue  Kaine said he s confident that special counsel Robert Mueller s full report on the Russia investigation will eventually reach the public  because you can t keep a secret in Washington   Attorney General William Barr released a four page summary that detailed Mueller s  principal conclusions  and says a redacted version will be sent to Congress Asked about impeachment talk among some Democrats against Trump and how Congress should respond  Kaine replied   You should not jump to a conclusion about something so momentous and weighty before all the facts are out on the table  Kaine spoke as part of the McConnell Center Distinguished Speaker Series at UofL  He was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  a Kentucky Republican and a UofL graduate

MAPASTEPEC  Mexico   Tempers frayed among hundreds of mostly Central American migrants gathered on Wednesday in southern Mexico  delayed as Mexican officials sought to slow down the U S  bound flow that President Donald Trump is determined to turn back Since last week Trump has repeatedly threatened to close down the U S  Mexico border if Mexican officials do not do more to thwart the migrants  potentially harming tens of billions of dollars in trade  but has also praised Mexican efforts following his outbursts The Mexican government has vehemently denied changing policy in response to threats  but has appeared to slam the brakes on its practice of awarding so called humanitarian visas that allow migrants from other countries to pass freely within its borders Without such papers  they are vulnerable to harassment and deportation from officials As many as 1 500 men  women and children traveling in a large group or caravan from Honduras  El Salvador  Nicaragua  and Cuba were gathered in the town of Mapastepec in Chiapas state  unable to obtain the temporary visas Mexico s immigration institute said it would prioritize giving the visas to vulnerable groups including the elderly and unaccompanied minors  while offering transport home for others Officials were issuing very few of the documents  migrants said  and frustrations were mounting as a result  It s been hard for me to get here because there aren t any visas   said Cuban migrant Yuremi Garcia  who had traveled without papers from the southern Mexican border a few hours south to a crowded sports ground in Mapastepec  converted into a temporary shelter  Garcia said he was tired of waiting and had decided to continue northwards together with others  despite the risk that Mexican authorities would deport them At the border town of Tapachula  near the southern tip of Mexico bordering Guatemala  another group included people from Sri Lanka  Congo and Haiti  a federal official said  Some migrants said Mexican officials had slowed down the process of awarding the visas or denied them outright without providing any explanation A small group lashed out at border officials in Tapachula on Tuesday over the delays  throwing rocks and breaking windows of a local migration institute building Edgar Corso  an official with Mexico s human rights commission  told Reuters that some 45 complaints filed with the commission by Cuban migrants since March 15 allege unreasonable delays in awarding the visas He said the attack on the migration office has also been formally documented Last week  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  who has steadfastly avoided any public confrontation with Trump  said he would help ensure more orderly migration In December February  his administration s first three months  Mexico sent home 19 360 migrants  17 percent fewer than a year earlier  data from the National Migration Institute show In response to Trump s pressure  the government has been providing daily updates to U S  officials on how it is acting more aggressively to halt migration flows  and providing specific numbers on how many people are being apprehended  a senior White House official said   They ve shown that they are increasing what they are doing   the official said on Tuesday  asking not to be named in order to speak freely U S  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and officials at the State Department have been in regular contact with Mexican officials about their efforts  the official said Lopez Obrador told reporters on Wednesday at his regular morning news conference that his administration was  acting with an abundance of prudence   saying a border shutdown was in nobody s interest  We are looking to ensure that the law is respected   he added   Reporting by Jose Cortez  Additional reporting by Lizbeth Diaz in Mexico City and Steve Holland in Washington  Writing by David Alire Garcia  Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Rosalba O Brien  

SEOUL   South Korean President Moon Jae in said on Monday he hopes North Korea responds positively when he meets U S  President Donald Trump this month as part of efforts to restart denuclearization talks with the North Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to make any agreement at their summit in Hanoi in February  leaving Moon with little room to maneuver and exacerbating divisions within his government over how to break the impasse Speaking to his cabinet  Moon said he would use the April 11 summit in Washington to discuss restarting U S  North Korea talks  advancing a peace process and creating a  virtuous cycle  of improving relations with Pyongyang  I hope North Korea will respond positively to the efforts of Seoul and Washington   he said The summit in Vietnam s capital was cut short after Trump and Kim failed to reach a deal on the extent of economic sanctions relief for North Korea in exchange for its steps to give up its nuclear program Though there have been no signs of any return to U S  North Korea talks  U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said   I would hope in the coming months our two leaders will be back together     in a way that we can achieve a substantive first step or a substantive big step along the path to denuclearization  Pompeo added  however  that it is  hard to know what the timing will be   according to a newly released State Department transcript of an interview on Friday with Pennsylvania radio station WHP  when asked how long the process would take There was criticism in Washington that Seoul might have over sold Kim s denuclearization commitment and gone too far in pushing for sanctions relief  while Moon s advisers have said the United States cannot stick to an  all or nothing  approach when trying to strike a deal over North Korea s nuclear weapons program But Moon said the allies are  very much on the same page when it comes to our shared objective of achieving complete denuclearization and establishing a permanent peace regime on the Korean peninsula  He criticized unnamed skeptics who he said had tried to  drive a wedge  between Seoul and Washington and  reverse the tide of peace   This is in no way helpful to our national interest or the future of the Korean peninsula   Moon said   Such attempts can be labeled truly irresponsible  especially when we recall the state of crisis we endured before dialogue was launched  The failure of the Hanoi summit created  temporary difficulties  but  it is becoming clear that neither the two Koreas nor the United States wants to go back to the past   he said North Korea for years pursued nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U N  Security Council resolutions  North Korea and the United States engaged in increasingly bellicose rhetoric until relations warmed last year  leading to a first summit in Singapore in June An official with South Korea s presidential Blue House said leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  were considering whether to invite Kim to a summit in the South Korean port city of Busan in November In Washington on Friday  South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung wha met U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and told reporters she had agreed to keep pushing North Korea to make concrete concessions on its nuclear arsenal  What s most important at this stage after the Hanoi summit is to restart negotiations between North Korea and the United States   she said  Moon said he would work with Trump to overcome obstacles and find new paths toward peace  If we work hard  we can pull it off   he said   Such positive thinking will lead us to a positive result    Reporting by Josh Smith  Additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin in Seoul and Matt Spetalnick in Washington  Editing by Nick Macfie and Marguerita Choy  

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform voted Tuesday to issue a subpoena to the former head of the personnel security division at the White House after a whistle blower accused him of putting national security in jeopardy by mismanaging security clearances The whistle blower  Tricia Newbold  a manager in the White House s Personnel Security Office  told the committee in a private interview last month that senior Trump administration officials granted security clearances to at least 25 individuals whose applications had been denied by career employees for  disqualifying issues   including drug use and criminal conduct  the committee s Democratic staff said in a memo released on Monday Ms  Newbold said the top personnel security official  Carl Kline  reversed a decision to deny a clearance for a senior White House official after a background check turned up multiple concerns  including possible foreign influence  She also said Mr  Kline granted a security clearance to a second White House official despite concerns voiced by a specialist When Ms  Newbold repeatedly pointed out his actions  she said he discriminated against her over her short stature  which is caused by a form of dwarfism  She filed a complaint against him with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission A White House spokesman declined to comment on the subpoena  In a statement  Mr  Kline s lawyer  Robert Driscoll  said the  facts will prove that he acted appropriately at all times   Mr  Driscoll said he received the subpoena from Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the committee  on Tuesday evening The committee also voted on Tuesday to authorize subpoenas related to the Trump administration s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire  an issue that is being taken up by the United States Supreme Court These committee votes authorized some of the first subpoenas for members of the Trump administration after Democrats  who promised to be a check on the White House  gained the House majority in the midterm elections Mr  Cummings said during Tuesday s meeting that despite claims the committee was just trying to  embarrass  the president with its newfound subpoena power  the move to compel testimony from Mr  Kline was meant to protect national security  The vote  22 to 15  was along party lines NBC News reported in January that Mr  Kline  who was Ms  Newbold s boss  had overruled a decision by career security officials concerned about granting a clearance to Jared Kushner  President Trump s son in law and senior adviser Ms  Newbold  a 39 year old employee who has worked in the White House for 18 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations  said she decided to go to the committee after attempts to raise concerns with her superiors and the White House counsel went nowhere  according to the Democratic staff s account  She s begging us to do something   Mr  Cummings said during the meeting   Because she simply wants her government to work the way it s supposed to work  Republicans on the committee argued against the subpoena because Mr  Kline s lawyer indicated that Mr  Kline was willing to appear before the panel voluntarily  In their own memo summarizing Ms  Newbold s comments to the committee  they presented her concerns as overblown and depicted her as a disgruntled federal employee  We re going to subpoena a guy who just sent us a letter saying he s willing to come here voluntarily   said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio  the committee s top Republican   I ve been on this committee 10 years  I ve never seen anything like this  But Mr  Cummings said that Mr  Kline  who now works at the Department of Defense  refused to answer questions from the committee about specific federal officials and clearance decisions during a voluntary appearance  Mr  Cummings said that the White House refused two committee requests to interview Mr  Kline and that Mr  Kline did not respond to two separate requests sent directly to him since January In a letter to Mr  Cummings  dated Tuesday  Mr  Driscoll wrote that his client was willing to appear but that the White House Counsel s Office deemed some of the proposed topics as an infringement upon President Trump s rights as the chief executive  Mr  Driscoll called a subpoena an  extreme and unnecessary step  Mr  Cummings said he planned to seek testimony from other senior White House officials as well Most of the Republican members of the committee also opposed the majority s proposal to subpoena testimony from a top Justice Department official  John Gore  about adding a citizenship question to the census The committee voted mostly along party lines to authorize a subpoena for testimony from Mr  Gore  as well as for documents from the Justice Department and the Commerce Department  some of which were either denied to the committee or heavily redacted One Republican member  Representative Justin Amash of Michigan  joined the Democrats in the vote The White House did not provide official comment on the census related subpoenas  Mr  Jordan accused Democratic members of the committee of trying to interfere in the court proceedings over the citizenship question In January  a federal trial judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding the question  saying the process that led to the decision was deeply flawed  The Supreme Court in February agreed to hear the case  putting it on a fast track ahead of the June deadline for printing the questionnaires  

WASHINGTON   Trade talks between the United States and China made  good headway  last week in Beijing and the two sides aim to bridge differences during talks that could extend beyond three days this week  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said  Kudlow  speaking to reporters on Wednesday at an event organized by the Christian Science Monitor  said China had recognized problems for the first time during the talks that the United States has raised for years Negotiations continued in Washington on Wednesday after meetings last week in Beijing  spearheaded by U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin President Donald Trump will meet with Vice Premier Liu He  who is leading the Chinese side in the talks  in the Oval Office at 4 30 p m   2030 GMT  on Thursday  the White House said The United States and China have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars  worth of two way trade since July 2018  Trump has said he wants a  great deal  with China and has hinted that tariffs could remain in place for some time Chinese commitments to increase purchases of American agricultural  energy and manufactured products are expected to be part of a final deal  and a person familiar with the talks said China would get about six years to meet those commitments  or until 2025 The deadline was reported earlier by Bloomberg  but Trump administration officials previously said that a six year timeline for purchases exceeding  1 trillion had been under discussion A final number for the amount of purchases has not been settled  the person said Kudlow said Liu and his team would remain in Washington for three days and possibly longer  We re covering issues that have never really been covered before  including enforcement   Kudlow said  listing U S  accusations that Beijing engages in intellectual property theft  forced transfer of technology from U S  companies doing business in China  cyber hacking  tariffs and non tariff barriers for commodity trading   All making good progress  all making good headway  but we re not there yet   he said about those areas   We hope this week to get closer  Kudlow said it was significant that China had  acknowledged these problems for the first time  They were in denial  Those structural issues along with the way a potential deal would be enforced have been sticking points during months of talks between the world s two largest economies Kudlow said on Wednesday that U S  charges against Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd had generally not come up during trade talks  Kudlow also said no decisions had been made on tariffs on auto imports coming from top U S  allies   Reporting by Jeff Mason  Editing by Grant McCool and Peter Cooney  

UNITED NATIONS   France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe  the United States and elsewhere France s Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that  support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world  The second objective  he said  is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate  including to fight inequality  tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies Le Drian said the alliance also wants  to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish  He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions U N  Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world s best hope and warning that  multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most  U S  President Donald Trump s speech  soon after Guterres   poured scorn on multilateralism  touted his  America First  policy  and rejected  the ideology of globalism  Nonetheless  General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week long meeting during which all 193 U N  member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U N  and multilateralism Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security  because there is security only if it is collective  and it is the best guarantee for long lasting peace  He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan  but he made no mention of the United States Asked about possible support from the Trump administration  and whether it had been contacted  Le Drian said   Whoever wants to join us can join us   It is against nobody  Maas said he hasn t talked to Trump about it yet  This alliance is an inclusive alliance   he said   So we don t want a situation where countries are left out  We don t lock out anyone  But  of course  we see multilateralism is under threat     and all of those who want to join such an initiative  should  also declare themselves to be multilateralists   We would be happy  of course  if the United States were to join such an initiative  but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules based order and strengthen the international order   Maas said   In the end  everyone will have to decide on which side they re on   

How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives  David E  Sanger  a national security correspondent based in Washington  discussed the tech he s using You previously were a bureau chief for The Times in Japan  one of your many roles for the newspaper  When you arrived in Tokyo in the late 1980s  what tech were you equipped with In retrospect  nothing very impressive  Our  portable  computers weighed about the same as an electric typewriter  had a tiny cathode ray tube screen that showed a paragraph or two at most and stored stories on magnetic bubble memory  which in the 1980s was supposed to replace hard drives Needless to say  it was a technology whose time never arrived  Oh  and the computer had two black rubber cups on the top  You put the handset of a hard line phone into them and dialed up a computer in New York to transmit at the astoundingly slow speed of 300 bits per second  Half the time we had to give up and call the dictation room  where someone would type out the story that you read to them When we gave up on bubble memory computers and moved to the first laptops  I sent a note to New York asking what to do with

Senate Republicans this week adopted rule changes that could make the august upper chamber something like a miniature version of the raucous and deeply partisan House In a bid to speed confirmation of President Trump s nominees  Republicans voted Wednesday to cut the debate time for lower level judicial and administration picks from 30 hours to two  Ordinarily  such a rule change requires the backing of a two thirds supermajority  But the Republican leader  Mitch McConnell  detonated the so called nuclear option  lowering the threshold for passage to a simple majority   a move Mr  Trump had been clamoring for  Only two Republicans joined with Democrats to oppose this latest erosion of the minority party s ability to  advise and consent  This may sound like parliamentary arcana  but the impact should be clear to anyone unnerved by the Senate s newish practice of ramming through Supreme Court picks with a bare majority   another Trump era innovation by Mr  McConnell The Democratic leader  Chuck Schumer  charged that the move  risks turning this body into a colosseum of zero sum infighting  a place where the brute power of the majority rules  with little or no regard to the concerns of the minority party  and where  longstanding rules have little or no meaning  Mr  McConnell contends that he was forced into this by Democrats   mindless  undiscriminating obstruction for the sake of obstruction   This claim will strike many as ludicrous  Well before the name Merrick Garland became synonymous with partisan stonewalling  Mr  McConnell was widely regarded as a master of obstruction  even by members of his own party Even so  it was not the Republican leader who started the Senate down this path  That distinction goes to the former Democratic leader Harry Reid  who  in November 2013  went nuclear to dismantle the filibuster for most judicial and executive nominees  Irked by the Republican minority s bottling up of President Barack Obama s picks  Democrats overwhelmingly backed the measure  which passed by a four vote margin At the time  Mr  Reid blamed Republican obstructionism   They have done everything they can to deny the fact that Obama has been elected and then re elected   he said Like today s Democrats  Republicans then warned of enduring damage to the institution   Breaking the rules to change the rules is un American   said Mr  McConnell  then the minority leader   I just hope the majority leader thinks about his legacy  the future of his party  and  most importantly  the future of our country before he acts  Republicans also vowed that Mr  Reid s team would live to regret crossing this line   Democrats won t be in power in perpetuity   Senator Richard Shelby told reporters   This is a mistake   a big one for the long run  Not six years later  here we are  For all his complaints about Democratic obstructionism  Mr  McConnell has pushed through a record number of Mr  Trump s judicial picks  In addition to killing the filibuster of Supreme Court nominees  Mr  McConnell ended the  blue slip  practice  a tradition that effectively gave senators veto power over nominees from their home state  Now he has done away with extended debate on most nominees Someone needs to stop the spiral  There is much about Senate processes that should be reformed  But razing the body s deliberative culture for partisan gain serves no one well  whichever side does it  Each line crossed makes the next one that much less daunting  This latest power grab has prompted concern about when the Senate will end the legislative filibuster  Such defanging of the minority would likely be a tough sell among lawmakers  But  as with confirmations  the 60 vote requirement on legislation would most likely end in stages  starting with baby steps like requiring only a simple majority to open debate Democratic presidential hopefuls are being asked about the issue  None seem eager to wade in  Yet  But as 2020 approaches  the issue will become more charged  and with every perceived Republican affront  the Democratic base will grow more impatient for its team to play hardball  If Democrats retake the White House and Senate  the pressure to deal with Republican obstructionism will intensify as progressives push bold plans    Medicare for all   the Green New Deal  gun safety measures  and so on   impossible to realize under the current system without a Senate supermajority  But if the rules were changed to allow passage with just 51 votes  who knows what could be achieved  This would make moving legislation through the often infuriating upper chamber easier  more like in the House  which provides few protections against the tyranny of the majority  No doubt this would strike some as a great victory   until the next time their team lost power More on the Senate  nuclear option Senate Republicans Go  Nuclear  to Speed Up Trump ConfirmationsApril 3  2019G O P  Ready to  Nuke  Senate Democrats Again Over Nominee

WASHINGTON   Three of eight importers granted waivers by Washington to buy oil from Iran have now cut their shipments to zero  a U S  official said on Tuesday  adding that improved global oil market conditions would help reduce Iranian crude exports further The United States reimposed sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump last May withdrew the country from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers  accusing it of supporting terrorism and conflicts in Syria and Yemen While the United States has set a goal of completely halting Iran s oil exports  it granted temporary import waivers to China  India  Greece  Italy  Taiwan  Japan  Turkey and South Korea to ensure low oil prices and no disruption to the global oil market  The Trump administration is currently in consultations with the importers ahead of a May 2 deadline when the waivers expire  In November  we granted eight oil waivers to avoid a spike in the price of oil  I can confirm today three of those importers are now at zero   Brian Hook  the special U S  envoy for Iran  told reporters  Hook did not identify the three  There are better market conditions for us to accelerate our path to zero   Hook said   We are not looking to grant any waivers or exceptions to our sanctions regime  Hook said U S  oil sanctions against Iran had removed about 1 5 million barrels of Iranian oil exports from the market since May 2018  This has denied the regime access to well over  10 billion in  oil  revenue   a loss of at least  30 million a day   he said Oil prices on Tuesday hit their highest level so far in 2019  with Brent crude approaching  70 a barrel on the prospect that more sanctions against Iran and Venezuelan disruptions could deepen an OPEC led supply cut Analysts believe the administration is likely to extend the waivers to the remaining five importers to placate top buyers China and India and to decrease the chance of higher oil prices China  India  Japan  South Korea and Turkey are likely to be given waivers that could cap Iran s crude oil exports at about 1 1 million barrels per day  U S  based analysts at Eurasia Group said in January  That would remove Italy  Greece and Taiwan from the waivers list Hook said a decision on whether to extend the waivers would be made  in due course   A total of 23 importers that once took Iranian oil had cut imports to zero  he added  With oil prices actually lower than they were when we announced our sanctions and global production stable  we are on the fast track to zeroing out all purchases of Iranian crude   Hook said A senior Trump administration official told reporters on Monday that the U S  government was considering additional sanctions against Iran that would target areas of its economy that have not been hit before Hook said more than 26 rounds of U S  sanctions against Iran had restricted the country s cash flow and constrained its ability to operate in the region Earlier on Tuesday  U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran s government of mismanagement that has led to devastating flooding across the country  At least 47 people have been killed in the past two weeks from flash floods   Reporting by Lesley Wroughton and David Brunnstrom  editing by Tom Brown and Rosalba O Brien  

WASHINGTON   House Republicans are expected as soon as Thursday to try to add an amendment on anti Semitism to a Yemen war resolution  giving Democrats a wrenching choice  Vote down the amendment amid charges that their party is coddling anti Semites  or approve it and kill a hard fought resolution aimed at ending American involvement in Saudi Arabia s war While Republicans are keeping a close hold over their plans  Democrats and Jewish groups are convinced that the minority will try the maneuver to derail the Yemen resolution and embarrass Democrats in one maneuver  In February  a similar last minute procedural motion to condemn anti Semitism caught Democrats off guard  and knocked the Yemen resolution off its fast track to President Trump s desk But this time  Democrats are prepared   and are already laying the groundwork to accuse Republicans of a cynical attempt to weaponize anti Semitism  In a closed door meeting this week  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the No  2 Democrat and a vocal supporter of Israel  implored members to oppose any Republican motion  If anybody thinks that I m not supportive of an anti Semitism resolution  you don t know much about my history  and I m going to tell that to the members on the floor   Mr  Hoyer later told reporters   This is about Yemen  This is not about some extraneous  maybe very important  but extraneous and undermining  amendment The last minute push by Democrats illustrates the lingering unease in the caucus as Republicans seek to divide them on support for Israel  And it demonstrates a renewed resolve among leadership to take a hard line against allowing members to derail major pieces of legislation by signing on to Republicans  politically freighted procedural motions Republicans have twice successfully used the tactic to divide Democrats and put them on the spot over hot button issues  once on immigration and a second time on anti Semitism  Both amounted to embarrassing setbacks for Democrats  and both emboldened Republicans  who see an opening to woo Jewish voters  a core component of the Democratic base ImageRepresentative Ro Khanna  the lead sponsor of a Yemen resolution  described the Republican maneuver as  a divisive tactic of anti Semitism to block an effort to save lives in Yemen  CreditErin Schaff for The New York Times I don t see the issue going away   said Representative Lee Zeldin of New York  one of two Jewish Republicans in the House   Silence isn t an option  Debate over anti Semitism and Israel has been roiling Democrats for months after comments by one of their freshmen  Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota  that many construed as anti Semitic  Republicans have seized on the issue  Mr  Trump has tried to brand Democrats as  anti Jewish   despite his own history of trafficking in anti Semitic tropes Republicans used the conference last week of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  the nation s largest pro Israel lobby  to attack Democrats over Israel and anti Semitism  Speaking to the group s 18 000 delegates  Vice President Mike Pence asserted that the Democratic Party  has been co opted by people who promote rank anti Semitic rhetoric  The recent controversy spurred Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and the lead sponsor of the Yemen resolution  to conduct private meetings with his Democratic colleagues to prepare for a possible Republican effort to derail the resolution  This is a bill about preventing a famine for 14 million Yemenis   Mr  Khanna said in an interview   It s about saving lives and liberty of women and children  and I find it offensive that the Republicans would use a divisive tactic of anti Semitism to block an effort to save lives in Yemen  Even as Democrats rebuke the tactic  it is not going away  Some veteran Jewish lawmakers  notably Representative Eliot L  Engel of New York  the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  and freshmen in swing districts  privately worried that it would be difficult to vote against a resolution supporting Jews or the Jewish state  according to people familiar with the discussions And at least two House Democrats  Representatives Elaine Luria of Virginia and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey  suggested they would have difficulty doing so  Ms  Luria said she would vote in accordance with her values  And Mr  Gottheimer said   This is a matter of principle for me  I have always stood strong against anti Semitism and always will  Democrats have already voted twice to condemn anti Semitism  once when the Yemen resolution first came up for a vote  and a second time as part of a broader resolution condemning all forms of bigotry after the uproar over Ms  Omar  If they had not approved the first anti Semitism amendment  the Yemen resolution would have reached Mr  Trump s desk weeks ago  Because the amendment was attached  the Senate had to start from scratch on a new Yemen resolution ImageGraffiti in Sana a  Yemen  protesting American drone airstrikes CreditYahya Arhab EPA  via ShutterstockJewish House Democrats  led by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  responded to the Republican efforts by introducing their own resolution condemning the boycott Israel movement Mr  Khanna said Democrats needed to do more  by going on offense against Republicans Last week  for instance  Representative Mo Brooks  Republican of Alabama  read from Hitler s manifesto   Mein Kampf   on the House floor to compare Democrats and the news media to Nazis who pushed political propaganda  And Representative Louie Gohmert  Republican of Texas  invoked Hitler during a Judiciary Committee hearing in which he compared socialists to Nazis in an effort to tar the Democratic left  Where are the voices calling for censure  of Mr  Brooks and Mr  Gohmert  Mr  Khanna asked on Twitter Representative Max Rose  Democrat of New York and the first Jewish lawmaker to represent his district  which has a large Yemeni population  has strongly urged his colleagues to turn back any attempts to weaponize anti Semitism to derail the legislation  The ongoing war in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has taken thousands and thousands of innocent lives  devastating families in my community back home   Mr  Rose said   I don t play politics when it comes to national security or rising anti Semitism  Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for using my faith and this issue as a political wedge  The resolution  which condemns a nearly four year conflict in Yemen that has inflicted a devastating famine  has faced a long and difficult road in getting to Mr  Trump s desk  The House easily passed it in February  But by attaching the unrelated Republican resolution over anti Semitism  Democrats stripped the bill of its so called privileged status  which would have allowed the Senate to take it up quickly and send it to Mr  Trump The Senate eventually did pass the measure  and now it is back to the House for what is essentially a do over If it passes the House cleanly  the president has promised to veto it  the second veto of his term

GENEVA   The World Trade Organization has cut its forecast for trade growth this year by more than a percentage point  to 2 6   due to an economic slowdown and amid a trade conflict between the United States and China The downgrade   from 3 7  forecast issued in September   reflects how quickly the prospects for global business are fading as  among other things  the U S  and China struggle to agree on how to lift tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of trade  Rising trade tensions are the major factor   WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told The Associated Press on Tuesday after the release of the forecasts Beyond the trade war  the WTO has cited weaker economic growth in North America  Europe and Asia   largely as the effect of fiscal stimulus by the Trump administration wears off  It noted a  phase out  of monetary stimulus in Europe and China s efforts to shift its economy away from its traditional reliance on manufacturing and investment toward services and consumption In 2018  trade grew by just 3    far below the WTO s forecast for 3 9   which had itself been downgraded last year  And next year  the Geneva based trade body expects only a small uptick in trade growth by volume next year  to 3   There is potential for a slight improvement in 2020 but that is very much dependent on an easing of the trade tensions   he said The WTO oversees international trade rules and settles disputes between countries  The Trump administration has also been critical of the WTO  accusing it of being  unfair  with the United States The U S  has slowly squeezed the WTO by blocking appointments to its dispute settlement group  the Appellate Body  which could in December fall below the minimum number of members required Azevedo pointed to the  fundamental importance of the rules based trading system   saying that its weakening would  be an historic mistake with repercussions for jobs  growth and stability around the world

SAN SALVADOR  El Salvador   Government officials  aid workers and activists in Central America are mystified by U S  President Donald Trump s threat to cut off nearly  500 million in aid to Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador in response to what he calls an immigration crisis  Over time  they say  it will only worsen the problem At risk of falling on the chopping block are development programs that work to tackle the root causes driving migration  poverty  inequality  violence and corruption  These include outreach to at risk youth to combat forced gang recruitment as well as programs to address gender based violence and support education  workforce development and the uphill fight to root out endemic graft  It s illogical and it s irresponsible      You re talking about long term challenges that are going to require long term  sustainable solutions   said Adriana Beltrn  a Central America specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America   So rather than helping to stabilize the situation and try to address these long term challenges  the cut in assistance will only make the situation worse   Gutting important programs   she added   will eventually lead to more migration  more insecurity  more corruption  more impunity in these countries  It s still not clear exactly what  when or how much could be cut Trump said last week that  we were paying them tremendous amounts of money and we re not paying them anymore because they haven t done a thing for us   and mentioned a figure of  500 million State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said Tuesday that the amount affected by any aid cut would be  450 million from fiscal year 2018 as well as an as yet undetermined amount from 2017  The president has made clear that the decision is aimed at securing the United States borders and protecting American citizens   Palladino said   These programs have not effectively prevented illegal immigration from coming to the United States  and they ve not achieved the desired results  The aid is meant to promote democracy building  good governance  trade  agriculture  education  health  public safety and law enforcement  Experts say all of those areas play a direct role in whether people feel they can get by or even survive in their home countries Reaction from the three governments has been muted so far  perhaps for fear of angering Trump Both Honduras and El Salvador pointedly said they had not been formally notified of any specific cuts in U S  aid  Honduran Defense Minister Fredy Daz said cooperation with the United States on security is  unchanged   while the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the relationship has been  solid  close and positive  Salvadoran Vice President Oscar Ortiz said Tuesday that an aid cut would not solve the migration problem but have the opposite effect   The best way to tackle the issue of migration     is not with this type of decision   he said   The best way to tackle the issue is to keep working together  Guatemala  the source of much of the recent migration from the region  was particularly circumspect  with presidential spokesman Alfredo Brito saying simply that the official response was not to comment for the time being But those carrying out the boots on the ground work are concerned Rick Jones  who works in El Salvador as the youth and migration policy adviser for Catholic Relief Services  counsels young people to keep them out of gangs and help them get jobs  He also runs behavioral therapy for inmates to deter them from returning to crime   all things that have  a positive impact to help guys think about and change their behavior   he said It s seen as unglamorous but badly needed work  especially in a place like El Salvador  which has a homicide rate that is among the world s highest at more than 50 per 100 000 people last year But all  38 million that Catholic Relief Services gets from U S  government agencies to run programs in the three countries   including ones on education and jobs   could disappear if the cutoff goes through If that happens   it will be sending the message   Help is not on the way     and you re going to be left on your own    Jones said   And basically people left on their own are going to be more desperate and more people are going to leave  Likewise  Vicki Gass  Oxfam America senior policy adviser for Central America and Mexico  said that axing funding for programs that have been running for years  would  in many cases   waste U S  taxpayer dollars that have already been invested  and  foster the same instability that is making people flee in the first place  Some government programs aimed at persuading Central Americans not to emigrate have been put in place  in part in response to Trump s earlier criticism about the migrant caravans that brought thousands trekking toward the U S  border  and the threatened aid cutoff does not take that into account  officials say  This goes against what we have seen in reports that show there have really been some decreases in migration  and that they are the result of the efforts being made on this issue   said lawmaker Yanci Urbina of the left leaning FMLN party in El Salvador  the least populated of the three countries and a distant third in terms of how many migrants are heading for the U S Salvadoran Treasury Minister Nelson Fuentes said U S  aid in his country includes  20 million in technical and fiscal funding over five years  and the government has not gotten word of any cuts  Another  200 million to spur growth and employment is managed in tandem with the World Bank  and it remains to be seen whether this will be reduced  Finally there are direct donations from Washington to the Salvadoran government and private organizations Fuentes said aid for security and migration could be affected  but that actively funded contracts should not be In Guatemala  the most significant aid comes in security assistance to fight drug trafficking   and that has already come under scrutiny recently over questionable use of armored vehicles donated by Washington  Other funds through USAID go to help programs on things like agriculture and education in poor rural communities  plus training for prosecutors  who have waged a high profile fight against corruption in recent years  or for judges Honduran political analyst Omar Garca called U S  aid to his country  vital  and said the threatened cuts show that Washington is  an unreliable ally for Honduras  Like Guatemala  Honduras has backed the Trump administration on key issues such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital and on the political crisis in Venezuela  It remains to be seen whether such support could waver  A sense of nationalism is surging in this country     and that could be a good thing   Garca said Beltrn noted that most of the assistance now in jeopardy does not go directly to the three countries  governments but to agencies  NGOs  church groups and others She predicted that an attempt to cut aid could face pushback in Congress if funds are reprogrammed without lawmakers  consent  Particularly in the Democratic controlled House of Representatives  members and committees could try to place holds on money in the next funding bill  she said  It is going to ensue into a battle   Beltrn said   because it is Congress that at the end of the day has the power of the purse     Associated Press writers Sonia Perez D  in Guatemala City  Freddy Cuevas in Tegucigalpa  Honduras  Matthew Lee in Washington and Mark Stevenson and Peter Orsi

BERLIN   Germany  like the United States  believes that Russia has breached the Cold War era Intermediate range Nuclear Forces Treaty  Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday U S  President Donald Trump has said Washington will withdraw from the 1987 INF treaty  this summer unless Moscow ends its alleged violations   an announcement that Merkel said she understood  Russia denies violating the INF treaty   Reporting by Andreas Rinke  Writing by Michelle Martin  Editing by Madeline Chambers  

WASHINGTON   The demise of the only U S  Russia arms control pact limiting deployed nuclear weapons would make it harder for each to gauge the other s intentions  giving both incentives to expand their arsenals  according to a study released on Monday The expiration of the New START accord also may undermine faith in the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  which calls on nuclear states such as the United States and Russia to work toward nuclear disarmament  as well as influence China s nuclear posture  historically one of restraint The study  produced by the CNA Corp non profit research group  is the most comprehensive public examination to date of the consequences of New START s demise  It argues for extending the 2011 treaty  which expires in February 2021 but can be extended for five years if both sides agree The Trump administration is deliberating whether to extend the pact  which President Donald Trump has reviled as a bad deal and his national security adviser  John Bolton  has long opposed  Russia has said it is prepared to extend New START but wants to discuss what it regards as U S  violations first The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the administration s deliberations Trump has said Washington will withdraw from another arms pact  the 1987 Intermediate range Nuclear Forces Treaty  this summer unless Moscow ends its alleged violations  compounding tense ties  Russia denies violating the INF treaty The New START treaty required the United States and Russia to cut their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1 550  the lowest level in decades  and limit delivery systems   land  and submarine based missiles and nuclear capable bombers It also includes extensive transparency measures requiring each side to allow the other to carry out 10 inspections of strategic nuclear bases each year  give 48 hours notice before new missiles covered by the treaty leave their factories  and provide notifications before ballistic missile launches Both sides must also exchange data declaring their deployed strategic nuclear warheads  delivery vehicles and launchers  as well as breakdowns of how many of each are located at individual bases All of that would end if the treaty expires  Neither country would have the same degree of confidence in its ability to assess the other s precise warhead levels   CNA s Vince Manzo wrote in the study  https   bit ly 2JUdSvW    Worst case planning is also more likely as a result  Increased opacity between U S  and Russian strategic nuclear forces would unfold within the broader context of growing mistrust and diverging perceptions about strategy  intentions  and perceptions   he added Without the data  the United States would have to reassign its overworked satellites  possibly devoting more surveillance to Russia and less to China  Iran and North Korea Another casualty of the treaty s expiration could be global nonproliferation  making non nuclear states doubt the United States and Russia will keep working toward nuclear disarmament under the NPT  the study said While it was impossible to predict how China   estimated to have about 280 nuclear warheads   would react to New START s expiry  the study cites factors that could make Beijing expand its capability Without a treaty limiting U S  and Russian nuclear forces  China could overestimate their arsenals  Unconstrained U S  and Russian forces could also strengthen voices in China that view a large arsenal as symbolically important  as well as those already advocating for more nuclear weapons The study recommends steps for the United States and Russia to mitigate the risks from the treaty s expiration  including voluntarily sticking to its limits and continuing to exchange data  It also recommends Washington propose annual exchanges of nuclear weapons information and dialogue with Beijing   Reporting by Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay  Editing by Mary Milliken and Dan Grebler  

COLUMBUS  Ohio   Interest rates may need move  a bit higher  if the U S  economy performs as expected and dodges fears of a global slowdown  a Federal Reserve policymaker said on Thursday Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said in a speech that she backed the central bank keeping interest rates steady for the moment between 2 25 and 2 5 percent  with  no urgency  to make any changes now But she said she expects a slowdown in the U S  economy this year and shown in recent economic data from factory activity to business and consumer confidence and inflation to be  temporary   I am biased to either keeping rates where they are or moving them up a little bit   Mester told reporters after the speech at a banking regulation event in Columbus  Ohio  If my likely outcome comes to pass then I think rates might have to go up a bit from where they are  But as you know the economy could evolve in a different way than I m expecting as my most likely outcome  Several Fed policymakers have in recent days used speeches and interviews to battle a view growing in financial markets  and embraced by the Trump administration  that the central bank will need to cut rates before long Mester  who is not voting on the central bank s policy this year but takes part in the deliberations  also said the Fed will be making decisions on how to transition its  4 trillion in assets to mainly U S  Treasuries  at upcoming meetings   The bank bought trillions of mortgage backed securities in the aftermath of the financial crisis to stimulate the economy Mester said business contacts in the district covered by her bank  which spans Ohio as well as parts of Pennsylvania  Kentucky and West Virginia  report that business has picked up after slowing late last year  That strength could offset a slowdown she sees in Europe and China But uncertainty over U S  China trade talks could still weigh on business spending  she said  China and the United States are in intense negotiations to end a months long trade war that has rattled global markets  Washington wants sweeping changes to China s economic and trade policies  while Beijing wants Trump to lift expensive sanctions on Chinese goods   Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama

CARACAS  Venezuela   Maduro loyalists stripped Venezuela s Juan Guaid of immunity Tuesday  paving the way for the opposition leader s prosecution and potential arrest for supposedly violating the constitution when he declared himself interim president But whether the government of President Nicolas Maduro will take action against the 35 year old lawmaker following the Constituent Assembly s decision remains unclear  Guaid has embarked on an international campaign to topple the president s socialist administration amid deepening social unrest in the country plagued by nearly a month of power outages  He declared himself Venezuela s interim president in January  and vowed to overthrow Maduro  So far  however  Maduro has avoided jailing the man that the administration of U S  President Donald Trump and roughly 50 other nations recognize as Venezuela s legitimate leader A defiant Guaid spoke publicly moments after the vote  saying he s undeterred  while knowing he runs the risk of being  kidnapped  by the Maduro government  We are aware of that   Guaido said   But we will not change our path  He cited low wages driving millions abroad and the spate of blackouts that have crippled the nation s public transportation  water services and communications The Trump administration has threatened the Maduro government with a strong response if Guaido is harmed and Florida Senator Marco Rubio   who has Trump s ear on Venezuela policy   said before the vote that nations recognizing Guaid as his country s legitimate leader should take any attempt by Maduro s government to  abduct  him as a coup  And anyone who cooperates with this should be treated as a coup plotter   dealt with accordingly   Rubio said on Twitter However  the vote against Guaid was unanimous  and Constituent Assembly president and socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello accused the opposition of naively inviting a foreign invasion and of inciting a civil war   They don t care about the deaths   Cabello said   They don t have the slightest idea   what the consequences of war are for a country  The Constituent Assembly  which is made up entirely of Maduro loyalists  met a day after Maduro ally and Venezuela Supreme Court of Justice Maikel Moreno ordered it to strip Guaid s immunity for violating an order banning him leaving the country while under investigation by the attorney general  The opposition leader is also accused of inciting violence through street protests  and of receiving illicit funds from abroad The Constitution guarantees immunity for elected officials  and says that in order to withdraw immunity the accused lawmaker must be given a preliminary hearing before the Supreme Court  The action must be approved by the National Assembly   steps that weren t taken in Guaid s case The Constitutional Assembly was created two years ago  when Maduro became frustrated by the democratically elected and opposition dominated National Assembly rejected the president s policies  Its creation essentially replaced the National Assembly  rendering it powerless Guaid has dismissed the Maduro stacked high court and Constituent Assembly as illegitimate  and continued his calls for Maduro to step down Guaid has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks  and Tuesday night s vote was but the latest instance of that  Officials have jailed his chief of staff  Roberto Marrero  and accused him of involvement in a  terrorist  scheme to overthrow the government  Maduro s government also barred Guaid from holding public office for 15 years for allegedly hiding or falsifying data in his sworn statement of assets The opposition leader  however  has drawn masses of Venezuelans into the streets and garnered broad international support  demanding Maduro give up rule of the crisis wracked nation Defying the court order  Guaid left the country in late February for a ten day tour of South America  meeting with foreign leaders who support the Venezuelan opposition and who reject Maduro s election last year for a second six year term Maduro blames Washington of attempting a coup to overthrow him and install Guaid s puppet government aimed at seizing Venezuela s vast oil reserves Geoff Ramsey  a Venezuela researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America  said the Maduro government may be assessing its strength amid the global community  This seems like an attempt to test the waters  weighing how the international community would react to detaining Guaido   Ramsey said   The government is reasserting its authority while also sending a clear signal to the opposition  we are in control     Associated Press writers Jorge Rueda and Fabiola Sanchez contributed to this story  

EL PASO  Texas   The surge of migrant families arriving at the southern border has led the Trump administration to dramatically expand a practice President Donald Trump has long mocked as  catch and release  With immigrant processing and holding centers overwhelmed  the administration is busing people hundreds of miles inland and releasing them at Greyhound stations and churches in cities like Albuquerque  San Antonio and Phoenix because towns close to the border already have more than they can handle Relief organizations in some cities are struggling to feed and house the migrants and warning that a public health crisis is taking shape  especially with sick infants and children among the many immigrant families who need medical attention  We re asking volunteer doctors and nurses and community members to step up and do what the government should be doing  If this was a hurricane  FEMA would be on the ground helping   said Jim Gannon  CEO and executive director of Catholic Charities in Albuquerque  New Mexico For many years  families arriving at the border were typically released from U S  custody immediately and allowed to settle in this country with family or friends while their cases wound their way through the courts  a process that often takes years Trump has railed against the practice  tweeting in November that it was over   Catch and Release is an obsolete term  It is now Catch and Detain  Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U S A   often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U S  Asylum  will be detained or turned away  But in recent months  the number of families crossing into the U S  has climbed to record highs  pushing the system to the breaking point  As a result  the government is releasing families faster  in greater numbers and at points farther removed from the border Since Dec  21  Immigration and Customs Enforcement has set free more than 125 000 people who came into the U S  as families Customs and Border Protection is also overloaded  and instead of holding families for up to 72 hours before turning them over to ICE  it has started releasing them directly into the U S  The numbers are overwhelming right now   said Gregory Archambault  ICE director of enforcement and removal operations in San Diego   Everybody is stressed  The agency is stressed  the  local governments  are stressed  the law enforcement agencies  Everybody is stressed because there are these mass numbers of people  ICE has been releasing asylum seeking families so quickly that they don t even have time to make travel arrangements  Families are given court dates  a head of household is often fitted with an ankle monitor  and they are dropped off at a charity run shelter or bus station San Antonio received part of that surge in recent days  forcing the city to open a help center with food for migrants In El Paso  where shelters and churches are at capacity and seats on buses headed out of the city are getting harder to find  authorities briefly resorted to holding migrants in a pen lined with concertina wire under the shade of a bridge that connects the American city to Juarez  Mexico  They closed the makeshift holding area over the weekend and moved the migrants to a place with more shelter  They treated us like animals   said Herling Jerlyn  a teenager from Guatemala Eduardo De Jesus Bermudez Florez waited for a Greyhound bus Tuesday to take him to Arlington  Texas  after spending time held under the bridge  where he said women cried through the night in cold temperatures The immigrant from El Salvador himself teared up as he described his ordeal  He became separated from his wife and their 10 year old daughter in Mexico before crossing the border  and he still doesn t know where they are  As De Jesus cried waiting for a bus  his 13 year old son held the charger for his ankle monitor battery  He d say  dad  I want to leave this place    said De Jesus  whose wife was once attacked with machetes by gang members   I just told him that from here we can t go back  Your future is here  Our country is too violent  In Albuquerque  nearly 280 miles from the border  faith based organizations have helped roughly 1 000 migrants since mid February  The groups were small at first  but they have been growing and the arrivals have become more frequent San Diego County recently opened a shuttered downtown courthouse slated for demolition to house up to 150 asylum seekers  A coalition of religious and civic groups that manages the shelter said it has helped more than 11 000 members of asylum seeking families since authorities began large scale releases in late October About 22 000 immigrants have been released in Arizona in the past three months  In the Phoenix area  the nonprofit organizations and churches taking them in have a capacity of only 700 a week  said Connie Phillips  president and CEO of Lutheran Social Services in the Southwest That means immigration authorities have to drop off families by the busload at places not designed to take them in  like the Greyhound station in Phoenix The bus company is no longer allowing anyone without a ticket to wait inside  so immigrant families  including little children  stand outside until a volunteer can get them in touch with a relative to buy them a ticket  That sometimes takes hours  The federal government is saying   This is not our responsibility    Phillips said   And the cities and states have not stepped up to provide any kind of emergency funding  She added   This is going to be a public health disaster  These are small children  these are families  these are babies  and we cannot have people just out in the heat  Authorities said family arrivals along the U S  Mexico border reached an all time high in February of 45 827 arrests or denials of entry  We didn t have family groups for years and years  like we have now   ICE s Archambault said   Our facilities are not made for this  We have diapers and baby formula and all this stuff  like a nursery  In another sign of how U S  authorities are being tested as rarely before  figures released Tuesday show a significant drop in prosecutions for illegal entry  even as arrests have climbed sharply  The numbers are at odds with Trump s vow to prosecute everyone who enters the country illegally In February  Customs and Border Protection referred 8 998 illegal entry cases to prosecutors along the border  a drop of 12  from January and 23  from October  according to Syracuse University s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse

JERUSALEM   In a charged election campaign that has been heavy on insults and short on substance  Israel s conflict with the Palestinians has been notably absent from the discourse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s ruling Likud Party has offered no plan for what many believe is the country s most existential problem  His main challenger in the April 9 vote speaks vaguely of  separation   while Netanyahu s hard line partners speak openly of the once unthinkable idea of annexing all or parts of the West Bank  Talk of a Palestinian state  the international community s preferred solution for the past two decades  is non existent It is a far cry from past elections  when peace with the Palestinians was the central issue for voters  This apparent lack of interest reflects widespread disillusionment in Israel over years of failed peace efforts But it also is a testament to Netanyahu s success in sidelining the issue  Capitalizing on internal Palestinian divisions and promoting sometimes contradictory policies  Netanyahu has succeeded in managing the conflict without addressing the bigger issue of how two intertwined peoples will live together in the future  Strong backing from the Trump administration has given him an extra boost  The peace track is currently in a coma   said Shmuel Rosner  a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute   There s not much hope for a viable solution to be revived in the near future  so people can just keep pushing it aside until someday it comes back to haunt them  Netanyahu took office in early 2009 and under heavy pressure from then President Barack Obama reluctantly stated his support for an independent Palestinian state  albeit with many conditions  which were rejected Things quickly went downhill  and serious peace talks never took place during Obama s time in office Throughout his tenure  Netanyahu has repeatedly cast blame on the Palestinians  accusing President Mahmoud Abbas  who seeks a negotiated settlement with Israel  of incitement and promoting  terror   At the same time  he has maintained behind the scenes security cooperation with Abbas  forces in the West Bank in a joint struggle against the Hamas militant group In the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip  Netanyahu has engaged in frequent rounds of fighting  but is also conducting behind the scenes negotiations with his bitter enemy in hopes of maintaining calm The Trump administration has further sidelined the Palestinians by cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital  prompting the Palestinians to sever ties with the U S  A long promised peace plan  which the White House says will be released after the election  faces dim prospects  if it is even released With the peace process in a deep freeze  it is perhaps no surprise that none of the major Israeli parties are talking about the Palestinians  The Palestinian cause is totally absent in the Israeli elections  and when it comes  it comes only in a negative context   said Ahmed Majdalani  a senior Palestinian official   This is worrisome  because it tells us that we are going from bad to worse  The Palestinians seek the West Bank  east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip   areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war   for an independent state  The so called two state solution is widely backed internationally as the best way to end the conflict If Israel continues to rule over millions of Palestinians  the thinking goes  the Palestinians will eventually abandon their dream of statehood and instead demand Israeli citizenship and full equality  In such a scenario  Israel would no longer be able to be both Jewish and democratic Israelis accuse the Palestinians of rejecting generous peace offers  most recently in late 2008  a narrative the Palestinians reject  The Israelis also point to the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza  which cleared the way for Hamas to seize power from Abbas  forces two years later Ahead of the election  several religious and nationalist parties  along with individual members of Netanyahu s Likud party  have openly called for annexing parts or all of the West Bank  These plans include a range of proposals for the Palestinians  including nonvoting residency rights  possible citizenship or financial incentives to emigrate It remains unclear how hard these parties  all potential coalition partners for Netanyahu  will push  though Trump s recent recognition of Israel s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights has led to stepped up calls for annexing West Bank territory Likud spokesman Eli Hazan said he does not expect annexation to be on the agenda  He said the party  strongly believes  in the status quo   We are against the one state solution and two state solution  Both ways may lead to the end of Israel as a Jewish and democratic country   he said Yohanan Plesner  president of the Israeli Democracy Institute and a former lawmaker  said he did not think Netanyahu would give in to the annexation calls   At the end of the day  West Bank annexation is the prerogative of the prime minister   he said Netanyahu s main challenger  former military chief Benny Gantz  has given Israel s  peace camp  some dim hope His Blue and White party s platform devotes just a few sentences to the Palestinians  promising  an open horizon for political settlement  and pledging to work with Arab neighbors to find a way to  deepen the separation   It makes no mention of Palestinian statehood  and says Israel will continue to maintain control of parts of the West Bank and never divide Jerusalem Ghassan Khatib  a former Palestinian negotiator  said the lack of interest on the Israeli side is harmful to the Palestinians in the short term but much worse for Israel in the long term  It means the end of the two state solution   he said   The alternative will be an apartheid system  and this will cause huge damage to Israeli democracy and the image of Israel  Yossi Beilin  one of the chief architects of Israel s historic 1993 interim peace agreement with the Palestinians  said Netanyahu s policies have been  devastating  for peace prospects  Yet he remains confident the two state solution will one day be adopted due to a lack of alternatives  and even believes that Gantz  for sure  will pursue a peace deal if elected Ironically  Trump s peace plan  if released  may force Netanyahu s hand  Beilin said  If elected  Netanyahu will have a hard time resisting his close friend s proposal while his hard line coalition partners oppose any concessions to the Palestinians  The impact of the plan might be very interesting   Beilin said    Associated Press writers Isabel Debre in Jerusalem and Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah  West Bank  contributed  

MEXICO CITY   Mexico s top security official says he twice crossed illegally into the United States in his youth to work La Jornada newspaper reported Monday that Public Safety Secretary Alfonso Durazo told a business gathering in the northern state of Sonora that out of economic necessity he went to the U S  to wash cars and dishes Durazo retweeted the newspaper s account Monday  His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment President Donald Trump has threatened to close the border with Mexico this week unless Mexico stops the flow of immigrants to the U S  border On Sunday  Mexico announced it would begin granting humanitarian visas again on a limited basis to some of the 2 500 Central American and Caribbean migrants currently in the southern state of Chiapas  

BEIJING   China said Monday it would begin regulating all fentanyl related drugs as a class of controlled substances  in a change U S  officials had long advocated as a way to stem the flow of lethal opioids from China The sweeping change in the way China regulates drugs that mimic fentanyl takes effect May 1 and could help end the game of regulatory whack a mole with chemists who can manufacture novel opioids faster than they can be banned  It could also facilitate prosecutions of opioid merchants in China  who until now have skirted the law by manufacturing and exporting fentanyl variants that were technically legal in China  We firmly believe that listing the entire class of fentanyl substances will completely block the loopholes that enable law breakers to evade punishment by simply modifying one or several atoms  functional groups or other groups   said Liu Yuejin  vice commissioner of China s National Narcotics Control Commission   It will effectively prevent the massive abuse of fentanyl substances and illegal drug trafficking and smuggling activities  and contribute to global drug control with China s wisdom and power  China already controls 25 variants of fentanyl  plus two precursors used to make the drug  Data from the U S  Drug Enforcement Administration have shown that when China bans a variant of fentanyl  seizures of that analog in the U S  fall U S  officials have repeatedly pointed to China as the main source of synthetic opioids shipped into the country directly by mail or transported via Mexico  China on Monday again denied that claim  China s control over fentanyl drugs is very strict   Liu told reporters   It cannot be the main source for the United States  The U S  accusation lacks evidence and is contrary to the facts  In 2017 and 2018  the U S  Department of Justice indicted the alleged kingpins of three opioid distribution networks in China  Liu chided U S  officials for bringing cases against Chinese nationals without first informing their Chinese counterparts  Until now  we haven t found that the relevant people infringed on Chinese laws  the U S  also has yet to present evidence showing that they have breached our laws   he said   The two sides are still progressing with cooperative investigative work  The U S   however  now takes some measures like indictments without informing us beforehand  This undermines the sound atmosphere of two sides  cooperation  We express regret for this  Monday s announcement from China s Ministry of Public Security  National Health Commission and National Medical Products Administration makes good on a pledge Chinese President Xi Jinping made to President Donald Trump during the G 20 summit in Argentina late last year At the time  Trump said China s new regulations could be  a game changer  for the United States  where tens of thousands of people die annually from opioid overdoses   Associated Press researcher Chen Si contributed to this report from Shanghai  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is blaming the Iranian government for damage from devastating floods that have killed at least 50 people Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says Tehran s  mismanagement  of urban planning and emergency preparedness led to the disaster  He s rejecting allegations from Iran s foreign minister that U S  sanctions against Iran are to blame Pompeo says the U S  is sympathetic to the victims and is willing to provide assistance for flood relief efforts but only through the International Red Cross and Red Crescent societies Iran s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif late Monday said U S  sanctions have prevented Tehran from getting badly needed equipment  including relief helicopters Iran has seen a decades long drought but the latest flooding is also blamed on disregard for safety measures and construction near rivers  

NEW YORK   President Donald Trump s threat to shut down the U S  Mexico border would hit American consumers   in the gut  From the avocados on avocado toast  to the limes and tequila in margaritas  the United States is heavily reliant on Mexican imports of fruit  vegetables and alcohol to meet consumer demand  Nearly half of all imported U S  vegetables and 40 percent of imported fruit are grown in Mexico  according to the latest data from the United States Department of Agriculture Americans would run out of avocados in three weeks if imports from Mexico were stopped  said Steve Barnard  president and chief executive of Mission Produce  the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world   You couldn t pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100 percent of the avocados in the U S  right now  California is just starting and they have a very small crop  but they re not relevant right now and won t be for another month or so   said Barnard  Trump said on Friday that there was a  very good likelihood  he would close the border this week if Mexico did not stop immigrants from reaching the United States  A complete shutdown would disrupt millions of legal border crossings in addition to asylum seekers  as well as billions of dollars in trade  about  137 billion of which is in food imports  When a border is closed or barriers to trade are put in place  I absolutely expect there would be an impact on consumers   said Monica Ganley  principal at Quarterra  a consultancy specializing in Latin American agricultural issues and trade  We re absolutely going to see higher prices  This is a very real and very relevant concern for American consumers  The effects of a shutdown would run both ways Mexico is the largest importer of U S  exports of refined fuels like diesel and gasoline  some of which moves by rail  It is unclear if rail terminals would be affected by closures As changing palates have increased demand for fresh produce  and a greater variety of it  the United States has increasingly come to depend on Mexico to meet that need  Imports have nearly tripled since 1999  In that period  Mexico has gone from supplying less than a third of imported produce to 44 percent today  In addition to avocados  the majority of imported tomatoes  cucumbers  blackberries and raspberries come from Mexico  While there are other producers of these goods globally  opening those trade channels would take time  said Ganley Although the share prices of U S  supermarket chains like Walmart and Kroger did not appear affected by Friday s announcement  food companies would ultimately feel the pain   We would be out of business for a while   said Barnard    Reporting by Kate Duguid  Editing by Dan Grebler  

Last year looked like the time when President Trump had delivered on his promises to strengthen the economy  His tax cuts appeared to juice growth above 3 percent  a pace the United States had not topped since 2005  But on Thursday the Commerce Department revised 2018 growth downward to below 3 percent  even as forecasts for 2019 were also trending lower  toward 2 percent  It all has triggered another wave of disappointed commentary about doggedly  slow  growth in the United States But it is not just an American story  and it s not just Mr  Trump who won t deliver on promises of 3  4 or even 5 percent growth  Across the world  economists have had to downgrade growth forecasts in most years since the global financial crisis of 2008 Defying the hopeful projections  Japan has rarely grown faster than 1 percent  Europe has struggled to sustain growth faster than 1 5 percent  No one quite knows how fast China is growing  but it s clear that there  too  the economy is slowing  So why is the dismal science suddenly guilty of issuing overly optimistic forecasts that set the whole world up for disappointment Economists keep basing forecasts on trends established during the postwar miracle years  when growth was boosted by expanding populations  rising productivity and exploding debt  But population and productivity growth had stagnated by 2008  and the financial crisis put a sudden end to the debt binge  The miracle is over Politicians often promise to bring back a golden age  but serious economists also are encouraging a similar illusion  Even during the Industrial Revolution  in the 19th century  the world economy rarely grew faster than 2 5 percent a year  until the post World War II baby boom began to rapidly expand the labor force  After 1950  the combination of more workers and more output per worker lifted the pace of global growth to 4 percent  Economists came to think 4 percent was  normal  Yet by last decade  the baby boom had faded out from Europe to Japan and China  Even in the United States  younger and faster growing than most developed countries  growth in the working age population slowed to a mere 0 2 percent last year from 1 2 percent in the early 2000s  Because fewer workers correlates directly with slower growth  that decrease implied a 1 point drop in economic growth Roughly  economists should have expected that United States economic growth would slow to 2 percent from 3 percent   and it has  This is the new normal for the American economy  Stimulus measures like the Trump tax cuts can lift growth above this path  but at best temporarily  at the risk of higher deficits and debt For political leaders  the new age of slow growth is not a problem to solve  it s a reality they need to accept and explain to the public  Because it s just not that bad When populations are growing slowly  the economy doesn t need to grow as fast to keep incomes high  Thus in the United States this decade  growth in gross domestic product per capita has slowed much more gradually than the overall economy  by half a point  to an average of 1 4 percent  And though Mr  Trump likes to boast about how well the United States is doing against developed rivals  Europe has been growing just as fast in per capita terms this decade  and Japan has been growing slightly faster  In a rich country  that is fast enough to satisfy most people  Indeed  surveys show that Americans have rarely been more confident about the economy Slower growth in the working age population also means less competition for jobs worldwide  which goes a long way to explaining why unemployment is now at record lows not only in the United States but also in Germany and Japan  Surely that s not a bad thing Whatever politicians tell the public  their attempts to bring back the miracle years are ill advised  Growth in the economy is driven by growth in the number of workers and in output per worker  or productivity  But since the postwar surges of 1950s and 60s  productivity growth has slowed  also defying government efforts to lift it For a time  the global economy kept motoring along anyway  fueled by a surge in debt  In the 1980s  central banks began winning the war on inflation  which allowed them to drop interest rates sharply  Lower borrowing costs unleashed a worldwide binge that saw debt surging from 100 percent of global gross domestic product in the late 1980s to 300 percent by 2008 Then the global financial crisis hit  ruining many private borrowers and lenders  many of whom are still wary of taking on new debt  After growing faster than the economy for three decades  debt growth in many countries  including the United States  has fallen back in line with economic growth  Even China  the one major country that dodged the crisis and experienced a surge in lending after 2008  is now reluctant to build on the mountain of debt that already weighs down its economy So the postwar miracle is over  Economic growth is weighed down by the baby bust and the debt hangover  Yet because economists continue to base forecasts on miracle rates of growth   4 percent for the world  3 percent for the United States   policymakers keep fighting to hit these targets  This is very risky There are growing calls from economists on both the right and the left to lower interest rates  or increase government spending  to boost growth even if that risks higher inflation  At the Federal Reserve  too  there is an emerging view that letting inflation rise above 2 percent  long considered a red line  may not be unwise The underlying assumption seems to be that policymakers must take action because 2 percent G D P  growth is intolerably slow  But must they  The confidence surveys suggest Americans are quite content with record low unemployment  benign inflation and 1 4 percent growth in gross domestic product per capita  Why then the rush to pump more money into the economy  which risks rekindling its debt problems and inflation The world does not need more debt and more inflation to counter trends of declining population growth and high indebtedness  Instead  economists need to adjust their forecasts and politicians need to rethink their polices to match this reality  Because trying to recreate a bygone golden age is a shaky way to build the future RelatedMore articles by Ruchir Sharma Opinion

In May 1987  Senator Gary Hart of Colorado was drummed out of the Democratic presidential contest following reports alleging an affair with Donna Rice  a 29 year old woman who was not his wife Months later  Douglas Ginsburg  a federal judge whom President Ronald Reagan had nominated for the Supreme Court  admitted that he had smoked marijuana years before  including as a young law professor  scuttling his candidacy The next summer  the Republican presidential nominee  George Bush  chose the little known Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his running mate  leading to a frantic investigation into how Mr  Quayle had gotten into the Indiana National Guard instead of serving in the Vietnam War   Rumors  never proven  also swirled about affairs and pot use   Mr  Quayle stayed on the ticket  but never quite recovered The late 1980s and 1990s marked a high water mark for a kind of giddy journalistic derangement over politicians  adultery  drug use and draft avoidance   a somewhat arbitrary trio of offenses inflated into mortal sins  Candidates and nominees for various public positions were barraged with questions on these issues  although no one ever showed that they bore on a person s fitness for office  These orgies of saturation press coverage  feverish speculation and moral righteousness were dubbed feeding frenzies In time  the manias subsided  Bill Clinton was elected president as an admitted philanderer  Barack Obama confessed to having used  a little blow  in his youth and no one cared  Not one of our baby boomer presidents served in Vietnam   a fact that troubles few people today So are we now able to evaluate aspirants for high office dispassionately  on the basis of their experience  achievements and qualifications  It sure isn t looking that way  More likely  we have just dropped one bucket of shark bait and picked up another We are now witnessing a feeding frenzy over Joe Biden s penchant for sometimes unwelcome public displays of affection  Mr  Biden  who is famous for overly tactile friendliness  has been dealing with two women s charges that he upset them by greeting them far too intimately  Pundits are now discussing whether these actions should end Mr  Biden s  as yet unannounced  presidential candidacy and even declaring point blank that he is the wrong man to succeed President Trump Charges about inappropriate touching must be heard and evaluated  But the more difficult question for journalists is whether these charges should become grounds for feeding frenzies   all consuming  multi day stories that  by virtue of their blanket coverage  signal to audiences that they outweigh everything else about a candidate  Front page stories  24 7 coverage and viral tweets can easily knock someone out of contention  Should they  How the press handles Mr  Biden s penchant for handling others will test whether it has learned from its mistakes in the days of Hart and Ginsburg and Quayle A historical lens may help us see things with a bit more dispassion  The media obsession with a specific set of gotcha issues  the conviction that they warrant an expenditure of vast journalistic resources  dates to the years after the Vietnam War and Watergate  Chastened by those national traumas  Americans  including journalists  concluded that they had sprung from the debauched or deformed characters of President Johnson and especially President Nixon   Character  became the watchword in politics But character was defined at once too vaguely and too narrowly  The imperative to evaluate character was too broad in that it gave journalists license to vet aspirants for the presidency  as well as for the Supreme Court  Cabinet appointments and other offices  by prying into their personal lives Yet it was also too narrow  because the peculiar foibles that the press fixated on were hardly sufficient to adequately judge someone s integrity or maturity or temperament  The issues of sex  drugs  and Vietnam loomed large for reporters of the Baby Boom generation because they provided an arena in which to work through unresolved feelings about the cultural transformations of the 1960s Eventually  the maturation of Generation X   whose members were largely unfazed by tales of sex  pot and draft dodging   diminished the potential of the boomers  pet issues to blossom into scandal  More broadly  the public was wearying of hyped up controversies that  it was becoming clear  had little or no relevance to how a politician performed his or her job Recently  though  America experienced another trauma  The election of Donald Trump   a rank misogynist and confessed sexual assaulter   over a woman seemingly destined to be America s first female president jolted many voters  Among its other effects  Trump s election helped spark the explosion of women s activism we have seen since 2016  including the long overdue insistence that we call sexual harassers and assaulters to account  If Mr  Trump couldn t be stopped  others guilty of like offenses would be policed with new vigor As many people recognize  however  for all the big shots  predators and cads rightly brought to justice  there have also been moments of excess   of sober judgment suspended  Most infamously  in late 2017  following multiple claims of inappropriate touching  the Senate peremptorily cast out Minnesota s Al Franken  before an ethics investigation could even occur  Mr  Franken denied that his actions amounted to sexual harassment  and apologized for them anyway  But when two new stories were posted to the internet in early December  his senate colleague Kirsten Gillibrand led a parade of lawmakers who demanded he give up his seat Like Gary Hart  Mr  Franken cannot blame others entirely  since he chose to step down  But a lot of Americans had and still have grave qualms about the lack of due process he was afforded  Clearly  both the media and the political class bore some responsibility for ratcheting up the pressure on him  instead of calling   as they could have   for cool deliberation to determine what actually happened  how severe his offenses were  and whether they should overshadow the many reasons his constituents might wish him to keep serving  as polls suggested they did  It is possible to cover stories such as these without creating feeding frenzies  Journalists can run fewer stories on a subject  talk about it once a day on cable news and not every hour  assume a matter of fact tone  remind themselves that Twitter isn t public opinion  question scandal material shopped by someone s political rivals  and in other ways bear in mind that many people deplore the media proclivity for these furors  When scandals relating to personal behavior arise  they can also ask themselves whether those behaviors reflect at all on how the politician might deal with Vladimir Putin  restore democracy to Venezuela  solve an immigration crisis or economic meltdown  or develop a plan for addressing health care costs or planetary dangers  And thoughtful coverage can illuminate the immense differences between  for example  Mr  Biden s occasionally cringe worthy physicality and Mr  Trump s contempt filled view of women as veritable pieces of meat Without such a tempered media environment  though  it is easy to imagine Mr  Biden or other candidates succumbing to media pressure as Mr  Franken did  without any careful weighing of the nature  severity and relevance of the alleged wrongdoing  Nonetheless  in our scandal soaked past there have also been politicians who withstood a media battering only to find their courage rewarded with the news that the public supported them all along   and that the headlines and headline news did not reflect popular opinion In 1989  for example  after disclosures that Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank had hired a male prostitute and kept the man on his payroll  many politicians  along with the Boston Globe  called on the congressman to resign  Mr  Frank resisted the pressure  submitted himself to the judgment of his constituents  and was reelected twelve more times Read moreOpinion coverage of Joe Biden Opinion   Ross Douthat  The Real Joe Biden DecisionApril 2  2019Opinion   Michelle Goldberg  The Wrong Time for Joe BidenApril 1  2019Opinion   David Leonhardt  In Biden s DefenseApril 2  2019Bill Clinton  too  stoutly rejected the pundits  calls during the Monica Lewinsky scandal that he abdicate  and he withstood impeachment by a Republican controlled House of Representatives  His approval ratings soared as the drama dragged on  showing again that voters don t always agree when a media mob calls for a politician s head More recently  Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia was found to have displayed a photo in his medical school yearbook of a student in blackface beside another one in Klan robes  Despite a cascade of calls for his resignation  he instead vowed to redouble his commitment to racial justice   and  a short while later  it turned out that most African Americans in the state wanted him to stay put These politicians at some level appreciated that a feeding frenzy is typically not a mirror but a distortion of public opinion  Consciously or intuitively  most of us know that public morality is distinct from private morality   that a great president or Supreme Court justice can be a flawed or rotten person  and a noble soul might be a lousy senator or governor   Of course  we can all think of a horrible human being who also made a terrible president   We need to remember that when we grill candidates about the taboo du jour  we aren t helping ourselves understand their suitability for leadership but rather working through other cultural concerns As for character  the real test of it may be whether a politician has the fortitude and self confidence to brave the media storm David Greenberg is a professor of history and of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University and the

Facebook considers a news serviceFacebook still hasn t solved its many problems with hosting false or misleading information  but Mark Zuckerberg says that it may start a dedicated news service   In India  Facebook is struggling to cope with disinformation and hate speech circulating ahead of elections  When local news outlets have raced to post  exclusive  information about hostilities between India and Pakistan  for instance  much of it has been false   Singapore has stopped waiting for Facebook to clamp down on false information and introduced draft legislation that would  among other things  require websites to run corrections alongside  online falsehoods  and would  cut off profits  of sites that spread it Against that backdrop  Mr  Zuckerberg is pitching the idea of a dedicated

British lawmakersBritain s Parliament reached no majority yesterday on proposals for the country s exit from the E U   worsening the disarray over Brexit less than two weeks before the deadline to

the country closely to the bloc  It failed 276 273   The failure to agree on any of them means Britain is facing the deadline with nothing resolved and all the options remaining on the table   Mr  Castle writes   It also underscores the stalemate in Parliament where different factions appear unable to compromise enough to swing behind any one vision for Brexit   Something will have to give soon  however  By April 10  Mrs  May needs to get a Brexit agreement through Parliament or ask the leaders of the European Union for a longer delay if she wants to avoid leaving without a deal   Mr  Castle adds  A last resort option  a general election Mrs  May s cabinet will hold a five hour meeting today  which the FT says  is likely to be a brutal and potentially decisive meeting to discuss what

President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will probably soon reach a trade agreement  but that won t solve the biggest problems The Chinese regime is interning people based on religion in a more systematic way than any other regime since perhaps the Nazis  Its tolerance of fentanyl trafficking leads to some 20 000 drug overdose deaths in the United States each year  It steals intellectual property and ratchets up persecution at home I lived in China  speak Chinese and deeply admire the country  Yet I am increasingly repulsed by Xi s China  for he is dragging the country in the wrong direction by imprisoning lawyers  journalists and people of faith  tightening controls over the internet  creating international security risks in the South China Sea  and fostering a personality cult around himself In fairness  it s also true that the Chinese government has helped lift more people out of poverty than any other government in human history  Just since 1990  the mortality rate for children under 5 has fallen in China by 83 percent   suggesting  by my calculations  that an additional 676 000 Chinese children survive each year who previously would have died  Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world  shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes  For a behind the scenes look at Nick s gritty journalism  sign up for his newsletter  Those of us who condemn China for human rights violations must also acknowledge this uncomfortable truth  A child born in Beijing today has a substantially longer life expectancy  82 years  than a child born in Washington  D C   77 years   In short  the Xi regime is complicated  It cheats  oppresses and brutalizes  but it also educates  enriches and saves lives I ve seen the worst of China  I was on Tiananmen Square in 1989 when troops opened fire on the crowd I was in  I ve also seen the best  impoverished families in western China moving out of caves into modern homes and sending their children to universities  I used to believe that China was best approached with ambivalence  but in the last few years the ambivalence has faded into wariness When a trade deal is reached  President Trump may hail it as a triumph  and it will probably result in announcements of Chinese purchases of American goods  A trade deal is a good thing  but I hope that the United States will work with allies and firmly stand up to China on three issues in particular First  to the extent possible  we should try to curb Chinese high technology firms  access to Western markets  These businesses are a security threat  and the Trump administration is right to be concerned  If a company like Huawei is asked to cooperate with Chinese State Security spies  its executives simply can t say no This doesn t mean that China is evil  American companies sold telecommunications equipment to China beginning in the 1980s that let us intercept officials  conversations there  and we have inserted cyber  back doors  into goods and software sold to China so that we can cause damage in the event of a conflict  China purchased a Boeing 767 in 2000 to be its presidential jet and it arrived riddled with listening devices  China inevitably will try to do to us what we already did to it Second  we should continue to highlight human rights  especially China s internment of perhaps one million Muslims in re education camps  This is a staggering affront to religious liberty  with Chinese officials reportedly forcing Muslims to violate their faith by eating pork and drinking alcohol Bravo to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for forthrightly denouncing China s  awful abuses  in detaining  hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of Uighurs   as well as its persecution of Christians  The Chinese authorities have even installed monitoring cameras inside Muslims  homes  and they have sent many Muslim parents to re education camps  leaving the children left behind to be brainwashed in boarding schools Third  we need continued pressure on China over its exports of fentanyl  the synthetic opioid that is killing Americans in huge numbers through overdoses  Two thirds or more of the fentanyl in the U S  originates in China  where the authorities have been promising since 2016 to crack down on it A few days ago  China announced that it would soon ban all variants of fentanyl  a welcome step that may make a difference  But China often promises cooperation that does not materialize  and everything will depend on enforcement over the country s 160 000 chemical companies  Too many lives hang in the balance to take China at its word About 20 000 Americans appear to be dying each year from Chinese fentanyl  some of it entering via Mexico   That s a toll of devastation far greater than that caused by terrorists in the U S  over multiple decades  and it should arouse far more outrage than Chinese companies pirating videos So  sure  a good trade deal with China is welcome  But when so many Americans are dying from Chinese fentanyl  when one million Muslims are interned  when Emperor Xi is dragging China in the wrong direction  let s not celebrate but  instead  keep up the international pressure READ MORE FROM OPINION ON CHINAOpinion   Derek Scissors And Daniel Blumenthal  China Is a Dangerous Rival  and America Should Treat It Like OneJan  14

CIUDAD JUAREZ   Trucks delivering goods from Mexico to the United States are facing up to 12 hours of gridlock  drivers said  after a transfer of U S  border agents to immigration duties slowed the flow of commercial traffic at several border crossings President Donald Trump took a step back on Tuesday from his threat to close the U S  southern border to fight illegal immigration  amid pressure from companies worried that a shutdown would inflict chaos on supply chains and the  1 7 billion daily trade But the reshuffling of border agents  announced last week to process the record number of migrant families entering the United States from Mexico  prompted delays of up to 12 hours for trucks crossing from Mexico s Ciudad Juarez to El Paso  Texas  truckers told Reuters  Industry is most affected by this situation  due to the millions in fines they have to pay when deliveries arrive late to clients   said Manuel Sotelo  head of the truckers union in Ciudad Juarez  He said the delays could even lead to the cancellation of contracts and layoffs Senior U S  Department of Homeland Security officials said on Tuesday the recent redeployment of some 750 officers on the border to deal with a surge in migrants   mostly Central American families turning themselves in to border agents   led to the slowing of legal crossings and commerce at ports of entry  The U S  threat is being carried out and having an impact on factories  transportation companies and most directly on drivers   truck driver Jose Cota said The U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  said in a statement that  as of Monday  the Otay Mesa commercial facility  one of the ports of entry at the San Diego Tijuana crossing  would operate eight out of the 10 truck lanes for the inspection and processing of imports and conveyances from Mexico  The indefinite reduction of processing lanes at the Otay Mesa commercial facility is due to this deployment  of agents   As such  we will be unable to extend the hours of operation impacting our ability to provide services after our regular closing times   it said Mexico s customs agency said the Nuevo Laredo Laredo crossing from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas into Texas was also affected and asked truck drivers to reschedule their deliveries considering that the port of entry would now close at 11 00 p m  daily Trump said on Friday he would close the border this week unless Mexico acted to curb a surge of asylum seekers from countries in Central America  He backed off that on Tuesday  saying that Mexico had made progress in detaining migrant flows Long lines of trucks started forming at the border crossings from Friday  as the number of agents was cut  said Cota  who had been waiting since 6 a m  to cross into El Paso  There is no danger     this is just the United States government s way of pressuring and blackmailing   Cota said Mexico s foreign minister  Marcelo Ebrard  also noted that commercial traffic at the U S  Mexico border had slowed at several crossings due to the transfer of U S  border agents  They don t intend on shutting  the border  but they have this problem that they are reallocating personnel   Ebrard said  He said Mexico would be prepared for the possibility of a border shutdown if it were to happen   Reporting by Jose Luis Gonzalez in Ciudad Juarez and Lizbeth Diaz in Mexico City  Additional reporting by Alexandra Alper in Washington  Writing by Anthony Esposito  Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Leslie Adler

It takes Carlos Rojas two and a half to three hours to drive from his home in Stockton  Calif   to a job spreading plaster on houses going up in Campbell  on the southern rim of Silicon Valley  The trip is worth it  though  The 30 year old immigrant from the Mexican state of Oaxaca says he makes roughly  25 an hour  depending on the job  That s more than twice as much as Stockton s farmworkers typically make in the fields  And his boss pays for gas   A lot of people returned to Mexico after the housing bust  and then came the deportations   he said   People got scarce  Now that the work came back they are short of people  Nationwide  the average wage of nonsupervisory workers in residential construction hit  25 34 an hour in January  That s over 6 percent more than a year earlier  close to the steepest annual increase since the government started keeping track almost 30 years ago  Pay is taking off even among those in less skilled construction trades  The gains are part of a broader trend  The tightest labor market in more than half a century is finally lifting the wages of the least skilled workers on the bottom rung of the labor force  bucking years of stagnation But to hear builders tell it  the rising cost of their crews reflects a demographic reality that could hamstring industries besides their own  Their labor force is shrinking  President Trump s threat to close the Mexican border  a move that would cause damage to both economies  only adds to the pressure  Immigration   often illegal   has long acted as a supply line for low skilled workers  Even before Mr  Trump ratcheted up border enforcement  economic growth in Mexico and the aging of the country s population were reducing the flow of Mexican workers into the United States  The number of undocumented immigrants in America declined to 10 7 million at the end of 2017 from a peak of over 12 million at the height of the housing bubble in 2008  according to the Center for Migration Studies   Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  The problem for builders is that the recovery in home building has outpaced the growth of the construction labor force  Housing starts have picked up to a pace of 1 2 million a month  more than twice as many as at their trough in April 2009  The number of nonsupervisory workers in residential construction  by contrast  has increased by only 40 percent since hitting bottom in 2011  to about 530 000  ImageA crew in Dallas connecting a new home to the water supply  In some less skilled work  about half the jobs are held by immigrants CreditCooper Neill for The New York Times The recent shortage of immigrant workers is impacting housing and housing affordability   said Jerry Howard  chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders  Phil Crone  who runs the association s Dallas chapter  said the labor bottleneck was adding about  6 000 to the cost of every home built in the area and delaying completion by two months Were it not for immigrants  the labor crunch would be even more intense  In 2016  immigrants accounted for one in four construction workers  according to a study by Natalia Siniavskaia of the home builders  association  up from about one in five in 2004  In some of the least skilled jobs   like plastering  roofing and hanging drywall  for which workers rarely have more than a high school education   the share of immigrants hovers around half  The need for labor has set off a scramble for bodies that is spilling across industries and driving up wages   A lot of our landscape companies are upset because their guys are coming into construction because they can earn more   said Alan Hoffmann  who builds energy efficient homes in Dallas For all the fears of robots taking over jobs  some economists are worrying about the broader economic fallout from a lack of low skilled workers  And businesses across the economy are complaining that without immigration they will be left without a work force  It is good for wages to go up  but if labor is at a point where employers can t hire  it is reducing growth   said Pia Orrenius  an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas   There s also considerable wage pressure in small towns and cities that are depopulating  but that is a sign of distress  not of rising productivity  The labor crunch is likely to persist for some time  The Pew Research Center projects very little growth in the working age population over the next two decades  If the United States were to cut off the flow of new immigrants  Pew noted  its working population would shrink to 166 million in 2035 from 173 million in 2015 Immigration has been padding the labor force for years  Over the last two decades  immigrants and their children accounted for more than half the growth of the population of 25  to 64 year olds  according to Pew s analysis  Over the next 20 years  they will have to plug the hole left by the retirement of the baby boom generation Children of Immigrants Will Expand the Labor Force       g working age immigration box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g

of those arriving will be 25 to 64 years old  as is now the case Source  Pew Research CenterBy The New York TimesBut the share of immigrants over 25 with less than a bachelor s degree   the most likely to seek a job hanging drywall or spreading plaster   has steadily shrunk  to 70 percent in 2016 from 76 percent in 2000  according to the Pew Research Center Although the Trump administration has tried to shift immigration policy to limit the entry of less educated immigrants and draw more workers with advanced degrees  businesses are still hungry for immigrants with lesser skills Immigrants make up almost a third of workers in the hotel and lodging industry and over a fifth of workers in the food service industry  according to the Brookings Institution  There are over a million immigrant workers in the direct care industry   home health aides and personal care aides tending to the sick and the frail  That amounts to about one fourth of the total  said Robert Espinoza of PHI  a nonprofit group that does research and advocacy for direct care workers Few of these workers studied past high school  Many didn t get their diploma  Barring immigration  such workers would be hard to find  There are fewer working age Americans who studied no further than high school than there were 20 years ago  according to an analysis of census data by Ms  Orrenius and Madeline Zavodny of the University of North Florida Businesses scrambling for low skilled workers provide a glimpse into the kind of strains a future of low immigration might bring  Consider agriculture  where seven in 10 workers were born in Mexico  and only one in four was born in the United States  Last year  the United States issued nearly 200 000 H 2A visas for agricultural workers  three times as many as in 2012  as farmers tried to make up for the decline in the undocumented work force  Growers complain about the bureaucracy and costs associated with the visa program and worry that a government hostile toward immigrant work might decide to curtail it Some growers are resorting to other tactics  too   We re seeing a large transition of growing from California down to Mexico   said Larry Cox  who farms in California s Imperial Valley as well as in Sinaloa and Guanajuato in Mexico Builders would love to have some of those options  For now  the H 2B visa seems to be their only one  Though it wasn t really designed for them  but rather to fill seasonal jobs outside of agriculture  builders are now scrambling to file H 2B applications  and they are lobbying Congress and the administration to get the Department of Homeland Security to double the allocation  The cap for the 2019 fiscal year was exhausted in February ImageAlan Hoffmann  a Dallas builder  said employers in other industries were losing workers to construction  where wages were higher CreditCooper Neill for The New York TimesBut builders know the H 2B visa won t solve their problems  Many of the high school students who would replenish the pipeline of carpenters  plumbers and electricians are undocumented immigrants   Half of the kids in the high school carpentry programs are DACA kids   said Mr  Hoffmann  the Dallas builder  referring to a program that allows unauthorized minors to stay in the United States   They are not documented  so we can t work with them  Could the United States cope without low skilled workers from abroad  The Conference Board projects that the working age population with a high school certificate or less will continue to decline  But the economy will continue to create low skill jobs  Nearly 600 000 in food preparation and service alone will be added between 2016 and 2026  And nearly 800 000 in direct care For all the ingenuity in Silicon Valley  there is little evidence so far that those jobs can be fully automated  Even Mr  Trump  who has insistently demanded funding for a wall along the southwestern border to keep undocumented immigrants out  appears to have softened

PARIS   A landmark order from China for 300 Airbus jets signed during a state visit last week was bolstered by repeat announcements of dozens of existing deals and advance approval for deals that have yet to be struck  two people familiar with the matter said Echoing an umbrella order for 300 Boeing jets awarded during a visit to Beijing by U S  President Donald Trump in 2017  the headline figure for the new  framework order  for European jets was partly driven by political considerations  the people said The Airbus deal would have been worth some  35 billion at list prices but the amount of new business is lower  they added  Duplicate announcements included a deal for 10 A350 aircraft to an unnamed buyer  which represents a repeat announcement of an order for 10 jets by Sichuan Airlines at an air show last year The disclosure takes some of the shine off an announcement widely regarded as the economic highlight of a trip to Europe by Chinese President Xi Jinping  Nonetheless the deal marked a return to the aircraft market by China s state buying agency after a pause of over a year during global trade tensions The overall figure of 300 was introduced late in the process and after Xi s visit was underway  although plane orders typically take months to negotiate  one of the people said Airbus declined to comment on detailed orders but left open the possibility that the large total contained gaps The agreement  creates the approval framework for aircraft ordered by Chinese airlines  be it existing orders or future orders   a spokesman said TRADE TIESAirbus shares fell 0 7 percent on Tuesday  extending earlier losses after Reuters reported gaps in the China deal  Airbus  stock had risen almost two percent after China s mega order  signed in Paris on March 25 in front of Xi and French President Emmanuel Macron Industry sources say major planemakers play by similar rules when selling to China  where they face a two tier system of negotiations with airlines within a framework of state backed umbrella deals that may be influenced by geopolitics But the headline figures for new orders during high profile diplomatic visits  which for several years hovered around 150 aircraft for both Airbus and Boeing  have increased as trade ties between Washington and China go through highs and lows In November 2017  months before a trade war erupted with the imposition of tariffs  China announced an order for 300 Boeing jets during a visit to Beijing by U S  President Donald Trump Analysts expressed doubts at the time over how much of that was new business  and said part of the announcement represented renewed government support for deals already on Boeing s books  The most recent Airbus and Boeing deals followed a similar pattern   said a China aircraft industry specialist Boeing is now seen as next in line to secure a 200 300 plane order as part of a possible economic truce being negotiated to end the trade war  but the recent grounding of one of its jets has cast uncertainty over the timing of the deal Boeing and Airbus compete fiercely to serve the needs of the world s fastest growing airplane market  while bracing for future competition from China s own aerospace industry  Analysts say Beijing tends over time to balance U S  and European purchases  though recent years have seen the rise of a growing number of independent Chinese leasing companies and an increase in autonomous decision making by several airlines   Reporting by Tim Hepher  Additional reporting by Marine Pennetier  Editing by Sudip Kar Gupta and Richard Lough  

LONDON   Politico reported the other day that the French European affairs minister  Nathalie Loiseau  had named her cat  Brexit   Loiseau told the Journal du Dimanche that she chose the name because  he wakes me up every morning meowing to death because he wants to go out  and then when I open the door he stays in the middle  undecided  and then gives me evil looks when I put him out  If you can t take a joke you shouldn t have come to London right now  because there is political farce everywhere  In truth  though  it s not very funny  It s actually tragic  What we re seeing is a country that s determined to commit economic suicide but can t even agree on how to kill itself  It is an epic failure of political leadership I say bring back the monarchy  Where have you gone  Queen Elizabeth II  a nation turns its lonely eyes to you Seriously  the United Kingdom  the world s fifth largest economy   a country whose elites created modern parliamentary democracy  modern banking and finance  the Industrial Revolution and the whole concept of globalization   seems dead set on quitting the European Union  the world s largest market for the free movement of goods  capital  services and labor  without a well conceived plan  or maybe without any plan at all Both Conservative and Labour members of Parliament keep voting down one plan after another  looking for the perfect fix  the pain free exit from the E U  But there is none  because you can t fix stupid  The entire Brexit choice was presented to the public in 2016 with utterly misleading simplicity  It was sold with a pack of lies about both the size of the benefits and the ease of implementation  and it continues to be pushed by Conservative hard liners who used to care about business but are now obsessed with restoring Britain s  sovereignty  over any economic considerations They don t seem to be listening at all to people like Tom Enders  C E O  of the aerospace giant Airbus  which employs more than 14 000 people in the U K   with around 110 000 more local jobs connected to its supply chains  Enders has warned the political leadership here that if the U K  just crashes out of the E U  in the coming weeks  Airbus may be forced to make some  potentially very harmful decisions  about its operations in Britain  Please don t listen to the Brexiteers  madness which asserts that  because we have huge plants here we will not move     They are wrong   he said   And  make no mistake  there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft  RelatedOpinion   Sam ByersBritain Is Drowning Itself in NostalgiaMarch 23  2019Opinion   Jenni RussellIs Theresa May the Worst Politician Ever March 29  2019Opinion   Pankaj MishraThe Malign Incompetence of the British Ruling Class Jan  17  2019I understand the grievances of many of those who voted to leave the E U  For starters  they felt swamped by E U  immigrants  There are reportedly some 300 000 French citizens living in London  which would make it one of the biggest French cities in the world  I had a drink with a member of Parliament in the bar in the House of Commons on Tuesday  and as we sat down he whispered to me that  not a single person working in this whole building is British  I also get the resentment of Brits at having regulations set by faceless E U  bureaucrats in Brussels  And I get their resentment at the globalized urban elites  who those in the rural areas here believed looked down at them  And I get the squeeze on middle class wages here that gets blamed  unfairly  on the E U  and immigrants the way President Trump blames Mexicans  I get all of that But I also get what it means to be a leader in the 21st century  And it sure doesn t mean asserting your sovereignty over all other considerations or breaking out of the giant E U  market  where the U K  sends over 40 percent of its exports  without a serious national discussion of the costs and benefits What do the most effective leaders today have in common  They wake up every morning and ask themselves the same questions   What world am I living in  What are the biggest trends in this world  And how do I educate my citizens about this world and align my policies so more of my people can get the best out of these trends and cushion the worst  So what world are we living in  For starters  we re living in a world that is becoming so interconnected   thanks to digitization  the internet  broadband  mobile devices  the cloud and soon to be 5G wireless transmissions   that we are becoming interdependent to an unprecedented degree  In this world  growth increasingly depends on the ability of yourself  your community  your town  your factory  your school and your country to be connected to more and more of the flows of knowledge and investment   and not just rely on stocks of stuff Over centuries  notes John Hagel  who currently co heads Deloitte s Center for the Edge  business has  been organized around stocks of knowledge as the basis for value creation  The key to creating economic value has been to acquire some proprietary knowledge stocks  aggressively protect those knowledge stocks and then efficiently extract the economic value from those knowledge stocks and deliver them to the market  The challenge in a more rapidly changing world is that knowledge stocks depreciate at an accelerating rate  In this kind of world  the key source of economic value shifts from stocks to flows  The companies that will create the most economic value in the future   Hagel says   will be the ones that find ways to participate more effectively in a broader range of more diverse knowledge flows that can refresh knowledge stocks at an accelerating rate  And yet Britain is ruled today by a party that wants to disconnect from a connected world  The notion that the U K  will suddenly get a great free trade deal from Trump as soon as it quits the E U  is ludicrous  Trump believes in competitive nationalism  and the very reason he is promoting the breakup of the E U  is that he believes America can dominate the E U  s individual economies much better than when they negotiate together as the single biggest market in the world The second thing the best leaders understand is that in a world of simultaneous accelerations in technology and globalization  keeping your country as open as possible to as many flows as possible is advantageous for two reasons  You get all the change signals first and have to respond to them and you attract the most high I Q  risk takers  who tend to be the people who start or advance new companies In the U S   who is the C E O  of Microsoft  Satya Nadella  Who is the C E O  of Google  Sundar Pichai  Who is the C E O  of Adobe  Shantanu Narayen  Who is the C E O  of Workday  Aneel Bhusri  Hello London  The best talent wants to go to the most open systems   open both to immigrants and trade   because that is where the most opportunities are  Britain is about to put up a big sign  GO AWAY The wisest leaders also understand that all the big problems today are global problems  and they have only global solutions  I am talking about climate change  trade rules  technology standards and preventing excesses and contagion in financial markets  If your country wants to have a say in how those problems are solved   and your country s name is not America  Russia  China or India   you need to be part of a wider coalition like the European Union  The U K  membership in the E U  has given it an outsize voice in world affairs And there s just one more thing the best leaders know  a little history  Trump is fine with a world of competitive European nationalisms  not a strong European Union  So is Vladimir Putin  So  it seems  are the Brexiteers  How quickly they ve all forgotten that the E U  and NATO were built to prevent the very competitive nationalism that ran riot in Europe in the 20th century and brought us two world wars Sorry to be so despondent  but I went to graduate school here on a Marshall scholarship from the British government  was married here and started as a journalist on Fleet Street in London  I like the place  But this is not the reasonably competent British government I grew up with  It s being led by a ship of fools   a Conservative Party bloc that is now radical in its obsession with leaving Europe and a Labour Party that has gone Marxist  If the people here can t force their politicians to compromise with one another and with reality  there s still a glimmer of hope that this might happen   there is going to be a crackup of the British political system and some serious economic pain  This is scary The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the

NEW YORK   On the opening day of a gathering of black leaders and voters in New York  two Texans seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination delved into the issue of reparations for African Americans over slavery Speaking at the four day conference of the National Action Network  the civil rights organization founded by the Rev  Al Sharpton  former Texas Rep  Beto O Rourke and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro weighed in on the topic  The question of whether to support reparations for African Americans as a means of addressing centuries of slavery and legal discrimination emerged as something of a litmus test earlier this year for Democratic presidential candidates After a speech that at times drew on stories of civil rights history from O Rourke s hometown of El Paso  he was asked by Sharpton whether he would back a House bill that would create a commission to study the issue of reparations  He said equivocally that he would back the bill  sponsored this year by Democratic Rep  Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas Later  O Rourke said that he d discussed the issue with Brian Stevenson  the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative   Foundational to reparations is the word repair  foundational to repair is the truth   O Rourke said  Until all Americans understand that civil rights  also involves  the injustices that have been visited and continue to be visited on people  we will never get the change that we need to live up to the promise of this country  So absolutely I would sign that into law   he said According to Jackson Lee  the bill would  make recommendations concerning any form of apology and compensation to begin the long delayed process of atonement for slavery  O Rourke is the latest 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to back the legislation  Castro  Sen  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen  Cory Booker of New Jersey also support it Castro  one of the most vocal candidates on the issue  said Wednesday that he has long believed  that our country will never truly heal until we address the original sin of slavery   If  under our Constitution  we compensate people if we take their property  why wouldn t we compensate people who were considered property and sanctioned by the state   he asked the crowd The annual Manhattan conference plays host to presidential hopefuls and other influential speakers each year  By the end of the week  a dozen Democrats running in 2020 will take the stage alongside Sharpton to make their pitch to black voters  While the candidates who spoke Wednesday drew distinctions on their views on reparations  they also discussed reforming the cash bail system  endorsed automatic and same day voter registration  and voiced support for legalizing marijuana O Rourke also said that he would support reversing an order from the Trump Justice Department that restricted the federal government s ability to use court enforced consent decrees when state and local law enforcement agencies are accused of abuse  Filed in federal court and overseen by a monitor  a consent decree is generally a road map for changes in fundamental law enforcement practices  Civil rights groups have said the move by the Trump Justice Department rolled back progress made under the Obama administration  There must be accountability for enforcement of the law  there must be accountability for use of force  and federal funds to local police departments and sheriff s departments must be tied to accountability   O Rourke said Wednesday Following his remarks  O Rourke was asked by reporters about the scrutiny former Vice President Joe Biden is facing over his past behavior with women  Two women have said that Biden   who is considering a 2020 presidential bid of his own   had touched them in overly familiar ways  Biden has said he doesn t believe he has acted inappropriately during his long public life but will pay attention to women s experiences  I think we need to listen to those who are raising their stories who have the courage to come forward   O Rourke told reporters

nudge ever closer to striking an agreement  Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT explain how one of its key tenets could undercut Washington s vision    Any agreement seems certain to involve China s promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods  For Mr  Trump  this is an essential element that will help reduce the United States  record trade deficit with China     But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state  and most will be carried out by state controlled Chinese businesses  further cementing Beijing s role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese   Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by next week  to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He  the Chinese special envoy charged with negotiating the deal   Ms  Swanson and Mr  Bradsher write  The goal is reportedly  to have an agreement by the end of that meeting  with a signing ceremony between Mr  Trump and President Xi Jinping of China potentially later this month  But there are still sticking points   Those include how an agreement will be monitored and enforced  and how many of Mr  Trump s tariffs

WASHINGTON   Joseph R  Biden Jr  came up in politics as an old school backslapper whose greatest strength was his ability to connect  He doled out handshakes and hugs to friends and strangers alike  and his tendency to lavish his affections on women and girls was so central to his persona that it became fodder for late night television jokes But the political ground has shifted under Mr  Biden  and his tactile style of retail politicking is no longer a laughing matter in the era of  MeToo  Now  as he considers a run for president  Mr  Biden is struggling to prevent a strength from turning into a crippling liability  on Tuesday alone  two more women told The New York Times that the former vice president s touches made them uncomfortable For Mr  Biden  76  the risks are obvious  the accusations feed into a narrative that he is a relic of the past  unsuited to represent his party in the modern era  against an incumbent president whose treatment of women should be a central line of attack  Mr  Biden has denied acting inappropriately but has said he will  listen respectfully  So far  no prominent Democrat has suggested he not run  and the women complaining about him have not claimed sexual harassment or assault  Other women have stepped forward to say Mr  Biden s touches were welcome  But the accusations lodged against Mr  Biden have raised questions about when a  tactile politician  crosses the line into inappropriateness  I don t think it s disqualifying   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an interview with Politico Playbook  But she added   He has to understand in the world that we re in now that people s space is important to them  and what s important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it  Gloria Steinem  the feminist icon  said politicians needed to set parameters   The way out is simple  Our bodies and voices belong to us   that should be the first step in democracy  Just ask before hugging  With a vibrant  youthful and multicultural field of candidates on the Democratic stage   and after a midterm election that swept dozens of women into Congress   Mr  Biden is already facing questions about whether this is the time for an older white man to carry his party s banner into 2020  His handling of the 1991 confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas  who was accused of sexual harassment by the law professor Anita Hill  has also been the subject of scrutiny Now some analysts are envisioning President Trump   who admitted on videotape to grabbing women without their consent   tagging the former vice president with a nickname that has emerged on the internet  Creepy Uncle Joe   A pro Trump group  the Great America PAC  said Tuesday it would release a  Creepy Joe  Biden ad  As if on cue  the president went after Mr  Biden at a fund raiser in Washington on Tuesday night  Cracking a joke about asking for a kiss  Mr  Trump said   I felt like Joe Biden  VideoIn an interview published by Politico Playbook  Speaker Nancy Pelosi discussed the accusations against Joseph R  Biden Jr  by women who said the former vice president s touches made them uncomfortable  Ms  Pelosi s remarks were delivered against the backdrop of Mr  Biden s impending decision to run for president in 2020 CreditCreditErin Schaff The New York TimesFor Democrats  that is problematic  It opens the door for a discussion about whether Joe Biden can actually credibly take on Donald Trump on a series of issues that the Democratic Party is seen as quite strong on   said Jennifer L  Lawless  an expert on women in politics at the University of Virginia The list of women coming forward is growing  Caitlyn Caruso  a former college student and sexual assault survivor  said Mr  Biden rested his hand on her thigh   even as she squirmed in her seat to show her discomfort   and hugged her  just a little bit too long  at an event on sexual assault at the University of Nevada  Las Vegas  She was 19 Ms  Caruso  now 22  said she chalked up the encounter at the time to how men act  and did not say anything publicly  But she said it was particularly uncomfortable because she had just shared her own story of sexual assault and had expected Mr  Biden   an architect of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act   to understand the importance of physical boundaries  It doesn t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that   she said   These are supposed to be people you can trust  D  J  Hill  59  a writer who recalled meeting Mr  Biden in 2012 at a fund raising event in Minneapolis  said that when she and her husband  Robert  stepped up to take their photograph with the vice president  he put his hand on her shoulder and then started dropping it down her back  which made her  very uncomfortable  Her husband  seeing the movement  put his hand on Mr  Biden s shoulder and interrupted with a joke  Ms  Hill did not say anything at the time and acknowledged that she does not know what Mr  Biden s intention was or whether he was aware of her discomfit  Only he knows his intent   she said  But norms are changing now  she said  and  if something makes you feel uncomfortable  you have to feel able to say it  Even as these women come forward  a counternarrative has begun to emerge  from women like Stephanie Carter  the wife of the former defense secretary Ashton B  Carter  who has complained that a photograph of Mr  Biden with his hands on her shoulders has been widely misinterpreted  She pushed back in a post on Medium titled  The  MeToo Story That Wasn t Me   writing that she saw the gesture as  means of offering his support  Erin Bilbray  a former Democratic congressional candidate from Nevada  also came to Mr  Biden s defense  During a meet and greet in a private room with her family before an event in 2014  she said  Mr  Biden  hugged me  and  kissed me on the head   It was a very nurturing  supportive action   said Ms  Bilbray  now 49  who also posted about her encounter with Mr  Biden on Facebook on Sunday   It was not anything other than that  Mr  Biden has been touchy feely with men  too  and he is hardly the first politician to make waves for such displays  Former President George W  Bush was captured giving Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany a quick shoulder massage at a Group of 8 summit meeting in Russia   prompting a headline in The Guardian that read  Bush Rubs Merkel Up The Wrong Way  ImageCaitlyn Caruso said that Mr  Biden placed his hand on her thigh and hugged her  just a little bit too long  at a campus event on sexual assault several years ago CreditEthan Miller Getty ImagesBut perhaps none have employed the use of touch as liberally as the former vice president  People who know Mr  Biden are virtually unanimous in their assessment of him as an inveterate hugger who has no ill intent    a very affectionate individual who is a natural toucher   said Senator Susan Collins  Republican of Maine In a Twitter thread on Tuesday  Jean Carnahan  the former senator from Missouri  described how caring Mr  Biden was after she arrived in the Senate  taking the seat of her husband  who had died weeks earlier in a plane crash  Mr  Biden had also suffered the loss of a spouse  shortly before he joined the Senate in 1973  It was his empathy and encouragement more than that of any of my colleagues  that gave me strength to meet each day   Ms  Carnahan wrote   And  yes  I sometimes  got a shoulder pat or even a head kiss  Joe has a deep desire to share in the lives of others   their grief  pain  and joy  He reaches out through the human touch to connect and express those feelings  Meghan McCain expressed similar sentiments  writing on Twitter   Joe Biden is one of the truly decent and compassionate men in all of American politics  He has helped me through my fathers diagnosis  treatment and ultimate passing more than anyone of my fathers friends combined  I wish there was more empathy from our politicians not less  But touching someone you know is one thing  touching complete strangers  as Mr  Biden often does  is another  Even so  former Biden aides said it never came up as an issue  and no one dissuaded him from the behavior  And it was hardly a secret  This is stuff mostly that he s done in front of everybody   said David Axelrod  who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama while Mr  Biden was vice president   I m sure his intent was benign  but through the lens of today  it looks like something different  There may also be a generational component to that lens  The controversy around Mr  Biden erupted over the weekend when Lucy Flores  a former candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada  described how Mr  Biden placed his hands on her shoulders  leaned in to smell her hair and  proceeded to plant a big  slow kiss on the back of my head  before she went onstage at a campaign rally Ms  Flores was 35 at the time   It was completely inappropriate   she said Sunday on CNN But Diane Denish  70  who served as lieutenant governor of New Mexico from 2003 through 2010  said she had  exactly the same experience  with Mr  Biden and  had a completely different reaction to it  As they were getting ready to go onstage at a campaign event  Ms  Denish said  Mr  Biden  just put his hands on my shoulders and leaned back and said   Go get  em   a little peck on the head  I paid so little attention to it  but I m of a different generation than Lucy Flores  On Tuesday  the Biden camp sent reporters quotations from about two dozen women   including former aides  current and former members of Congress  and news media personalities including Mika Brzezinski   vouching for the former vice president  But Ms  Lawless  the political scientist  said that if Mr  Biden was to survive this episode  he would have to persuade his fellow Democrats that he could and would change  He can rein in his exuberance  but he is who he is   Mr  Axelrod said   He can discipline himself to some degree  but you re not going to put this guy in a straitjacket

WASHINGTON   The U S  Constitution does not guarantee a prisoner sentenced to capital punishment  a painless death   a divided Supreme Court said on Monday  paving the way for the execution of a convicted murderer who sought to die by lethal gas rather than lethal injection because of a rare medical condition Russell Bucklew  50  had argued that lethal injection might inflict undue agony by rupturing blood filled tumors on his face  head  neck and throat caused by a congenital condition called cavernous hemangioma in violation of the Constitution s Eighth Amendment  which bars cruel and unusual punishment In a decision that exposed stark divisions among the justices on the death penalty  the court ruled 5 4 that Bucklew had failed to present enough evidence to pursue his request to be executed by lethal gas  The court s five conservatives were in the majority and its four liberals dissented Referring to the history of capital punishment  conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court s majority that  the Eighth Amendment does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death   something that  of course  isn t guaranteed to many people  including most victims of capital crimes   The state of Missouri and the victims of Russell Bucklew s crimes have waited 23 long years for this just and lawful sentence to be carried out   said a spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt  a Republican   With today s ruling we are one step closer to justice  Bucklew s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday s ruling was in line with a 2015 decision in which the court rejected a challenge to Oklahoma s method of execution by lethal injection  In that case  the court held that inmates challenging a method of execution must come up with an alternative option that was less painful Bucklew failed to show that lethal gas could be  readily implemented  as required under Supreme Court precedent  the court ruled  There also was no evidence that his chosen alternative  lethal gas  would be less painful  it concluded Gorsuch  appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017  noted that Bucklew is awaiting execution for crimes committed more than two decades ago  Yet since then  he has managed to secure delay through lawsuit after lawsuit   Gorsuch wrote  echoing a view often expressed by death penalty advocates Fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito said in 2015 that the legal challenge to Oklahoma s method of execution case was part of a  guerilla war  against the death penalty Bucklew was convicted of the 1996 murder in southeastern Missouri of Michael Sanders  who was living with Bucklew s former girlfriend Stephanie Ray at the time  Bucklew fatally shot Sanders at his trailer home  kidnapped and raped Ray  shot at Sanders  6 year old son and wounded a police officer before being apprehended  according to court papers Bucklew s appeal neither contested his guilt nor sought to avoid execution The case did not challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty itself  The court has barred the execution of juveniles and mentally disabled people  but there are no signs that its conservative majority is inclined to find capital punishment unconstitutional  VIGILANCE AND CARE Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor took issue with Gorsuch  writing in a dissenting opinion that questions about legal tactics that lead to delays are  wholly irrelevant  to the case before the court  The majority seems to imply that this litigation has been no more than manipulation of the judicial process for the purpose of delaying Bucklew s execution   Sotomayor wrote When death row inmates seek last minute stays of execution  courts should individual cases on their merits  Sotomayor said  Our jurisprudence must remain one of vigilance and care  not one of dismissiveness   Sotomayor added  Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer in another dissenting opinion repeated his assertion  first raised in the 2015 case  that if prisoners cannot be executed quickly without violating their rights  it may be that     there simply is no constitutional way to implement the death penalty  In Missouri  execution is authorized using either injection or gas but the state in practice uses only lethal injection The high court last year blocked Bucklew s execution on a 5 4 vote  The conservative justice who voted with the court s four liberals to grant the stay  Anthony Kennedy  has since retired and was replaced by Trump s appointee Brett Kavanaugh  who joined the conservative majority in Monday s decision Other recent cases also illustrated the court s differences over the death penalty  The court in February voted 5 4 to allow the execution of a Muslim convicted murderer after Alabama denied his request to have an imam present  saying he waited too long to file his lawsuit In an abrupt turnaround  the court last week blocked the execution of a convicted murderer whose request to have his Buddhist spiritual adviser present at the execution was denied by Texas    Reporting by Lawrence Hurley  Editing by Will Dunham

RALEIGH  N C    When Republicans took control of virtually every lever of North Carolina s state government for the first time since Reconstruction  they set out to transform the historically moderate Southern state into a more conservative stronghold That was less than seven years ago These days  the question is how much Republicans may have set their project back with a recent string of

deregulate industry  play down climate change  curtail access to the ballot box  strip a Democratic governor of some executive powers  launch their so called  bathroom bill  and gerrymander districts in ways that made the courts recoil Republicans won some of those fights and lost others  but the hard right turn plunged the state into years of intense partisan warfare rife with high profile boycotts and large scale public demonstrations It is this record  and the recent bouts with scandal  that could also affect state and national elections next year Mr  Cooper will be up for re election  as will Senator Thom Tillis  a Republican whose delicate political situation was recently underscored by his opposition to   then eventual support of   President Trump s controversial executive action to fund a border wall And once again  this battleground state will be up for grabs in a presidential race   one that will unfold as Charlotte  the state s largest city  hosts the Republican National Convention  where Mr  Trump is likely to make his case for re election But there is also a chance that Democrats might end up ensnared in the most recent federal probe The donor who was charged  Greg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham  gave money to both parties  In the indictment unsealed Tuesday  federal prosecutors said Mr  Lindberg worked with Mr  Hayes to bribe the state insurance commissioner  Mike Causey  with campaign donations in the hopes that Mr  Causey would replace a state regulator who oversaw a company that Mr  Lindberg owned Mr  Hayes  who is a former congressman  Mr  Lindberg and two other men who were charged pleaded not guilty on Tuesday in appearances before a federal magistrate in Charlotte Mr  Causey  a Republican  tipped off federal investigators about possible corruption and later worked closely with them during their protracted inquiry  In an interview on Wednesday  Mr  Causey said he did not expect Republicans to be alone in facing the fallout  This is certainly not a party thing   Mr  Causey said  adding   I think when the facts come out  you re going to see both parties in the same boat  ImageGreg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham  has been accused of working with Mr  Hayes to bribe the state insurance commissioner CreditRobert Brown Public Relations  via Associated PressMr  Causey would not elaborate  and a spokeswoman for the F B I  declined to comment Although the indictment focused on Mr  Lindberg s dealings with Republicans  his ties to Democrats have also been under scrutiny in recent months Wayne Goodwin  a former insurance commissioner who is now chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party  accepted donations from Mr  Lindberg and later consulted for him  Mr  Goodwin told The Wall Street Journal this year that he was not a target of the federal inquiry  with which he said he cooperated The speculation around Mr  Goodwin  who has not been charged  did not keep his state party operation from taking a gleeful swing at its opponent  In a statement  Democrats mashed the scandals together and also nodded to the turmoil surrounding Representative Mark Walker  a North Carolina Republican whose ties to Mr  Lindberg were referenced in the indictment that became public this week   Mr  Walker was not charged with a crime and was not identified by name in the indictment   Bribery  Election fraud  Witness tampering  Lying to the F B I    Wednesday s Democratic Party statement declared  adding that 2019 would be the year when  North Carolina Republicans  corruption finally became public  and the party s leading figures  became fully engulfed in chaos  Carter Wrenn  a longtime Republican consultant in North Carolina  said the allegations of chicanery created  a smell in the air and around the Republican Party   The party  he said  would do well to try to quickly isolate the scandals Indeed  the Republican Party played down the idea of chaos  even as it moved to put a limited distance between itself and the accused  In a statement on Wednesday  it said Mr  Hayes had  relinquished most of his day to day duties  and that another Republican leader  Aubrey Woodard  had been named acting chairman  On Monday  the day before his indictment became public  Mr  Hayes said he planned to step down later this year as party chairman  citing his health The indictment is a dramatic turn of events for Mr  Hayes  73  a former State House majority whip whose family founded the Cannon Mills textiles company  and who has long been an advocate of integrating biblical principles into state government  He opposes abortion and was criticized  in an unsuccessful 1996 run for governor  for supporting a sex education curriculum that promoted abstinence and recommended cleaning genitals with Lysol disinfectant after sex To critics  the new instability is a consequence of the party s years of dominance  when they controlled the Executive Mansion and had a supermajority in the General Assembly  Until this year there s been literally no check on these folks  except for the courts   said Allison Riggs  a senior lawyer at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice who has been involved in fighting Republican redistricting efforts in North Carolina Pat McCrory  a business minded former Charlotte mayor  was elected governor in 2012 and helped cement Republican power in North Carolina  But the party s state legislative leaders often set the aggressive tone  In March 2016  Republicans led the charge on the law that became known as H B  2  which curbed legal protections for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people and set new restrictions on transgender bathroom use The resulting national backlash  with boycotts and threats of boycotts  allowed Mr  Cooper  who was then challenging Mr  McCrory  to argue that Republicans were harming the business climate  In November 2016  on a night when Mr  Trump won the state  Mr  Cooper did  too  by a slim margin  A few months later  he and the Legislature arrived at a compromise to repeal the law Last year  the Republicans  power was further weakened when they lost their veto proof majorities in the Legislature But they are majorities still  proof of the continued power of conservative ideas in North Carolina In an interview in his office on Wednesday  Senator Phil Berger  the president pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate and long one of the most influential Republicans in the state  cautioned against drawing immediate conclusions about how the scandals would influence voters Still  he acknowledged that it was  frustrating  that scandals were so often overshadowing Republican policy achievements  Stepping on a rake   Mr  Berger said with a light chuckle   I see it as some Republicans doing something that creates problems for the vast majority of Republicans who haven t done anything wrong

WASHINGTON   Vice President Mike Pence called on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to immediately release six American oil executives who have been jailed for more than a year without trial  but he acknowledged  practically in the same breath  that their freedom will be slow to come as long as Maduro remains in power The U S  is among scores of countries that contend Maduro s election last year was illegitimate and that support opposition leader Juan Guaido s claim to the presidency  The U S  has imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela in an attempt to force Maduro to step down  but he so far has maintained his hold on power while accusing the U S  of attempting to overthrow him  The United States today calls for the immediate release of these six individuals   Pence said at a White House meeting with relatives of those who have been held for nearly 18 months while the Venezuelan government has postponed multiple court hearings in the case  Of course  we recognize that none of that will happen so long as Nicolas Maduro remains in power   the vice president added Pence said the five American citizens and one legal permanent U S  resident  all with roots in Texas and Louisiana  are being  illegally detained  The men  all employees of Houston based Citgo  a longtime U S  subsidiary of the Venezuelan oil giant PDVSA  were summoned to Caracas in November 2017 for a last minute budget meeting but were arrested and charged with embezzlement stemming from a never executed proposal to refinance some  4 billion in Citgo bonds Their families claim the charges are bogus and complain that their loved ones are kept in inhumane conditions in basement cells in a military counterintelligence prison with limited access to food and medicine  One relative told Pence she worries about her father s health and safety  It s been about a month since her last contact with him  she said Another relative expressed confidence in the Trump administration s record in winning freedom for Americans detained abroad Pence assured the group that  we re with you  and we re going to stand with you until your loved ones are free and until Venezuela is free

LONDON   British lawmakers debated halting Brexit on Monday after a record six million people signed a petition to revoke the process that set Britain on course to leave the European Union Britons voted to leave the European Union by 52 percent to 48 percent in 2016  and the following year British Prime Minister Theresa May gave notice of the intent to leave the bloc on March 29  2019 under Article 50 of the EU s Lisbon Treaty But May has failed on three occasions to pass her EU Withdrawal Agreement  forcing a delay to Brexit until at least April 12 and leading to some for call for the whole divorce to be canceled altogether The online petition to revoke Article 50 took off after a speech when May said that she was on the side of the British public over Brexit  Its website repeatedly failed as it garnered as many as 2 000 signatures a minute  This petition has been supported by an unprecedented number of people  although it s not surprising because we live in unprecedented times   Catherine McKinnell  an opposition Labour lawmaker  said as she introduced the debate The debate is largely symbolic and did not take place in the main chamber of the House of Commons  where discussions on alternatives to May s Brexit plan were taking place Petitions on the government s website are debated after they reach 100 000 signatures and the government must respond to all petitions with more than 10 000 names  This government will not revoke Article 50  We will honor the result of the 2016 referendum and work with parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union   the government said in response to the petition The revoke petition is the largest parliamentary one ever  beating the 4 15 million signatures for a 2016 petition which called for another EU referendum in the event that neither the remain or leave camps achieved 60 percent of the vote  More than 1 8 million people signed a petition calling for U S  President Donald Trump to be prevented from making a state visit to Britain  leading to a debate in parliament in 2017  Reporting by Alistair Smout  editing by Michael Holden  

CHICAGO   A lawyer defending R  Kelly said Monday that the prosecution s sex abuse case against the R B singer had been marred by the involvement of attorney Michael Avenatti  who faces extortion charges in New York and embezzlement charges in California The singer s lead attorney  Steve Greenberg  said in comments to reporters and a court filing that Cook County State s Attorney Kim Foxx relied way too much on Avenatti in deciding in late February to bring charges against Kelly  saying Avenatti s involvement irreparably tainted the case There was  Greenberg told reporters after a brief pretrial hearing   a rush to prosecute because of pressure   all polluted   by Michael Avenatti   who gained national fame by filing an ultimately failed lawsuit against President Donald Trump on behalf of porn star Stormy Daniels Greenberg went into detail in a seven page court filing Monday  saying Avenatti has appeared to take on the mantel of  a de facto prosecutor  in the Kelly case  Given the allegations against  Avenatti  one must wonder what he has told those he has interacted with in these matters  and what is true and what is not   the filing says Avenatti  who represents two Kelly accusers  has said a video he gave prosecutors in mid February purporting to show Kelly having sex with a minor was key in Foxx s decision to seek charges  something her office hasn t disputed  Avenatti also met with prosecutors at least twice before indictments accused Kelly of abusing three girls and one woman Criticism over Foxx s handling of the Jussie Smollett case also makes her more vulnerable to the kinds of accusations leveled by Kelly s attorney Monday Last week  prosecutors dropped all charges against the  Empire  actor that accused him of staging a racist  anti gay attack  Foxx and her staff offered often contradictory  muddled accounts for their logic behind the sudden dismissal of the case A Foxx spokeswoman declined comment on Greenberg s comments  Prosecutors said in a brief filing Monday that Greenberg s  accusations and speculation  were  lacking in factual support  Avenatti is accused in California of fraudulently obtaining  4 million in bank loans and pocketing  1 6 million that belonged to a client  Federal prosecutors in New York allege that Avenatti tried to shake down Nike for millions of dollars so he wouldn t reveal allegations the apparel company paid off high school basketball players Greenberg s Monday filings asks the judge in his case for an order that all communications between Avenatti and the state s attorney s office be preserved as possible evidence of inappropriate coordination and communication leading up to charges  Judge Lawrence Flood said he d rule on the request later Avenatti shot back in a series of tweets later Monday  accusing Greenberg of  trying to distract attention away from the clear guilt of his client by raising bogus arguments about me and Kim Foxx   There was never anything improper about our involvement in the case and we are going to continue to press forward   Avenatti said Greenberg and Avanetti have hurled insults at each other on Twitter for weeks  After Avenatti s arrest last week on the New York charges  Greenberg offered his legal services in a wry tweet   I hear he needs a good lawyer  Just hours after Avenatti s arrest last week  Greenberg also tweeted references to the New York federal complaint in which Avenatti mentions Kelly to Nike executives in a secret recording  He d go public with damaging information if they didn t pay up  and emails and texts would pour in claiming the sportswear giant of wrongdoing  Avenatti allegedly said  It s always  BS  90 percent of the time  always  whether it s R  Kelly or Trump   Avenatti said  according to the complaint   But 10 percent of it is actually going to be true  and then what s going to happen is that this is going to snowball  Avenatti denied any wrongdoing after his release from custody last week  declaring he d be fully exonerated Among the questions that must be answered  Greenberg said in his Monday motion  is whether Avenatti influenced his clients in ways to improve the odds of charges against Kelly  He said the accusations of one accuser   an Avenatti client   was investigated around 2002 and prosecutors decided not to prosecute  The case laid dormant till Mr  Avenatti joined in   Greenberg said in his motion   Then it miraculously was resurrected  although nothing had changed  over more than 15 years Greenberg said Avenatti s interest in the Kelly case corresponds with his own legal and professional problems  including his falling out with Daniels  He drums up problems for others to deflect from his own   Greenberg said The motion also says Foxx has demonstrated bias against Kelly  including by mentioning her own experience as a victim of abuse and by characterizing the allegations before Kelly was ever charged  He said that  creates the appearance of bias and an understandable willingness  desire and propensity to rush to judgment in prosecuting  The motion also mentions Foxx s recusal in the Smollett case after she spoke to a member of Smollett s family and before charges were filed and dropped  Plainly  this particular State s Attorney is able to be influenced and wowed  as evidenced by the facts of her recusal and the subsequent series of events in the Jussie Smollett case   it says    

This article is part of David Leonhardt s newsletter  You can sign up here to receive it each weekday Over the weekend  my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick and I went looking for articles arguing both sides of the Joe Biden question  We found numerous pieces upbraiding Biden for touching people while interacting with them  and several of them argued that his likely presidential campaign should suffer for it Finding articles making the opposite case wasn t so easy   The closest we came was a Medium essay by Stephanie Carter  whose husband served in the Obama administration with Biden   But if the media consensus this weekend was a condemnation of Biden  the reaction on Monday   both in the media and among readers   was different  It was substantially more mixed and less negative You can see some of that view in the letters that The Times received from readers   Men were acculturated to behave in ways that ignored the sensibilities of women  and that is no longer acceptable   Laura Petiford wrote   I   struggle to understand how it is helpful to render men like Mr  Biden  unfit  because of behaviors that were so deeply woven into the social fabric of this country that we are only now beginning to address them contextually   Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Susannah Sard wrote   Sometimes we need to relax   Richard Brandshaft wrote   Yet again the proverbial liberal circular firing squad   And Eileen West wrote   Joe Biden has plenty to answer for  especially his treatment of Anita Hill  Let his challengers question him on that  rather than being distracted by the media frenzy of the day  The strongest reaction I saw came from Theda Skocpol  a Harvard political scientist whom I ve quoted before in this newsletter  She has spent years studying the Tea Party  the Obama presidency and the Trump resistance  I m going to turn over most of the rest of the newsletter to her  by reprinting an email she sent me And my own view  I m still thinking it through  As I said yesterday  Biden s  handsiness  is a bit strange  I ve interviewed other politicians who touched me repeatedly during the conversation  and it was unnecessary   I hope Biden understands why the habit makes some people uncomfortable  But I m increasingly thinking that it should not become a defining issue for his likely campaign  Wait a minute Theda Skocpol writes The piling on about Joe Biden s sometimes unwanted affectionate touches by political competitors and media outlets is shameful  Both women who have come forward so far are not talking about workplace abuse or sexual misconduct  I can believe them  and still ask why they are speaking up now  One person  who has supported a political competitor to Biden  acknowledges that she is speaking because Biden is considering entering the primaries  the other says that if Biden really respects women  he should not run and clear the field for the capable women candidates  Wait a minute  Is this what gender equality really means  Is this the kind of society we want to live in   where right wingers can do any vicious thing they want to anyone and shrug it off  while people on the center left are supposed to expel from public life anyone who says a single wrong word or has done something benignly intended in the past that now does not fit changed norms  Not me  that is not the kind of America I want to live in  That is not the kind of Democratic primary I want to participate in  If Biden wants to run  I want to hear what he has to say and compare him  fair and square  to the others Biden has long been known as an emotional person who hugs just about everyone he feels positively about  male and female  Now the social mores have shifted  He needs to say he realizes this and change his behavior accordingly  Everyone else  meanwhile  needs to get a grip  Anyone who experiences an unwanted word or gesture should tell the person involved that they would like them not to say do that   not wait a decade and contact the media in an expedient moment  And Democrats must keep in mind that they need votes in 2020 from millions of older Americans who are really put off by this kind of out of context piling on  End of Skocpol s email  For more   Joe Biden needs to cut it out  And so does the mob that is after him   Karen Tumulty writes in The Washington Post My colleague Michelle Goldberg says that this is the wrong time for Biden to run and criticizes his reaction to this controversy  In response to Lucy Flores s description of his touching   Biden could have told her that he was sorry for making her uneasy  Instead  he focused on his intentions rather than her experience  a faint echo of the way he d ignored  Anita  Hill s experience decades ago  Ross Douthat argues that the episode highlights a choice Biden will need to make  Whether to run a campaign in which he is constantly apologizing  and likely losing  or trying to appeal proactively to the large group of Democrats who like him    a mix of older white Democrats  culturally moderate African Americans and Hispanics  and anti Trump suburbanites   And  yes  Michelle  Ross and I will be debating about Biden on this week s episode of  The Argument   which will be out on Thursday  If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter  you

Pete Buttigieg has some kind of magic right now  His campaign bio   Shortest Way Home   was the 25th best selling book on Amazon when I checked on Monday  That put him just a few dozen places behind Michelle Obama  and thousands or tens of thousands of places ahead of Kamala Harris  Bernie Sanders and the other candidates who have campaign books out now In a recent Iowa poll he surged to third place  His campaign just announced that it s raised an impressive  7 million since January  And I can t tell you how many Democrats in places as diverse as Nebraska  Indiana  New York and Washington have come up to me over the last few weeks raving about the guy  I met a superfan in Frederick  Md   who says that every few hours she calls the campaign to give another  10  This is the biggest star is born moment since Lady Gaga started singing  Shallow  Why are people so in love with the mayor of South Bend  Ind   who almost nobody had heard of until he did a CNN town hall on March 10 It s important to remember that when Democrats vote next year  they ll not only be choosing a policy alternative to Donald Trump  they ll also be making a statement about what kind of country they want America to be The Trump era has been all about dissolving moral norms and waging vicious attacks  This has been an era of culture war  class warfare and identity politics  It s been an era in which call out culture  reality TV melodrama and tribal grandstanding have overshadowed policymaking and the challenges of actually governing The Buttigieg surge suggests that there are a lot of Democrats who want to say goodbye to all that  They don t want to fight fire and divisiveness with more fire and divisiveness  They don t want to fight white identity politics with another kind of identity politics They are sick of the moral melodrama altogether  They just want a person who is more about governing than virtue signaling  more about friendliness and basic decency than media circus and rhetorical war Buttigieg s secret is that he transcends many of the tensions that run through our society in a way that makes people on all sides feel comfortable First  he is young and represents the rising generation  but he is also an older person s idea of what a young person should be  He d be the first millennial president  but Buttigieg doesn t fit any of the stereotypes that have been affixed to America s young people  Young people are supposed to be woke social justice warriors who are disgusted by their elders  Buttigieg is the model young man who made his way impressing his elders   Harvard  Rhodes scholar  McKinsey  the Navy  Young hipsters are supposed to flock to coastal places like Brooklyn and Portland  after college  Buttigieg returned to Indiana  Young people are supposed to be anti institutional  but Buttigieg is very institutional   his life has been defined by his service to organizations  not his rebellion against them Second  he is gay and personifies the progress made by the L G B T Q  movement  but he doesn t do so in a way that feels threatening or transgressive to social conservatives  He has conservative family values  it s just that his spouse is a husband  not a wife  He speaks comfortably about his faith and says that when he goes to church he prefers a conservative liturgy to anything experimental Third  he is a localist and a Washington outsider  but he carries no populist resentment and can easily speak the language of the coastal elite Buttigieg has spent his political career in Indiana  where pols are expected to go to county fairs and eat the catfish fillet and cheesecake on a stick  He wasn t alive when the Studebaker plant shut down in South Bend  but he has the trauma of Midwestern deindustrialization in his bones  He lives in a house near his mother where the mortgage comes to about  450 a month  On the other hand  he was friends with Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard  earned a first at Oxford and thrived as a corporate consultant Finally  he s a progressive on policy issues  but he doesn t sound like an angry revolutionary  Buttigieg s policy positions are not all that different from the more identifiable leftist candidates  But he eschews grand ideological conflict   The whole point of politics is everyday life   he said in his CNN town hall  His book is mostly about how as mayor he faced problems like snow removal and fixing potholes  His big achievements were renaming city streets  repairing the sewer system and tearing down derelict buildings  He says he ll do whatever works I ve only met Buttigieg once  when we were seated at the same table at a dinner in Detroit a few months ago  He was smart  modest and self effacing  and I can t square that impression with his assumption that at 37 he s qualified to be president of the United States  But maybe that s Buttigieg   he squares a lot of circles  He deftly detaches progressive policy positions from the culture war  He offers change without

ANKARA ISTANBUL   Turkey has proposed to the United States that they form a working group to determine that Russian S 400 missile defense systems do not pose a threat to U S  or NATO military equipment  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday The United States and Turkey have been at loggerheads over Ankara s decision to purchase the S 400s  which are not compatible with NATO systems  from Russia  Washington has warned that proceeding with the deal could result in U S  sanctions and the exclusion of Turkey from the F 35 fighter jet program   It will not be integrated into the NATO system   therefore we propose the United States to establish a technical working group to make sure that this system will not be a threat   neither to  U S   F 35s nor the NATO systems   Cavusoglu told a panel in the United States He said it was  not our aim  to integrate the S400 system into that of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization because  it s for our own use   Turkey and the administration of U S  President Donald Trump need to explain to the U S  Congress why Ankara had to go through with the purchase from the Russians  Cavusoglu said Turkey says it needs the S 400s  to be delivered in July  to defend against potential security threats and President Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly said he would not back down from the  done deal   Cavusoglu  in Washington for a NATO summit  said he would  definitely  repeat this to U S  counterparts during his visit  Seeking to apply pressure  the United States halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F 35 fighter aircraft to Turkey  its first concrete step to block delivery of the jets due to Ankara s planned purchase of the S 400s A U S  official on Tuesday said that the purchase risked triggering sanctions  Acting U S  Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan later said that he expected the dispute to be resolved In a broader move to stop the delivery of the fighter jets  four U S  senators introduced a bipartisan bill last week to prohibit the transfer of F 35 aircraft until Washington can certify Turkey will not take the delivery of the S 400s   Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Sarah Dadouch  Writing by Ali Kucukgocmen  Editing by Dominic Evans and Jonathan Spicer  

BERLIN   Germans with a second nationality who fight abroad for groups like Islamic State will lose their citizenship  the cabinet agreed in a draft law on Wednesday intended to deter future militants  Like other Western countries  Germany faces a conundrum of how to deal with citizens who travel to the Middle East to join violent Islamist causes like IS whose self proclaimed  caliphate  was eliminated last month The measure  which needs parliamentary approval  would exclude minors  cover only future cases  and not apply to single nationality Germans who could otherwise be left stateless  This will send a signal to IS supporters  to those thinking of traveling to IS areas   government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters More than 1 000 Germans have left their country for Middle East war zones since 2013 and the government has been debating how to deal with them as U S  backed forces took IS s last patch of territory in Syria and rounded up prisoners About a third have returned to Germany  another third are believed to have died  and the rest are thought to be still in Iraq and Syria  including those detained by Iraqi forces and U S  backed fighters in Syria  according to German intelligence officials In February  U S  President Donald Trump urged Britain  France and Germany to take back more than 800 captured Islamic State fighters and put them on trial  Germany said it would take back fighters only if the suspects have consular access  adding that in principle  all of its citizens and those suspected of having fought for IS have the right to return In one high profile case  Britain in February revoked the citizenship of a teenager who had left London aged 15 to join IS in Syria  The case of Shamima Begum highlighted the security  legal and ethical dilemmas facing European governments dealing with those who swore allegiance to a group determined to destroy the West Germany joined the military campaign against IS militants in Syria in a support role by deploying Tornado reconnaissance jets  refuelling aircraft and a frigate to the region  after an appeal from close partner France for Berlin to do more   Writing by Paul Carrel  Editing by Andrew Cawthorne  

WASHINGTON   Senate Democrats blocked a GOP attempt on Tuesday to change Senate rules to limit debate time on most of President Donald Trump s nominees to just a couple of hours The party line vote is another step toward a potential power play by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who is considering ramming the rules change through later this week using an arcane parliamentary maneuver The proposed rules change would limit debate on most nominees to two hours instead of the 30 hours now required  Cabinet secretaries  Supreme Court nominations  and appeals court judges would be exempted from the new rules Tuesday s approach required 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster  but McConnell s upcoming maneuver would only require a simple majority McConnell said Tuesday he s taking action in response to  systematic obstruction  not targeted  thoughtful opposition to a few marquee nominations or rare circumstances  but a grinding  across the board effort to delay and obstruct the people this president puts up  Democrats said Republicans abused the old rules   which required a 60 vote margin to break a filibuster for all nominees   to thwart dozens of nominees of former President Barack Obama  Democrats changed the filibuster threshold to a simple majority in 2013 over outraged protests by Republicans such as McConnell Shortening the debate time  they maintain  would allow Republicans to run roughshod over them  The hurdles and hoops required to win confirmation should be difficult  they say  as a means to ensure nominees are ethical and qualified and responsive to requests by senators for information  The purpose of these rules is to reject partisanship so that we can get nominees who will put the good of the country before politics   said Sen  Amy Klobuchar  D Minn   If we eliminate this crucial check on our democracy  allowing the majority to ram through these appointments  we will undermine our democracy and our government  Republicans counter that it is Democrats who are abusing the process now by claiming the full 30 hours of debate time for noncontroversial picks  Often  the Senate chamber sits empty as the clock ticks on these picks  And Obama benefited from abbreviated debate times for most nominations under a temporary arrangement over 2013 14 that suited Democrats just fine back then

LONDON   The polarisation of U S  politics in the Trump era has created an opportunity for the Financial Times to attract readers who want balanced coverage with a global perspective  the London based business newspaper s chief executive said on Thursday John Ridding said the FT  acquired by Japanese media group Nikkei for  1 3 billion  988 29 million pounds  in 2015  is increasing investment in the United States  along with China and India  after it reached the milestone of 1 million paying readers this week  a year ahead of target  I think we are underweight in the U S    Ridding told Reuters   We can and should be bigger  Clearly there has been a polarisation in the media in the U S  alongside and probably contributing to a polarisation in politics  There is a huge opportunity for what we do  which is independent  fair  balanced coverage  Ridding said the company would be bringing new products to the U S  market and would add more reporters The FT  famously printed on pink paper  became one of the first newspapers to charge for its content online when it introduced a pay wall in 2002  It established a metered model in 2007  requiring users to register and pay a charge to read more than a few articles a month before moving to a paid trial model in 2015  which allows access to most articles for a relatively small fee Digital subscribers now account for more than three quarters of its circulation Ridding said customer data had helped the newspaper to exceed its subscriber target  in part by offering easy tools for readers to curate what was of interest to them  adding that both consumer and corporate subscriptions are showing healthy growth  In the B2B  business to business  side     revenue retention is above 100 percent and volume retention is near 100 percent   he said   That has been a big part of our success  the institutional part of the business  Despite the growth in digital revenue  Ridding said the FT still had a future in print  It had a circulation of 171 459 in January  according to ABC data quoted by Press Gazette Ridding said the print product is profitable on its cover price before advertising   a rare feat in the newspaper market  I would certainly hesitate to write off print in the near term   he said   Reporting by Paul Sandle  Editing by David Goodman

One of the great political themes of the Democratic presidential campaign is how much everybody loves Joe Biden Really  Just Google  I love Joe Biden   Go past the T shirts and memorial coffee cups and you ll see a ton of stuff  I love Joe Biden  He s a great guy and a great politician   said Jerry Shriner  a Democratic National Committee member from Idaho  when the question of a Biden return came up   I wish he were the president right now  But I m not sure I wish he is president in 2021   I love Joe Biden  I really do   said Tom Courtney  a Democratic leader in Iowa   But there comes a moment when it s time to not run  In the past  whenever Biden has tried to run for president  things didn t go well  In part it s been because of his tendency to sound   goofy  In 2007  he described one of his opponents  Barack Obama  as the  first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy  He didn t mean it the way it sounded  but he still finished fifth in the Iowa caucuses  He dropped out and became vice president  When asked about Biden as a possible successor  Obama just said   I love Joe Biden  Now  Biden seems ready to give it one more shot  He hasn t announced yet  but he s ahead in the polls  And thrashing around in the controversy over his longstanding habit of affectionately putting his hands all over women he meets  Social norms are changing   said the former vice president via Twitter  It was not quite an apology  More like   O K   O K  I ll do it another way  Well  remember that old movie line about how love means never having to say you re sorry On Wednesday  Biden sent out a video promising the world he d be  more mindful and respectful of people s personal space   It was a pretty good presentation  He managed to look fairly normal  all things considered  When you ve spent a week being savaged for old uncle creepiness  it s easy to get a little self conscious  I worked my whole life to empower women   he told the camera     so the idea that I can t adjust to the fact that personal space is important  more important than it s ever been  is just not thinkable  I will  I will  Two problems here  One is that Biden is acting as though the whole don t touch business is a brand new product of the  MeToo movement  That a person in his position could have accidentally missed the message until recently Let s go back to 2006  At a G 8 summit in Russia  President George W  Bush came up behind German leader Angela Merkel and inflicted a quick back rub  Merkel appeared   grossed out  The picture went around the world  Comedians had a field day  Hard to believe a powerful U S  senator with an expertise in foreign affairs could have missed the story A few months earlier  New Mexico Lt  Gov  Diane Denish had told a reporter she tried to avoid being around the governor  Bill Richardson  because  He pokes me  He pinches my neck  He touches my hip  my thigh  sort of the side of my leg   Like Biden  Richardson was a Democratic presidential hopeful People were talking about it a lot   Have our leaders gone mad   demanded a Times writer  who traced the new touchy feely trend to political consultants like Republican Frank Luntz  who were trying to create more human interaction between their clients and the public Luntz was indeed encouraging his clients to go beyond the traditional handshake when it came to making contact  These days  he s still consulting but he s pretty clear that times have changed   What used to be seen as a demonstration of endearment is now seen as invasion of space   he said in a phone interview  Nevertheless  he loves Joe Biden    One of the warmest people I ve ever met   Second problem with Biden s video pitch  He has indeed worked to empower women   he was an author of the Violence Against Women Act  But he also has that really nasty history on the Anita Hill matter  Hill had the courage to show up and testify before the world about Clarence Thomas s lecherous behavior as a boss  This was in 1991  when no one ever talked about that stuff in public  And Biden  the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  did nothing but ask her embarrassing questions    Were you uncomfortable  were you embarrassed  did it not concern you   He s been trying to make amends  without really taking responsibility    I am so sorry if she believes that   I am so sorry that she had to go through what she went through   Maybe that s why he made a particular point of lacing into Donald Trump s history of grabbing women s private parts  Last year Biden told some college students that if only he and Trump were in high school together   I d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him  At the time  I wrote a column about the inadvisability of advocating an assault on the president  even in the past tense  And the next day Biden called up to say thanks  for showing me what a jerk I was  See  this is the reason people keep saying they love Joe Biden  Right before they say they hope he doesn t run for president The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think

A second woman on Monday accused Joseph R  Biden Jr  of touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable  intensifying the scrutiny of the former vice president s close physical interactions with women over the years as he prepares for a likely presidential bid The woman  Amy Lappos  said in an interview with The Hartford Courant that Mr  Biden  put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me  at a fund raiser in Connecticut in 2009  When he was pulling me in  I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth   she said in the interview  She said the encounter  wasn t sexual  but that there was  a line of respect   and Mr  Biden had crossed it  Joe Biden s hugs and kisses were well known in Washington  Now he faces a generational reckoning  Her allegations follow a weekend in which Mr  Biden defended himself against a similar complaint from a former Nevada assemblywoman  Lucy Flores  who said in an essay published on Friday that the former vice president had touched and kissed her inappropriately at a campaign event in 2014 In a statement late Monday that Ms  Lappos sent to The New York Times  she said she was speaking out because she was disappointed in the way Ms  Flores has been treated in the aftermath of her allegations   Uninvited affection is not okay  Objectifying women is not okay    Ms  Lappos said  Referring to this type of behavior as  simply affection  or  grandpa like  or  friendly  is ridiculously dismissive and part of the problem    she said in the statement   Saying  but Trump    is dangerous and sets the bar for Democratic men far below where it should be  Mr  Biden s team had already issued two statements trying to contain the damage  Earlier Monday  his spokesman  Bill Russo  sent a third  lengthy email to reporters criticizing what he said were misrepresentations of Mr  Biden s past behavior  and seeking to link some of the attacks on him to Republicans Mr  Russo cited an image of Mr  Biden holding the shoulders of Stephanie Carter  the wife of former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter  and another of Mr  Biden kissing the head of Senator Chris Coons s daughter  arguing that the criticism of the former vice president was rooted in inaccurate assumptions about what was occurring in the pictures Both Ms  Carter and Mr  Coons s young daughter welcomed Mr  Biden s embrace  Mr  Russo said  pointing to a Medium post Ms  Carter wrote and comments Mr  Coons made about how close his family is to the Bidens But Mr  Biden s team of advisers is preparing for more criticism about his past behavior  acknowledging that  given Mr  Biden s nearly 50 year career in politics  it s inevitable that others will come forward to say he made them feel uncomfortable Mr  Russo pointed out that much of the criticism about Mr  Biden s conduct has come from Republicans and that some of it has been manufactured entirely The aide pointed to photoshopped images  including one in which Mr  Biden is portrayed touching Ms  Carter s breast  and another cropped photo of the former vice president comforting his grandson at the funeral of his son  Beau   which he called  most galling of all    These smears and forgeries have existed in the dark recesses of the internet for a while   Mr  Russo said   To this day  right wing trolls and others continue to exploit them for their own gain   he added  warning against a  cottage industry of lies  On Monday  the Drudge Report posted a collage of Biden photographs  including one that photoshopped him standing behind a crying piccolo player in the Villanova University band  a widely shared image from the 2015 N C A A  basketball tournament Mr  Biden s advisers believe that the more the right pushes images of him  real or fake  the more it will help them persuade Democrats that Republicans are trying to derail a potential challenger who performs best in polls against President Trump  The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because the former vice president is not yet in the race But Mr  Biden s inner circle is also deeply suspicious about the timing of Ms  Flores s criticism  believing it s part of a larger effort by hostile Democrats to undermine the former vice president s candidacy before he even announces  the advisers said The aggressive response by Mr  Biden s aides represents the latest indication of what they said over the weekend  that he will not be dissuaded by the allegations from entering the presidential race The challenge for Mr  Biden now  though  is that Ms  Flores is no longer alone in speaking out In her interview with The Courant  Ms  Lappos said the encounter that made her uncomfortable occurred at a fund raiser in 2009  when she was working as a congressional aide to Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut  There s absolutely a line of decency   she told The Courant   There s a line of respect  Crossing that line is not grandfatherly  It s not cultural  It s not affection  It s sexism or misogyny  She said she  never filed a complaint  to be honest  because he was the vice president  I was a nobody  The office of Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut confirmed Monday that the event described in the Courant article took place and that Mr  Murphy  who was a congressman at the time  attended it The recent scrutiny of Mr  Biden s physical behavior began on Friday when Ms  Flores  a Democrat  published an essay in New York Magazine s The Cut  which described an encounter with Mr  Biden in 2014 that she described as mortifying In the essay  she wrote that Mr  Biden had come to a rally to help her fledgling campaign for lieutenant governor of Nevada and had come up behind her  touched her and planted  a big slow kiss  on the back of her head  Mr  Biden  in a statement Friday  said he did not believe he acted inappropriately  but pledged to listen to any accuser Since the essay published  Ms  Flores  39  has praised Mr  Biden for being willing to listen to concerns and clarify his intentions  But she has said she finds it hard to believe that Mr  Biden could not have been aware of how he made her and other women feel and has called his behavior  completely inappropriate   

At some point soon  Joe Biden is going to have to make two decisions  The first is whether he wants to run for the Democratic nomination  The second is whether he wants to win it  and at what cost Right now  even after some slippage  Biden has the highest polling numbers of any candidate in the race  He also has a record that s completely out of step with his party s activists and ideologists  a highly   familiar personal style that promises further accusations like the ones already leveled by Lucy Flores and Amy Lappos  and a base of support that s roughly as old as he is The combination makes it easy to imagine Biden running a campaign that ends up feeling like an apology tour  in which he talks endlessly about how much he has learned and grown since the days when he was a tough on crime Democrat who opposed school busing and sometimes voted for late term abortion limits  Some of the ideas apparently bandied about by his aides   a one term pledge  Stacey Abrams as a running mate    fit with this strategy  in which the goal would be to establish Biden as a temporary bridge to a woker future  a candidate ready to put his moderate past behind him and serve the new liberal consensus That kind of Biden campaign would probably lose  Indeed  it would probably lose   I know this is harsh   as badly as Jeb Bush did Why  Because in a big primary field  with a lot of flavors available to voters  it s very hard to hold your base if you aren t giving that base a clear reason to vote for you  And the only reason anyone would affirmatively want to vote for Biden is the same reason so many liberals now despise the very idea of his candidacy  because he has that moderate record  because he s closer to the political center than many of his critics  because he s out of step with what Matt Yglesias of Vox recently called  the Great Awokening    the sudden leftward turn on issues of race and immigration and identity The key point here is that while the Great Awokening has transformed the Democratic Party  it hasn t entirely eliminated the constituency for a Bill Clintonian form of moderation  The party has embraced left wing ideas about structural racism  but there are still lots of Democratic voters   minority voters included  as white liberals have outpaced blacks and Hispanics in their wokeness   who would endorse the rhetoric of personal responsibility and colorblindness that the party s activists now disdain as  respectability politics   The party is more zealously pro choice than ever  but there are still Democrats who identify as pro life  the party is vigorously pro  MeToo  but there are still Democrats  the Al Franken constituency and others  who worry that the movement has gone too far And that s just social issues  You can find similar constituencies who aren t yet sold on the full social democratic agenda  who still find the old Clinton era mix of middle class tax cuts and targeted spending more appealing than the Bernie Sanders turn These groups   a mix of older white Democrats  culturally moderate African Americans and Hispanics  and anti Trump suburbanites   probably don t amount to a primary season majority  But they might add up to a large plurality in a divided field  which could easily be enough to win the nomination   It s how Sanders will win it  if he does   with a very different plurality  of course   and it s how Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016  To unite this plurality  though  Biden would have to actually appeal to them openly and directly  which would require taking ownership of his record  not defending everything  not avoiding all apologies  but arguing explicitly that some tough on crime policies were a necessary response to a destructive multi decade crime wave  that some moderation on abortion should be acceptable in the Democratic Party and that the Ocasio Cortezan turn on economic policy should be questioned or resisted  And  yes  defending his personal familiarity  hugs and nose rubs and hair kisses and all  and in the process questioning some aspects of  MeToo Absent that argument  in a primary where Biden is just an old white dude running away from his record  the party s various moderate voters will almost certainly fracture and go to fresher candidates with cleaner pitches   to the Texan Jesus or the South Bend Meritocrat or the Mean Minnesotan or the Racial Optimist   That would be Beto O Rourke  Pete Buttigieg  Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker  respectively   none of whom are likely to challenge the Great Awokening directly  but all of whom offer something to Democratic voters wary of the left  However  To run the way I m suggesting  on his record rather than against it  would exact a possibly extraordinary cost  Just to campaign this way would make Biden hated by many liberals in a way that would make today s Twitter animosity look mild  To win the nomination this way would produce fury on a scale that far eclipsed the pro Sanders anger in 2016 and guarantee a strong 2020 showing for Jill Stein s grifter left  if not a more sincere alternative   And to lose the nomination this way   which would remain  obviously  a strong possibility   would ensure that Biden exited the stage of liberal politics not as an elder statesman but as a wrong side of history bad guy Naturally I d still like Biden to try it   not least because some of the party s Reagan and Clinton era compromises were Actually Good  and it would be good for today s Democrats if a prominent Democrat defended them  But even as a biased outsider to Democratic politics  I can see why Biden would shrink from the strategy  shrink from dividing his party by challenging its new consensus  shrink from being hated by his co partisans If so  though  I hope he has

CARACAS   Venezuela s Constituent Assembly  an all powerful legislature controlled by the ruling Socialist Party  on Tuesday approved a measure allowing for a trial of opposition leader Juan Guaido  in what appeared to be step towards having him arrested Guaido  leader of the opposition controlled National Assembly  in January invoked the country s constitution to assume the interim presidency after declaring President Nicolas Maduro s 2018 re election a fraud He has been recognised by the United States and most other Western nations as Venezuela s legitimate leader  and has said he does not recognise decisions emanating from the Maduro government The Constituent Assembly s decree is necessary for the Supreme Court to move ahead with a trial of Guaido because as a legislator he has parliamentary immunity that makes it more difficult for him to be tried than the average citizen  This formally authorizes the continuation of the trial  of Guaido    said Constituent Assembly Chief Diosdado Cabello  who is also the Vice President of the Socialist Party  The Supreme Court on Monday had reiterated a previous measure blocking Guaido from leaving the country  an order which he openly violated in February when he embarked on a tour of Latin American nations to bolster support for his campaign to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro Venezuela s chief prosecutor s office has opened an investigation of Guaido  into alleged links to  incidents of violence  in January  but has not ordered his detention or officially charged him with any crime  We are not going to evade our responsibility   Guaido told reporters in eastern Caracas after the announcement   They thought this would be easy  But it won t be  If they want to move forward  they will have to assume the consequences  Constitutional lawyer Jose Vicente Haro called the decision a  constitutional fraud  that stripped Guaido of parliamentary immunity without the approval of the legislature  which under the constitution must approve such a decision  The legislature is currently control by the opposition  It also violated due process  because he should have had a hearing to defend himself   said Haro in a telephone interview Maduro has said Guaido should  face justice  and calls him a coup mongering puppet for the United States   but he has stopped short of calling for his arrest  Guaido s international backers  chiefly the Trump administration  have warned Venezuelan authorities not to touch him and threatened ever harsher sanctions against the Maduro administration to further cut it off from foreign financing    Reporting by Angus Berwick and Vivian Sequera  Writing by Brian Ellsworth  Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Michael Perry  

JERUSALEM BRASILIA   Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro  accompanied by Israel s prime minister  visited Jerusalem s Western Wall on Monday as the Palestinians considered recalling their ambassador in Brasilia over a new trade mission to Israel in the holy city The ancient Western Wall  the most sacred prayer site in Judaism  is located in the eastern part of the city Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally Israel has long considered all of Jerusalem as its eternal  indivisible capital  while Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state they seek in territory Israel captured in the 1967 war U S  President Donald Trump broke global consensus in 2017 by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital and moved the U S  embassy there last May Brazil on Sunday opened a new trade mission to Israel in the city  edging back from earlier signals it would follow the United States with a full embassy move The Western Wall is a remnant of the compound of a Jewish temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD  The plaza above known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary is the third holiest site in Islam  containing al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock Bolsonaro  on a four day trip to Israel  and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approached the wall together and leaned side by side against its massive stones  Bolsonaro placed a prayer note in between the stones  as is customary Bolsonaro s original proposal to move Brazil s embassy to Jerusalem angered the Muslim world  and senior Brazilian officials backed away from it for fear of damaging ties with Arab countries and jeopardizing billions of dollars in Brazilian halal meat exports Presidential spokesman Otavio Rego Barros said on Sunday the trade mission would not be a diplomatic representation  but the move angered the Palestinians Palestinian Ambassador in Brasilia Ibrahim Alzeban told Reuters that he may be recalled  although a response was still under consideration  From what I was told  it will depend on how  Bolsonaro s  visit evolves   Alzeban said   We wish that the subject of Jerusalem had not been touched upon  Alzeban said the Palestinians were also upset because Bolsonaro did not consider a visit to the Palestinian territories and did not coordinate his trip with Palestinian authorities Netanyahu has said he hopes Brazil s Jerusalem trade office is a step toward moving the embassy to the city  There is no recognition of Jerusalem as the capital   Brazilian presidential spokesman Barros said   Our president continues to evaluate this possibility  of moving the embassy   but that is not what we decided at this time    Reporting by Lisandra Paraguassu   Writing by Jake Spring   Editing by Susan Thomas and Ed Osmond  

BERLIN   Keen to use its presidency of the U N  Security Council to demonstrate its commitment to multilateralism  Germany has laid itself bare to criticism from disenchanted allies of double standards on defense spending  energy and arms exports Powerful business interests and the compromises needed to hold together conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel s loveless coalition with the Social Democrats  SPD  have led to go it alone decisions that have angered the United States  France  Britain and other Europeans Merkel won plaudits in Davos in January and a standing ovation at the Munich Security Conference in February for strong appeals to maintain the post World War Two rules based international order Her SPD foreign minister  Heiko Maas  is singing from the same hymn sheet   When faced with a new order in which great power rivalry is back on the agenda  our response shouldn t be  my country first  It should be a close alliance of all those committed to a rules based international order   he said in New York this week  Such rhetoric rings hollow for some An unwavering commitment to the NordStream 2 gas pipeline from Russia has angered the United States  Ukraine and eastern European partners  A freeze on arms exports to Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi led Paris to accuse Berlin of jeopardizing joint tank  combat jet and drone development Germany s long insistence on austerity and refusal to rein in its large current account surplus  which reflects its export prowess  have perpetuated a view among euro zone peers that they must play to Berlin s tune  IN DENIAL  Berlin has also exasperated close allies by pouring cold water on deeper euro zone reform ideas from France  and especially by rowing back on NATO defense spending goals  Not to mention Merkel s unilateral disavowal of EU rules in 2015 which let migrants enter Germany  a move which most commentators say contributed to the rise of the far right Constanze Stelzenmueller  senior Robert Bosch Fellow at the Brookings Institution  said it is an  ultimately misguided and only semi functional attempt  to articulate a foreign policy opposed to U S  President Donald Trump s  America First  stance  No other country has been so deeply in denial about the tension between its high minded normative convictions and its own selective compliance with them   she said  adding that other European countries are looking to Germany for leadership   Germany today is   for all its wealth and power  including soft power   also increasingly lonely  overwhelmed and beset by internal rifts   she said  adding it risked being shaped by events  competitors and adversaries In its one month presidency of the U N  Security Council which started on Monday  the spotlight will be on Germany if any Security Council response is needed to global crises  But with the legacy of the Nazi era and World War Two still weighing on it  Germany is wary of being seen as too assertive on the world stage  As it struggles to find a role to match its economic might  its foreign policy is deeply embedded in international bodies such as the EU  NATO and United Nations  CREDIBILITY AT STAKESo why  ask critics  did SPD Finance Minister Olaf Scholz last month announce plans which mean Germany will fall even shorter of a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense in coming years than it was previously going to  Having previously said it would reach 1 5 percent by 2024  Scholz s plans now see a decrease to 1 25 percent of gross domestic product by 2023  It doesn t serve German credibility if we start questioning the goal of 1 5 percent by 2024 after committing to the 2 percent goal in 2014   said Roderich Kiesewetter  a senior lawmaker in Merkel s conservative party It gives ammunition to Trump  who singles out Germany for  not paying its fair share   U S  Vice President Mike Pence said this week Germany was a top offender  pointing out it had for generations benefited from U S  protection of Europe  Whether Scholz is pandering to his own pacifist wing of his party or its anti Americanism base  or has his sights on the chancellery  Germany s credibility inside NATO is being dented   wrote Judy Dempsey  a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe  The government insists it is committed to the 2024 goal  Maas says Germany has raised defense spending by nearly 40 percent since 2014 and the defense budget will continue to rise    but the debate exposes a classic German dilemma  After World War Two and the Nazi era  it s in our political DNA that military solutions are almost never the answer  rather political solutions   said senior SPD lawmaker Thomas Oppermann Another major driving force is business  Berlin has long sought to protect its powerful car industry from EU attempts to curb emissions and has also dug in its heels in over a pipeline that will secure supplies of Russian gas needed by German industry   and bypass Ukraine Brushing aside opposition from the United States  eastern European and Baltic states who warn that Europe will become over dependent on Russian energy  Merkel has let firms  including Uniper and BASF s Winterhall unit  push ahead with NordStream 2 Even after the EU imposed sanctions on Russia for annexing Crimea in 2014  Merkel insisted it was a commercial project and only last year acknowledged it had a political element and saw the need to reassure Ukraine on transit revenues  Allowing it to trundle along was a mix of business driving it hard and the government taking its hands off  hoping for the best   and that turned out not to be   said Stelzenmueller  One other factor affecting policy is Merkel s reliance on the SPD as a coalition partner  seen in last week s extension of an arms exports ban to Saudi Arabia The original ban last year  which took European partners by surprise  prompted London and Paris to warn that billions of euros of military orders were in danger  While the SPD  seeking to win over traditional voters for regional and European elections later this year  insisted on extending the ban  they bowed to pressure from France and Britain and allowed loopholes for joint projects However  if Merkel is to fulfil her aim of joint European development and export of defense equipment  she may have to convince Germans to change their mindset  It won t work if Germany says we are passionate Europeans but only on our terms  We must get used to the idea that we have to compromise   said Oppermann    Additional reporting by Paul Carrel  Editing

This article is part of the Frank Bruni newsletter  You can sign up here to receive the free newsletter every Wednesday How do Democrats properly vet their candidates for president without cannibalizing them  How do they rightly insist on sensitive and inclusive leaders while making allowances for past mistakes  present quirks  human messiness and the differences in the conversation and the culture now versus 10 or 20 or 40 years ago That s emerging as a central challenge of the Democratic presidential primary  And it s worrying me I m worried because there was an actual mini debate on the left recently over whether Pete Buttigieg is gay enough  Do his whiteness  upper middle class background and Harvard and Oxford degrees nullify his experience as a minority and undercut his status as a trailblazer  This question is out there  in both senses of that phrase I m worried because it in some ways echoes an earlier question about whether Kamala Harris   whose father came from Jamaica  whose mother came from India and whose husband is white   is black enough And I m worried because of what Joe Biden is going through   because of the intensity of the censure that he faced after the Nevada politician Lucy Flores s allegation and because of the fixation on precisely what kind of apology he must issue  Get a more personal  less conventional take on political developments  newsmakers  cultural milestones and more with Frank Bruni s exclusive commentary every week  Sign up for his newsletter  Flores of course accused him of coming up behind her  touching her shoulders and kissing the back of her head  a gesture that s inappropriate and demeaning  Biden says that he doesn t recall the incident  from 2014  The media has given this breathless coverage I ve written that I don t think Biden  76  should run  for many reasons  including that someone in politics as long as he has been carries too much baggage  that Democratic voters have generally preferred candidates significantly younger than he is  and that he mismanaged and failed miserably in his two prior presidential campaigns But I feel just as strongly that Democrats need to show some proportion  realism and reason as they assess and react to candidates  or  in Biden s case  probable candidates   With Biden especially but with others as well  too many Democrats aren t doing that It s nonnegotiable that Democrats hold their presidential aspirants to high standards on issues of racial justice  gender equality and more  It s crucial that the party nominate someone who can credibly represent its proudly diverse ranks  But it s also important that the party not demand a degree of purity that nobody attains I m not recommending the Republicans  course in accepting and protecting Donald Trump  which was to bury principles so deep that they may never be exhumed  I m saying that to turn the Democratic primary into a nonstop apology tour when the nominee will be going up against a president never expected to apologize for anything is a risky strategy  It obsesses over the flaws in candidates who have many strengths  defining them in terms of what they seek forgiveness for  It blurs the line between job interview and inquisition  Taken too far  it rips contenders to shreds before Trump even takes out his scissors As for the mini debate about Buttigieg s gayness  it arose principally from this column in Slate  which included the following paragraph  A marginalized sexual orientation can remain unspoken and unnoticed for as long as a queer person desires  A gay man who conforms to a critical mass of gendered expectations can move through life without his sexuality attending every interaction  even after he comes out  Buttigieg  for instance  would register on only the most finely tuned gaydar  Most people who are aware of his candidacy probably know he s gay  but his every appearance doesn t activate the  Hey  that s that homosexual gentleman  response in the average brain  That doesn t mean he s not gay enough   there s really no such measure  It just means that he might not be up against quite the same hurdles that a gay candidate without such sturdy ties to straight culture would be  The author is asserting that Buttigieg  37  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   doesn t come across as particularly gay  meaning       what  That he lacks stereotypical mannerisms  That his voice isn t high pitched  I m kind of floored  because I and other gay people around my age  54  or older spent most of our lives educating people about the bigotry and inaccuracy of those very stereotypes and trumpeting the message   the truth    that gay people can be every bit as buttoned down and strait laced as  well  Pete Buttigieg  Now his divergence from those stereotypes is deemed remarkable and in need of dissection  Strange days indeed Also  I guarantee you that Buttigieg s adherence to  a critical mass of gendered expectations  and failure to  activate  the homosexual alert siren don t mean that being gay has been incidental to his life and is incidental to his perspective  That he didn t come out until he was 33 is all the proof you need that he wrestled privately with his sexual orientation and with fears about how the world would respond to it and to him And when I first met and interviewed him nearly three years ago  this is how he argued that Democrats should reclaim the word  freedom  from Republicans  who have tried to reserve it for their brand  You re not free if you have crushing medical debt  You re not free if you re being treated differently because of who you are  What has really affected my personal freedom more  the fact that I don t have the freedom to pollute a certain river  or the fact that for part of my adult life  I didn t have the freedom to marry somebody I was in love with  We re talking about deep  personal freedom  He sounds sufficiently gay to me  His powers of empathy seem plenty informed by his sexual orientation  And we need to stop making assumptions about how well someone can understand and address what minorities go through based on his or her looks or vocal inflections or anything of the sort  That s the quintessence of prejudice  And it s the antithesis of enlightenment The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think

damage in Freeport  Ill CreditScott P  Yates Rockford Register Star  via Associated PressThe news that Anna Sorokin  the New York  party girl grifter  whose story has fascinated society and Hollywood and who is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court  has been advised by a stylist on what to wear for her courtroom appearances should not really come as a surprise to anyone  Increasingly  it seems  there is a tendency to rely on experts to help navigate the thorny issues of what to wear when  and not just for highly fraught events Consider  for example  the recent reports that J B  Pritzker  the governor of Illinois  has daily notations on his official schedule related to dress  Or rather  how to dress for different occasions  This has gotten less attention than Ms  Sorokin s news has  he is  to be fair  a somewhat less sensationalist figure   but in many ways it is a similarly revealing sign of the times According to John O Connor of The Associated Press  who used the Freedom of Information Act to get access to the governor s schedule during the first six weeks of his term  there were more than 70 written recommendations regarding what the governor should wear to various planned events  The advice included when to bring multiple tie choices  for his official photo  he went with marine blue with white polka dots   when to forget the tie altogether  as well as what occasions were best for the  polo with Columbia jacket  At first  like Mr  O Connor  I thought this was unusual  Governor Pritzker  after all  has been a businessman and philanthropist  and presumably knows how to dress for the office  So I called Jordan Abudayyeh  Mr  Pritzker s press secretary  to ask why it was necessary  She said the notations were  standard operating procedure  meant to make his life simpler and make sure he always looked appropriate  She did not have much else to add Which is too bad  because Mr  Pritzker and his team are indeed far from alone in this particular strategy  though they may be taking it to a slightly more extreme level than most According to Ryan Williams  a Republican strategist and former aide to Mitt Romney during Mr  Romney s time as governor of Massachusetts and his two presidential campaigns  it was  not unusual  to jot down on the governor s schedule whether the dress code for an event was  business  casual or black tie   During the campaigns  this could be even more detailed  depending on the event   A country barbecue  for example  might require more thought   Donna Brazile  the onetime interim head of the Democratic National Committee and a recently signed Fox News contributor  said that in her experience such advice came from communications and advance teams and was  part of the message of the day   Also  that it had become increasingly important and  perhaps  detailed ImageGovernor Pritzker unveils his graduated income tax plan at the Illinois State Capitol CreditJustin L  Fowler The State Journal Register  via Associated Press Once upon a time  you had three dress codes  business  casual and formal   she wrote in an email  noting that today candidates can dress to  signal everything from leadership style to their political branding  and hence need a certain amount of premeditation Bennet Ratcliff  a former political consultant who worked with the Democratic Governors Association  pointed out that social media has exacerbated the situation  A politician is now dressing not just for the people in the room but also the people scrolling past a picture of said politician with the people in the room   and may be stopping to look or think In that context  you can go one of two ways  adopt an effective uniform that communicates an attitude of formality in representing the job  see  for example  President Trump  who rarely appears in public without a jacket  and seems happiest in his oversize suits and below the belt red ties   or dress to fit in with the group you are with  In which case maybe you need a bit of help determining what that means There is nothing wrong with this  or with thinking about this  it doesn t reveal a superficiality or lack of substance  which is often the default fear when the topic of clothing comes up  On the contrary  it acknowledges the truth that we all make snap judgments based first on appearance  and then make a choice about how much time and brain space need to be devoted to influencing those judgments  and how much can be delegated This should be something everyone can relate to  given the current craziness around dress codes in general  be it the complete nonsense of events that request  creative dress  or  dress to impress  or the difficulty of corporate strictures on dressing  appropriately  in an office setting  a word so vague that it is practically meaningless   Yes  Goldman Sachs  this means you   To a certain extent  we are always in search of dress recommendations and instruction  as the social and professional codes of yesteryear have eroded under the increasing commingling of life and work  putting an end to unspoken uniforms  That s why stylists and personal shoppers have become such a booming business  increasingly famous in their own right  In many ways  politics has been the most insulated of all professions  but clearly  even that is changing  And really  if there is such a thing as a courtroom stylist  can a political stylist be far behind  This is essentially the role Meredith Koop played for Michelle Obama  though officially her job was general aide  and how Herv Pierre functions for Melania Trump  Mr  O Connor of The Associated Press said that after he discovered the dress notations on Mr  Pritzker s schedule  he asked to speak with the governor about the subject but to no avail  his email request received no response  which was  he said  a rarity in his experience   Frankly  I think Governor Pritzker missed a great opportunity  He would have done everyone a favor if  once the topic was on the table  he had embraced it  Imagine how liberating it would be if a politician  especially a male one  was secure enough to give an interview about the importance of dressing the part  and how useful it was to have someone thinking about that so he could use his time crafting policy  be it for flood management or health care Especially because the question of public figures and what they wear and who helps decide that is bound to become more fraught during the coming Democratic primary  as the pressure to distinguish oneself will put more onus on crafting an identifiable image that stands apart while simultaneously standing for something  Arguably Beto O Rourke has already proven himself to be working this angle  at least judging by his Vanity Fair cover and his skill at casting

WASHINGTON   International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Tuesday that global growth has lost momentum amid rising trade tensions and tighter financial conditions  but pauses in rate hikes will help boost activity in the second half of 2019 Lagarde  in a preview of the April 12 14 IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings  said the global economy is  unsettled  after two years of steady growth  with the outlook  precarious  and vulnerable to trade  Brexit and financial market shocks In January  the IMF cut its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 5 percent from 3 7 percent  and Lagarde signalled further cuts when the IMF releases new forecasts next week  We had this synchronized acceleration of growth a couple of years ago  Now it is synchronized deceleration and a slowing momentum across the spectrum   Lagarde said in a panel discussion at the U S  Chamber of Commerce headquarters in Washington Lagarde said that the IMF does not anticipate a recession in the near term  and the Federal Reserve s  more patient pace of monetary policy normalization  will provide some thrust to growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 She cautioned  however  that years of high public debt and low interest rates since the financial crisis a decade ago have left limited room in many countries to act when the next downturn arrives so countries need to make smarter use of fiscal policy  This means striking a better balance between growth  debt sustainability and social objectives and acting to address growing inequality by building stronger social safety nets She previewed new IMF research to be released on Wednesday showing that rising trade tensions and tariffs were hurting investment in plant  machinery and job creating projects  Other IMF research will show that rising market power among some technology firms was leading to price markups in a  winner takes most  dynamic that she said requires more effective policies to foster innovation and ensure fair competition Lagarde also said that the IMF has revised its analysis of the U S  China trade war s impacts  showing that if all trade between the world s two largest economies were subjected to a 25 percent tariff  U S  gross domestic product would fall by up to 0 6 percent while China s GDP would fall by up to 1 5 percent U S  President Donald Trump has threatened to subject all imports from China to a 25 percent tariff if the two sides cannot resolve their disputes in negotiations  Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is due in Washington for another round of talks starting on Wednesday   Nobody wins a trade war   Lagarde added   That is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system     Reporting by David Lawder  Editing by Sam Holmes and Susan Thomas  

WASHINGTON   The United States will not send high level officials to attend China s second Belt and Road summit in Beijing this month  a spokesperson for the U S  State Department said on Tuesday  citing concerns about financing practices for the project China s top diplomat  Yang Jiechi  said on Saturday that almost 40 foreign leaders would take part in the summit due to be held in Beijing in late April  He rejected criticisms of the project as  prejudiced  The first summit for the project  which envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia  Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending  was held in 2017 and was attended by Matt Pottinger  the senior White House official for Asia  There are no such plans this year   We will not send high level officials from the United States   a spokesperson for the U S  State Department said in answer to a question from Reuters  We will continue to raise concerns about opaque financing practices  poor governance  and disregard for internationally accepted norms and standards  which undermine many of the standards and principles that we rely upon to promote sustainable  inclusive development  and to maintain stability and a rules based order   We have repeatedly called on China to address these concerns   the official added Chinese President Xi Jinping s Belt and Road Initiative has proven controversial in many Western capitals  particularly Washington  which views it as a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through non transparent projects On Saturday  Yang called such criticisms  prejudiced   saying China has never forced debt upon participants and the project was to promote joint development On Saturday  he did not name the 40 leaders he said would attend  but some of China s closest allies have already confirmed they will be there  including Russian President Vladimir Putin  Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan  Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen The United States has been particularly critical of Italy s decision to sign up to the plan this month  during a visit by Xi to Rome  the first for a G7 nation Washington sees China as major strategic rival and the Trump administration has engaged Beijing in a tit for tat tariff war The world s two biggest economies have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars  worth of bilateral trade since July 2018  raising costs  disrupting supply chains and roiling global markets White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Tuesday said the countries  expect to make more headway  in trade talks this week  while the top U S  business lobbying group said differences over an enforcement mechanism and the removal of U S  tariffs were still obstacles to a deal   Reporting by David Brunnstrom  Editing by Sandra Maler  

GENEVA   World trade shrank by 0 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is likely to grow by 2 6 percent this year  slower than 3 0 percent growth in 2018 and below a previous forecast of 3 7 percent  the World Trade Organization said on Tuesday In its annual forecast  the WTO said trade had been weighed down by new tariffs and retaliatory measures  weaker economic growth  volatility in financial markets and tighter monetary conditions in developed countries  It forecast in September that 2018 growth would be 3 9 percent  down from 4 6 percent in 2017 WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told a news conference that the lower forecast was no surprise  given the trade tensions between the United States and China  WTO chief economist Robert Koopman said worse may be to come  with an even bigger impact if U S  President Donald Trump goes ahead with a plan to impose high tariffs on global imports of cars later this year   U S  China trade is about 3 percent of global trade  Automobile trade globally is about 8 percent of global trade  So you can imagine that the impact of automobile tariffs is going to be bigger than the impact of the U S  China trade conflict  I think it s pretty clear that any automobile tariff would likely have bigger knock on effects through the global economy than what we see from the U S  China conflict  The WTO did not make a specific prediction about the impact of Brexit  but Koopman said in the worst case it would help push global trade growth down to the bottom end of the WTO s forecast range in 2019  1 3 to 4 0 percent   The UK s own analysis suggests that  no deal  or  hard Brexit  would shave 7 6 percent off British GDP  That would be a big number  It would force our numbers down to that lower part of our range   Koopman said   If we end up in the fall with a revision  my guess is the likelihood of a revision is that it s downward  based on any number of factors from Brexit to no resolution in the U S  China trade conflict  and other trade conflicts going on  Although the volume of global trade grew only slowly in 2018  the dollar value rose 10 percent to  19 48 trillion  partly because oil prices rose 20 percent  the WTO said The value of commercial services trade grew by 8 percent to  5 80 trillion in 2018  driven by strong import growth in Asia  Goods trade volumes are expected to grow more strongly in developing economies this year  with 3 4 percent growth in exports compared with 2 1 percent in developed economies    Reporting by Tom Miles  editing by Larry King

WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a bid by family members of 17 U S  sailors killed in the 2000 al Qaeda bombing of the Navy destroyer USS Cole to collect some  35 million in damages from Sudan for its alleged role in the attack  six days after also ruling against Americans injured in the attack  The justices declined to hear the relatives  appeal of a lower court decision in favor of Sudan  The Richmond  Virginia based 4th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the lawsuit had not been properly initiated in 2010 because the claims were sent to Sudan s embassy in Washington instead of directly to its foreign minister in Khartoum  the African country s capital  The high court last Tuesday ruled that the improper mailing violated the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act  a U S  law governing when foreign governments may be sued in American courts  tossing out more than  314 million in damages from Sudan for a group of injured sailors and their spouses President Donald Trump s administration sided with Sudan  It said the United States rejects judicial notices at its embassies abroad and that allowing notices to be sent to a foreign embassy in Washington could harm U S  foreign relations and American treatment in foreign courts The Virginia lawsuit included 56 spouses  siblings  parents and children of the 17 Americans killed in the Cole attack  They accused Sudan of providing material support to the al Qaeda Islamist militant group  including funding and training  that helped facilitate the bombing  Sudan has denied the allegation On Oct  12  2000  two men in a small boat detonated explosives alongside the Navy guided missile destroyer as it was refueling in the southern Yemeni port of Aden  killing 17 sailors  wounding more than three dozen others and blasting a gaping hole in its hull  The vessel was repaired and later returned to full active duty The bombing came 11 months before al Qaeda s Sept  11  2001  attacks on the United States The relatives sued under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act  which generally bars suits against foreign countries except those designated by the U S  as a sponsor of terrorism  as Sudan has been since 1993  Sudan did not defend against the claims in court  In 2014  a trial judge found that Sudan s aid to al Qaeda  led to the murders  of the 17 Americans and awarded the families about  35 million  including  14 million in punitive damages Sudan then sought to void the judgments  arguing that the lawsuit was not properly served on its foreign minister  violating notification requirements under U S  and international law  The 4th Circuit sided with Sudan last year  but said the families could have another chance to properly serve Sudan s government with the lawsuit  They did so last October  with the help of U S  diplomatic channels    Reporting by Andrew Chung  Editing by Will Dunham  

When federal immigration agents carried out a workplace raid at an electronics repair company in Texas this week  they handed out color coded bracelets  People whom they deemed authorized to work in the United States received green wristbands  Those suspected of being undocumented wore yellow It was an emotional scene punctuated by the arrests of more than 280 employees who were detained on immigration violations   the biggest single workplace sweep since 2008  officials said  and the largest since President Trump took office with a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration The operation on Wednesday in Allen  a suburb of Dallas  evoked strong reactions  as families rushed to the site of the raid  protesters gathered outside an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement office in Dallas  and immigrant advocacy groups condemned the operation for throwing families  lives into turmoil in a matter of hours The employees arrested  who were predominantly women  hailed from 15 countries  including El Salvador  Honduras  Mexico  Nigeria and Venezuela  according to ICE  The agency said more than half of the workers had been released with orders to appear before a federal immigration judge  but 110 people remained in custody as of Thursday Katrina W  Berger  who leads the agency s Homeland Security Investigations unit in Dallas  said its focus was on a criminal investigation into the company  CVE Technology Group  But she said the authorities could not  turn a blind eye  to the unauthorized workers who were found there The authorities executed a criminal search warrant at the company  which refurbishes and repairs cellphones and other technology equipment  after getting  many tips  that the business was hiring workers who were using fraudulent documents  Ms  Berger said  Businesses that knowingly hire illegal aliens create an unfair advantage over their competing businesses   Ms  Berger said at a news conference after the raid   They take jobs away from U S  citizens and legal residents  and they create an atmosphere poised for exploiting an illegal work force  By Thursday  frantic families were seeking help from Raices  a Texas based organization that offers free and low cost legal services to immigrants and refugees  said Felix Villalobos  a lawyer in the organization s Dallas office  He said the group had been inundated with requests  as many employees remained detained United We Dream Texas  an organization led by young immigrants  condemned ICE in a statement for  targeting black and brown immigrant workers    Within hours  the lives of hundreds have spiraled into turmoil and anxiety   the group said   These workers are now in the hands of an agency that is abusive and negligent towards the physical and mental well being of the people they target  In an email on Thursday  Edward Cho  the chief executive of CVE Technology Group  said the company has a strong history of complying with federal immigration and employment laws  We are cooperating with the authorities and intend to continue doing so   he said   We are also focused on providing support to impacted employees and their families  for whom this is a profoundly upsetting development  Workplace raids have become more common under Mr  Trump  whose strict enforcement agenda has pushed the population of detained immigrants to the highest levels in history  Homeland Security Investigations opened about 6 850 workplace investigations last year  a jump from about 1 700 the year before  Officials also made nearly 800 criminal arrests  up from about 140 in 2017  according to figures released by ICE in December The operations recall the high profile immigration raids that made headlines during the presidency of George W  Bush  One of the biggest workplace raids  in May 2008  resulted in the detention of nearly 400 undocumented immigrants  including several children  at an Iowa meatpacking plant ImageU S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials stand outside CVE Technology Group in Allen  Texas CreditSmiley N  Pool The Dallas Morning News  via Associated PressThe Obama administration took a more hands off approach to enforcement  auditing employers  compliance in documenting their workers  status without conducting many on site investigations About eight million of the nearly 11 million immigrants unlawfully in the United States participate in the labor force  They account for about 5 percent of all workers  according to the Pew Research Center Experts say that workplace raids primarily serve as a deterrent for employees   dissuading workers who are in the country illegally from showing up at their jobs and warning prospective undocumented immigrants that  even if they make it across the border  they may be captured at work While the raids may also make employers think twice  it has traditionally been difficult for the government to take criminal action against businesses that hire unauthorized immigrants A handful of employers faced prominent criminal cases in recent years  Last year  after federal agents rounded up about 100 workers at a meatpacking plant in Tennessee  the owner of the company pleaded guilty in federal court to fraud and employing unauthorized immigrants But many companies avoid serious charges because it is often impossible to prove that they knew someone was unauthorized to work Kathleen Campbell Walker  who is on the board of the American Immigration Lawyers Association  said unauthorized immigrants seeking work may present fake documents  and it is up to employers to verify that the paperwork is legitimate In some cases  she said  businesses are hiring and recruiting undocumented workers to try to cut costs and stay competitive  But there are other situations in which businesses don t properly assess the documents   or get fooled by realistic fakes   Many employers don t have a clue to be able to spot something that is fake   she said The law requires only that employers ensure that documents appear to be valid  and federal law prohibits them from requiring specific types of identification from workers The standard is   To a reasonable employer  on their face  do they appear to be valid   Ms  Campbell Walker said Immigration officials said CVE Technology Group had  knowingly  hired unauthorized immigrants  After an audit earlier this year found  numerous hiring irregularities   officials executed a criminal search warrant on Wednesday The vast and complex operation involved more than 200 law enforcement officials who arrested people suspected of being undocumented while also working to identify the sole caregivers of children and others who should be released quickly on  humanitarian grounds   Ms  Berger said Mr  Villalobos of Raices said his group was working to independently confirm what had happened and to quell a panic that was rippling among immigrants locally and beyond   Even if they live nowhere near that city   he said  an operation like this can scare families into changing their habits  including their driving patterns The families who rushed to the site of the raid on Wednesday  were pretty emotional   he said  Some were left waiting for hours or more for their loved ones to be released One man told a local television station  WFAA  that his fiance had been detained  They were planning

FORT LAUDERDALE  Fla    A woman carrying two Chinese passports and a device containing computer malware lied to Secret Service agents and briefly gained admission to President Donald Trump s Mar a Lago club over the weekend during his Florida visit  federal prosecutors allege in court documents Yujing Zhang  32  approached a Secret Service agent at a checkpoint outside the Palm Beach club early Saturday afternoon and said she was a member who wanted to use the pool  court documents said  She showed the passports as identification Agents say she wasn t on the membership list  but a club manager thought Zhang was the daughter of a member  Agents say that when they asked Zhang if the member was her father  she did not answer definitively but they thought it might be a language barrier and admitted her Zhang s story changed when she got inside  agents say  telling a front desk receptionist she was there to attend the United Nations Chinese American Association event scheduled for that evening  No such event was scheduled and agents were summoned Agent Samuel Ivanovich wrote in court documents that Zhang told him that she was there for the Chinese American event and had come early to familiarize herself with the club and take photos  again contradicting what she had said at the checkpoint  She showed him an invitation in Chinese that he could not read He said Zhang was taken off the grounds and told she could not be there  Ivanovich said she became argumentative  so she was taken to the local Secret Service office for questioning There  he said  it became clear Zhang speaks and reads English well  He said Zhang said she had traveled from Shanghai to attend the nonexistent Mar a Lago event on the invitation of an acquaintance named  Charles   whom she only knew through a Chinese social media app  Ivanovich said she then denied telling the checkpoint agents she was a member wanting to swim Ivanovich said Zhang carried four cellphones  a laptop computer  an external hard drive and a thumb drive containing computer malware  She did not have a swimsuit  While the Secret Service does not determine who is permitted to enter the club  our agents and officers conduct physical screenings to ensure no prohibited items are allowed onto the property   a U S  Secret Service spokesperson said in a statement   This access does not afford an individual proximity to the President or other Secret Service protectees  In such instances  additional screening and security measures are employed  Zhang is charged with making false statements to federal agents and illegally entering a restricted area  She remains in custody pending a hearing next week  Her public defender  Robert Adler  declined comment There is no indication Zhang was ever near the president  There is also no indication that she is connected to Li Yang  a Chinese native  Republican donor and former Florida massage parlor owner Yang recently made news after it was learned she was promising Chinese business leaders that her consulting firm could get them access to Mar a Lago  where they could mingle with the president

WASHINGTON   The National Rifle Association  the nation s largest gun lobby  has settled on its next target on Capitol Hill  blocking Congress from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act  a 1994 law that assists victims of domestic and sexual violence The House is set to vote on the legislation this week  the law expired in February  But the bill includes a new provision   aimed at curbing sexual violence by expanding law enforcement s ability to strip domestic abusers of their guns   that the N R A  does not like  The measure closes the so called boyfriend loophole by barring those convicted of abusing  assaulting or stalking a dating partner or those subject to a court restraining order from buying or owning firearms Under current federal law  those convicted of domestic abuse can lose their guns if they are   or were formerly   married to their victim  live with their victim  have a child with their victim or are a parent or guardian of their victim  The proposed provision would extend those who can be convicted of domestic abuse to include stalkers and current or former boyfriends or dating partners Jennifer Baker  a spokeswoman for the N R A   said that for  many of those  offenses    and I m using air quotes here   the behavior that would qualify as a stalking offense is often not violent or threatening  it involves no personal contact whatsoever   She argues that the new provision is  too broad and ripe for abuse   Like if you were sending harassing messages to somebody on Facebook  to somebody you never met or somebody you dated five years ago   she said  adding   How it s written right now  you could be convicted for a misdemeanor stalking offense for a tweet that causes someone emotional distress and then you would be prohibited from owning a firearm  Others find the N R A  s argument far fetched   A single tweet or Facebook message  without significant other conduct  would ordinarily not be enough  to result in a conviction for stalking  said David Keck  director of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms  which provides guidance to law enforcement and governments on implementing firearms prohibitions  but takes no position on the new domestic violence act provision And times have changed for the gun lobby  A wave of freshman Democrats in Congress were elected on a promise to enact new gun restrictions  and they proudly campaigned against the N R A  The No  1 way that women are being killed with guns is by their beloveds  their boyfriends  their significant others   said one of those freshman Democrats  Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia   I am not paying attention to the rhetoric of the N R A  because I can t be distracted  What s most important is putting forth good legislation to save as many lives as we can   Ms  McBath s son  Jordan Davis  was shot to death in 2012 Roughly half of all female homicide victims are killed by what experts call  intimate partners    meaning current or former spouses or dating partners   according to a 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  And about half of intimate partner homicides involved dating relationships  according to Mr  Keck The  boyfriend loophole  provision is  a refocus on should we be just looking at domestic partners or should we be looking more broadly at intimate partners   he said Studies also show that domestic abusers with guns inflict a disproportionate amount of violence on their partners  and that the victims are overwhelmingly female  Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a firearm  according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence  a gun safety group  Roughly three quarters of all intimate partner murder victims were also victims of stalking by their partners  according to the National Center for Victims of Crime  The share of homicides committed by dating partners has been increasing for three decades   said Shannon Watts  who founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  a group that supports tighter gun laws  in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012   Women are now as likely to be killed by dating partners as by spouses with guns  The reauthorization bill has one Republican co sponsor  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania  Representative Kevin McCarthy  the House Republican leader  is urging Congress to extend the expired law for the rest of the year to continue funding services to survivors at current levels  Ms  Baker  of the N R A   accused Democrats of  playing politics  with the bill by inserting the so called boyfriend provision as a  poison pill  so that Democrats can portray Republicans who vote against it as anti woman The N R A  has decided to  score  the vote on the Violence Against Women Act  meaning it will keep track and publish how lawmakers vote in an effort to either reward or defeat them in the next election  While the move is not likely to keep the bill from passing the House  it does make it more likely that the  boyfriend loophole  provision will be stripped from the act when the measure arrives in the Senate  Anybody who votes for this should take the outrage of the N R A  and wear it proudly   said Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  who drafted the provision as a separate bill and fought for it to be included in the Violence Against Women Act Ms  Dingell   whose husband  John D  Dingell Jr   who died this year  served on the N R A  s board of directors   has spoken powerfully of her experiences as a child  cowering in the closet in fear of her father  who struggled with mental illness and had a gun  I am not someone who wants to take people s guns away   she said   I have lived with a man that was an N R A  board member and with a man that shouldn t have had a gun  And I want to stand up for both sides  The move to oppose the act comes as the N R A  s power is increasingly being challenged on Capitol Hill and in statehouses around the country by gun control activists  including many students who have taken up the charge after the massacre last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Fla Twenty six states and the District of Columbia passed 67 new gun safety laws in 2018  according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence  On Capitol Hill  the House in February passed legislation expanding background checks to cover nearly all gun purchases   the first significant gun safety measure in 25 years Even in the Republican controlled Senate  Senator Lindsey Graham  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  convened a hearing last week on  red flag laws  or extreme risk protection orders that allow family members and law enforcement officers to obtain court restraining orders to remove firearms from people who have been identified as a risk to themselves or others So far  14 states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing extreme risk protection orders  Mr  Graham said he is working on legislation to create incentives for states to enact such bills  Ms  Baker said the N R A  agrees with the idea in theory but has not supported any of the state laws because of  serious due process concerns  The idea has gained traction in some unlikely places   including the White House  where President Trump embraced it when Vice President Mike Pence raised it during a meeting with lawmakers after the school massacre in Parkland  Or Mike  take the firearms first and then go to court   Mr  Trump told Mr  Pence  adding   because a lot of times  by the time you go to court  it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures  I like taking the guns early

SEOUL  South Korea   A South Korean ship is being held at a domestic port over suspicions that it illegally provided oil to heavily sanctioned North Korea  officials said Wednesday The revelation comes amid growing concerns over wide ranging efforts by North Korea to evade U N  Security Council sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missiles program A South Korean coast guard official said the 5 160 ton P PIONEER has been prevented from leaving Busan port since October over allegations that it was used to supply diesel to North Korea through two ship to ship transfers in September 2017 in international waters in the East China Sea  He did not confirm how much was supplied South Korea s Yonhap news agency cited unnamed sources to report that the North Korean vessels on the receiving end were the Kum Un San and the Yu Son  The Kum Un San is believed to be one of North Korea s most active vessels involved in ship to ship transfers of petroleum products  The U N  Security Council said in a report last month that an unnamed member state said that North Korea has been using approximately 23 of its tankers for the prohibited transfers  and that six tankers  including the Kum Un San  accounted for half of the transfers An official from Seoul s Foreign Ministry said it was the first time a South Korean ship was detained over allegations of violating U N  sanctions against North Korea  South Korea is detaining three foreign vessels for illegally providing oil to North Korea or transporting North Korea produced coal The Korea Coast Guard has sent the case to state prosecutors  who are now examining whether to indict the ship s captain and management company for violating laws governing maritime transport and exchanges with North Korea  the coast guard official said Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity  citing department rules preventing them from speaking to the press In its March report  the U N  Security Council said North Korea was continuing to defy its resolutions through a  massive  increase in ship to ship transfers of petroleum products and coal  The report quoted one unnamed member state as saying North Korea obtained more than the cap of 500 000 barrels of refined petroleum products in 2018  but said another unnamed country questioned the figure U N  sanctions against North Korea have strengthened significantly since 2016 as Pyongyang stepped up its weapons tests and now includes strict import restrictions on petroleum products and crude oil and export bans on coal and other minerals that had been key sources of foreign currency for the North South Korean prosecutors in December charged four people with illegally importing North Korean coal  saying they used falsified documents and transshipments at Russian ports to disguise the coal as Russian Following successful tests of long range missiles potentially capable of reaching the U S  mainland in 2017  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un shifted to a diplomatic mode in 2018 and held summits with leaders of South Korea and the United States in an effort to leverage his nuclear arsenal for economic and security benefits  But Kim s second summit with President Donald Trump in February collapsed over mismatched demands in sanctions relief and disarmament

One prisoner had been dead for so long that when he was discovered lying face down  his face was flattened  Another was tied up and tortured for two days while no one noticed  Bloody inmates screamed for help from cells whose doors did not lock Those were some of the gruesome details in a 56 page report on the Alabama prison system that was issued by the Justice Department on Wednesday  The report  one of the first major civil rights investigations by the department to be released under President Trump  uncovered shocking conditions in the state s massively overcrowded and understaffed facilities Prisoners in the Alabama system endured some of the highest rates of homicide and rape in the country  the Justice Department found  and officials showed a  flagrant disregard  for their right to be free from excessive and cruel punishment  The investigation began in the waning days of the Obama administration and continued for more than two years after Mr  Trump took office  The department notified the prison system that it could sue in 49 days  if State officials have not satisfactorily addressed our concerns   The New York Times received more than 2 000 photos taken inside an Alabama prison  This is what they showed  Alabama is not alone in having troubled  violent prisons  But the state has one of the country s highest incarceration rates and its correctional system is notoriously antiquated  dangerous and short staffed  The major prisons are at 182 percent of their capacity  the report found  contraband is rampant and prisoners sleep in dorms they are not assigned to in order to escape violence  The violations are severe  systemic  and exacerbated by serious deficiencies in staffing and supervision   the report said  noting that some facilities had fewer than 20 percent of their allotted positions filled  It also cited the use of solitary confinement as a protective measure for vulnerable inmates  and  a high level of violence that is too common  cruel  of an unusual nature  and pervasive  State officials said the report addressed issues that Alabama was already aware of and working to fix  For more than two years  the D O J  pursued an investigation of issues that have been the subject of ongoing litigation and the target of significant reforms by the state   a statement from the office of Gov  Kay Ivey said   Over the coming months  my Administration will be working closely with D O J  to ensure that our mutual concerns are addressed and that we remain steadfast in our commitment to public safety  making certain that this Alabama problem has an Alabama solution  But the report called the state  deliberately indifferent  to the risks prisoners face  and said   It has failed to correct known systemic deficiencies that contribute to the violence   Legislative efforts to reduce overcrowding through measures such as reducing sentences were not made retroactive and have had  minimal effect   the report said Alabama s prisons have for years been the subject of civil rights litigation by the Equal Justice Initiative and the Southern Poverty Law Center  nonprofit legal advocacy groups based in Montgomery  Maria Morris  the lead lawyer for the center s lawsuit  also disputed the assertion that the problems were being fixed  They re not fixing them   Ms  Morris said   They re giving a lot of lip service to the need to fix them  but the lip service always comes back to we just need a billion dollars to build new prisons and  as the Department of Justice found  that s not going to solve the problem  Alabama inmates continue to die in high numbers  There have been 15 suicides in the past 15 months  and the homicide rate vastly exceeds the national average for prisons The Justice Department report focused on the failure to prevent prisoner on prisoner violence because of what it said was inadequate training  failure to properly classify and supervise inmates  and failure to stem the flow of contraband including weapons and drugs  among other problems The department is still investigating excessive force and sexual abuse by prison staff members  an investigation that former federal prosecutors say could lead to criminal indictments  Our reporter went inside St  Clair Correctional Facility in Springville  Ala  He found it was  virtually ungoverned  and the inmates were armed  Investigators visited four prisons and interviewed more than 270 prisoners  To  provide a window into a broken system   the report detailed a single week s worth of injuries and attacks  including days that saw multiple incidents including stabbings  a sleeping man attacked with socks filled with metal locks and another man being forced to perform oral sex on two men at knife point The department also concluded that the system does not provide  safe and sanitary  living conditions  Open sewage ran by the pathway that government lawyers used to access one facility  which the state closed soon after the visit  One investigator grew ill from the toxic fumes of cleaning fluids while inspecting the kitchen  the report said The report said the state failed to track violent deaths or adequately investigate sex abuse  At least three homicide victims   including one who was stabbed and another who was beaten   were classified as having died from natural causes  the report said  The report listed nine killings in which the victims had been previously attacked or officials had received other warnings that they were in danger Sexual assaults occur in  dormitories  cells  recreation areas  the infirmary  bathrooms  and showers at all hours of the day and night   the report said  Prisons must screen inmates and separate sexually abusive prisoners from those at risk of sexual abuse  particularly gay and transgender people  the report said Alabama does not do so Inmates are raped to pay off debts  and one mother told the Justice Department that a prisoner had texted her to say he would  chop her son into pieces and rape him if she did not send him  800   the report said Last month  Governor Ivey warned of  horrendous conditions  in the prisons and an impending federal intervention in her State of the State speech Ms  Ivey said the department had increased the prison budget in recent years  given raises to corrections officers and requested  31 million to hire 500 more correctional officers and increase pay in the coming fiscal year But Mac McArthur  the executive director of the Alabama State Employees Association  which includes state corrections workers  said attrition was still outpacing recruitment  in part because starting salaries were still below  30 000 a year for some officers  and in part because the job was so dangerous The federal investigation was opened during the Obama administration  after the lawsuits over prison abuses and published accounts of endemic brutality  violence and torture  The investigation continued under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions  who had also served as a longtime senator from Alabama The report included a series of measures necessary to remedy the constitutional and other violations that regularly occur in the Alabama prison system  including additional screening for those entering the prisons  moving low risk inmates  hiring 500 additional corrections officers and overhauling disciplinary processes around violence and sexual assault Similar federal civil rights investigations have resulted in consent decrees   court approved deals that include a road map of changes that institutions such as police departments and state correction departments must adhere to in order to avoid being sued But in a break with past practice  Mr  Sessions placed three key restrictions on consent decrees  He said that a top political appointee must sign off on any deal  Department lawyers must show proof of violations that go beyond unconstitutional behavior  And the deals must have a sunset date  meaning they can expire before violations have been remedied  The current attorney general  William P  Barr  has not changed Mr  Sessions s policy Mr  Sessions said that the consent decrees interfered with states  rights  a position echoed by Ms  Ivey in her statement insisting on an  Alabama solution  But Vanita Gupta  a head of the civil rights division in the Obama administration and one of the officials who opened the investigation  said that given the pervasive problems and the history of inaction   nothing short of a comprehensive consent decree will adequately address these constitutional violations  The Justice Department declined to comment on whether it would seek a consent decree Ms  Ivey is hardly the first governor to reckon with the prison system and its decrepit conditions  Her immediate predecessor  Robert Bentley  pushed a plan for  800 million in bonds to build four new prisons and to close some existing facilities But governors have only so much influence in Alabama  and the Legislature balked  especially as a scandal left Mr  Bentley weakened  This year  Ms  Ivey proposed a similar plan for new prisons that state officials hoped would be ready by 2022

WASHINGTON   U S  Vice President Mike Pence warned Turkey on Wednesday against buying a Russian S 400 anti missile system  keeping up pressure on the NATO ally to abandon a purchase that Washington views as a threat to U S  military equipment  Turkey must choose  Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making such reckless decisions that undermine our alliance   Pence said in an address during a meeting of NATO ministers in Washington The United States and Turkey remain at loggerheads over Ankara s plan to buy the air defense system from Russia  which Washington believes would compromise the security of its F 35 fighter jets  made by Lockheed Martin Corp Turkey struck back promptly  with Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay issuing his own admonition on Twitter   The United States must choose  Does it want to remain Turkey s ally or risk our friendship by joining forces with terrorists to undermine its NATO ally s defense against its enemies  Washington has warned that proceeding with the deal could result in U S  sanctions and the exclusion of Turkey from the F 35 fighter jet program  The United States this week halted delivery to Turkey of equipment related to the stealthy aircraft  We ve also made it clear that we will not stand idly by while NATO allies purchase weapons from our adversaries that threaten the cohesion of our alliance   Pence said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey has proposed to the United States that they form a working group to determine that Russian S 400 missile defense systems do not pose a threat to U S  or NATO military equipment  It will not be integrated into the NATO system     therefore we propose the United States to establish a technical working group to make sure that this system will not be a threat   neither to  U S   F 35s nor the NATO systems   Cavusoglu told a panel in Washington Ankara says it needs the S 400s  to be delivered in July  to defend itself  as Turkey faces threats from Kurdish and Islamist militants at home and conflicts in neighboring Syria and Iraq The United States hopes to find a way out of the dispute by convincing Turkey to purchase the U S  made Patriot air defense system  made by Raytheon  Turkey is also looking into a French Italian system based on the SAMP T missile systems Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed his concerns about the S 400 surface to air missile system with Cavusoglu in a meeting on Wednesday  the State Department said The leaders of the U S  House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee  who can block military sales to Turkey  also told him that the S 400 purchase could jeopardize Turkey s future in NATO and risked sanctions as well as Turkey s participation in the F 35 program NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg  in Washington for the 70th anniversary of the Western alliance and a meeting of its foreign ministers  told Reuters in an interview he had spoken several times with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan about the S 400 issue and had discussed it in a meeting with Trump on Tuesday Asked about Turkey s working group proposal  Stoltenberg said the S 400 issue had been considered many times at different NATO ministerial meetings  While it was not formally on the agenda in Washington  he expected it to be addressed  I expect that on the margins of our foreign ministerial meeting here in Washington this week  the S 400 issue will be discussed again  Not at the formal agenda  but on the margins when we have the ministers sitting down and looking into whether there s a way to find a way to find a compromise   Stoltenberg said In the meeting with his Turkish counterpart  Pompeo also called for the speedy resolution of cases involving detained U S  citizens including Serkan Golge  the State Department said   Reporting by Doina Chiacu and David Brunnstrom in Washington  Additional reporting by Sarah Dadouch in Istanbul and Patricia Zengerle in Washington  Editing by Grant McCool and James Dalgleish  

CHICAGO   Cook County State s Attorney Kim Foxx was elected in 2016 mainly because of anger that the prosecutor she ousted had waited a year to charge a Chicago police officer in the killing of black teenager Laquan McDonald  Then Foxx  who is a survivor of sexual assault as a child  grabbed national attention by charging singer R  Kelly with aggravated sexual abuse But in the course of just a few days  her reputation as rising political star and legal crusader was badly tarnished by her office s handling of two celebrity cases involving  Empire  actor Jussie Smollett and Kelly  The dismissal of all charges against Smollett enraged many  from President Donald Trump to Chicago s mayor and the city s police union  They accuse her of allowing Smollett to walk away from faking a hate crime attack and lying about it to police without so much as an apology or admission of guilt And adding to her woes  Kelly s attorney Steve Greenberg on Monday accused Foxx of caving in to pressure from celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti to charge Kelly  Avenatti  who is accused by federal prosecutors in a separate case of trying to shake down shoe company Nike  said he had provided Foxx with a video of Kelly having sex with a 14 year old girl David Erickson  a former state appellate judge who teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law  said you d have to go back 50 years to find a Chicago prosecutor so embroiled in controversy  Edward Hanrahan was charged with conspiracy in the deaths of two Black Panther members in a raid by agents from Hanrahan s office in 1969  He was acquitted  but ultimately ousted by voters  Looking back  that s the only thing that comes close to this   said Erickson  pointing out that Foxx s troubles may be far from over Retired Illinois Appellate Justice Sheila O Brien vowed on Monday  in an opinion piece posted on the Chicago Tribune s website  to file a petition to the courts asking that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate Foxx and her office  This is exhausting  but it has to be done   O Brien wrote Foxx declined to comment for this article  Her fate was literally debated in the streets of Chicago Monday at dueling protests   one organized by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson in support of Foxx and another by the police union where demonstrators chanted  Foxx must go  The praise she received for opening up about being raped as a small child  and then taking on R  Kelly   a Chicago native who had beaten child pornography charges in 2008   has been drowned out  Her office has been severely criticized by two major legal groups for what they called ethical lapses in the Smollett case Kelly s attorney on Monday asked a judge to order all of Foxx s communications with Avenatti preserved and suggested that Foxx fed clients to Avenatti  They got in bed with Avenatti and Avenatti is toxic   Kelly attorney Greenberg said in reference to Avenatti s cooperation with Foxx s office in the Kelly investigation Even Foxx s decision to recuse herself from the Smollett case is being questioned  Former judge O Brien said a special prosecutor should answer whether Foxx really stepped back from the Smollett case after she said she was removing herself because of communications with a relative of the actor  I can say without any reservation that her reputation has been damaged among people who work in the criminal justice system   said Terry Ekl  a local defense attorney How it plays out politically is anyone s guess  Voters may have to wait until next year s primary election to do anything about Foxx Dick Simpson  a University of Illinois at Chicago political scientist  said the only way he knows of to remove Foxx from office before an election would be to impeach her  But she hasn t done anything impeachable   he said  citing her recusal from the case

WASHINGTON   U S  senators from both parties on Tuesday asked Energy Secretary Rick Perry for details about recent approvals for companies to share nuclear energy information with Saudi Arabia  with the lawmakers expressing concern about possible development of atomic weapons Saudi Arabia has engaged in  many deeply troubling actions and statements that have provoked alarm in Congress   Senators Bob Menendez  a Democrat  and Marco Rubio  a Republican  told Perry in a letter  a copy of which was seen by Reuters  The senators said Congress was beginning to reevaluate the U S  Saudi relationship  and they believe Washington should not be providing nuclear technology or information to Saudi Arabia now The Trump administration has been quietly negotiating a deal that would potentially help Saudi Arabia build two reactors  Last week news reports revealed that since November 2017  Perry has authorized so called Part 810 approvals allowing U S  companies to share sensitive nuclear information with the kingdom  The approvals were kept from the public and from Congress  The senators asked Perry to provide them by April 10 with the names of the companies that got the 810 approvals  what was in the authorizations  and why the companies asked that the approvals be kept secret  U S  Representative Brad Sherman  a Democrat  also asked the Energy Department in a separate letter what was in the approvals  While 810 agreements are routine  the Obama administration made them available for the public to read at Energy Department headquarters  Lawmakers say the department is legally required to inform Congress about the approvals  Perry approved the seven recent authorizations as the administration has tried to hash out nonproliferation standards with Saudi Arabia  Such a pact  known as a 123 agreement  would have to be agreed before U S  companies can share physical exports of materials and equipment to build reactors  The kingdom has resisted standards on reprocessing spent fuel and enriching uranium  two potential paths to making nuclear weapons  The United States has been competing with South Korea  France  Russia and China on a potential deal to help build reactors in Saudi Arabia  The kingdom is expected to announce the winner this year  Lawmakers from both parties have been concerned about Saudi Arabia s bombing campaigns in Yemen  which is on the brink of famine  and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi  a U S  resident  last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul  Concern in Congress grew last year after the kingdom s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS that  Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb  but without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb  we will follow suit as soon as possible  Perry has said the 810 approvals were kept from the public for corporate proprietary reasons  He has also said that if Saudi Arabia relies on China or Russia for building nuclear reactors those two countries don t give a  tinker s damn  about non proliferation  Many non proliferation experts dispute the notion that a deal with China or Russia would be riskier  These people say the United States has many other levers it can pull to influence nuclear behavior At another Senate hearing  the five members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  including Chairman Kristine Svinicki  would not say whether the NRC raised any concerns over the 810 approvals in a required consultation with the Energy Department  Svinicki said the NRC s consulting role on the approvals is narrow and delegated to staff  Senator Chris Van Hollen  a Democrat who asked the question of the NRC at the hearing  told Reuters in an interview that the commissioners  lack of knowledge about the approvals was  stunning    It s kind of scary because we do rely on them to provide input into this process and not a single commissioner knew anything about what input they may or may not have provided    Reporting by Timothy Gardner  Editing by David Gregorio and James Dalgleish  

CAIRO   In his desire to wield sweeping power  President Abdel Fattah el Sisi of Egypt has suppressed politics  cowed the media and jailed legions of opponents Now he is extending his iron grip to a new corner of Egyptian society  the country s cherished soap operas Every year during the holy month of Ramadan  Egyptians crowd around their televisions to gorge on big budget mini series starring the country s top actors  including weepy melodramas  police procedurals and sweeping historical epics  The best are exported across the Middle East But the crop of shows currently in production for Ramadan are being subjected to suffocating controls  Mr  el Sisi s officials are dictating scripts and capping wages  directors and actors say  A military linked production company has taken charge of some of the biggest shows Filmmakers have been told their stories should follow approved themes  like praising the army and the police  or vilifying the banned Muslim Brotherhood  Those who don t play by the rules don t get on the air  For Sisi  this is not just about politics or power   said Ezzedine Choukri Fishere  a writer and former diplomat whose novels have been adopted into TV serials   He wants to re educate the Egyptian public  ImagePresident Abdel Fattah el Sisi  at an Arab summit meeting in Tunis on Sunday  is extending his grip to a new corner of Egyptian society  soap operas CreditZoubeir Souissi ReutersThe soap opera clampdown is the cultural edge of a far reaching and intrusive brand of authoritarianism that has taken root in Egypt under Mr  el Sisi  reaching new levels even for a country that has been governed by military backed strongmen for decades Hosni Mubarak  who governed for 30 years until his ouster in the 2011 Arab Spring  also presided over an oppressive  often cruel system  Even so  he allowed space for other centers of power  like his political party and the senior judiciary  which could result in surprising actions  Now and then  judges issued rulings that discomfited him  Newspapers could criticize him to a point  In 2005  the opposition Muslim Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in Parliament That space  limited as it was  has been virtually shut down under Mr  el Sisi  who came to power in a 2013 military takeover  He governs through a small clique of advisers  mostly drawn from the military  the security services and his family  that enjoys huge economic clout  sees the world through a security prism and has sought to stamp out every breath of dissent  Egyptians can be arrested for politically incorrect Facebook posts  I would frankly feel safer talking politics in Damascus than in Cairo   said Yezid Sayigh  a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut  Mr  el Sisi s personalist autocracy  he continued   tries to dominate the public space so completely that nobody dares say anything  even in private  that might be deemed dissent by those in power   That fear is what all totalitarian systems try to instill  that even when the system cannot eavesdrop on you  it can hear you  A government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Mr  el Sisi s approach has met with little resistance from President Trump  who is scheduled to host him at the White House next week  Where Washington once was a modest brake on the excesses of Egypt s strongmen  Mr  Trump has lavished praise on Mr  el Sisi in previous encounters   even complimenting his taste in footwear   but has said little about the tightening vise of repression in Egypt The United States has not had an ambassador in Cairo since July 2017 Mr  el Sisi s governing circle is dominated by military men he trusts  The army s Engineering Authority has been charged with overseeing ambitious projects worth billions of dollars  including an extension of the Suez Canal that was completed in 2015 and a new administrative capital that is under construction in the desert east of Cairo ImageThe set of the soap opera  Murafaa  in Cairo in 2013  The crop of shows currently in production are being subjected to suffocating controls CreditGianluigi Guercia Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMilitary courts operate with little public oversight  prosecuting actors and political opponents as well as terrorism suspects  Mr  el Sisi s intelligence agencies quietly manipulate the workings of Parliament  which is currently debating sweeping constitutional changes that would extend Mr  el Sisi s term until 2034 and could also bring the senior judiciary directly under his authority  a power Mr  Mubarak never had Television talk shows  once a ferment of raucous debate  have become so predictably pro government that many Egyptians are tuning out  The foreign ministry  once a bastion of Egypt s proud diplomatic tradition  is viewed as a much reduced force  Sisi is not Kim Jong Un or Saddam Hussein   said Amy Hawthorne of the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington   But he s inching Egypt toward that kind of regime  The hand of the security agencies also extends deep into the economy  often blurring the line between national security and commerce As the ride sharing company Uber has expanded in Egypt  it has faced government demands to provide access to personal information about its customers  In February  as the security agencies stepped up those demands  the Uber app started to crash in Egypt  said an official with knowledge of talks between Uber and the Egyptian government But it is in his pursuit of culture and the arts that Mr  el Sisi has really stood out Last month the celebrated author Alaa al Aswany  who wrote The Yacoubian Building  said a secret military court had prosecuted him for  inciting hatred against the regime    a prosecution all the more striking because Mr  al Aswany was once an avowed el Sisi supporter In January  Amr Waked  an actor who starred in the Hollywood movie  Syriana   said in a Twitter post that he had been sentenced to eight years in prison for criticizing Mr  el Sisi  Last week  the Egypt s Actors Union expelled Mr  Waked  who lives in Europe  and another prominent actor for  high treason  after they attended a congressional briefing in Washington that examined Mr  el Sisi s plans to amend the Constitution ImageAmr Waked  center  in a scene from the movie  Syriana   He said he had been sentenced to eight

positive principles  of older  state produced TV shows  and criticized recent productions  In the following years  state officials started to press filmmakers through both censorship and quiet pressure This season  though  the meddling has created an industry crisis  by several accounts With Ramadan just a month away  the number of mini series currently under production has been cut in half  to about 12 or 15  one director said The Egyptian Media Group  a company with links to the General Intelligence Service  has established the dominant TV production company and bought several of the biggest TV networks  according to Mada Masr  one of the last independent news outlets left in Egypt A senior director  speaking on the condition of anonymity  said scriptwriters were ordered this winter to follow certain guidelines  to glorify the military  to attack the Muslim Brotherhood and to promote conservative family values that encourage young Egyptians to obey their elders   and presumably avoid the kind of questioning that led to the 2011 Arab Spring  the director said The directive is a sign of another major difference between Mr  el Sisi and Mr  Mubarak  said Mr  Ezzidine  the analyst  who lives in the United States While Mr  Mubarak often seemed content to simply manage Egypt s dysfunction  Mr  Sisi appears intent on reshaping the country s moral and intellectual fiber  He has lectured citizens on their manners and their physical fitness  Now he wants to purge what he views as dangerous currents of thought Mr  el Sisi s defenders say Egypt needs a strong leader to protect the country from the chaos that has engulfed Libya  Syria and Yemen  and to enact long overdue yet unpopular  harsh economic reforms  like recent cuts to fuel and electricity subsidies  Egypt s stability has contributed to a 16 percent increase in tourism in the past year  and the energy sector is booming after major gas discoveries in the Mediterranean ImageEgypt s Parliament held hearings on proposed constitutional amendments last month  The changes would extend Mr  el Sisi s term until 2034 and bring the senior judiciary directly under his authority CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesEven so  many Egyptians are straining under the combination of austerity and repression  The day after a train barreled into Cairo s main station in February  killing at least 22 people  a man named Ahmed Mohy walked into the middle of Tahrir Square  scene of the 2011 protests  with a sign that read  Step down Sisi  Mr  Mohy  34  a pharmacist  was outraged by the train crash  which he saw as a sign of mismanagement of basic services  He hoped to attract more protesters  But he was arrested within minutes and bundled into a police van alongside a friend who had filmed his solo protest In the back of the van  Mr  Mohy recorded an impassioned  sometimes tearful video message that was posted on Facebook  He would probably be tortured for speaking out  he said  but he insisted it had been worth it  Maybe they will inject us  maybe they will kill us  maybe they will burn us   said Mr  Mohy  whose Facebook page is filled with his poetry   But we are facing our destiny as men  With tens of thousands of opponents already in jail  such acts of public resistance are rare  and Mr  el Sisi s authority faces few obvious challenges for now Mr  el Sisi s view is that his strength comes from divine providence In a 2013 interview  he told a journalist that a voice had come to him in a dream and said   We will grant you what no one has had before  But some analysts warn that  in seeking to exert such tight control over the Egyptian state and society  Mr  el Sisi might be sowing the seeds of his eventual undoing Presiding over such a top heavy system that has alienated so many sectors of society could leave Mr  el Sisi vulnerable on the day his system inevitably faces an unforeseen shock  said Mr  Sayigh  the senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center  Sisi and the army have painted themselves into a corner by destroying anyone they could talk to   Mr  Sayigh said   When the day comes where they need others in government or business  they may have nobody to support them

 Reuters    Amazon com Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will retain voting control of his entire  143 billion stake in the company under a divorce settlement with his wife  MacKenzie Bezos  who will own 25 percent of those shares  the couple said on Thursday  removing uncertainty over control of the online retailer The world s richest couple had announced their impending divorce in a joint Twitter statement in January  causing some to worry that Jeff Bezos could wind up with less Amazon voting power or that he or MacKenzie would liquidate large positions  Graphic  Amazon filing with U S  SEC   https   bit ly 2IaO24s  It takes the issue off the table  with less turbulence than you might have expected   said an investor  whose company owns several million dollars worth of Amazon shares but who asked for anonymity because of a firm policy  MacKenzie Bezos will wind up with a stake in Amazon that is worth roughly  36 billion  Her shares represent a 4 percent stake in Amazon  according to a regulatory filing by the company  The Amazon shares will make her the world s third richest woman while Jeff Bezos will remain the world s richest person  according to Forbes The couple  who tweeted separately on Thursday  disclosed that under their settlement MacKenzie will give up her interests in the Washington Post  which Jeff Bezos bought in 2013 and which has been a frequent target of criticism from U S  President Donald Trump  and the rocket company Blue Origin he founded in 2000   Grateful to have finished the process of dissolving my marriage with Jeff   MacKenzie Bezos said in her tweet outlining the agreement  the first and only post from an account created this month The two did not provide any further financial details about the settlement  INFLUENCE WOULD BE THE SAME Amazon  the world s biggest online retailer  said in the filing that 4 percent of its outstanding shares would be registered in MacKenzie Bezos  name after court approval of the divorce  which is expected to occur in about 90 days The petition for divorce was filed in Washington state  a person familiar with the matter said Jeff Bezos  whom Amazon listed in its most recent proxy statement as its single largest shareholder with a 16 3 percent stake  will keep sole voting authority over the shares unless MacKenzie donates them to a nonprofit or sells them in the open market Amazon shares closed down 0 1 percent at  1 818 86  Jeff Bezos  55  is seen as essential to Amazon s meteoric growth and stock price rise since he founded the company as an online bookseller in 1994  He has credited MacKenzie  48  for her support when he uprooted the young couple to Seattle from New York to launch Amazon  When I think about Amazon  and the influence Bezos has on Amazon  I would argue his influence would be the same if he had 51 percent shares outstanding or 1 percent  I think his influence is dictated by his vision for Amazon   D A  Davidson analyst Tom Forte said MacKenzie Bezos  stake in Amazon is worth more than the market values of nearly 70 percent of the components of the S P 500 The settlement suggests that Amazon will be spared the kind of boardroom battle that has plagued other companies whose owners are dealing with family rifts  even though the divorce had jolted the once private Bezos couple into the public spotlight Jeff Bezos re tweeted MacKenzie s statement and added in a separate post that he was grateful  for her support and for her kindness in this process  Liat Sadler  a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer  said the settlement should put investors at ease  They ve done a lot of work behind the scenes to make their breakup as amicable as it seems   she said  Still  Sadler added   Without knowing what cash she received  I have no idea how favorable it was to him or not  The day the couple announced their separation on Twitter  the National Enquirer promised to reveal an affair by Jeff Bezos that it claimed had ended their marriage  contrary to the couple s statement that they were on a  long period of loving exploration and trial separation  The U S  tabloid then published alleged photos and intimate text messages between Bezos and his new partner  former television news anchor Lauren Sanchez   Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru  Writing by Meredith Mazzilli  editing by Nick Zieminski  Bill Berkrot and Leslie Adler  

RAMALLAH  West Bank   Israel is holding an election on Tuesday  and Palestinian communities in the occupied territories are not following it with much interest  This is not because whoever is elected will not have a strong impact on our lives  It s because none of the leading candidates has a program for peace  The main contenders are committed to maintaining the illegal Jewish settlements that have been established in the West Bank  They do not seek to end the occupation  Israel has not formally annexed the West Bank or the Gaza Strip  but it lords over these lands like a sovereign power  Or worse  It has seized tax revenues from the Palestinian Authority  which is supposed to administer the West Bank  it keeps Gaza under siege  It dictates that we  Palestinians  can only watch from our homes the results of an election whose outcome will govern our lives and the future on our land  Israeli Jews in the West Bank are citizens  but we are not  They will be able to go into Israel to vote  Not us During the last Israeli election  in 2015  I wrote that Palestinians here had become less interested in the results of that race than in the prospect of filing various international legal cases  I  for one  had pinned my hopes on the preparation of several claims to be brought before the International Criminal Court in The Hague  One of them would challenge the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank  There was no lack of evidence  I thought  and the transfer of civilians by a government into territories it occupies is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 Now I think  Never mind the merits of any such cases  With the United States government threatening to refuse granting visas to the court s staff   this  in relation to another case  to do with suspected crimes in Afghanistan   our chances are slim  Last month  the Trump administration also recognized Israel s authority over the Golan Heights  disputed territory that Israel forcibly seized from Syria in 1967  This can only embolden Israel to eventually proceed with the formal annexation of the West Bank Israel  thanks partly to this support from the United States  now appears to be winning on all fronts  with impunity  And we Palestinians seem too weak to stop it Israelis  for their part  seem to live under the illusion popularized by their prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  that their government can manage the conflict   that there is no need to actually resolve it  Yet over the span of Mr  Netanyahu s premiership  the situation has gone from gloom to more gloom  from dark times to darker ones  from some measure of hope to despair Then again  at this point  maybe even darker would be better for us   maybe that s the only way out  My one consolation watching Israel pursue its current path is to think that it is doing itself damage  too Consider three examples Violence by Jewish settlers and right wing activists against Palestinians in the West Bank more than tripled last year  compared with 2017 An Israeli family built a home on land taken away from Palestinians   and then tried to rent it out on Airbnb  When the company balked  citing a new policy announced late last year against listing properties in settlements  the family brought a case for discrimination in the United States   The Palestinian family is suing back  Last week  a family near the village of Hizma  north of Jerusalem  whose house is in an Israeli settlement  chose to destroy its home of more than three decades rather than paying Israeli authorities to do the job  and being fined  Won t Israeli society at some point also feel the nefarious effects of its government s inhumanity toward us In Arundhati Roy s novel  The Ministry of Utmost Happiness   one of her characters  Musa  says that if Kashmiris have failed to gain independence from India  at least in struggling for it they have exposed the corruption of India s system  Musa tells the book s narrator  an Indian   You re not destroying us  You are constructing us  It s yourselves that you are destroying   Palestinians today might say the same of our struggle with Israel Raja Shehadeh is a lawyer and the author of  Where the Line Is Drawn  A Tale of Crossings  Friendships and Fifty Years of Occupation in Israel Palestine  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

ALBUQUERQUE   Mention the border with Mexico these days and dystopian images might come to mind  Agents detaining children in a holding pen  blimps hunting drones  the corpses of border crossers marking the frontier But even as President Trump presses ahead with his cry for a wall along the entire border   implying  yet again  that neighbors to the south threaten the richest and most powerful country on Earth   history offers other perspectives The photographer Tomas van Houtryve had in mind the nuanced past of what is now the American West when he set out on the border No  not the current

mythology  in which Hollywood nurtured the view that the expansion of the United States spread ideas like equality  liberty and democracy in conquered lands  In reality  these values arrived in the West straight from Mexico City   said Mr  van Houtryve  who was raised in California and now lives in Paris   The main ideological import of Anglo Americans to the West at the time was actually strident white supremacy  Before President James K  Polk prodded the two nations into war  Mexico was nearly twice as large and the border was some 700 miles north of where it is now  Mexico prohibited slavery  American slave owners wanted to expand the institution Then came the 1845 annexation of Texas  where American immigrants to what was then Mexico s state of Coahuila y Tejas had staged their slaveholder rebellion  The Texas Revolution s martyrs included men like the slave trader James W  Fannin A few years later  the United States orchestrated the war with Mexico that led to

have made its debut in Europe   Mr  van Houtryve traveled along Mexico s old northern border to meet families who have lived in the region for centuries His equipment in the Instagram age  A 19th century camera he found in a Paris antique shop  He stocked up on the glass plates and pungent potions needed for the wet collodion process  a technique invented in 1851 Doing so  Mr  van Houtryve conjures what the West may have looked like in the Mexican era in places such as Medicine Bow Peak  in Wyoming  and the Bonneville Salt Flats in northwest Utah Using 19th century technology requires meticulous planning  Instead of taking hundreds of digital photos in an hour  then sifting through the images  he takes about two in the same amount of time with the wooden camera  It puts your thoughts and intentions at the start of the process instead of the end   he said ImageIn 1540  Francisco Vasquez de Coronado and his expedition entered what is now the United States at this remote

display at the Photography Show presented by Aipad in New York from April 3 to April 7  and a monograph is scheduled to be published by Radius Books  this fall  Mr  van Houtryve also photographed people like Susan Calderon Belman  a descendant of Luis Manuel Quintero  a black man who was one of the original pioneers of what is now California As Mr  van Houtryve reminds us  most of the original colonists who founded El Pueblo de Nuestra Seora la Reina de los Angles in 1781 had varying degrees of African ancestry  though public recognition of the city s Afro Mexican origins remains sparse Mr  van Houtryve  who previously photographed countries where communism endures in the 21st century  like Nepal and North Korea  said he embarked on this project after the 2016 election in the United States was marked by resurgent bigotry  With his pictures  he homes in on the historical amnesia that envelops not just the Mexican American War but so much else of America s past  effectively enabling our new era of intolerance This practice of remembering reminds us of the Americans whose ancestors never crossed the border with Mexico  It crossed them ImageNathan Alexander Steiner  left

The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau  Sign up to get it by email    Australians will go to the polls next month to elect a new government  and because elections take place as soon as 33 days after they re officially called  the country s politicians will have to move quickly to solidify votes Whoever takes the helm will have to contend with a set of challenges that mirror those of other democracies around the world Here s a look at some of the key domestic and international issues that we ll be watching and that Australia s leaders will be confronting Election MeddlingIn February  Australia became the latest Western nation whose institutions had most likely been tampered with after the government acknowledged that Parliament s computer network had been hacked by a foreign government No country has been named as being behind the cyberattack  but security experts say China  Russia  and possibly Iran and North Korea are among the suspects Officials said the three major political parties were among those affected  but wouldn t say to what extent  because they hadn t seen anything like this breach before  Even as he said a  sophisticated state actor  was behind the attack  Prime Minister Scott Morrison insisted there was  no evidence of any electoral interference  Australian elections are quick  they are compulsory and the majority of voters will cast their ballots on paper  However  during the last federal election  some areas used electronic lists to check voters  names off electoral rolls  It s not yet known if those electronic lists will be used in light of the recent hack ChinaThe Australia that will go to the polls in May is markedly different to the one that voted in 2016  particularly when it comes to China  Then  the Australian economy was on fire  Chinese investment had surged to a new high  and while the government blocked some Chinese bids for infrastructure projects  it was a record setting year for deals with Chinese companies For years  the Australian government had been able to successfully navigate its economic ties with its largest trading partner  China  and its strategic relationship with its greatest ally  the United States  without having to compromise on either But a slew of events have redefined Canberra s relationship with Beijing  In 2017  a prominent Australian senator  Sam Dastyari  resigned over accusations of lobbying for Beijing and taking money from Chinese born political donors  The government passed a foreign interference law  requiring lobbyists for other countries to register and disclose their activities   one of many efforts to push the Chinese government s soft power campaign out of the shadows And in August  Australia banned Huawei  the Chinese technology giant  from participating in the building of a fifth generation telecommunications network Politicians have been reluctant to explicitly discuss the China challenge up till now  but pressure will continue to build no matter who wins the election The EnvironmentIt was ostensibly energy policy that led to Malcolm Turnbull becoming the third prime minister in 10 years to lose the job   a dispute about addressing climate change prompted the change But the public is far less divided  A recent poll found that 59 percent of Australians are concerned about climate change and frustrated at the lack of initiative from Canberra to address it Several independent candidates are running in key electorates   including the former head of a clean energy corporation who is campaigning for the seat won last time by Josh Frydenberg  the treasurer Even so  the two main political parties have staked out vastly different positions on climate change  The Labor Party has said that there will be no new coal powered plants if it wins  but the Coalition has not ruled them out  Labor also supports a 45 percent emissions target by 2030  while the Liberal Party said that it is committed to 26 percent by 2030  Labor has also promised rebates for households installing solar batteries and wants 50 percent of new car sales to be electric vehicles by 2030 Mr  Morrison says he will spend billions of dollars on a hydroelectricity project to help alleviate rising power bills and offset carbon emissions  He has criticized the opposition s policies  arguing that higher emissions targets would  crash the economy  ImmigrationAs President Trump calls for funding to build a wall on the Mexico border  Mr  Morrison continues to boast of his role in stopping boats full of asylum seekers heading to Australia  and now wants to limit the number of skilled migrants who come to the country legally each year The move to reduce the current cap on immigration by nearly 30 000 people is seen as a step back by many  The country has relied on immigrant labor to fuel its economic boom as its population has grown to 25 million  The move also represents a reversal for Mr  Morrison  who pushed back against cutting the cap before he became prime minister The Labor Party  on the other hand  wants to increase the annual refugee intake from 16 250 to 27 000 by 2025 and said it would stick to the current migration cap should it win But the issue of immigration has created a heated debate in Australia  as voters and politicians ask  How much of the opposition to immigration comes from concerns over strained infrastructure in cities  and how much comes from racism  Islamophobia and fear A senator recently made global headlines when he blamed Muslim immigration for the mass shooting in

party officials Steve Dickson  left  and James Ashby tried last Tuesday to explain comments recorded by a reporter undercover for Al Jazeera CreditDave Hunt EPA  via ShutterstockMany of you weighed in on our examination last week of Al Jazeera s undercover investigation on the National Rifle Association and whether it was ethical  Thanks to all who wrote in or shared in our Facebook group  Here s a few of your responses  I am all for journalists using deception if it is the only way to expose something as serious as the activities of the gun lobby and One Nation  We heard them say to put nothing in a recordable form that can be investigated in any accepted way  including by law enforcement  so if they are being so deceptive  deceptive journalism is the only way to find the truth     Helen O Dea One assumes that the job of journalists is to uncover the truth  If you ask people  particularly One Nation people  questions  they will lie to you  This method worked a lot better as a means to expose what One Nation really stand for  I like it  Would I like it if some of my political allies were shown up as a bit grubby  Well not as much  but its still a legitimate technique     John Brookes Your ethics guide is right  The last thing you want is to be accused of deception in pursuit of a story as that diminishes the validity of said story  The issue of what  and who makes the determination  is in the public interest is equally as important  The case of the N R A  and One Nation is a clear cut case of foreign intervention in our democratic process  That is a concern and definitely in the public interest  But there are cases  no doubt  that are less clear  which begs the question  how does the NYT decide what is in the public interest  Sticky area     Ian Baxter

BERLIN   Swastikas daubed on a Jewish cemetery in France  An anti Semitic political campaign by Hungary s far right government  Labour lawmakers in Britain quitting their party and citing ingrained anti Semitism  A Belgian carnival float caricaturing Orthodox Jews sitting on bags of money And that was just the past few months The accumulated incidents in Europe and the United States have highlighted how an ancient prejudice is surging in the 21st century in both familiar and mutant ways  fusing ideologies that otherwise would have little overlap The spike is taking place in a context of rising global economic uncertainty  an emphasis on race and national identity  and a deepening polarization between the political left and right in Europe and the United States over the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians  There s an ideological pattern that is common   said Gnther Jikeli  an expert on European anti Semitism at Indiana University   The world is seen as in a bad shape  and what hinders it becoming a better place are the Jews  Anti Semitism has become a section of today s political Venn diagram where the far right can intersect with parts of the far left  Europe s radical Islamist fringe  and even politicians from America s two main parties That confluence is new  experts say  as is the emergence of an Israeli government that has sidled up to far right allies who praise Israel even as they peddle anti Semitic prejudice at home  It creates a landscape that is very confusing and where things are more blurry than in the past   said Samuel Ghiles Meilhac  an expert on Jewish history at the Institut d Histoire du Temps Prsent  a government funded research group in France Polling suggests that anti Semitic attitudes may be no more widespread than in the past  particularly in Western Europe  where Holocaust remembrance has become a ritual for most governments Despite this  bigots have seemingly become more brazen  creating a climate that has made anti Semitism far more permissible and dangerous In recent decades  Western anti Semitism has tended to trace the contours of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  spiking and ebbing in correlation with spasms of violence between the two sides  But since the 2014 war in Gaza  researchers say  anti Semitic incidents have remained at high levels  And that s kind of worrying because it means it has become normal to act in anti Semitic ways   Mr  Jikeli said ImageHungary s far right government regularly invokes George Soros  the billionaire philanthropist with Hungarian Jewish roots  as a threat  as it did in this campaign poster in Budapest last year CreditAkos Stiller for The New York TimesThose include acts of violence  In 2018  France reported a 74 percent spike over the previous year in anti Semitic incidents  with more than 500 incidents  including the murder of a Holocaust survivor in her own home  President Emmanuel Macron called it the worst level of anti Semitism since World War II In Germany over the same period  violent anti Semitic attacks   62 of them   rose by 60 percent  while all anti Semitic crimes rose almost 10 percent to 1 646  according to government statistics Around Europe  where the popularity of the far right has been boosted by economic uncertainty and fears over migration  almost 90 percent of Jews believe that anti Semitism has increased in their country in the last five years  according to surveys by the European Union For decades after World War II and the Holocaust  anti Semitism was mostly consigned to the political fringes  which is no longer the case  It is now more widely harnessed for political ends  experts say  Today  mainstream European and North American politicians  even presidents  premiers and prime ministers  don t hesitate to flirt with or embrace overtly anti Semitic messages and memes   said David Nirenberg  dean of the Divinity School at the University of Chicago and an expert on Jewish history  This electoral utility of anti Semitism feels new to me  newly flexible  and therefore newly dangerous   Mr  Nirenberg added Far right parties often portray Jews as a cosmopolitan threat to national identity  especially in regions where the stereotype has been used historically  In Hungary  Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been able to present the Jewish billionaire George Soros as a secret instigator of Muslim immigration In Poland last month  a far right newspaper sold inside the Parliament ran a front page headline saying  How to spot a Jew   alongside a condemnation of a historian who researches Polish complicity in the Holocaust On the far left  some politicians have associated Jews with the failings of capitalism and conspiracies about supposed control over the global economy  Those complaints are now heard on the fringes of the Yellow Vest movement in France President Trump himself embodies the contradictions of the moment  Mr  Trump has openly courted white nationalists  saying they include  some very fine people   even as they marched in the style of the Ku Klux Klan  gave stiff armed Nazi salutes and chanted slogans like  Jews will not replace us  During his campaign  he attacked Hillary Clinton with a Twitter post that included her image  a Jewish star  and a pile of money ImageMembers of the Alt Right led a torch march in Charlottesville  Va   in 2017 CreditEdu Bayer for The New York TimesAt the same time  the president has boasted close relations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and offered full throated support to Israel  including moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem  even absent progress toward a settlement with the Palestinians That more strident support has now been greeted with more strident opposition  most obviously from Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota  one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress She has been widely condemned for what critics called her peddling of anti Semitic stereotypes   for which she publicly apologized  Ms  Omar also was criticized for what was widely interpreted as questioning American Jews  allegiance to the United States  and for remarks that some construed as referring to the undue influence of Jewish lobbies  interpretations she denies The use of similar tropes by members of the Labour Party in Britain has prompted several Labour lawmakers to resign in protest  They are also common talking points in extremist Islamist circles  When French Muslims attack Jews in Paris or Marseille   said Mr  Nirenberg  of the University of Chicago   it is because Islamist discourse has taught them to understand not only the situation of Palestinians  but also the global status of Islam and even their own poverty and marginalization in France  as in some way caused by Zionists and Jews  But data  particularly from Germany  suggests that most contemporary anti Semitism is nevertheless primarily still perpetrated by the white  far right  who are often also virulently anti Muslim  It cheapens the very right struggle against anti Semitism for Islamophobic bigots to weaponize it in their campaigns   said H A  Hellyer  a nonresident expert on Islam and the Middle East at the Atlantic Council  a research group  One needn t agree with Congresswoman Ilhan Omar to recognize that she is being targeted primarily as a black  Muslim  hijab wearing woman  and by many people whose records on combating bigotry and discrimination  or calling it out in their own ranks  are abysmal   Dr  Hellyer added It is unsurprising to find a resurgence of anti Semitism at a time of prolonged political and economic instability  historians and analysts say  when citizens from many different political and cultural traditions are grasping for easy explanations for sudden and complex injustices Just as Jews were a ready made scapegoat during previous eras of anxiety about the pace of social change or global economic trauma  so are they again today  said Stefanie Schler Springorum  the head of the Center for anti Semitism Research in Berlin ImageA demonstration organized by the Campaign Against Anti Semitism outside the head office of the British opposition Labour Party in London last year CreditTolga Akmen Agence France Presse   Getty Images Globalization and especially the crisis of 2008 have strengthened a feeling of being at the mercy of mechanisms that we do not understand  let alone control   Ms  Schler Springorum said   From there it is only a small step to classical conspiracy theories  which have always formed the core of anti Semitism  That step is even smaller in the social media age  Rumor and conspiracy theories have always played a role in stoking anti Semitism  Today  the speed at which lies can spread  because of the internet  is without precedent The increasingly hard right Israeli government led by Mr  Netanyahu is a point of divergence for the different strands of contemporary anti Semitism Far right political figures like Mr  Orban have drawn close to Israel  while leftist anti Semites revile it  But both do so for the same reason  They perceive Israel as a country that has done its best to preserve its ethnic and religious character at the expense of a Muslim minority The main difference is that Mr  Orban  the prime minister of another small country fighting to preserve its ethnic identity  sees this as a virtue  whereas leftist critics of Israel  such as the supporters of the British Labour leader  Jeremy Corbyn  largely do not Both left and right  have the same image of Israel   said David Hirsh  a sociologist at Goldsmiths College  University of London  and a critic of Mr  Corbyn who campaigns against the academic boycott of Israel  Corbyn says that Israel is a uniquely belligerent human rights abusing state that defends its purity at all costs against Muslims   he said   And I suspect that people on the far right have exactly the same picture of Israel   that it is a belligerent country that defends itself against Muslims  For critics of Mr  Netanyahu  this also explains why the leader of the world s only Jewish state might find common cause with a far right leader like Mr  Orban  despite the latter s anti Semitic leanings ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  shown with the Hungarian leader  Viktor Orban  has sidled up to far right governments who support Israel even as they peddle anti Semitic prejudice at home CreditBalazs Mohai EPA  via ShutterstockMr  Netanyahu and Mr  Orban share an approach to domestic politics  an antipathy for liberal voices  a discomfort with Muslim minorities and a willingness to work with the far right Like Mr  Orban in Hungary  Mr  Netanyahu has introduced legislation that targets civil society organizations that receive significant funding from overseas  His government has forbidden non Jews to exercise the right to self determination  and removed Arabic as an official Israeli language Recently  Mr  Netanyahu engineered an electoral pact with a racist party from the far right fringe who could help him retain power in a general election later this year  I don t believe that Netanyahu really wants a State of Israel with no Arabs  but I believe he does want a State of Israel where the position of Jews is so dominant and secure that it would never have to consider having to be a Western style liberal democracy without an ethno religious character   said Derek Penslar  a professor of Jewish history at Harvard University  There is an aspiration for ethnocracy   added Mr  Penslar   It doesn t mean there are no other ethnic groups   but only one group truly rules  And though the relationship between Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Orban may trouble some in the Jewish diaspora  it may not be so troubling for Israelis themselves  said Yossi Shain  a professor of political science at Tel Aviv University Mr  Orban supports Israel s right to exist  whereas his critics are perceived by some Israelis  to demean Israel s nationalism and right to exist   said Mr  Shain  the author of a forthcoming book addressing the subject  And for Israelis  that is the core of anti Semitism in the modern era

Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio  a Democrat from one of the nation s most coveted swing states  announced his candidacy for president on Thursday  bringing the Democratic primary field to 17 Mr  Ryan  who represents a district in northeastern Ohio that includes Youngstown and part of Akron  is perhaps best known at the national level for his criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  and his accompanying argument that Democrats have stopped connecting with working class voters  especially in the Midwest  He challenged Ms  Pelosi for the minority leader position in 2016 and  two years later  was again a leader of a push to elect someone else He began his presidential campaign with a TV appearance Thursday morning on  The View   in which he emphasized jobs and the economy   I m a progressive who knows how to talk to working class people   he said   At the end of the day  the progressive agenda is what s best for working families   Here s where Mr  Ryan stands on the issues  In an interview with The New York Times a few hours later  Mr  Ryan argued that he was better positioned than any other candidate to address  economic disorientation  in places like Youngstown and Akron  He spoke in particular about the potential of electric vehicles and other renewable energy industries to create jobs for people displaced by the decline in manufacturing  I want a businessperson in Michigan to say   I think Tim Ryan really understands what we need to do around electric vehicles    he said   and I want a worker in Michigan going   Yeah  we just lost our job  Let s make electric  That seems like it s the future   It was the sort of message   progressive populism to challenge right wing  Trumpist populism   that some voters had expected to hear from one of Mr  Ryan s fellow Ohioans  Senator Sherrod Brown  who flirted with the idea of a presidential campaign before deciding last month not to run  Who s in  Who s out  Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker  Over his 16 years in the House  Mr  Ryan has also shifted to the left on some of the country s most contentious issues For much of his career  he opposed abortion  citing his Catholic faith  But in 2015  he wrote an op ed for The Akron Beacon Journal in which he said that after speaking with women about their reasons for choosing to have abortions  he had  come to believe that we must trust women and families   not politicians   to make the best decision for their lives  He made a similar reversal on gun policy after the Las Vegas mass shooting in 2017  breaking publicly from the National Rifle Association   which had previously given him A ratings   and announcing that he would take the roughly  20 000 he had received from its political action committee and donate it to organizations seeking stricter gun laws  That was the culmination of a shift in thinking that began after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting five years earlier  he said Thursday He is also a co sponsor of Representative Pramila Jayapal s Medicare for All bill  The Republican National Committee highlighted that support in its response to Mr  Ryan s announcement  calling him one more addition  to the long list of liberal candidates demanding government run health care  Mr  Ryan s path to the nomination is steep  and not just because the field is so crowded  The last   and only   sitting House member to be elected president was James Garfield in 1880 But Mr  Ryan believes there is an opening in the race for a Midwesterner who can focus on winning back the voters who flipped to President Trump in 2016  turning states like Michigan and Wisconsin red for the first time in about three decades  Of the 17 Democratic candidates  only three   Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend  Ind   and Mr  Ryan   are from the Midwest  Who can win western PA   he said   Who can win Ohio  Who can win Michigan  Wisconsin  I think I ll be as well if not better positioned than anybody else to be able to win those states   I think somebody from the Midwest could be a healing candidate in the sense that we re so divided   he added   You can have a great 10 point plan  but if we don t figure out how to come together  then we re not going anywhere  On  The View   Mr  Ryan said his daughter had called him one day  crying  to tell him her friend was going to have to move because a local General Motors plant had closed  My daughter called me and said   You ve got to do something    Mr  Ryan recalled   And I said   I m going to do something  I m going to run for president of the United States    

WASHINGTON   U S  services sector activity hit a more than 19 month low in March and private payrolls grew less than expected  underscoring a loss of momentum in the economy that supports the Federal Reserve s move to suspend interest rate hikes this year The reports on Wednesday came on the heels of some modestly upbeat data earlier in the week  including retail and motor vehicle sales and manufacturing  Investors are worried about a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter  The Fed last month ended its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy  dropping projections for any interest rate increases this year  The U S  central bank lifted borrowing costs four times in 2018  The yin and yang of the numbers makes it clear that the year of tax induced solid growth is over   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania   But growth is still decent  The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  said its non manufacturing activity index fell 3 6 percentage points to 56 1  the lowest since August 2017  A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity Last month s sharp slowdown in services industry activity reflected a 7 3 points drop in the production subindex  Activity was also weighed down by decreases in new and export orders measures  A gauge of service sector employment rose  But many industries continued to believe that their inventories were too high  a potential hurdle for increased production The ISM said while businesses in the services sector remained mostly optimistic about overall business conditions and the economy   they still have underlying concerns about employment resources and capacity constraints  It said 16 industries  including utilities  real estate  finance and insurance  healthcare and social assistance  information  and professional  scientific and technical services reported growth last month  The two industries reporting contraction were education services and retail trade WORKER SCARCITYBusinesses in the accommodation and food services industry complained that  labor is tight and in short supply   Similar complaints were also voiced by businesses in the transportation and public administration sectors  Miners said activity  held flat   while businesses in the professional  scientific and technical services reported that an  initial surge in business at the beginning of the year has peaked and settled to a more stable level  The economy is losing speed as stimulus from the Trump administration s  1 5 trillion in tax cuts diminishes  It is also facing headwinds from slowing global growth  Washington s trade war with China and uncertainty over Britain s exit from the European Union Growth estimates for the first quarter range from as low as a 1 4 percent annualized rate to as high as a 2 1 percent pace  The economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the fourth quarter  For the most part  GDP source reports have firmed lately following some very weak readings around the turn of the year   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan in New York   The timelier survey data signal that the recent firming may be temporary  The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies  U S  Treasury prices fell  while stocks on Wall Street rose The shortage of workers could be curbing job growth  The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private employers added 129 000 jobs in March  the fewest since September 2017  after creating 197 000 positions in February The ADP figures came ahead of the Labor Department s more comprehensive non farm payrolls report on Friday  which includes both public  and private sector employment The ADP report  which is jointly developed with Moody s Analytics  has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government s employment report  But job growth has slowed from last year s 223 000 monthly average pace Economists polled by Reuters are looking for private payroll employment to have grown by 170 000 jobs in March  up from 25 000 the month before  Total non farm employment is expected to have increased by 180 000 jobs after a paltry 20 000 gain in February  There is sure to be a bounce back in the official data given how weak February was  the only question is how big it will be   said Paul Ashworth  chief U S  economist at Capital Economics in Toronto  According to the ADP report  employment in the goods producing sector fell by 6 000 jobs in March  with manufacturing payrolls shrinking 2 000 and construction shedding 6 000 positions  The services sector added 135 000 jobs last month  concentrated in professional and education and health services   Reporting By Lucia Mutikani  Additional reporting by Dan Burns in New York  Editing by Bernadette Baum and Andrea Ricci  

LONDON   Royal Dutch Shell Plc on Tuesday became the first major oil and gas company to announce plans to leave a leading U S  refining lobby due to disagreement on climate policies  citing its support for the goals of the Paris climate agreement In its first review of its association with 19 key industry groups  Shell said it had found  material misalignment  over climate policy with the American Fuel   Petrochemical Manufacturers  AFPM  and would quit the body in 2020 The review is part of Shell s drive to increase transparency and show investors it is in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement s goals to limit global warming by reducing carbon emissions to a net zero by the end of the century It is the latest sign of how investor pressure on oil companies  particularly in Europe  is leading to changes in their behavior around climate  Last year  Shell caved in to investor pressure over climate change  setting out plans to introduce industry leading carbon emissions targets linked to executive pay Its chief executive  Ben van Beurden  has since repeatedly urged oil and gas producers to take action over climate and pollution  staking out a more radical position than the heads of other major oil companies   AFPM has not stated support for the goal of the Paris Agreement  Shell supports the goal of the Paris Agreement   the Anglo Dutch company said in its decision  The need for urgent action in response to climate change has become ever more obvious since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015  As a result  society s expectations in this area have changed  and Shell s views have also evolved   van Beurden said in the report The company has disagreed with AFPM on a number of issues for some time  according to two lobbying sources  Shell said it also disagreed with AFPM s opposition to a price on carbon and action on low carbon technologies  Shell and AFPM have also been at odds in recent months over regulation over the use of renewable fuels  While Shell and other large refiners invested in cleaner fuel technology  AFPM has fought hard against standards requiring refiners to blend or subsidize the blending of biofuels into the gasoline pool   saying it hurts independent refiners Shell and rivals Exxon and BP have in recent years left the American Legislative Exchange Council  a conservative political group  over its stance on climate change  AFPM Chief Executive Chet Thompson thanked Shell for its  longstanding collaboration   We will also continue working on behalf of the refining and petrochemical industries to advance policies that ensure reliable and affordable access to fuels and petrochemicals  while being responsible stewards of the environment   Thompson said in a statement  AFPM counts around 300 U S  and international members including Exxon Mobil Corp  Chevron Corp  BP Plc and Total SA that operate 110 refineries and 229 petrochemical plants  according to its 2018 annual report French oil major Total said in a statement to Reuters that consensus required by organizations such as AFPM does not always reflect its position  and that it regularly monitors the relevance of its participation  In this case  Total takes a pro active approach in order to convince its peers  particularly on climate issues  In case of differing points of view  Total publicly defends its position  and is ready to reconsider its participation in case of disagreement   the company said Total said it was fully aware of climate issues  has publicly recognized them and takes them into its strategy  Shell s review was welcomed by Adam Matthews  director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board  which invests in Shell and led discussions with the company over its climate policy  This is an industry first   Matthews said   With this review Shell have set the benchmark for best practice on corporate climate lobbying not just within oil and gas but across all industries  The challenge now is for others to follow suit  WALK AWAYShell also found  some  misalignment with nine other trade associations  including the American Petroleum Institute  the oil and gas industry s main lobby  Shell said that while it had some climate related differences with the API  it welcomed the lobby s advocacy on a range of state and federal issues such as trade and transport  as well as the API s efforts to reduce methane emissions Shell said it will continue to engage with the API and other groups over climate policies and monitor their alignment Shell last month urged President Donald Trump s administration to tighten restrictions on emissions of methane  a potent greenhouse gas  instead of weakening them as planned   Reporting by Ron Bousso  Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in New York and Bate Felix in Paris  Editing by Louise Heavens  Emelia Sithole Matarise  Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler  

CANBERRA  Australia   The Australian government unveiled a plan on Tuesday to balance the national budget next year and pay off all debt in a decade as it prepares for a general election next month Treasurer Josh Frydenberg outlined a strategy to deliver a 7 1 billion Australian dollar   5 billion  surplus in the fiscal year starting July 1   Australia s first surplus budget in 12 years   while promising tax cuts and cash handouts for most Australians Prime Minister Scott Morrison hopes the budget will be positively received by voters whom he will ask to re elect his conservative coalition for a third three year term  Morrison is expected to announce within days that an election will he held on May 11 or May 18 The government expects surpluses to grow annually to AU 17 8 billion in 2021 22 before slipping to AU 9 2 billion the following year as tax cuts take effect on government revenues Net debt would peak at AU 373 billion in the current fiscal year   at 19 2 percent of GDP   and be paid off by 2029 30 Frydenberg described proposed income tax cuts as the largest since Australia s mining boom years before the global financial crisis in 2008 The cuts  which include lowering the 32 5  tax rate to 30  from July 2024  are forecast to cost the nation s coffers AU 158 billion in tax revenue by 2030 The budget strategy has to be endorsed by Parliament to become law But the government does not propose to get much of its economic blueprint through Parliament before the next election  which opinion polls suggest the center left opposition Labor Party is likely to win Frydenberg said he will try to pass legislation this week that would give AU 284 million to pensioners in one off payments by July to help pay soaring energy bills He said voters must decide at the election between the low taxing conservatives and high taxing and high spending Labor  There s a clear contest in this election between one side of politics which wants to reduce taxes and the Labor Party which will try and increase taxes   Frydenberg said Opposition treasury spokesman Chris Bowen said Labor would go to the May election promising bigger surpluses than the ruling coalition  Based on the figures we ve seen tonight  we would have a better bottom line     paid for by a whole range of policies   Bowen told Sky News TV Annual GDP growth is forecast to accelerate from 2 25  in the current fiscal year to 2 75  for the next two years  The jobless rate is expected to remain unchanged at around 5  The Australian economy is vulnerable to commodity swings that the Treasury Department regards as particularly volatile at the moment Exports are forecast to grow by 4  in the next fiscal year  supported by major liquefied natural gas projects ramping up production  Australia recently overtook Qatar as the world s biggest LNG exporter But prices of Australia s most lucrative exports   coal and iron ore   are forecast to decline next year A dam collapse at a Brazilian iron ore mine in January that killed more than 110 people elevated prices of Australian iron ore in the current fiscal year  But the price will settle as supply issues are addressed  Treasury said Australian coal shipments have also been held up at Chinese ports with conflicting reports of Chinese policy changes  There is greater uncertainty than usual around commodity prices as a result of heightened price volatility and policies in China and Brazil   a Treasury document said Frydenberg said one of the government s  chief concerns  is a forecast downturn in the Australian housing market next year  Housing prices are falling in Australia s largest cities  Sydney and Melbourne  where construction has slowed Frydenberg said the downturn would be worse if a Labor government is elected and implements its promised reduction of tax breaks for landlords The budget continues the government s policy of increasing defense spending to 2  of GDP by 2020 21  with AU 38 7 billion allocated next year  President Donald Trump has called on U S  allies to raise their defense spending to that level A AU 2 billion fund to invest in infrastructure construction among Australia s Pacific island neighbors will become operation on July 1  The fund offers an alternative to growing Chinese investment in the Pacific A conservative Australian government delivered annual surplus budgets for a decade before the global financial crisis struck during a Labor government s first year in office  Labor ran up debt through stimulus spending and avoided a recession  But Labor s failure to curb debt during six years in office damaged the party s economic credentials If opinion polls are correct and Labor wins the next election  Morrison would become the sixth Australian prime minister since 2007 to fail to last an entire three year term Labor has said if it wins the election  it will outline its own economic blueprint before September  

MADISON  Wis    Wisconsin s high stakes Supreme Court race was too close to call and appeared headed for a recount Tuesday With the unofficial vote at 99   conservative candidate Brian Hagedorn held a lead of about 1 600 votes over his liberal backed challenger Lisa Neubauer  The margin was about 0 14 percentage point out of nearly 1 2 million votes cast  close enough for Neubauer to request a recount paid for by taxpayers The Associated Press did not declare a winner  noting that the race was within the 1 percentage point margin for a recount The last recount in a Wisconsin Supreme Court election was in 2011  This race is too close to call   Neubauer campaign manager Tyler Hendricks said in a statement   We are almost assuredly headed to a recount  We are going to make sure every vote is counted  Wisconsinites deserve to know we have had a fair election and that every vote is counted  Conservatives have been in the majority since 2008  currently with a 4 3 split  Their majority would increase to 5 2 if Hagedorn defeats Neubauer  A win by Neubauer would give liberals a chance to take control in 2020 The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been the final word in some of the most partisan battles in the state over the past decade  It has upheld several polarizing laws passed by the Republican controlled Legislature  none more so than GOP former Gov  Scott Walker s law that essentially eliminated collective bargaining for public workers Now with Democratic Gov  Tony Evers often at odds with the Republican controlled Legislature  the Supreme Court s role could be even more crucial in settling disputes  Already  cases fighting laws passed by Republicans during a December lame duck legislative session appear headed to the court Tuesday s outcome will also be read for clues to the 2020 election cycle  with Wisconsin seen as a critical battleground for presidential hopeful  Expected low turnout could make that difficult  Past Supreme Court races in non presidential years has generally been around 20  Both Neubauer and Hagedorn are appeals court judges and insist their personal views would not affect how they would rule on the Supreme Court There has been no public polling in the race  but Neubauer raised more money than Hagedorn    1 7 million to  1 3 million Hagedorn  41  served as a law clerk for conservative state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman  Hageman served as an assistant attorney general  worked in private practice and was Walker s chief legal counsel for nearly five years  Walker appointed him to the state appeals court in 2015  and Hagedorn won election two years later Madison resident Lana Nenide  a 43 year year nonprofit director  said she voted for Neubauer   I want a Democratic woman representing my rights  I don t want Scott Walker s puppet   she explained Kathy Halverson  a 50 year old Republican from Franklin  said she voted for Hagedorn because  he has morals   He will judge according to the law and I just really like his stance on the topics   abortion  I think he s fair and he s going to be an asset to the Supreme Court   she said   Hopefully he will get in  Hagedorn  an evangelical Christian  spent much of the race defending his conservative beliefs  Opponents have pointed to a blog he wrote as a law school student in the mid 2000s in which he called Planned Parenthood a  wicked organization  and denounced court rulings favoring gay rights by likening homosexuality to bestiality  They have also pointed to his founding of a conservative private school that allows for expelling students who are gay  Hagedorn was also paid  3 000 to give speeches at meetings of the Alliance Defending Freedom  a group that supported criminalizing sodomy and sterilizing transgender people Neubauer  61  was appointed to the appeals court in 2007 by former Democratic Gov  Jim Doyle  Neubauer was elected to the appeals court in 2008  re elected in 2014 and has been chief judge since 2015  She spent almost 20 years as an attorney in private practice Judy Johnson  76  an independent voter from Franklin  said her vote for Neubauer reflected her dislike of President Donald Trump  Johnson said she believes Neubauer  will vote for the people   rather than supporters of the president Nearly every judge who has endorsed a candidate in the race   more than 340  or 98    backs Neubauer  Hagedorn has endorsements from the National Rifle Association and Wisconsin Right to Life The winner will serve a 10 year term and replace retiring liberal Justice Shirley Abrahamson  who is 85       Associated Press writer Ivan Moreno contributed to this report from Franklin  Wisconsin

WASHINGTON   The House on Thursday rebuffed a furious lobbying campaign by the National Rifle Association and approved a revamped Violence Against Women Act that would expand law enforcement s ability to restrict gun purchases by convicted domestic abusers The legislation passed easily  263 to 158  but the divided vote came on what was once a broadly bipartisan measure first passed in 1994  In recent years  partisan rancor over efforts to expand the protections of the legislation have clouded efforts to renew it  and this year  the divide was over gun control The provisions would close the so called boyfriend loophole and bar those under a restraining order or who were convicted of abusing  assaulting or stalking a domestic partner from buying guns  The N R A  seized on the new measures and warned Congress that it would track and publish how lawmakers voted  hoping to intimidate Republicans and Democrats in Republican leaning districts  Do not let the N R A  bully you   Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  urged her colleagues before the vote  noting that her recently deceased husband  former Representative John Dingell Jr   also a Democrat  was a member of the organization Thirty three Republicans bucked the threat and voted with the Democratic majority in favor of the legislation   among them  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania  the sole Republican sponsor of the reauthorization  Representative Jeff Fortenberry  Republican of Nebraska  voted present Democrats  including all of the freshman members who won in districts swept by Donald J  Trump in 2016  stood up to the gun lobby  with only one   Representative Collin C  Peterson of Minnesota   voting no Many in the new majority campaigned on tightening access to guns  and they appeared to embrace condemnation from the gun lobby as a badge of honor  Lawmakers should be reading the tea leaves   said Shannon Watts  the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  a group that supports restricting gun laws   In the midterm elections  it was gun safety that got people to the polls  Other supporters of the legislation argued that the gun provisions made up only a fraction of the protections offered by the bill  and included invaluable resources for survivors  This wasn t a gun bill   this is a bill to protect women   said Lisette Johnson  a member of the Everytown Survivor Network and a survivor of domestic abuse   This passing today is really a huge support for women and keeping them safer  Republicans had advocated a clean one year extension of the current law  which expired in February  arguing that new elements of the legislation were controversial and overreached   in particular  the gun restrictions and language offering additional protections to transgender people  Can we stop playing political games at the expense of vulnerable women   asked Representative Elise Stefanik  Republican of New York  before the vote  arguing that the bill put forward by Democrats would  collect dust in the Senate    Democrats  who booed vigorously during her speech  rejected her motion  The vote highlighted the stark contrasts between the new Democratic majority  with its historic number of women  and the Republican minority  which has struggled to attract female voters and to increase the number of conservative women holding office on Capitol Hill  Democrats framed opposition to the legislation s renewal as a denial of protections for survivors of abuse  efforts to prevent domestic violence and support for law enforcement Representative Sharice Davids  Democrat of Kansas and one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress in November  presided over the final vote on the measure  which contains a number of protections for women on tribal lands   including a new provision that would allow tribal courts to prosecute nonnative people accused of domestic crimes or dating violence on tribal lands A number of Democrats  including Ms  Dingell and Representative Katie Porter of California  offered passionate defenses of the legislation  repeatedly drawing on their own experiences as survivors of domestic abuse  I know that fear  I know that terror and I just want to try to save another family from going through that terror   Ms  Dingell said at a news conference on Wednesday  recalling being afraid as a child that her father  who had mental illness and owned a gun  would harm her mother or her siblings   Why would you not close that loophole  Republicans  beyond objecting to what they said was an infringement on gun ownership  argued that the measure contained other proposals that were too broad for a law intended to protect survivors of assault  In previous hearings and speeches  they had singled out provisions that would expand protections for transgender people and require the Bureau of Prisons to consider the safety and protection of transgender prisoners when giving housing assignments  We find ourselves debating a VAWA reauthorization act that is literally a Christmas tree of progressive liberal policy objectives  rather than an honest approach to reforming and updating such an important law   said Representative Debbie Lesko  Republican of Arizona  who is a survivor of domestic abuse The legislation heads to the Senate  where Senators Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  and Joni Ernst  Republican of Iowa  have said they will lead efforts to pass a version  It is unclear how many of the new gun provisions in the House legislation will prevail in the Republican controlled Senate  There are a number of improvements in the House bill that I think should be in our version  including preserving improvements already made in the 2013 reauthorization   Ms  Feinstein said in a statement after the vote   I hope the Senate will move quickly  This is an important law and one the Senate should take very seriously and act upon expeditiously   

 Reuters    Venezuela s state run energy company  PDVSA  kept oil exports near 1 million barrels per day in March despite U S  sanctions and power outages that crippled its main export terminal  according to PDVSA documents and Refinitiv Eikon data The OPEC member stabilized exports in March after shipments fell about 40 percent in February from the prior months  in the immediate aftermath of the United States announcing it would impose sanctions on oil sales to choke off the main source of revenue for socialist President Nicolas Maduro The United States and many Western governments have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country s rightful leader  Guaido in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency on the grounds that Maduro s 2018 re election was illegitimate March s exports of 980 355 barrels per day  bpd  of crude and fuel were only slightly below February s shipments of 990 215 bpd  according to the documents seen by Reuters and the Refinitiv Eikon data U S  restrictions on Venezuelan exports will tighten further in May  when the grace period for winding down purchases expires for importers of Venezuelan oil who use U S  subsidiaries or the U S  financial system for transactions   We will  continue to take action to ensure Venezuela s energy resources are preserved for the legitimate government of interim president Juan Guaido  for the people of Venezuela  and the reconstruction of a country destroyed through mismanagement and corruption   a senior U S  administration official told Reuters on Tuesday U S  President Donald Trump is considering imposing sanctions on companies from other countries that do business with Venezuela  White House national security adviser John Bolton told Reuters TV on Friday Most oil shipments in February and March were destined for Asia  Until the sanctions  the United States was Venezuela s largest crude buyer  Given the new set of challenges that landed on PDVSA s lap  we were surprised to see a rebound in exports amid the nationwide power blackouts   said Samir Madani  co founder of TankerTrackers com  a service that tracks oil shipments and storage Exports dipped below 650 000 bpd during the blackouts  TankerTrackers estimates Two massive power outages in March caused Jose port  the country s largest crude terminal  to shut for at least six full days  according to the Eikon data PDVSA was able  however  to offset delays caused by the blackouts by loading larger vessels bound for Asia  Shipping data shows the company plans to do the same again in April Cargoes sent to India  China and Singapore   a hub for storage and re exports   made up 74 percent of total exports in March  compared with almost 70 percent in February Exports to Europe accounted for 17 percent of the total  versus 22 percent the previous month  PDVSA also continued exporting oil to Maduro s ally Cuba  At least seven small cargoes were sent from its ports in March  totaling 65 520 bpd of crude and fuel  according to the data Guaido last month said shipments to Cuba should be halted  But PDVSA  controlled by a military leadership loyal to Maduro  has continued exports to the island The state run company did not respond to a request for comment Venezuela s oil production once surpassed 3 million bpd  but years of what critics say is mismanagement and corruption have caused that output to dwindle  The reduction in oil revenue has led the once prosperous nation into recession and created conditions for hyperinflation  Millions have fled the country and many who remain cannot afford food or basic goods Sanctions have made it difficult for PDVSA to take payment for its exports  said a PDVSA source  who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation  The largest problem is not to load and ship the vessels   the source said  declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter   It is to get paid   INDIA REMAINS TOP DESTINATIONIndia was once again Venezuela s main destination for exports in March  with a third of total cargoes sent to refineries operated by Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy U S  imports of Venezuelan oil have dropped to zero since mid March due to sanctions  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration The largest individual recipient of Venezuelan barrels last month was China National Petroleum Corp  CNPC  and its subsidiaries with some 234 000 bpd  followed by Russia s Rosneft  which received 214 000 bpd  according to the data  New customers including trading firms Sahara Energy and MS International also received access to Venezuelan crude Rosneft has increased its share of Venezuelan oil shipments since the sanctions  mainly for reselling to refiners  Venezuela s oil minister  Manuel Quevedo  last month traveled to Moscow to negotiate larger sales of Venezuelan oil to Russian companies Rosneft has also boosted fuel supplies to Venezuela  according to the data  Venezuela imported 184 500 bpd of fuel last month  with the largest portion provided by the Russian company  followed by cargoes sent by Reliance and Spain s Repsol Following U S  pressure  Reliance turned to selling fuel to Venezuela from India and Europe to circumvent sanctions  Repsol in March swapped gasoline and other fuel for Venezuelan crude as part of an agreement to collect on dividends owed it by PDVSA   Reporting by Marianna Parraga in Mexico City  Editing by David Gaffen  Simon Webb and Rosalba O Brien  

MONTGOMERY  Ala    The Justice Department said Wednesday that Alabama is violating the Constitution by failing to protect prison inmates from violence and sexual abuse and housing them in unsafe  overcrowded facilities The department gave Alabama 49 days to begin to correct the violations or possibly face another federal lawsuit  Our investigation found reasonable cause to believe that Alabama fails to provide constitutionally adequate conditions and that prisoners experience serious harm  including deadly harm  as a result   said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband  who leads the department s civil rights division Gov  Kay Ivey responded with a promise to work together on  an Alabama solution   The scathing report released Wednesday condemns virtually every aspect of prison operations  chronicling a  broken system  beset by poor staff training  an inability to prevent drugs and weapons from entering   and a high level of violence that is too common  cruel  of an unusual nature  Because the prison system has failed to turn over certain investigative files it subpoenaed  federal officials said  the level of violence may be  even greater than that which we report  It lays out in stark detail a culture of violence across the state s 13 prisons for men  which together house roughly 16 000 inmates in among the nation s most overcrowded conditions The report describes inmates brutally attacking one another with knives and other weapons  and a management system that undercounts homicides and fails to protect prisoners even when there s been warning of a problem  Staffing shortages  it says  are at a  crisis level  Investigators reviewed more than 600 reported inmate on inmate sexual assaults from late 2016 through April 2018  and  did not identify a single incident in which a correctional officer or other staff member observed or intervened   Rapes happen day and night in all corners of the prisons   dormitories  cells  showers and recreation areas   the report said In February 2018  one prisoner was killed the day after telling prison officials he d been threatened in a dispute over a cellphone  In another prison that month  an inmate who d been repeatedly disciplined for knife possession fatally stabbed another prisoner in a fight In a single week in September 2017  two inmates stood guard at a dormitory s doors while two others repeatedly stabbed a prisoner who eventually bled to death  Another inmate was stabbed and had to be evacuated by helicopter  and a prisoner in a dorm reserved for inmates with good behavior was attacked with a sock filled with metal locks The prison system documented 24 prisoner homicides between January 2015 and June 2018  but the Justice Department said that high number was an undercount  It identified three more  and said the state sometimes classifies violent deaths as arising from natural causes  This is especially concerning given that these incident reports are used for public statistical reporting as required by law   the letter said Alabama s prisons also have a high suicide rate  and a federal judge in 2017 ruled that the state has provided  horrendously inadequate  care to mentally ill inmates  The Justice Department hopes to work with Alabama to resolve the Department s concerns   Dreiband wrote  The letter included dozens of recommendations   including the immediate hiring of 500 new corrections officer and eventual addition of 1 500 more Ivey said she appreciates the  open lines of communication   and said the state has already been trying to address problems  citing her proposal to build three new mega prisons for men  Over the coming months  my Administration will be working closely with DOJ to ensure that our mutual concerns are addressed and that we remain steadfast in our commitment to public safety  making certain that this Alabama problem has an Alabama solution   Ivey said in a statement That statement of cooperation is undercut by something else in the letter  The department says it still can t determine whether Alabama s prisons are protecting prisoners from excessive force and sexual abuse from staff  because its petition to enforce its subpoena for relevant documents remains pending in court Alabama also has been trying to address crowding through sentencing reform  but the threat of a federal lawsuit will force the state to address other issues such as sexual assaults said Republican state Sen  Cam Ward  who chairs a legislative prison oversight committee  We don t have much of a choice  Something has got to happen   Ward said This investigation opened in 2016 at the end of the Obama administration  which launched wide ranging probes of troubled police departments and corrections systems  Some led to agreements to make changes under federal oversight  The Trump administration has been more hands off  and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions  a longtime Alabama senator  limited the use of such consent decrees before he left office  I don t think there is any dispute that the conditions in Alabama prisons are desperate  They are the worst I ve seen in 35 years  There is an immediate need for reform   attorney Bryan Stevenson said  His Equal Justice Initiative asked the Justice Department to investigate the men s prisons after the department intervened in Alabama s only prison for women  Stevenson said state officials need to act with urgency  given  the fact that people are being murdered on a regular basis  That people are being stabbed and raped and assaulted on an almost daily basis  That there is the level of corruption and abuse that we ve seen among staff     Associated Press reporter Eric Tucker contributed from Washington  

BHIMTAL  India   When India s Election Commission announced last month that its code of conduct would have to be followed by social media companies as well as political parties  some analysts scoffed  saying it lacked the capacity and speed required to check the spread of fake news ahead of a multi phase general election that begins April 11 Just weeks later  the commission is indeed struggling to cope with the fake news swirling on Facebook  WhatsApp  YouTube  Twitter and other platforms  and even for its staff to spot it before it has spread across India  observers said Tuesday  Millions of voters are waking up to fake news  propaganda and hate speech inciting violence against Muslims and other minorities every day  But all the commission can do is monitor it   said Apar Gupta  a lawyer and executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation Given the findings that Russia used Facebook to influence the U S  election in 2016  India s Election Commission should have been better prepared  Gupta said Alarmed at the surge in misinformation  Facebook said Monday that it was removing hundreds of pages and accounts because  we don t want our services to be used to manipulate people   WhatsApp on Tuesday unveiled a helpline called Checkpoint Tipline on which people can check the authenticity of information they receive Examples of fake political news in India on social media abound An India page on Facebook claimed that Sonia Gandhi  the ex president of the Congress Party and mother of Rahul Gandhi  the party leader  is the country s fourth richest woman  Another fabricated image showed the Pakistani flag being waved at Rahul Gandhi s election rallies  Yet another purported to show a photograph of Rahul Gandhi s sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wearing a cross around her neck  intended to malign her as a non Hindu Other social media messages and images depicted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a poor light or as a sinister force  Facebook said it had removed 687 pages or accounts that  engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior  linked to the Congress Party The scale of the propaganda  false information  manipulated photos and fake videos may have something to do with the scope of India s general election  The outcome of 879 million Indians voting over five weeks starting next week is being seen by some as a watershed moment that could fundamentally alter the ethos of Indian society Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party hopes for a second term to consolidate its pro growth  majoritarian policies  The opposition Congress is desperate for a revival in its fortunes after a long period of a declining voter base With many politicians convinced the election is going to be fought on WhatsApp  political parties have created WhatsApp group chats to spread their message  Reports in the Indian media say that the BJP plans to have three WhatsApp groups for each of India s 927 533 polling booths   or 2 8 million WhatsApp groups in all  With WhatsApp recently limiting group members to a maximum of 256  the forum s group chats could potentially reach millions of voters For the Commission  fake news presents a huge challenge  India has 1 14 billion cellphone connections  Around 240 million Indians use WhatsApp  Facebook has over 300 million users in India  more than any other country In India  rumors present a real threat  In 2018  more than 30 people were lynched by mobs acting on rumors spread on WhatsApp  In response  the messaging platform limited the number of people that messages could be forwarded to in India to five from the earlier 20  But experts say that all this has meant is that the number of small groups has proliferated For Gupta  the Election Commission s methods for tackling fake news are woefully inadequate  The mechanism they have set up is that if they see any fake news  they will request the Internet and Mobile Association of India to contact Facebook or YouTube and ask them to take it down  The Association then requests the platforms to do this  This is ludicrously slow   said Gupta Last month  Facebook  Google  Twitter  WhatsApp and ShareChat agreed to adhere to a voluntary code of ethics in collaboration with the Election Commission to curb the menace of fake news  promising to take down any deliberately misleading information within three hours Palash Goorha  business director of social media analytics firm Konnect Insights  said this agreement alone was a novel and useful initiative for India s general election   the world s biggest democratic exercise  He expects it will be watched closely by other governments  It s the first time for such an agreement  After the Trump election  Facebook is being proactive and it s good that everyone else signed up to this  Yes  the commission is learning on the job  Yes  it will learn the hard way  But it s a start   Goorha said But according to Ankit Lal  head of social media with the Aam Aadmi Party  which rules New Delhi  the commission should have engaged all the parties concerned  including those who work in public policy in this field  much earlier to grasp the sheer scale of the problem and devise more concrete steps to tackle it  For an organized and concerted effort  the commission should have been actively engaged both with the social media companies and other groups who know much more about it than it does  long ago   Lal said   You can t get ready for such a mammoth exercise in a few months  At present  it seems more concerned about being seen to be effective than actually being effective in preventing fake news influencing this election   

When it comes to explaining why Facebook  YouTube and Twitter have become hotbeds for extremism  propaganda and bigotry  there s a tendency to overcomplicate things  That s understandable  The algorithms that govern the platforms are unknowable trade secrets  There are  in some cases  billions of users to account for  There are meaty issues of free speech and copyright law playing out in real time across borders  Technology is confusing  And  yes  it s true that the tech companies are dealing with thorny problems that most likely have no universally satisfying outcome  Big Tech s problems are indeed dizzying and manifold  but the last few years have taught us that there s an Occam s razor quality to any explanation of the toxicity of our online platforms  The original sin  it seems  isn t all that complicated  it s the prioritization of growth   above all else and at the expense of those of us who use the services The most recent example came on Tuesday morning when Bloomberg News published a story chronicling YouTube s struggles to quash misinformation  conspiracies and incendiary content  According to the report  current and former YouTube employees said that the company had ignored warnings to change YouTube s recommendation engine and that they were  in some cases  discouraged from seeking out videos that might violate YouTube s rules to preserve a sense of plausible deniability  Employee fears  were sacrificed for engagement   Ambitious goals were set to hit one billion hours of viewing a day  and algorithms were tweaked accordingly   We were so in the weeds trying to hit our goals and drive usage of the site   one former senior manager confessed in the piece   I don t know if we really picked up our heads   As technology advances  will it continue to blur the lines between public and private  Sign up for Charlie Warzel s limited run newsletter to explore what s at stake and what you can do about it  The story shouldn t be shocking  Reports from inside YouTube echo insider tales from other large tech platforms   a familiar pattern of ruthless optimization for users and of attention gone wrong The YouTube employee s quote reminded me of a conversation I d had a few years back with a former member of Twitter s product team   Leading up to I P O   it was all about revenue growth  from C E O  on down   the employee told me  suggesting that  in a frantic race to look good for Wall Street  the company deprioritized fixing systemic issues  including its rampant harassment problem  Others inside Twitter back then agreed   I did see a lot of decisions being made in terms of growth when it came to how to handle abuse  which I get   Leslie Miley  a former engineering manager at Twitter  told me at the time Growth at any cost  It s a mantra familiar inside Facebook as well  as an internal memo surfaced last year by BuzzFeed News revealed   We connect people  Period  That s why all the work we do in growth is justified   a Facebook senior executive  Andrew Bosworth  wrote in the memo in June 2016  In a separate section  while advancing the argument that more human connections via Facebook are a  de facto good   he appears to grapple with the downsides of connection   Maybe it costs someone a life by exposing someone to bullies   maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools   he wrote Mr  Bosworth has suggested the memo was a thought experiment   I don t agree with the post today and I didn t agree with it when I wrote it   he said  But Facebook s rapid rise to two billion plus users  numerous privacy debacles and a steady stream of reported negative revelations suggest that  like its counterparts  the company s quest for expansion trumped pressing concerns of privacy and transparency  A New York Times investigation last year reported that   bent on growth   Facebook executives  ignored warning signs  that Facebook could  disrupt elections  broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe  Scale is also seductive at an engineering level  bottom line aside  Adding users and engagement  in one interpretation  might signal that you re giving people what they want  In 2017  I asked a former senior Facebook employee if staff members had felt a sense of blame for Facebook s inability to stop the spread of misinformation that plagued the platform during the 2016 election  Not exactly  the employee explained   They believe that to the extent that something flourishes or goes viral on Facebook   it s not a reflection of the company s role  but a reflection of what people want  And that deeply rational engineer s view tends to absolve them of some of the responsibility  probably  We want to hear from youOpinionLosing Your Privacy in the Digital Age  Share Your StoriesFeb  13  2019We can see this sensibility today in the way the platforms tend to obfuscate and deflect responsibility  Just last week  a YouTube executive argued that its recommendation algorithms weren t designed to nudge users toward more extreme videos  Similarly  Twitter has and will continue to argue it was not designed specifically to be disproportionately hostile to women and people of color  And Facebook will argue that it was certainly not designed to help foreign countries interfere in our elections But this defensive posture seems only concerned with intent  Even if we take the platforms at their word that they did not intend to profit from extremism or to become hubs for radicalization online  that doesn t mean it doesn t happen  Intent is far less important than the actual outcomes  And the outcomes appear to suggest that these platforms were intentionally designed to keep you glued to your screen for one more video  one more retweet  one more outraged share of a hate read  How can the mess be unwound  Can it be fixed  Those are the complicated questions  But the answer as to how we got here in the first place is much less complicated than Big Tech wants you to think  Intentionally or not  it was designed this way  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear

The Steve Jobs Theater on Apple s spendy new campus in Cupertino  Calif   is a majestic temple to pomp  An ethereal glass and marble cylinder set high on a serene hill  the venue feels like the architectural manifestation of the Apple co founder s famous  reality distortion field   It is an edifice meant to recall those moments when Mr  Jobs  smirking joyfully  would bound up to the stage  teasingly pull a black shroud off some new invention and instantly alter your picture of the future And so it was meant to go once more last week  when Apple invited journalists and celebrities to an event billed as  a Think Different production  Some different thinking did seem in order  Since becoming the first trillion dollar corporation last summer  Apple has battled a souring assessment on Wall Street  The iPhone is the most profitable product in the history of business  but more than a decade after its debut  pretty much everyone on the planet who can afford one already has one  and many customers see little reason to upgrade  Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter  So now  instead of selling better stuff to more people  Apple s new plan is to sell more stuff to the same people   Today is going to be a very different kind of event   said Tim Cook  Apple s chief executive  taking the stage It was not  From start to finish  Apple s affair was a brushed aluminum homage to sameness   a parade of services that start ups and big rivals had done earlier  polished with an Apple y sheen of design and marketing  Among other offerings  Apple showed off a service for subscribing to news on your phone and a credit card  and it offered vague details about a still in development TV service involving Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey  who are not exactly edgy or up and coming  None of these efforts look terrible  Some  like the news service  might be handy  Yet they are all so trifling and derivative  As the analyst Ben Thompson noted  Apple s crush of me too announcements falls far short of Mr  Jobs s goal of putting  a ding in the universe   As I watched Apple s event  I felt the future shrink a little  In its gilded middle age  Apple is turning into something like a digital athleisure brand  stamping out countless upscale accessories for customers who love its one big thing  a company that has lost sight of the universe and is content merely to put a ding in your pocketbook In an ordinary time  such an ordinary corporate vision might be fine  But these aren t ordinary times  and Apple is no ordinary company  Here is a corporation with the resources of an empire  the mass devotion of a religion and the operational capacity of a war machine  Under Mr  Cook  Apple has cannily avoided every minefield in tech and politics over the past couple of years  winning a windfall from President Trump s tax cut  avoiding getting burned in his trade war   all while enjoying the loyalty of every moneyed hipster and suburbanite on earth We want to hear from youOpinionLosing Your Privacy in the Digital Age  Share Your StoriesFeb  13  2019Yet  all around Apple  the digital world is burning up  Indirectly  Apple s devices are implicated in the rise of misinformation and distraction  the erosion of privacy and the breakdown of democracy  None of these grand problems is Apple s fault  but given its centrality to the business  Apple has the capacity and wherewithal to mitigate them  But instead of rising to the moment by pushing a fundamentally new and safer vision of the future  Apple is shrinking from it Consider privacy  Mr  Cook is one of the tech industry s strongest champions of the sanctity of our private information  and Apple has pushed for more stringent privacy regulations   which is just about the least Apple could do  But what if it thought a little bigger  For example  it could directly take on Google and Facebook   the demons who rule our era of surveillance capitalism   by placing far more stringent restrictions on their culture of rampant invasion  or at least removing them from preferential places in the iPhone   Google will pay Apple an estimated  12 billion in 2019 to act as the default search engine on the iPhone  More than restricting the present  Apple could deploy its billions to build a better digital future  In particular  I wonder why Apple isn t working feverishly to create new privacy minded versions of social media services the world needs Take messaging  for starters  There is a strong moral case for Apple to turn iMessage  its encrypted messaging app  into an open standard available to anyone  even Android users  who currently lack many privacy minded messaging apps that aren t run by an ad company or aren t friendly with the Chinese government There might be a business case  too  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s founder  recently reoriented his company toward messaging  As Will Oremus noted in Slate  the move brings Facebook into direct competition with Apple  This presents an opportunity for Apple to turn a cold war into a hot one  Apple could swiftly undercut Mr  Zuckerberg s ambition by freeing iMessage and bringing the gift of privacy to the non Apple world RelatedOpinion   Cal NewportSteve Jobs Never Wanted Us to Use Our iPhones Like ThisJan  25  2019Here are some other big ideas  Apple could embark on a long term project to create a privacy minded search engine to rival Google s  It could build an ad free Instagram  its founders just left Facebook in frustration   It could create a YouTube that isn t a haven for neo Nazis  Some  or many  of these may be dumb ideas   ideas that would ruin Apple  or at the very least kneecap its short run profits  But they are at least big ideas  they match in scope and daring what Apple was created to do  Let other companies handle streaming entertainment  To paraphrase a wise man  Does Mr  Cook want to sell prestige TV for the rest of his life  or does he want to change the world The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email

Between the time I wrote these words and the time that you are reading them  a team of government censors decided how much of what I wrote you would get to see  Fortunately  it was cleared without redactions  But I haven t always been so fortunate There are millions of others like me who face this scrutiny as present and former employees of the armed services and a dozen other government agencies  from the C I A  and F B I  to the State and Energy Departments  We have faithfully carried out our duties and upheld our oaths of allegiance to the Constitution  Many of us earned the highest trust of our country  serving in roles that brought us in contact with government secrets and classified material  We have honored and repaid that trust  guarding sensitive information and fulfilling the obligations associated with our security clearances In return  we have been rewarded with what feels very much like a lifetime of distrust  Whenever we want to write about even the nonsensitive aspects of our service and experience  we have to submit our manuscripts and articles for prepublication review by the government  We have to do this even after we retire I spent 31 years in sworn duty to support and defend the Constitution of the United States  and I m pretty sure this is not how the First Amendment is supposed to work  That s why I have joined in a lawsuit with four other former federal employees seeking to block the government from enforcing this review process in its current form I joined the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in 1981  At that time  despite the Cold War obsession with national security  service members and intelligence officers rarely had to submit their writings before publication  Two years later  President Ronald Reagan issued a directive that would have subjected millions of government employees to prepublication review  That directive was so controversial  and so obviously at odds with free speech values  that Congress held hearings  and Mr  Reagan rescinded it In the years since  however  17 military and civilian agencies have instituted their own prepublication review regimes  according to an analysis  by the A C L U  and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University  which are representing us in our lawsuit  The rules about which employees are required to submit to review are confusing and inconsistent among agencies  The criteria for what gets censored are unclear  The time it takes to have a manuscript approved can stretch to years  Of course  vital intelligence and operational information must be protected  But no review system will guard against those who are determined to divulge government secrets  At its best  then  this review should confirm that employees are not inadvertently disclosing information that would actually harm national security  My own experience shows  however  that this is not always the way the system works  Three years ago  during a presidential race in which Donald Trump  the Republican Party s presumptive nominee  was pledging to  bring back waterboarding and I d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding   I felt I needed to share what I knew about the destructiveness of torture  and about the struggle many of us had waged to stop the abuse of prisoners in American custody after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  As deputy commander of the Department of Defense Criminal Investigation Task Force  I had protested prisoner abuse to my superiors  and I had shared what I knew with Senate investigators  With the subject of torture again thrust into the center of the national debate  I wanted to write a book that would make the case why these abuses should never be repeated I would never publish classified material  I carefully avoided it  and meticulously cited congressional hearings and official investigations to show that the information I included was already public  In January 2017  I submitted my manuscript to the military  Defense Department regulations provide for a review process of at least 30 working days  but the government held my manuscript for 233 days  I finally got it back  months after the planned publication date  littered with unnecessary redactions of already published material I m now one of the editors of an academic volume on ethical interrogation  A single chapter that I helped write  thoroughly footnoted with published sources  was held up for six months for review  It was finally returned to us with redactions that required additional rewriting  adding to the delays This censorship system seriously discourages publishers from taking on books by people who often have the most to contribute to public debates and decision making  As my first book languished in review  my publisher considered canceling my contract  and told me afterward that it was unlikely to publish similar projects because of the uncertainties and costly delays involved  Worse  review inhibits others from publicly writing about their service  There are several million veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other post Sept  11 military operations  plus many more from nonmilitary agencies  They are all required to submit their writings to government censors  many for the rest of their lives I take seriously my obligation to protect information essential to our national security  I also understand that I face a range of penalties  including criminal prosecution  if I betray this trust  There may be a place for prepublication review  but it should be limited in scope  clear in what it covers  and consistent with constitutional protections for freedom of speech  But the system we have now is not it The current system is discouraging some of our most dedicated and trustworthy veterans and public servants from joining public conversations that are crucial to our country s future  That is the very opposite of what the First Amendment intended  and it is not good for any of us  RelatedEx National Security Officials Sue to Limit Censorship of Their BooksApril 2  2019Mark Fallon  who spent 31 years as a federal agent  counterintelligence officer

KIEV  Ukraine   Volodymyr Zelenskiy has no political experience  but that s no problem for the people of Ukraine who have already seen him performing the role of president In a striking example of fiction morphing into reality  the 41 year old comic actor seems set to take the top office for real  following in the footsteps of the man he plays in a wildly popular television series   an ordinary teacher who becomes an unlikely president and succeeds in bringing the country together Zelenskiy took a commanding lead against the incumbent in Sunday s presidential election  putting him in a strong position for the runoff in three weeks  time He is the latest candidate with little or no political experience to fare well at the ballot boxes  reinforcing the trend in Europe and beyond for anti establishment leaders  Just a day before Ukraine s election  a liberal environmental activist won a runoff in Slovakia to become the country s first female president Zelenskiy is much more moderate than far right populists who have had recent success in elections  and he appealed for reconciliation with separatist held eastern Ukraine  A new life begins   Zelenskiy said in his trademark raspy voice after the vote   A life without corruption and without bribes  A life in a nation of dreams comes true  His easygoing manner and snappy talk on the campaign trail strongly resembled his character in  Servant of the People    a schoolteacher catapulted into the presidential seat after a student s video of him blasting official corruption goes viral  Zelenskiy has  however  refused to hold standard campaign meetings with voters  and his political program remains a mystery The TV series that premiered in the fall of 2015 painted a grotesque satirical picture of Ukraine s officialdom  complete with easily recognizable parodies of serving politicians  It has been immensely popular  attracting up to 20 million viewers in the nation of 42 million   a sign that it hit a nerve in a country fed up with endemic corruption and grinding poverty Zelenskiy s character  Vasyl Holoborodko  at first looks too naive and soft hearted to survive in the cruel world of Ukraine s corruption ridden elite  But he learns quickly and soon turns into a strong leader capable of defeating his wily and experienced foes without losing his integrity  The series is full of profanities and crude humor  but Holoborodko turns serious when he talks about the country s challenges The latest season of  Servant of the People   shown just days before the election  opens with Holoborodko thrown into prison on trumped up charges fabricated by his pitiless foes Inmates hired by his enemies try to kill him  but he survives and gets out  to find Ukraine sunken deeper in poverty and broken into multiple fiefdoms   in a nod to the ongoing separatist conflict in the east  On screen  Zelenskiy s character regains the presidential post and leads the country to peace  prosperity and reunification These are the challenges incumbent President Petro Poroshenko has sorely failed to meet  and Zelenskiy s electoral success clearly reflects public aspirations that he could be just as successful in real life as his character was on screen Ukraine has suffered from economic meltdown  endemic corruption and a spiraling conflict with Russia sponsored separatists in eastern Ukraine that has killed 13 000 people since 2014  Its hopes for integration into the European Union and NATO remain as elusive as ever  and there is no realistic way for Ukraine to reclaim control over the Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 in a move that most of the world sees as illegal For those who cast ballots for Zelenskiy  his lack of political skills is a major advantage  a welcome break from the cast of familiar political figures associated with the country s woes  Both incumbent Petro Poroshenko and Yulia Tymoshenko  who polled second and third  respectively  have been on the political stage for more than a decade Born to a professorial family in the industrial city of Kryvyi Rih when Ukraine still was part of the Soviet Union  Zelenskiy is a native Russian speaker  something that helped him sweep the vote in central  eastern and southern regions where many speak the language The comedian has had a low key campaign  In his rare public appearances  Zelenskiy wouldn t offer his views on specific political or economic issues  promising to rely on a team of professionals Zelenskiy rejects Poroshenko s claim that his lack of experience will make him unable to stand up to Russia  pledging to firmly defend Ukraine s interests  He charged late Sunday that he will make sure that Russia not only returns Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine held by pro Russia rebels  but pays compensation for the  disgusting and horrible  land grabs In Moscow  lawmakers and commentators have described Zelenskiy s strong showing as a sign of public disillusionment with the current government  but most predict that the tug of war between the two neighbors will continue Poroshenko has sought to disparage Zelenskiy  accusing him of being a  puppet  of self exiled billionaire businessman Ihor Kolomoyskyi  whose station has aired  Servant of the People  and given him the platform to announce his candidacy in a New Year s speech  Zelenskiy  who has bitingly mocked the president in his stand up performances  shot back by ridiculing Poroshenko and his associates accused of corruption Kolomoyskyi  who lives in Israel  denied bankrolling Zelenskiy s bid  but hailed him

LOS ANGELES   Rapper Nipsey Hussle was fatally shot outside the clothing store he founded to help rebuild his troubled South Los Angeles neighborhood  police said  cutting short a career that earned him a Grammy nomination this year for his major label debut  He was 33 Police said Hussle was one of three men shot Sunday outside Marathon Clothing  his store in South Los Angeles  the other two were in stable condition  A large crowd gathered outside the store as night fell  Detectives were canvassing the area for witnesses and looking to see if any surveillance video captured the shooting  police Lt  Chris Ramirez said  Investigators had not yet determined a motive or identified any suspects  Ramirez said Mayor Eric Garcetti was among the many people expressing condolences  Our hearts are with the loved ones of Nipsey Hussle and everyone touched by this awful tragedy  L A  is hurt deeply each time a young life is lost to senseless gun violence   Garcetti tweeted Hussle  who had two children and was engaged to actress Lauren London  was an Eritrean American whose real name was Ermias Asghedom  This doesn t make any sense  My spirit is shaken by this    Rihanna wrote while posting photos of Hussle with his daughter and another with his fiance   Dear God may His spirit Rest In Peace and May You grant divine comfort to all his loved ones  I m so sorry this happened to you  nipseyhussle  Hussle was born on Aug  15  1985  in the same Crenshaw neighborhood where he died  and where he had been working to provide youths with alternatives to the hustling he did when he was younger Los Angeles Police Commissioner Steve Soboroff tweeted that he and Police Chief Michel Moore had agreed with Hussle to meet with him on Monday to  talk about ways he could help stop gang violence and help us help kids  Hussle explained where he was coming from in a Los Angeles Times interview last year   In our culture  there s a narrative that says   Follow the athletes  follow the entertainers    he said   And that s cool  but there should be something that says   Follow Elon Musk  follow  Mark  Zuckerberg   Hussle said his first passion was music but getting resources was tough after leaving his mother s house at 14 to live with his grandmother  Hussle said he got involved in street life as he tried to support himself  and he joined the gang Rollin 60 s Neighborhood Crips as a teenager  The culture of my area is the gang culture   he explained in a 2014 interview with VladTV   So by being outside  being involved with hustling  being in the hood  doing things to try to get money  being young  you know riding your bike through the hood  getting shot at  your loved ones and homies that s your age getting killed  getting shot at     it s like  we were just raised like if you with me and something goes now  I m in it  Music eventually happened for Hussle  who said in interviews that his stage name  a play on the 1960s and 70s rhyming standup comic Nipsey Russell  was given to him as a teen by an older friend because he was such a go getter   always hustling Hussle released a number of successful mixtapes that he sold out of the trunk of his car  helping him create a buzz and gain respect from rap purists and his peers  In 2010 he placed on hip hop magazine XXL s  Freshman Class of 2010    a coveted list for up and coming hip hop acts   alongside J  Cole Big Sean  Wiz Khalifa and others The proud West Coast rapper continued to build more hype for himself  scoring big when Jay Z bought 100 copies of his 2013 mixtape  Crenshaw  for  100 each  and sent him a  10 000 check During the 2016 presidential campaign  Hussle and rapper YG released the protest song  FDT   short for   Expletive  Donald Trump   He later hit a new peak with  Victory Lap   his critically acclaimed major label debut album on Atlantic Records that made several best of lists last year  from Billboard magazine to Complex  The album debuted at No  4 on Billboard s 200 albums charts and featured collaborations with Kendrick Lamar  Diddy  CeeLo Green and more At this year s Grammy Awards   Victory Lap  was one of five nominees for best rap album in a year that hip hop dominated the pop charts and streaming services and a number of top stars released projects  including Drake  Eminem and Kanye West  Cardi B s  Invasion of Privacy  won the honor  It s my debut album so for my first one  to be nominated  out the gate  it s like  it was overwhelming a little bit  It was     inspiring  humbling   he said in an interview with the Recording Academy on the red carpet of the 2019 Grammys  which he attended with this daughter Many celebrities were mourning his death on social media  NBA star Steph Curry tweeted   God please cover and restore  NipseyHussle right now    Snoop Dogg posted a video of himself and Hussle together on Instagram  and posted a second clip sending prayers to the rapper s family  Prayers out to the whole family man  This  stuff has  got to stop man   he said in the second video Rapper Nas mourned Hussle s death on Instagram and wrote   It s dangerous to be an MC  Dangerous to be a b ball player  It s dangerous to have money  Dangerous To Be A Black Man    Nipsey is a True voice  He will never be silenced  Outside of music  Hussle said he wanted to provide hope and motivation to those who grew up in Crenshaw like him  and pay it forward  Forbes magazine reported in February that with business partner Dave Gross  the rapper had purchased the Crenshaw plaza where his Marathon Clothing store is located  and had plans to knock it down and  rebuild it as a six story residential building atop a commercial plaza where a revamped Marathon store will be the anchor tenant   Watching Nipsey inspired me to invest and own in our communities   Emmy nominated actress Issa Rae  also from Los Angeles  wrote on Twitter TV commentator Van Jones also tweeted  writing   AWFUL  This brother was JUST getting started  He d finally figured out how to use celebrity to build real wealth and opportunity in the hood  AND HE WAS DOING IT   FOR ALL OF US       Fekadu reported from New York    This story has been corrected to show that the first name of Los Angeles  police chief is Michel  not Michael  

RANCHO MIRAGE  Calif    Albane Valenzuela could have been teeing it up Wednesday in the inaugural Augusta National Women s Amateur  where the contestants who survive the cut will play the final 18 holes on the fabled course where men will compete at the Masters next week Valenzuela  a junior at Stanford and the fifth ranked women s amateur in the world  seriously entertained the invitation from the board of governors of the Augusta National Golf Club until she received what she considered a better offer for this week  her third start in the ANA Inspiration  the women s first major of the year  Getting to tee off and play the same course as the world No  1   she said Tuesday  referring to South Korea s Sung Hyun Park   I think that s the best experience you can get  Augusta National officials have trumpeted their amateur invitational as a grand stage for women s golf  That overlooks the major originally known as the Dinah Shore  which has captivated young golfers since 1972  The tournament has cultivated indelible traditions like the winner s leap into Poppie s Pond and consistently provided significant exposure for top amateurs like Valenzuela  who used her 2016 debut here as a springboard to the Rio Olympics Augusta National didn t admit its first female members until 2012  And while it has since opened its course to boys and girls through the Drive  Chip and Putt contest and to amateur women  these inclusive gestures have ignored   and however unintentionally  undermined   the L P G A   one of the longest running women s professional sports organizations The Drive  Chip and Putt contest  held the Sunday before the Masters  has siphoned television and other media coverage from the final round of the ANA Inspiration  And with the advent of the Augusta National Women s Amateur  the spotlight on the best women s players in the world has become more diffuse ImageHonoring a tradition  Pernilla Lindberg jumped into Poppie s Pond just behind her caddie  Daniel Taylor  after winning the ANA Inspiration last year  Lindberg s parents followed her into the water CreditAlex Gallardo Associated Press I think it comes from a very positive place in Augusta   they want to do the right thing   Valenzuela said   It s probably not my place to say  but it would have been great if both could have worked together to make them happen in different weeks  because you don t want to get the spotlight off the L P G A  The ANA Inspiration matters because the magnetic moments that attracted Valenzuela to the sport as a child didn t involve Augusta National  which for most of its history has been so far out of the women s orbit that it might as well have been on Mars  Ever since I ve been a little girl I ve seen all the girls jump in the pond   Valenzuela said  adding   This is the women s Masters  On Wednesday  Jennifer Kupcho  a Wake Forest senior and the top ranked women s amateur  struck the opening drive of the new event at the Champions Retreat resort in Evans  Ga   the site of the first two rounds  Only the final round will be played at Augusta National Across the country Wednesday  Valenzuela grooved her swing on the Mission Hills practice range  Stacy Lewis  the 2011 ANA Inspiration champion  said she planned to extend a warm welcome to Valenzuela and the four other amateurs in the field  Patty Tavatanakit  Frida Kinhult  Rachel Heck and Xin Kou  who is also known as Cindy  I m really proud of them   said Lewis  the former women s world No  1 who recently returned to competition after the birth in October of her first child  a daughter   If you want to play professional golf  you need to play in majors  and you need to see where your game stacks up and have that experience of playing in front of those big crowds  ImageThe chance to compete against Sung Hyun Park  the world No  1  at the ANA Inspiration in Rancho Mirage  Calif   was one of the reasons Valenzuela bypassed the new amateur event CreditSteve Dykes Getty

her Stanford teammates on Sunday at the Silverado Showdown  a collegiate women s event in Napa Stanford is ranked fourth in the Women s Golf Coaches Association poll and is jockeying with other top teams for seeding positions at next month s N C A A  championship  Another Stanford star  Andrea Lee  chose to play in Georgia this week Anne Walker  Valenzuela s coach at Stanford  said in a telephone interview that she welcomed Augusta National s move into the women s game  describing it as  another great opportunity that s opened up  But in its exuberance to grow the game  Augusta National big footed more than the L P G A  schedule   There s very little discussion about the timing of it as it relates to college golf   Walker said She pointed out that Texas  which is ranked second behind the University of Southern California  competed in the Bruzzy Challenge this week in Texas without three of its top players  Emilee Hoffman  Agathe Laisne and Kaitlyn Papp  who are in Augusta  The Longhorns finished tied for seventh  their lowest finish of the season by three places Walker ultimately described the scheduling conflicts as  a great problem to have  But they are a problem  nonetheless ImageJennifer Kupcho  the top ranked women s amateur  was the first golfer to tee off at the inaugural Augusta National Women s Amateur  which started Wednesday at Champions Retreat in Evans  Ga CreditDavid Goldman Associated PressWhen the Augusta National chairman  Fred Ridley  announced the new event last year  he said   We think that to have one week where the future greats of the game and the current greats of the women s game are all competing on a big stage is  it s just very exciting  Referring to L P G A  Commissioner Mike Whan  who was not consulted before the Augusta tournament was scheduled  Ridley added   I think he also understands that in time it s going to be a win for the L P G A  Lewis said she would love to see the Augusta event played at a different time of year Referring to the amateurs  she added   Maybe they could get a full tournament on Augusta National  Get a couple practice rounds and a three round tournament there  Or better yet  the Augusta National members could find a way to welcome the 8 year old girls and the 18 year old amateurs after they have grown into the best women players on the planet It s a win win for golf any time the best women mix with the best men  as Brittany Lincicome  a two time ANA Inspiration champion  recently was reminded Lincicome spent two days last month at the PGA Tour s flagship event in Florida  and she was shocked when players like Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy saw her behind the rope lines and came bounding over to ask if she would pose for selfies with them Lincicome  33  has been slow to recognize that her start last year in a PGA Tour event in Kentucky trumped either of her victorious finishes here  I had no idea they knew who I was   she said If the L P G A  has to move the date of its first major to accommodate Augusta National  here s one idea how Augusta National members could make the change palatable  They could extend an invitation to the women s reigning major winners to compete alongside the men in the Masters  par 3 contest  That would be more meaningful start than a flashy 18 hole finish to an amateur event  

JUNEAU  Alaska   During Republican Mike Dunleavy s successful run for governor last year  he offered few specifics for his vision of limited government but was clear that Alaska residents should get a full payout from the state s oil wealth fund Lawmakers and Dunleavy s predecessor capped the annual checks at  1 600 or less the past few years as they struggled to address a budget deficit that has persisted amid low to middling oil prices and is now estimated at  1 6 billion Dunleavy s call for paying the full amount this year  around  3 000 each  plus what they missed out on the past three years  was a centerpiece of his campaign But now that he s governor  residents are learning what it will take to pay a full dividend  and many don t like their options Dunleavy has proposed sweeping cuts  including potentially selling a state museum  idling Alaska s ferry fleet while the future of that service  critical to many coastal communities  is debated  slashing health and social service programs  shifting costs to local governments  and cutting the University of Alaska system budget by an amount nearly equivalent to the cost of running two of its three flagship campuses Some see this as a manufactured crisis that doesn t consider potential new or increased taxes and too highly prizes the annual checks over education and other government services The formula for calculating the amount residents receive from Alaska Permanent Fund earnings is set in state law  based on an average of the fund s income over five years  Starting in 2016  former Gov  Bill Walker and the lawmakers capped the yearly dividend  at  1 022   1 100 and  1 600  A full dividend this year would be roughly  2 900 to  3 100 Alaska has no personal income or state sales tax Frank Kelty  the mayor of Unalaska  a community of about 4 300 along the far flung Aleutian Islands that is home to one of the nation s busiest fishing ports  likens Dunleavy s quest to pay a full dividend to President Donald Trump s push for a U S  Mexico border wall  The governor s looking at any kind of pool of money he can try and grab  and it s all going into this dividend promise that he made   Kelty said   I don t think that s right  Dunleavy argues the state must live within its means  He says spending is the problem  not the dividend  and sees revenue that would come from new or increased taxes as a pathway to more spending  Dunleavy is seeking constitutional changes that include a spending cap  giving voters a say on tax or dividend changes approved by lawmakers and giving the Legislature a say on tax related voter initiatives  Key senators have begun kicking around the idea of a change in the dividend calculation He hasn t said if he would accept a smaller dividend  or how heavily he ll wield his veto power  He said he s willing to use  every tool available to make sure we have our fiscal house in order  Lawmakers in recent years blew through billions of dollars in savings as they struggled to address the deficit  With savings dwindling and disagreement over taxes and continued cuts  they began tapping permanent fund earnings  typically used to pay dividends and fortify the nest egg fund  to help pay for government last year  This created tension  with the decades old dividend  widely considered an entitlement  seen as competing against other programs for funding A new law that seeks to limit what can be taken from fund earnings calls for a withdrawal of  2 9 billion for the coming budget year for both dividends and government expenses  Paying a full dividend for 2019 alone would take  1 9 billion  That doesn t include any back payment The dividend provides a financial boost more critical for residents with lower incomes and those in high cost rural areas  Checks have ranged from about  331 a person in the program s early years to  2 072 in 2015  the year before it was capped Roger Stone  a Dunleavy supporter from Ketchikan  doesn t agree with everything Dunleavy proposed but sees his budget as a wake up call that something s got to give  I think that they need to take a hard look at what s really necessary in state government   Stone said of lawmakers  Once that happens  he said he s willing to have a lower dividend  seeing that as preferable to a sales or income tax Former state Sen  Rick Halford unsuccessfully sued Walker for roughly halving the amount available for dividends in 2016 and agrees with Dunleavy s effort to pay a full dividend  But he said it isn t a full debate when options such as taxes on oil and other resources aren t being considered  Nothing should be off the table   he said Jan MacClarence said she and her husband  who are in their 70s  are moving from a state owned elder care facility in Anchorage after 3  years and into an apartment to avoid the budget stress  State officials have proposed rate increases of between 40  and nearly 140  for Pioneer Home residents to reflect costs of care  though they have said no one would be evicted or barred entry based on their ability to pay MacClarence said being on their own and using food delivery and personal care services as needed is better than worrying every year about what lawmakers might do As lawmakers have held hearings around the state on Dunleavy s budget proposals  the governor has begun traveling to make his case He s faced criticism for participating in what some see as friendly venues  including events hosted by the limited government group Americans for Prosperity Alaska  which asked people to register in advance and reserved the right to kick out anyone who was disruptive  Some of the gatherings drew protesters  police alleged one woman yelled at the governor in Nome and resisted their commands  but the prosecutor there declined to pursue charges Community meetings and some budget hearings held by lawmakers have drawn big crowds  Hundreds spoke against cuts to the ferry system  a thoroughfare for coastal communities not connected to the mainland road system The state wants to hire a consultant to recommend  reshaping  the system and reducing its costs  Dunleavy has expressed openness to keeping some runs going while that process plays out  but no boats are currently set to sail past Oct  1 Many residents of small southeast Alaska communities travel by ferry with their cars to the bigger city of Juneau to buy supplies at places like Costco  or fly there and take the ferry home  Walt Weller  the mayor of Pelican  a town of about 70 people 70 miles  113 kilometers  west of Juneau  called the ferry a lifeline  When you re out here at the end of everything   I mean no roads  float planes only   100  weather dependent  we re pretty doggone dependent on that ferry   Weller said  He acknowledges people choose to live there but said the ferries   even with limited runs   have helped make that possible  To have people claim that they re going to give everybody giant  dividend  checks and then rip our road out from underneath us is fairly upsetting   he said  

WASHINGTON   How many ways can you measure the first quarter of the year  For Democratic presidential candidates  it s 300 plus events  26 states and hundreds of voter questions The Iowa caucus is still 10 months away  but the Democratic primary campaign is already an all out sprint   passing eye popping markers for campaign activity and voter engagement  Voters in Florida and Ohio may not see it  but weekends in Iowa  New Hampshire  Nevada and South Carolina   not to mention a handful of select states   are a blitz of candidate rallies and local meet and greets For some candidates the frenetic pace is the message  a way of casting themselves as tireless and willing to take every last question  Elizabeth Warren and Beto O Rourke are trying to make an ambitious schedule and accessibility part of their brands  but Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand have done their parts to keep up with several dozen events each  most in early voting states It s far from clear that the candidate who holds the most events  whether leaping onto tables or addressing big rallies  will emerge as the candidate with the most votes  Still  Democrats watching the display from a distance say the engagement  the activity and the enthusiasm bode well  Broad picture  This is incredibly good for the Democratic Party   said Jim Messina  who managed President Barack Obama s re election campaign The Democrats  contested 2008 primary and the GOP s packed 2016 field showed  that enthusiasm in primaries becomes very important in a general election   Messina said  That s because engaged backers are  more likely to do two things you need them to do  in order to win  he said  donate money and help persuade their social networks to vote For all the recent upheaval in politics  the 2020 campaign so far shows some things haven t changed  Retail campaign stops are still essential to breaking through in early voting states that will play a central role in choosing the nominee  They are  perhaps  even more important in the social media era  One live streamed rally that goes viral on social media can reach more voters than dozens of smaller events Even though no one metric can predict success  a look at the campaigns  tallies of on the ground engagement shows how some of the busiest road warriors are faring at the end of the first quarter Warren and O Rourke are logging mileage in areas their party hasn t always traveled to early on and underscoring their appetite for grassroots interaction  a style Pete Buttigieg is also cultivating  Warren took more than 200 questions from voters and O Rourke answered more than 350  according to their campaigns  first quarter estimates That s a notable feat for O Rourke  who only entered the race last month  The former Texas congressman has logged 55 first quarter events in nine states where he publicly took voter questions  according to his campaign  Gillibrand held 59 public events in eight states since launching an exploratory committee in January  according to the New York senator s campaign  Buttigieg has held 35 events in 11 states since the South Bend  Indiana  mayor started an exploratory committee that same month Minnesota Sen  Amy Klobuchar logged 36 public events in 10 states since forming her campaign in February  according to her campaign s tally California Sen  Kamala Harris has emerged as a top tier contender despite fewer public events than some opponents  clocking in with 26 public first quarter events in eight states since launching her campaign in January  according to an AP estimate  Harris  campaign said Monday night that she took more than 100 voter questions during first quarter events  where total estimated turnout has topped 37 000 Warren  a former law professor whose campaign is keeping detailed statistics  took questions at 48 events in 12 states over all three months  according to the Massachusetts senator s campaign  Her aides measure her commitment to voter engagement partly in selfies   estimating that she s taken more than 12 000 with voters so far  The tally of extra time after events is itself a strategic move  an argument that availability can win the day while other candidates spend time on the high dollar fundraisers she s sworn off Other Democrats are consciously mixing up their number and types of public events  Booker is holding a bigger kickoff of a national tour soon after holding smaller events  The New Jersey senator s campaign estimates that he has held more than 50 public events in seven states since he jumped into the race in February and taken more than 350 voter questions A handful of other candidates have lagged behind in their total number of first quarter events  Former Colorado Gov  John Hickenlooper s campaign has logged 16 events  while Washington Gov  Jay Inslee held 12 events according to an AP tally  Former housing secretary Julian Castro has held more than a dozen of his own over the first quarter All of these candidates tend to fall behind Bernie Sanders in early polling of the Democratic field  Sanders  the runner up in 2016  has held 17 major events in eight states and Washington  D C   since declaring his candidacy in early March Not all of Sanders  events   nor those of other candidates   feature the sort of real time voter questions that are a fixture of Warren s and O Rourke s appearances  But Sanders  crowds illustrate his formidable ability to engage voters on his own terms  The Vermont senator s campaign projects a total turnout of 74 000 people for all of his events so far President Donald Trump famously upended the traditional calculus of campaigning in 2016 by making fewer retail visits as he powered past more than a dozen GOP rivals  Whether anyone in the Democratic field can repeat that model remains to be seen  We want to fall in love like we did with Barack Obama   Messina said of Democratic voters   and to do that  you need to do the retail part of this  Several candidates have made a point of veering off the beaten track  hoping a stop outside the early states will earn them some extra media attention and voter good will O Rourke crossed six states in one week on his post announcement road trip  Warren has made unexpected trips to Puerto Rico and the Deep South  eager to find a way to set herself apart from the pack When the Massachusetts senator touted her  not traditional  choice to visit Alabama during a rally there last month  a voice from the audience chimed in to note that  Obama did it    Associated Press writers Juana Summers in Washington  Will Weissert and Paul Weber in Austin  Texas  Sara Burnett in Chicago  Hunter Woodall in Berlin  New Hampshire  Nicholas Riccardi in Denver  and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this

ATHENS   In the nearly three months I ve been in this fascinating city  I ve met plenty of rather high spirited people  But it was not until I visited the monastery at Mount Athos in northeastern Greece that I encountered the happiest person I ve ever met I d traveled from Athens with my friend Anthony Papadimitriou  who had very kindly arranged the trip to the Holy Mountain  as it is called here  We share an abiding interest in monasticism  although neither of us is fully monkish in our habits We had been on the road since very early in the morning when we left the port of Ouranopoli  the City of Heaven  in a small white and orange boat with a captain named Yorgos  The only way of approaching the long rocky peninsula of Mount Athos is by water  and it requires a special permit  I had it in my hand  stamped with the seal of the Holy Mountain  with four handwritten signatures  Anthony told me that the monks had checked out my credentials and noticed somewhere online that I was described as an atheist  which is not exactly true  But apparently that was better than being Catholic  On my permit  it read  Anglican   which made me smile ImageThe only way of approaching Mount Athos is by water CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesTo understand contemporary Greece  and what connects it  and fails to connect it  with antiquity  you have to consider the Orthodox Church  which still has considerable ideological power over Greek life  for good or ill  Christianity is the connecting tissue in the body of Hellenism  for it is here that religious traditions and  most important  the Greek language was preserved  Mount Athos  the spiritual epicenter of Orthodoxy  is an entirely self governing monastic republic  with its own parliament  Legally part of the European Union  Athos is an autonomous state with its own jurisdiction  like the Vatican  although the monks would not appreciate that analogy  The Orthodox Church has still not forgotten the Catholic sacking of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 The monastic tradition on Athos goes back to the 9th century A D   although the continuous Christian presence is much older  Athonite legend has it that the Virgin Mary traveled to Athos with St  John the Evangelist and liked it so much that she asked Jesus for it to be her garden  Happy to oblige his mother  Jesus agreed  And since that time  the only female creatures allowed on Mount Athos are cats  who are abundant in the monasteries  The mother of God was apparently the only woman to be allowed in her garden We were going to spend three days and two nights in the monastery of Simonopetra  or Simon s Rock  founded in the 13th century  The fact that my name is Simon rather amused some of the monks to whom we were introduced ImageThe flag of the Greek Orthodox Church CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesSimon was a hermit who lived in a cave  a five minute walk downhill from the monastery  Inside a tiny chapel  a few rocky steps took me up to Simon s cell  It was tiny  cold and bare  He d had a vision in a dream of a monastery on the rock in front of his cave and then had the audacity to build it  As one monk said to me  this is the world s first skyscraper  An improbable looking 10 story building is somehow wrapped around a huge rock with the church at its center  It has been burned down on several occasions  but then rebuilt with great effort  Inside is a bewildering array of staircases  a labyrinth that leads down to the monastic library  there is no elevator  Today there are 65 monks in Simonopetra  mostly Greek  we met French monks and new arrivals from Lebanon and Syria  as well  On Athos itself  there are around 2 000 monks  mostly living communally in monasteries  but there are others living in very small communities called sketes  each with three or four monks  Some 30 or so live alone as hermits  I was intrigued It was late on our first day there that I met Father Ioanikios  He was a very handsome and physically fit man  probably in his late 60s  with the clearest eyes  olive skin and a long white beard  He briefly introduced himself to me and said   Tomorrow you and I will go around Mount Athos  We will see the chestnut forests  You re from New York   I said yes   Ah  New York  I used to live there   And with that he shook my hand warmly and disappeared The next day  after getting up at 4 a m  for church  which lasted for three and a half hours  and a modest lunch around 10 30  Father Ioanikios took me for a ride in his Toyota four wheel drive  pretty much the only cars I saw on Athos  and told me his story He was Greek  but also an American citizen  and had studied mechanical engineering at New York University in the late 1970s before getting a master s degree in economics  He used to live on 32nd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues  He got a really good job with Mobil Oil in New Jersey and used to commute back and forth   Back in those days  I used to drink a little and go out   he said   You know that club that people went to    Studio 54   Yeah  I used to go there all the time    Did you ever meet Donald Trump   I asked   Trump  That guy  Forget it  He was set  living in Manhattan in his mid 20s  single and with a good job and clearly having a ball  But he told me that in his bedroom  he had a small icon of the Virgin Mary  to which he always used to pray before going to sleep  even when he d had a little too much to drink  Then  in the early 1980s on a trip to see his family in Greece  he visited Simonopetra because his grandmother s brother had been a monk there  He visited the cell of an old and very sick monk who knew his relative well  The monk couldn t speak and could barely move  But Father Ioanikios told me that this wordless encounter stayed with him when he went back to New York   The old monk had such life in his eyes  Such love   he said  He couldn t get the experience out of his mind He returned to the monastery on a second visit and then decided to give up his New York life and become a novice  That was in 1984  He became a monk in 1987 and has been there ever since  When one becomes a monk  there is a second baptism  So Christos became Ioanikios  after a Byzantine saint from the 9th century Ioanikios is not an intellectual or a theologian  He is a practical man  in charge of some of the business operations of the monastery  building projects  road repairs and buying gasoline for the cars  a procedure he explained in some detail while driving  He talked fondly of a JCB mechanical digger that he had bought and about what kind of concrete was required to fix the road after snow and storm damage during the winter  But he is a person of deep and convincing faith  He told me that he frequently prays in the forest because he feels comfortable there   It s the Garden of Eden   he said  Looking out of the window at the forest  mountains and blue sea  I sighed in agreement ImageIn Athos  the day begins at sunset CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesWhen I asked him more closely about his decision to become a monk  he simply said that when he came to Simonopetra he felt called by God and had responded to the call  Not all are called by God and not all who are called respond  But he did The first source of disorientation in the monastery is caused by time  Athos follows the old clock of Byzantium  where the day begins at sunset  According to our vulgar  modern time  matins begin at 4 a m  and last for three and a half hours  But monks get up much earlier  around 1 a m  The father told me that some of younger  keener monks often get up at 11 p m  to extend their devotions  There is at least one hour of Bible reading  one hour reciting the Jesus Prayer or the Prayer of the Holy Mountain   Lord Jesus Christ  have mercy on me   repeated rhythmically over and over again  and one hour of prostrations  The amount of prostrations depends on your age and physical ability  but there should be at least 120  some monks perform up to 2 000  This rather put my Pilates classes into perspective After the morning service  monks can nap for two hours  This is followed by a short service of 30 minutes  then lunch  the main meal of the day  at 10 30  Meals in the refectory are taken in silence and one can eat only when the head of Simonopetra  Abbot Eliseus  rings the gold bell he has beside him  When a second bell rings  it is permitted to drink either water or a sole glass of sweet red wine from their own vineyards  Meal times are fast  about 20 minutes or so  and you have to eat quickly  Throughout the meal  a monk reads aloud from a text  during my stay there was something about Julian the Apostate  Then the bell rings  everyone stops eating and they file silently out After lunch  there is four hours work  which often ends with another hour s prayer  After vespers  which lasts for 90 minutes or so  there is a modest dinner  also eaten in silence  and then two hours of free time before sleep  reading or talking with brothers  The whole cycle repeats  with its ritual variations  every day  with no vacations  no breaks and no Netflix bingeing  until your death  The cassock that the monks wear under their robes has a skull and crossbones at the bottom to remind them of mortality  As the monk Evagrius of Pontus said  the monk should always act as if he were going to die tomorrow What struck me during my stay at Simonopetra was the constant emphasis on monasticism as a living experience  as an unbroken continuity of tradition  In the case of Athos  that means at least 1 000 years  In this place  every day without exception  the rituals have been followed  Monasticism is not a theology  it is a way of life  Abbot Eliseus told me that there are two foundational monuments in Greece  the Acropolis and Athos   But one is dead and the other is living   he continued   One is an idea  the other is a living experience  Toward the end of our little road trip  Ioanikios looked at me with his clear eyes and spoke quietly   It is hard being a monk  Man was made for something else  to make a family  And we have chosen a different life  This is only possible when the energy comes from God   What is that energy   I asked   It is hard to describe  but you could call it grace   He paused   When you experience it  it s like you have no enemies  You know what Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount   Love your enemies   and you think that s a crazy thing to say  How can that be  But when you feel that energy  you feel supported  and it feels like the most obvious thing  You feel only joy and happiness   He repeated the word  joy  three times   For me  this life is hard  but I feel that joy sometimes when I m singing  ImageThe cross is the most sacred symbol of Orthodox church CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesLet me tell you about the singing  For  truth to tell  I heard Ioanikios sing at vespers before I spoke to him and had remarked on the strength of his voice  I watched him lead his fellow monks for at least 11 hours during my three days in Simonopetra  On either side of the church  there were groups of about 10 monks clustered around a lectern chanting  in a constant movement of call and response  from one side of the church to the other  With subtle harmonies and occasional deliberate discord  the voices flowed back and forth  complementing and counterpointing each other  Nothing was staccato  Everything was movement and overlapping lines  I have listened to recordings of Byzantine chants  indeed by the choir of Simonopetra itself  but they don t even begin to get close to how it felt in the church During the service  some of the monks  faces that I had seen and talked to were transformed and elevated by song  It is impossible to describe what it was like to be there  but the sheer duration and intensity of the services had a powerful effect  I was in church for about 13 hours during my stay  including a five hour vigil for the Virgin Mary on Saturday evening  There is an absolute seriousness to the monks during the services  but none of the usual clerical piousness  There was much coming and going during the service and quite a lot of talking among the monks  which seemed like the most natural thing in the world  Once I had got to know Ioanikios  he came over to me a few times during a break in the singing to ask how I was doing or tell me what was happening   This is the dance of the angels   he said  as the golden candelabra swang back and forth overhead   All of heaven is dancing    Then he would go back to his chanting Everything felt loose and completely relaxed  Here were participants in a ritual who knew exactly what they were doing  There was no judgment  hushing or disapproval of an outsider like me  The scent of myrrh hung heavy in the air from the swinging incense burner that functioned like a percussive accompaniment for the chanting  It was heady  And Anthony and I were only a few feet away from some of the monks as they sang  There were no sermons and no attempts at contemporary relevance  One had the impression that everything was song I have never seen a church seem so alive  At certain points in the Divine Liturgy on Sunday  it felt as if the whole church was glowing gold inside as the sunlight began to come up in the morning light  The physical discipline of the monks was hard to comprehend  They stood for hours on end without moving  twitching  fidgeting or biting their nails  No one drank anything or looked thirsty  At other times  all the candles were extinguished and there was a low droning chant in darkness  Toward the end of the five hour vigil  around midnight  I noticed one or two stifled yawns  but nothing much  By this time  the monks had been awake for at least 24 hours  At the end  Ioanikios looked as fresh as a daisy  I was shattered  hungry and thirsty  I hadn t eaten since the previous morning and had only a few hours  sleep   But I felt such a lightness ImageMount Athos  seen from a distance  emerging from the clouds CreditMaria Mavropoulou for The New York TimesBefore we left Athos  Ioanikios showed me his office in a ramshackle building at their tiny port of Daphne  He has dreams of transforming it into a spiritual center for pilgrims  He gave Anthony and me small  hand carved wooden crosses and placed them around our necks  He also gave me some prayer beads and told me to repeat the Jesus prayer  He said it would help dispel any worries I had in my mind   Lord Jesus Christ  have mercy on me   He repeated the words   Keep saying the words  and your cares will disappear   Don t forget us   he added in leaving   And come back every year  You are our friend now  I took off the cross after getting back to Athens late in the evening  I was back in the profane world  And back with my stupid philosophical distance and intellectual arrogance  But my time in Athos was the closest to religious experience that I have ever come  I wonder if I will ever get so close again  This is the seventh installment in an eight part

THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORYHow Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West GreatBy Ben ShapiroCLEAR AND PRESENT SAFETY The World Has Never Been Better and Why That Matters to Americans By Michael A  Cohen and Micah ZenkoWhy  exactly  are so many Americans so angry and unhappy  Almost any other country today  and any prior version of the United States  would give its eyeteeth to enjoy our manifold blessings  The country is prosperous and at peace  it faces rivals and nuisances but no major threat  The government acted decisively and capably to crush jihadist terrorism and avert a global depression  Innovation is galloping  crime is down  kids are behaving  and   the ultimate gift   Americans live almost a decade longer than as recently as 1960  President Obama was just plain right when he wrote  in 2016   If you had to choose any time in the course of human history to be alive  you d choose this one  Right here in America  right now  Yet  right here in America  populist rage and illiberal backlash are seizing the day  Why  Two new books approach the question  one of them constructively  the other not so much   The Right Side of History  looks to the politics of meaning   Clear and Present Safety   the politics of fear Remember the politics of meaning  That was the theme of a speech given by Hillary Clinton in April 1993  when she was the first lady   All of us face a crisis of meaning   she said   We need a new definition of civil society which answers the unanswerable questions posed by both the market forces and the governmental ones   Conservatives  and some liberals  made merciless sport of that speech  No one in those end of history days was in the mood to listen Well  they are listening now  Competition  consumerism and globalization worked out much better for some people than others  and the others  who saw their incomes stagnate  their dignified livelihoods evaporate and their communities wither  decided not to go quietly into that good night  In response  some of the best minds on the right are rethinking Reaganism and grappling with the need to humanize neoliberalism Into this conversation steps Ben Shapiro with  The Right Side of History   A conservative writer and speaker whose previous books include  Bullies  How the Left s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans  and  Brainwashed  How Universities Indoctrinate America s Youth   Shapiro begins by saying that we live  in the best world that has ever existed   Yet Americans are losing faith in their democracy and institutions  What changed  In a few introductory paragraphs  he dismisses economics  racial tensions and tribalism as inadequate answers  Instead   we ve spent the last two centuries carving ourselves off from the roots of our civilization   Beginning with the Jewish Bible and ancient Greece  he argues that Western civilization succeeded because it balanced the anchoring moral foundations of its Judeo Christian heritage with the revolutionary dynamism of Enlightenment liberalism  In the past couple of centuries  however  secularism has gone all in on individualism and materialism   Material human progress in the absence of spiritual fulfillment isn t enough   he writes   People need meaning   Mrs  Clinton  call your office Shapiro s spiritual challenge to secularism is not new  In fact  it is venerable  As the liberal tradition s most astute contemporary defender  Peter Berkowitz  often points out  the charge that liberal individualism is self destructively materialistic is itself an important strand of the liberal tradition  Today and in the recent past  its many facets have been explored and debated by some of the right s leading minds  David Brooks  Arthur C  Brooks  Patrick J  Deneen  Yuval Levin  Alasdair MacIntyre  Richard John Neuhaus  Michael Novak and the three most recent popes  to name just a few  Shapiro s argument claims a distinguished pedigree Why  then  did I find his book so dispiriting  Partly because  instead of contending with great ideas  it deploys them as if they were toy soldiers or characters in a video game  The head spins as he trots past thinkers from Plato to Steven Pinker  frequently rendering tendentious judgments along the way  In one typical four page passage  we carom past Marx  Clausewitz  Fichte and Hegel  Most of the name checked play either the role of tradition upholding good guys or relativistic  secular bad guys  Hume leads briskly to Darwin  then Nietzsche  then eugenics and fascism and existentialism and postmodernism and intersectionality  and here we are  kowtowing to the  knowing falsehood  of transgenderism Although I am sympathetic with elements of the author s case  his galloping reductionism left me enervated and wishing his short book were even shorter  But one section is too short  If Western civilization hangs in the balance  how do we save it  In a concluding chapter of only eight pages  Shapiro urges that children be taught that life has purpose  that they have agency  that our civilization is unique and that we are all brothers and sisters  In this way  with  boldness  and  sacrifice   parents will  make warriors of our own children   training them as  defenders of the only civilization worth fighting for  Pondering Shapiro s call for fresh recruits in a never ending culture war  I found myself wondering what sort of book he might have written had he sought out and contended with the real world puzzles and contradictions and trade offs that would complicate his story line  as David Brooks and Timothy P  Carney and Oren Cass and James and Deborah Fallows and George Packer and J  D  Vance  among others  have done  May we hope that someday Shapiro will leaven his combativeness with curiosity  Clear and Present Safety  is less ambitious and more constructive  Michael A  Cohen and Micah Zenko  who are columnists for The Boston Globe and Foreign Policy magazine  respectively  write that  Americans live in a world that is safer and freer than ever before in human history   and it is not even close   Yet  most Americans are simply unaware of the extraordinary and unprecedented political  economic and social progress that has taken place in virtually every corner of the globe over the past three decades  The closest thing America has to a national ideology today may be neurotic safetyism  the doctrine that the country s children and college students and homeland are fragile and besieged by danger  Leaving helicopter parenting and campus safe spaces to others  the authors focus on the exaggerated fear of foreign threats and terrorism   The American public is being fed  by politicians and pundits alike  a steady diet of threat inflation that has made them deeply fearful of the world outside their borders   they write  Fearmongering builds power for politicians and pundits  profits for media companies and defense contractors and publicity for social activists and reformers  The harms include swollen defense budgets  counterproductive military interventions  wasted resources  think  border wall  and demagoguery s toll on democracy itself This argument  too  is not new  In his book  Overblown  How Politicians and the Terrorism Industry Inflate National Security Threats  and Why We Believe Them   John Mueller  of Ohio State University  has written indispensably about threat inflation  and so have others  But Cohen and Zenko march through the evidence commandingly and comprehensively  and their case has never been more apt and important than it is right now  when a professional fearmonger leads the country  Recall President Trump s Inaugural Address  with its theme of  American carnage   Or his first speech to a joint session of Congress  when he lied point blank about immigrant terrorism  Or any of a thousand other examples Next time you hear the words  existential threat  from a politician  hide the silver  The greater threat to American safety is demagogic safetyism  or  as another American president said in much harder times  fear itself  

TOKYO   The Nidec Corporation likes to say it makes everything that  spins and moves   from the intricate motors that whir in hard drives to the hulking ones used on oil rigs  In recent years  things had been going well for the company  Global demand for precision engineering  especially from China  increased sales for Nidec and other Japanese companies  helping to lift long sluggish Japan out of its economic doldrums  Then sales to China plunged in November and December as the country s economy slowed  Nidec  which counts on China for about 40 percent of its revenue  slashed its profit projections by more than 25 percent   I ve been in management for 46 years   the company s founder and chief executive  Shigenobu Nagamori  told reporters in January   and seeing our monthly orders plummet like this is a first  Japan s economic rebirth is in trouble  and China shares part of the blame  Exports have slumped  and companies that depend on Japan s fast growing neighbor are slashing profit forecasts and considering idling factories  Combined with other problems   including lackluster spending at home and an aging society   China s slowdown presents a major challenge to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his namesake economic program  Abenomics  as he prepares for an important national election this summer  Specifically  it raises questions about how Mr  Abe  who took office in 2012  can fix problems at home without the boost from China s powerful growth engine Japan s economy continues to grow for now  and the fate of Abenomics is far from certain  Still  Mr  Abe s political opponents are sharpening their knives   It s the beginning of the end for Abenomics   Yuichiro Tamaki of the opposition Democratic Party for the People told reporters in mid March The Abe administration points to signs that Japan s economy is still on track   We continue to see an increase in consumer spending and capital investment  which are pillars of demand   Yoshihide Suga  chief cabinet secretary  said at a March news conference   There has been no change in the moderate recovery of the economy  But even the government is wondering how much longer the expansion can continue  Exports plummeted starting in December  Industrial output fell for three months straight before rising slightly in February  The annual salary negotiations between Japan Inc  and unions ended with only modest gains after the government softened a pressure campaign on companies to raise wages In mid March  the government downgraded its economic assessment for the first time in three years  pointing to China s economy as a major factor Mr  Abe s economic proposals were supposed to lift Japan out of a slump that had begun in the early 1990s  They included what he called the  three arrows  of Abenomics  increasing Japan s money supply  raising government spending and proposing fixes to longstanding problems that discouraged companies from hiring and investing Pumping money into Japan s economy provided the quickest fix  Under Mr  Abe s influence  the central bank began printing more yen in 2013  The value of the currency dropped  making Japanese exports more appealing to foreign buyers  ImageA construction site in Jurong  in eastern China  in November  China s economic slowdown has shown how much of Japan s growth in recent years came from Chinese purchases of its exports CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesThe strategy added gas to Japan s export machine  Except for a brief downshift in 2015 when a Chinese slowdown hit global growth  Japanese sales abroad picked up speed  Nidec and many other companies like Renesas  which makes semiconductors  and Fanuc  which makes high end robots  enjoyed steadily rising sales  The easy money policy did little to help other parts of the economy  however  Longstanding problems like deflation  bureaucracy and a shrinking population added friction to the country s growth As deflation pushed down prices  companies struggled to increase profits  Deflation generally discourages consumers from making major purchases as they wait for lower prices and better deals  An entrenched and backward looking corporate culture made it difficult for Japan to keep up with the times  Many companies have resisted government efforts to improve corporate governance and introduce more women into the work force  leading to mixed results for Mr  Abe s initiatives  As a result  corporate oversight remains weak  And although more women are working than ever  the quality of jobs available to them is still low  Increasing government spending has also proved tricky  Japan has the highest level of debt in the industrialized world  so finding money to spend can be difficult  Mr  Abe has long pushed for an increase in the country s consumption tax to 10 percent to help finance public spending  But after a first increase in 2014  to 8 percent from 5 percent  shook the economy  the government has twice delayed the politically unpopular second round Should Japan s economy continue to weaken  a tax increase could do even more damage  Nonetheless  Mr  Abe has committed to the move  Economists say he has few other options   There s no space left for thinking up some additional policies   said Shinichiro Kobayashi  a senior economist at the research arm of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ImageShinzo Abe  Japan s prime minister  delivering a speech to Parliament in January  Questions about the sustainability of Japan s growth streak could undermine one of his signature accomplishments CreditFranck Robichon EPA  via ShutterstockThat means Japan s future growth may heavily depend on China As Japan s population has aged and demand has weakened  Japanese companies have increasingly looked to China to expand revenue  Growth in the Chinese middle class and the increasing sophistication of its manufacturing base have whetted the country s appetite for high end consumer and industrial goods  all underwritten by a cheap yen But in the short term at least  that demand  too  is weakening  In January  Japan s exports to China across a wide range of industries   from consumer electronics to the machines that make them   fell more than 17 percent from a year earlier  after a drop of over 6 percent in December  Although exports to the country rebounded in February  the gains did not make up for lost ground The sudden shift in the Chinese market has forced many Japanese companies to revise their earnings forecasts down  Consumer electronics companies and automakers in particular have expressed pessimism about market conditions  with flagship brands like Nissan  Nikon and Sony moving to temper investors  expectations for sales in the country It isn t clear when Chinese demand may bounce back  Beijing has pledged to focus on job creation  made more money available for its state controlled banks to lend out and promised to make business friendly moves like cutting taxes and red tape  However  the government reduced its growth target for 2019  saying it is seeking an economic expansion that emphasizes quality over quantity The picture has been further complicated by trade frictions between the United States and China  as President Trump s decision to slap tariffs on the country has squeezed Japanese companies with manufacturing there The trade war is  the biggest risk to Japan s economy   Mr  Kobayashi of Mitsubishi UFJ said Nidec is hanging its hopes for a turnaround on China s government  Beijing  understands the current critical situation well  Mr  Nagamori said  addressing questions about the future of his company s business in China   and we re sure they ll use every possible strategy to quickly work out a solution  In the meantime  he said  the company can t dwell on its present difficulties  If it does   we won t be able to respond when demand comes rushing back   Mr  Nagamori said  He added   We ll lose a big opportunity  Hisako Ueno contributed research  

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today by email  The decision last month not to prosecute the police officers who shot and killed Stephon Clark has added renewed urgency to the debate over police shootings in this state  And the state s lawmakers have plunged in headfirst this year with a pair of dueling bills to help deal with the issue Both aim to reduce the number of police shootings  but they come from opposite perspectives  One  Assembly Bill 392  would make it easier to criminally prosecute officers who use deadly force  and is supported by the A C L U  and the family of a victim  Oscar Grant III The other  Senate Bill 230  would require law enforcement agencies to clearly set use of force policies and boost de escalation training for officers  It s backed by police unions Laurel Rosenhall  a reporter for the nonprofit state news site CALMatters  will be tracking the issue in a new podcast called  Force of Law   I talked to her about what she s learned and what the podcast hopes to accomplish   Our conversation has been edited and condensed  Jill Cowan  Why did you and CALMatters decide to tackle this in a podcast form  Laurel Rosenhall  This is a huge issue in the Legislature because it s become a huge issue in so many communities around California  And the death of Stephon Clark in Sacramento really propelled it onto the front burner for the Legislature in a way that earlier shootings hadn t done It s extremely emotional and perceived as a life or death issue by both sides  And that gets to your question about why we re doing a podcast  You know the emotion of that comes through in a podcast in a way that is different than on the printed page  And we re really conceiving of this as a project that goes from now through October when the governor has to decide on all the bills that reach his desk  Tell me about what it is in California s political climate that s giving rise to this particular debate here Obviously having a huge Democratic majority in the Legislature  which is around 75 percent right now  plus having a new governor who has a track record of taking groundbreaking and risky moves that ended up panning out well for him   I think those are definitely big factors in terms of the political landscape But I also think there are factors outside of politics that have led to this moment It s been a sea change on this issue in the last decade largely because of technological changes and between the rise of social media cellphone videos and police body cameras  And so there s just like a broader societal swell And then the death of Stephon Clark   because it happened in Sacramento about 10 miles away from the state capitol   seems to have made an impact in ways that other police shootings have not One thing that s interesting is that even with basically total Democratic control  the state s approach to this issue is still very divided  Can you talk about that In Sacramento  that s where the most drama happens  when the Democrats are not on the same page about any given policy and policing issues has been an area where they re just not all aligned You can listen to the

After several blocks  we thought we were clear of the other cab  when suddenly it was right alongside us The driver reached out his open window  grabbed the passenger door of our cab and slammed it

JERUSALEM   Israeli politics is not subtle  Threats are always existential  opponents are out to destroy everything voters hold dear  and the enemies aiming rockets at residential neighborhoods from the Galilee to the Gaza periphery can seem only scarcely more menacing than the supposed enemies within With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu polling neck and neck against Benny Gantz  a former army chief  riling up the base is as important as persuading anyone still on the fence  Right wing parties talk tough about terrorists and liberal jurists  left wing parties vie to sound like the most authentic peace loving progressives  and centrists try to show that the parties to the left and right of them are unreasonable Just take a look at the commercials targeting voters on social media as the election next Tuesday draws near  They are in Hebrew and Arabic  but much of what is shown in the ads requires little or no translation  Let s move from the political right to the left Mocking limits on lethal forceAn anti Arab party accuses the Israeli army of being too soft on terrorism  CreditCreditUnion of Right Wing PartiesA fear of letting any right wing or religious votes be wasted on a splinter party spurred Mr  Netanyahu to broker a deal that could allow one such splinter  the extremist anti Arab party Otzma Yehudit  or Jewish Power  into his next governing coalition  But how does that party appeal to voters With absurdist satire  of course  An Israeli soldier is confronted with a knife wielding Palestinian attacker  but before he can shoot in self defense  a military lawyer   tape measure in hand   intercedes to make sure he adheres to rules of engagement that Jewish Power considers too restrictive More settlement  no apologiesThe New Right party emerged to advance the careers of Naftali Bennett  the education minister  and Ayelet Shaked  the justice minister  Ms  Shaked has pushed the Israeli Supreme Court to the right  particularly over settlement of the West Bank  She wants to keep her job and continue that work  Mr  Bennett wants to become defense minister Their ads have often been lighthearted  though some jokes have misfired  But their core messages can be seen in two more sober minded videos  In one  Mr  Bennett aggressively sticks up for Israel in interviews with Western and Arab journalists  showing he believes the best defense is a good offense In another  Ms  Shaked plants herself outside an unspecified Jewish settlement outpost and replays familiar criticisms by settlers  opponents  which she dismisses as  background noise   Then she tells voters to  settle down   I still have a lot to do here   A headline promises that  Shaked will tame the High Court  Putting the ultra Orthodox in uniformThe Russian immigrants who voted en masse for Avigdor Lieberman  the former defense minister  are not as potent a political force anymore  and polls show Mr  Lieberman s career and his party  Yisrael Beiteinu  are in peril  To survive  he offers a blunt slogan   Both right wing and secular  Driving home the second half of that formula  Mr  Lieberman highlights his battle to end the decades old exemption from military service for the ultra Orthodox  or Haredim  whose rabbis have fought tooth and nail to preserve it You don t need to understand the prayers to grasp that men with sidecurls in olive drab and with rifles at their feet are  as Mr  Lieberman assures voters   the worst nightmare  of the Haredi rabbis  Read our guide to the Israeli elections  Belittling the challengersMr  Netanyahu s Likud party is putting out ads at the fastest clip  sometimes several a day  with President Trump frequently playing a supporting role  Mr  Gantz  the center right candidate  is invariably belittled by a sneering announcer as  weak left  Here  Likud taunts Mr  Gantz for his poor performance in a recent TV interview  and his No  2  Yair Lapid  for saying Mr  Netanyahu was wrecking Israel s ties with the United States  Guess who we see in the very next clip bestowing upon Mr  Netanyahu a big political prize  Hint  It takes place in the White House   It s too much for them   the ad says of the challengers   Netanyahu  Strong  Right  Successful  For a tough job  a gang of fourMr  Gantz s ads  like his campaign  have vacillated between making the most of his rough hewed military background and trying to dress him up like a slick politician  His Blue and White party s most effective ads may be those in which he surrounds himself with his top running mates   two other former army chiefs and Mr  Lapid   and talks turkey about what needs to be changed and why Mr  Netanyahu needs to go In this spot  titled  A change in priorities   the specifics are interesting enough  Mr  Gantz says he does not need any lectures from Mr  Netanyahu on security or strength  Mr  Lapid says the rise in the cost of prescription drugs could have been offset by canceling the  superfluous plane    an Israeli Air Force One   that Mr  Netanyahu  insisted on buying for himself  But the words are less important than the visuals  tough guys sitting around plotting how they are going to take down Mr  Netanyahu and fix what is ailing their country  That job has indeed been too much for those who have challenged Mr  Netanyahu in the past  but their message is that together they can pull it off Slashing Netanyahu from the leftThe once mighty Labor party has shrunk to a wisp of its old self  largely because of the rank and file s disenchantment with the party s current leader  Avi Gabbay  But Labor still has some moves  Its ads ridiculing Mr  Netanyahu have been the most cutting and the quickest to capitalize on the news With Israelis from the Gaza border to the suburbs of Tel Aviv routinely running for cover  Labor is hammering Mr  Netanyahu   widely known by his nickname   Bibi    for allowing Hamas to get away with firing rockets into Israel   No security  No peace   this ad says furiously  over images of blazing farmland and cowering children   No reason to vote for Bibi  The view from Tel Aviv s towersIn a choice that could prove either canny or just plain out of touch  Tamar Zandberg of Meretz  the left wing secular party that supports a two state solution with the Palestinians  makes a show of her urbane Tel Aviv lifestyle  asking what kind of Israel voters want to see after the election  a darker  more isolated and violent one  or an Israel of justice  freedom and equality She points to battles for gay rights and affordable housing  laments the rise of the right wing  shows herself meeting President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and embraces the  leftist  label  saying the only way Israel can reverse the path it is on is if people who think like her vote for a  strong left that will have confidence in itself  Demonized  Arabs push backThe strongest Arab party  Hadash Taal  actually includes both Palestinian citizens and Jewish Israelis  and it is running a Hebrew language ad that powerfully addresses anti Arab incitement by Mr  Netanyahu  other right wing leaders and ordinary Israelis You do not need to know what is being said  suffice it to say that when you hear the word  Aravim   or Arabs  it is being used in ways that the people on the screen  whether Arab or Jew  would find hurtful Many Arab citizens of Israel are sitting out the election  partly because the chief alternative to Mr  Netanyahu  Mr  Gantz  entered the campaign by boasting about the numbers of Palestinian militants he killed as commander of Israel s 2014 war in Gaza  And a low Arab turnout  paradoxically  could sink Mr  Gantz s chances of toppling Mr  Netanyahu In this Arabic language ad  Hadash Taal  which would likely support a Gantz led government  wields his commercial against him  saying that 530 children were also killed in the Gaza war   Keep your voice clean   it pleads  by voting for Hadash Taal   not for a man with  the blood of Gaza s children  on his hands  

LOS ANGELES   It had become an inspiring symbol of success in South Los Angeles  but on Monday the Marathon Clothing store was transformed into a makeshift memorial for the rapper Nipsey Hussle  the co owner  who was fatally shot outside its doors  stunning fans across the city and the music world Some prayed and cried  while others left candles  flowers and signs to express their condolences for Hussle  born Ermias Joseph Asghedom  who had grown up in the Crenshaw area and stayed on to help his neighborhood even after becoming big enough to make it out  A steady flow of passing cars on Slauson Avenue blared tracks from his latest album Bela Vega  28  a fan  fought back tears as she explained how Hussle  33  had given hope to people who had also grown up around gang violence  His fans and neighbors clung to lyrics and interviews in which he advocated self improvement  his financial investments in the community  she said  showed he was serious about creating a ladder for other people who had grown up in similar circumstances  But now  his death  and the questions surrounding it  have reignited longstanding fears about violence and despair in the area  The story repeats over and over again  and you just ask   When does it stop    Ms  Vega said   This is our community  But do I want my son to grow up over here  No  No  Two others were wounded in the shooting  and a suspect has yet to be identified  according to the police Hussle remained a regular presence at the strip mall off Crenshaw Boulevard that houses Marathon  Outside the store on Monday  mourners shared stories about times they had summoned up the courage to say hello to him and the smiles he had flashed back  More than a dozen people were injured as a stampede broke out at a memorial for Nipsey Hussle   He meant everything to the community   said Lesly Marroquin  26   This was all him  His music  he speaks real facts  He talks about how he grew up  He wanted people to see what he went through  to show people they could change  He was a role model  The area  comprising several predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods in South Los Angeles  is home to many working  and middle class families  Its streets are lined with single family homes and low rise apartment buildings  while its main boulevards and thoroughfares feature strip mall businesses and fast food restaurants  The area has a troubled history with gang violence  something Hussle addressed in his music  Crime has remained a significant concern  residents said Monday  even as citywide rates have fallen in recent decades An autopsy found that Hussle died from gunshot wounds to the head and torso  the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner Coroner determined  Chief Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department noted Sunday night that in one week there had been 10 homicides and 26 shooting victims across Los Angeles   That s 36 families left picking up the pieces   he said on Twitter  Despite those numbers  the yearly total of homicides in the city of Los Angeles  which includes Crenshaw  has decreased steeply in the last 30 years  from a peak of 1 092 in 1992 to 259 in 2018 ImageCandles and tributes outside the store on Slauson Avenue CreditRozette Rago for The New York TimesStill  Hussle made improving South Los Angeles a priority  After his rap career took off  he diversified beyond the music industry  becoming a local businessman and philanthropist  From the beginning  Nipsey Hussle has been a critical part of  DestinationCrenshaw  even inspiring the name   Marqueece Harris Dawson  a city councilman who represents South Los Angeles  said on Instagram  Destination Crenshaw is a project devised to promote black cultural history in South Los Angeles Last year  Hussle  who taught himself how to build computers  helped open a center in Crenshaw dedicated to connecting underrepresented groups with technology companies  according to an interview with The Los Angeles Times  Growing up as a kid  I was looking for somebody   not to give me anything   but somebody that cared   he told the newspaper   Someone that was creating the potential for change and that had an agenda outside of their own self interests  As a teenager  he dropped out of high school and became involved in street life and joined a gang  according to interviews  as he tried to start a rap career He began releasing music in the mid 2000s  and first made his name with the  Bullets Ain t Got No Name  series of mixtapes  which established him as an inheritor of the storied lineage of Los Angeles gangster rap  carrying a torch lit by N W A  Snoop Dogg and DJ Quik  He was a muscular rapper who delivered direct  unromanticized lyrics about navigating the challenges of street life On singles like  Hussle in the House   which had the trademark g funk synthesizer whine and a reference to  Straight Outta Compton   Hussle rapped authoritatively as a resident of Crenshaw and especially the notorious Slauson Avenue   I m from where homicide boost the economy   he delivered matter of factly   I came from nothing so did every other rapper save the speculation real banger  gun clapper  Slender and a little grizzled  with slick braids and a grown out beard  he identified as a member of the Rollin 60 s Crips gang  which he chalked up to history  circumstance and survival   I m not promoting it  I m just speaking on it   he said in a 2010 interview with Complex magazine  I feel like I m an ambassador   the rapper added   I m more focused on giving solutions and inspiration more than anything  He had plans to meet on Monday afternoon with representatives from Jay Z s Roc Nation and officials from the Los Angeles Police Department to talk about preventing gang violence  according to Steve Soboroff  the Los Angeles police commissioner As his music career careened forward  Hussle largely stayed the independent route  releasing most of his projects through the All Money In label that he founded in 2010  But his entrepreneurial streak often earned more attention than his songs  namely the marketing coup tied to his 2013 mixtape  Crenshaw   in which he sold 1 000 copies for  100 each  including 100 copies to Jay Z  who respected the hustle  ImageNipsey Hussle spoke to children at an event last year in Los Angeles  After his rap career took off  he diversified beyond the music industry  becoming a local businessman and philanthropist CreditJerritt Clark Getty ImagesThe move came as digital piracy and free music online had all but sapped CDs of value  leading Hussle to start his  Proud2Pay movement   It ISN T the price of the plastic case and polyurethane disc   he said at the time   it s the price of Revolution  The price of Rebellion against an industry that has tricked us all into making products that have no soul for fear of not being heard if we don t  It wasn t until last year that he released his proper debut studio album   Victory Lap   via Atlantic Records  in partnership with All Money In   The LP debuted at No  4 on the Billboard chart and was nominated for best rap album at the Grammys  losing to Cardi B s  Invasion of Privacy  He collaborated with a wide array of rappers  including Drake  the Game  Snoop Dogg  Childish Gambino  Rick Ross and YG  He was an occasional actor and had a memorable performance as a rapper having a feminist awakening on the CW sitcom  Crazy Ex Girlfriend  Hussle also guest starred on YG s anti Trump hip hop anthem  FDT   rapping   I m from a place where you prolly can t go speakin  for some people that you prolly ain t know it s pressure built up and it s prolly gonna blow  At the same time as he released  Victory Lap   which featured Puff Daddy and Kendrick Lamar  Hussle helped open a 4 700 square foot co working space in Crenshaw called Vector 90  dedicated to increasing diversity in science  technology  engineering and mathematics  In our culture  there s a narrative that says   Follow the athletes  follow the entertainers    he told The Los Angeles Times last year   And that s cool but there should be something that says   Follow Elon Musk  follow Zuckerberg   I think that with me being influential as an artist and young and coming from the inner city  it makes sense for me to be one of the people that s waving that flag  He added   I just want to give back in an effective way  His death drew condolences from across the music industry and beyond  with everyone from Drake and Rihanna to Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook recognizing the stamp he left on his city  It s dangerous to be an MC   Nas wrote on Instagram   It s dangerous to have money  Dangerous To Be A Black Man    Nipsey is a True voice  He will never be silenced  Hussle was in a relationship with the actress and model Lauren London  with whom he had a son  Kross  He also had a daughter  Emani  from a previous relationship Outside the Marathon store on Monday  Marcus Adams  24  said the rapper  was an inspiration  for him as a young black man who grew up in South Los Angeles  Mr  Adams  who is studying business administration at West Los Angeles College  said Hussle s music reflected his own experience trying to avoid the pitfalls of growing up in an impoverished community  I came because I just felt I owed it to him   he said   It s a job to come here and show my condolences   

RICHMOND  Va    More than a dozen state lawmakers filed onto the stage  summoned by the smiling leader of their state  Ralph S  Northam  the governor of Virginia On the governor s right were a handful of House Democrats  who as a group in February said they were  no longer confident in the governor s representation of Virginians   after learning of a shocking racist photo on Mr  Northam s medical school yearbook page On his left were mostly Republicans  including the speaker of the House  Delegate Kirk Cox  who d declared that Mr  Northam s  ability to lead and govern is permanently impaired  Some on stage were members of the legislative black caucus  which called the yearbook photo  disgusting  reprehensible  and offensive  and  a complete betrayal  Even so  as Mr  Northam took out a pen at the event last week and signed bills to overhaul the state s foster care system  the lawmakers of both parties stood behind him  grinning and clapping This is the strange  suspended state of Virginia politics  just two months after scandal after scandal seemed to be devouring the state s government from the top down In the space of a week in early February  the public was stunned by revelations about each of the three highest statewide elected officials  all Democrats  the racist photo in the governor s yearbook  accusations of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor  and the attorney general s appearance in blackface at a party in college  Protesters and news crews swarmed the Statehouse  Calls for resignations came from fellow Virginia Democrats  Republicans and even 2020 presidential candidates And then   It just went poof   said Natalie Draper  a librarian sitting in the back of a coffeehouse last week in Richmond   It s like it never happened  Virginians have various theories as to how this surreal normalcy set in Some say the whole mess was so exhausting and embarrassing that by the time the legislature adjourned on Feb  24  the outrage had burned itself out  Others point to polls that showed Virginia voters were considerably less hungry for resignations than their representatives were  Some political observers mused about more fundamental changes to the life span of scandal  describing President Trump s approach to bad press as if it were a revolutionary medical breakthrough  Don t apologize  move on  and everybody will talk about something else next week   is how Ben Tribbett  a Democratic strategist  described it   Maybe we ve been doing it wrong over the last 100 years  For the Democrats  perhaps above all  there are the blunt political realities  Whatever may happen in the 2021 election for governor  every seat in the Republican controlled Virginia General Assembly will be up this November  and Democrats have a chance to take back power in at least one chamber of the legislature  That will be hard enough now  given the bales of fodder Republicans now have for attack ads  But the idea of trying to raise money and hold rallies while spurning the three highest officeholders in the state came to be seen by many Democrats as just a needless handicap Betsy Carr  a Democratic delegate  said shortly after stepping off the stage last week with Mr  Northam that voters  want to move on    They want positive things to happen  they re concerned about the elections   she said That sort of hard pragmatism is common among Democratic figures these days  But it is not unanimous  Many younger people in the party  in particular  are frustrated by what they see as the leadership s hurry to move on from the scandals rather than come to grips with them ImageGov  Ralph Northam and his wife  Pam Northam  third from left  posing for photos after the dedication of a historical marker for the civil rights leader Dr  Dorothy Height at a library in Richmond CreditParker Michels Boyce for The New York Times Winning is important   said Taikein Cooper  the 30 year old chairman of the Prince Edward County Democratic Party   but we also have to have some morals  In the immediate wake of the scandals  the governor all but disappeared  either avoiding public events or being explicitly disinvited from them The gears of state government kept turning   bills were signed or vetoed  cabinet secretaries did their work   but Mr  Northam s public resurfacing was slow  beginning with an appearance in early March at the third annual Public Safety Unmanned Aircraft Systems Conference Still  it is only in recent days that his public schedule has approached normal   or at least  something that looks normal from the outside  I think groups are struggling with   What do we do  What do we do about inviting him  Do we want him the centerpiece of an announcement    said Mr  Cox  the House speaker  who spoke with Mr  Northam at the bill signing for the first time since February   It s going to be pretty hard to say we re just going to have a normal governorship for the next three years   Mr  Cox said Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax  too  has been showing up at public events more often  But rather than trying to change the subject from the allegations against him  he dives right into them  even unprompted  as he did on the last day of the legislative session in a surprise speech comparing himself to a victim of lynching Mark Herring  the attorney general  has taken questions from the public on a few occasions since his own blackface scandal broke  But when he talked recently with reporters in Washington  after a Supreme Court hearing on gerrymandering  no one asked him about the episode Democrats fully acknowledge that there is unfinished business in all this  But they cite the lack of resolution as a reason to slow down on those immediate calls for resignations  Most people wanted to give the governor time to sort out what had happened   said State Senator Scott A  Surovell   I think a lot of people question whether he s in that picture  and they re waiting for more information about who s actually in it  Initially  Mr  Northam apologized for appearing in the yearbook photo  which shows a man in blackface makeup standing next to someone wearing a Klan robe and hood  But since then  he has insisted that he is actually not either of the people in the picture  and he has pledged to get to the bottom of the matter  The mechanism for that appears to be an inquiry that began last month  conducted on behalf of Eastern Virginia Medical School by the law firm McGuireWoods That investigation into the role of racism in the past and present culture of the school was also examining the circumstances of the infamous photo  No findings have been announced yet  and the investigation is expected to wrap up in the next few weeks Still  Mr  Northam made another pledge around the time he announced that he was staying put  to focus for the rest of his term on addressing racial inequities in American life  a theme he now repeatedly emphasizes in speeches The governor  welcomes the opportunity for future conversations  on improving racial equity  said a spokeswoman  Ofirah Yheskel  who pointed out various measures the governor has supported in recent weeks that reflect  his focus on the equity issues  One of the chief barometers of Mr  Northam s success on this front has become the opinion of the legislative black caucus  to which other Democrats have readily deferred since the scandals broke  Members of the caucus have laid out their priorities in meetings and conversations with the governor  and they say he has mostly abided ImageAt a memorial service for Dr  Dorothy Height at a church in South Richmond  Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax spoke about Dr  Height s advocacy against lynching  false accusations and denial of due process  themes he has hit repeatedly since the scandals erupted CreditParker Michels Boyce for The New York Times He s been trying hard  from what I can see   said Delegate Lamont Bagby  the chairman of the caucus   He s stumbled on his own feet a couple times  I think he would agree to that   But Mr  Bagby gave his approval to the governor s choice of bills to veto and amendments to propose over the past few weeks  and he said he believed that long delayed but badly needed conversations about race had begun At a Baptist church in Richmond on a recent Sunday afternoon  Mr  Northam delivered brief remarks referring to lingering inequities at a ceremony in honor of Dorothy Height  a grande dame of the civil rights movement  He was followed at the pulpit by Mr  Fairfax   the first time they appeared in public together since the scandals erupted The contrast was stark Mr  Fairfax began with praise for Ms  Height s  oratory around the issue of anti lynching   but it quickly became clear he was also talking about other matters  She saw what was happening in this country  where people were being falsely accused   Mr  Fairfax said   They were not given due process  They were having their lives in so many ways impacted negatively  in some ways taken away  because people wanted not to get to the truth but ultimately wanted things changed in a negative way for nefarious reasons  It was barely subtext  and he would revisit these themes more forthrightly two nights later at a Women s History Month mixer in Hampton  Va   an event sponsored by the local chapter of the N A A C P  After the lieutenant governor gave a short speech on his fight against  fabricated claims and false allegations   the crowd erupted in cheers of support Like Mr  Northam  Mr  Fairfax has insisted on an investigation into the accusations against him  He contends that he is being accused of sexual assault and rape for encounters that were consensual His demands for an investigation are echoed by fellow Democrats  as Mr  Northam s are  But it remains unclear where exactly such an investigation is to come from  If it s proved in a court of law  something needs to be done  but we re not there yet   Ms  Carr  the lawmaker  said Prosecutors in North Carolina and Massachusetts have been in contact with the two women who accused Mr  Fairfax   Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson   but there has been no public indication yet that a criminal investigation has been formally opened  Republican lawmakers announced plans for an investigative hearing  and both accusers have said repeatedly that they are willing to testify publicly as part of a bipartisan process  but Democratic lawmakers have balked  seeing such a hearing as a fruitless exercise prone to partisan grandstanding  At this point  there are few other obvious options  We are actually engaged in initiating processes that will make the truth known   Mr  Fairfax said at the event in Hampton  speaking over the live jazz music and pleas for him to join in group photos  He declined to elaborate further On Sunday  a lawyer for Mr  Fairfax issued a news release saying that Mr  Fairfax had undergone polygraph examinations administered by a former F B I  agent  and that the results  demonstrated that Lt  Gov  Fairfax was telling the truth  in denying the allegations  A spokeswoman said these exams were separate from the  processes  that Mr  Fairfax had spoken of earlier And so life goes on in Virginia  with the legislature coming back this week for a quick session and with the political jockeying getting underway before the primaries in June  Democratic lawmakers who are asked what may come next on the scandal front have no concrete answer  most say their constituents would rather hear about roadwork  school financing and health care Those  after all  are matters that state politicians can actually change  as opposed to the things that apparently they cannot  The calls for resignation have not been rescinded   Delegate Jeff Bourne  a member of the legislative black caucus  said a few days before appearing with the governor at a bill signing ceremony   But I think it s one of those things where we are operating in the current state of affairs  And the current state of affairs is that the governor and lieutenant governor are still there   

Imagine that you re sitting in a theater  that you ve been sitting there for 19 hours  with five more to go  Well  not only sitting  At times  you ve been asked by the show s maestro and star  the drag queen and performance artist Taylor Mac  to dash across the room to re enact the Oklahoma Land Rush  or in a ritualized recompense for white flight  to  move to the suburbs  by surrendering your coveted orchestra seat to someone who was stuck in the back  You ve grown used to the surprises of this piece  a 24 hour long concert in which Mac works his way through 246 songs that were popular in America from 1776 to the present  interspersed with a radical narrative of American history  You came expecting that you would be challenged  provoked  entertained   why else sign up for a full day  participatory history lesson administered by a queen who is currently wearing a macram owl with a yellow brick tail  a homage to Judy Garland and the Stonewall riots   a sequined miniskirt  a camouflage cape with cutout psychedelic peace signs and an iridescent Afro space helmet    but you aren t prepared for what comes next The band strikes up a tender ballad  The lights are lowered  and a disco ball drops  You re back at your middle school prom  The song Mac is about to sing  the 1975  Snakeskin Cowboys   by the hard rocker and N R A  board member Ted Nugent  is sinisterly homophobic  warning guys with too fancy shoes to get off the dance floor  But Mac s version   he and his music director  Matt Ray  preserved the lyrics and transformed the music   is romantic and wistful  Mac tells everyone to find a partner of the same sex for a slow dance A Pavlovian self consciousness kicks in  You are 13 again  ungainly and unsure if you have bad breath  Add to that the awkwardness of having to touch a stranger  Add to that the discomfort of dancing with another woman  something you ve never done before  Or if you have done it before   if  in fact  it was your middle school dream to do so openly and without shame   there s the question of whether your partner ever has  and whether she s comfortable with it All over the room  people arrange themselves into pairs  holding one another at a respectful distance  giggling so much that it creates a din  The laughter is cut by Mac s voice  commanding everyone to pull their partner into a real embrace  You feel strange about it  but you do as he asks  because you ve spent a whole day and night in his presence and you trust he s taking you somewhere  You ve even come to trust the people around you  who have undergone this wondrous ordeal of a show with you  The feeling in the room changes again   it s hushed  heating up  Mac s voice  strong and assured  sings   Oh  snakeskin cowboys Who the hell you think you are You re dancing around with your high heeled boots Don t think that should get you far   Same sex couples are locked in hundreds of embraces  People are crying The multilayered drama that Mac creates   of awkwardness yielding to grace  of exhaustion yielding to focus  of strangers yielding to intimacy   is typical of his masterwork   A 24 Decade History of Popular Music   which he made with Ray  along

more than 60 cities around the country and will continue to do so   it will have its European debut in Berlin this fall  and he plans to bring it back to New York in 2020 Sometimes Mac performs the piece over two days  sometimes over four  other times over weeks  Only one time has he done it all at once  in 24 hours straight   at St  Ann s Warehouse in Brooklyn in October 2016  just a month

intricate  a triumph that insists on   because of its duration  because of the degree to which it involves the audience   moments of failure  You could describe it in 20 different ways without capturing all of its dimensions  It s a retelling of American history through a queer perspective  focused on various communities that have been torn apart by discrimination  land theft  disease  war  migration  and then rebuilt themselves  It s a catalog of popular song  a soundtrack of America s dancing and mourning since the 18th century  It s a confrontation with unsettling artifacts that we ve  forgotten  dismissed or buried   as Mac puts it  like  Massa s in de Cold Ground   a Stephen Foster song from 1852 that imagines slaves weeping at their master s grave  it s also a showcase for songs of protest  like Patti Smith s  People Have the Power   or just plain sexiness  like Prince s  Purple Rain   It s an act of impossible  mind bending virtuosity and endurance  as Mac  backed by a 23

It s a participatory performance piece that puts pressure on its audience members  breaking them down and building them back up by essentially asking them to co create the show Mac s own description of his ambition is deceptively simple   All I m trying to do is to get the audience to consider things   perpetually    Consideration  is one of Mac s favorite words  He s asking  through the sheer force and ingenuity and joy of his performances  that the audience stop on the threshold of judgment and dwell with him in the realm of uncertainty  His hope is that someone might be still mulling the ideas from his shows years  or even decades  later  Every single audience I ve gotten to do it   except one   he said  describing the queer prom   The earnest dream is that they will consider what it means to slow dance with someone of their same gender  But more importantly  it s that they consider whether or not they were able to   The moment is  in part  Mac s gift to the queer people in the room  It might be a salve for their memories of isolated longing  it might be  as Mac put it  the first time  many of them have seen straight people stretch toward queerness  where it wasn t mocking or some kind of ridicule  So it can be very  very  very moving   But that s not the goal  Moving is never the goal  Mac is after something more radical than cozy catharsis  He won t allow the audience

maybe you re not going to be safe   Mac told me recently  This month  he ll be bringing that sense of danger to Broadway  with his new play   Gary  A Sequel to Titus Andronicus   Mac is not performing in it   Nathan Lane stars as the play s title character  a clown in the waning days of the Roman Empire who aspires to be a fool  and George C  Wolfe directs   but it bears all the marks of a Taylor Mac production  high spectacle  profound emotion juxtaposed with outr humor  verbal acrobatics and a searching ethical drive Over ginger tea  in the compact  elegant apartment he shares with his husband in Manhattan  Mac explained to me the series of bizarre events that led to the creation of  Gary   Onstage  Mac  who is 45  has an almost shamanistic grandeur and a skewering wit  But folded into a chair  in jeans and a simple sweater  he was gentle and attentive  He has sharp blue eyes and a serene  unfazed smile   simultaneously unsurprisable yet open to surprise Two weeks after his marathon performance of  A 24 Decade History  in Brooklyn  he returned to California  where he grew up  to care for his mother  who was dying of breast cancer  She was a Christian Scientist  and she believed  as Mac put it  that humans are a perfect reflection of God    so we can t get sick  because God can t get sick   Mac and his sister flew home to do hospice work  everything from arranging pillows to holding her through her pain  without being able to acknowledge to her that she was dying  It was a bewildering yet familiar experience of repression  growing up in her household  it was only permissible to feel  certain things  but not the whole range   Shortly before she died  Trump was elected president A few months later  Mac was in Mexico  where he and his husband like to spend time  trying to process all that had happened  They were warned to stay out of the water because a tourist had been pulled out to sea by the strong current and disappeared  Mac went running on the beach early one morning when he came upon the washed up body  The consecutive horrors that he experienced   his mother s denial of reality  even in death  and then this corpse appearing out of the ocean   converged with his despair over the election  his sense that  we are living in a revenge tragedy that s trying to be a comedy that isn t succeeding   He was thinking about sequels  the ways in which American history repeats its cycles of progress and retrenchment  Mac set himself a challenge  Could he take everything that was ugly  grotesque  dispiriting in the world  put it onstage and transform it The result is  Gary   Mac s 14th play  many of his earlier works have been performed in New York and internationally  including  The Be a st of Taylor Mac    The Lily s Revenge  and  Hir     Gary  is a ribald comedy set in the aftermath of the massacre that ends Shakespeare s notoriously violent  Titus Andronicus   Mac has taken three minor characters from the original   a clown  a maid and a midwife   and placed them center stage  The curtain opens on a gigantic mound of corpses in the deposed emperor s banquet hall  which is being used as a makeshift morgue  Bodies are piled chaotically around the space   half clothed  exposed  somehow both gruesome and hilarious  Gary  a street clown who comes from generations of clowns  has just narrowly escaped execution by volunteering to help clean up the mess left by all the killing  He enters the stage brimming with excitement at his promotion to maid  his secret aspiration to become a person of consequence suddenly unleashed  In the banquet hall  he meets Janice  an old acquaintance  who has spent her life as a maid at court and is running the improvised morgue  She s a no nonsense  stalwart sort of woman who has managed to hold on to her job through coups and rapes and usurpations of all sorts  The two immediately clash As Janice demonstrates the gruesome work  they must process each body by pressing out all the flatulence and suctioning out blood and feces through a primitive tubing system   Gary muses about all the reasons they shouldn t do it  Why must they be cogs in the conflicts of the powerful  Isn t there some other way  A raucous argument ensues  about revolution versus incrementalism  the power of satire versus the power of straight talk  the question of whether they should simply get the job done or abandon it altogether  Gary confesses that his lifelong dream is to become a fool   the sort of comedian who uses his wits to tell powerful men the truth about themselves  It has suddenly dawned on him that he is an artist  and much to Janice s disgust  he occasionally breaks into dreamy rhyming couplets  He suggests that they use the bodies as the basis for a performance  or what he proudly calls  a fooling   He challenges Janice to unlock whatever passions lie buried inside her to join him in an act of subversive creation Wolfe  the director  says what he loves about the play is  how fragile emotions and ridiculous situations and a slightly absurdist truth can all share the same space  That  at any given moment  is American madness    Gary  is very funny  but it s also sincere  a play about people who are trying to devise a new way to clean up violence and destruction that is not of their making A few weeks before the previews of  Gary   I sat with Mac in the balcony of the Booth Theater  observing the organized chaos onstage  The corpses  grayish  sandbag like forms  were piled on a 14 foot wooden structure with a staircase traversing it  Bodies were draped  flung  stacked on top of it  some with their legs splayed  revealing their genitals  About a dozen people stood around looking at the pile  A stagehand was constructing a butt and attaching it to one of the bodies near the front  Wolfe lounged in the lap of a corpse and gesticulated expressively as he talked with the set designer  Santo Loquasto  A few moments later  Loquasto removed a part of a leg from one of the bodies and handed it to an assistant who had materialized from behind a side curtain and then promptly disappeared It was funny  but also poignant  to see a group of people pondering the logistics of this huge pile of bodies and delicately ministering to it  It was also a real life enactment of the question that the characters in the play endlessly debate  What do we do with a situation that is grotesque and unworkable and make of it something wondrous  To answer it  Mac arms them with pretty much every tool human beings have at their disposal  slapstick humor  collaboration  revolutionary zeal and poetry Mac s aesthetic is proudly maximalist  it s not just a style but a system of ethics   I make a lot of work that has heterogeneity in it   genre  forms  style all squished together   he said  He finds the trend of stripped down minimalism that has taken hold   whether in design  in fashion  in tech and especially in theater   suspect   Subtlety is a privilege   he said  When I asked him what he meant  he explained   The trend of subtlety in the theater is one of people who didn t have to shout in the streets and do direct action protest in order to stay alive because the government was refusing to acknowledge the AIDS epidemic  Like  Larry Kramer is not subtle  right  So that s what I mean  Subtlety is a privilege  And so when I go to the theater and I see people being subtle  I m like  Oh  great  what do you  expletive  want  What are the stakes  What are you risking  His tone  which was usually even  became agitated  But then he started to complicate the idea   I like maximalism because minimalism is in it  This play    he meant  Gary     seems like so much and crazy  crazy  crazy  but there are moments of total stillness in this play  But when you go and see a play where it s all subtle  subtle  subtle  there s no moment of praise  In the play  Gary gives a beautiful speech about noticing the sky for the first time in his life   he wonders not so much at the sky but at his own capacity for wonder  Its simplicity is arresting amid all the gore  like a breeze blowing through the morgue  When you don t see maximalism   Mac continued   I just always feel like you re not really giving it all to me  You re hiding  You re hiding from me  Because I know there s craze in your life  It drives me crazy in the theater because     Mac was animated again   You go to the theater to see a part of yourself you haven t seen before  Mac was reticent when I asked him about his early life  hesitant to put forward the story of a queer kid who overcomes obstacles  because  we ve heard that five million times   It is what happened to him  but he was much more interested in talking about ideas  his work  how he  found my way to love   He was brought up by his mother  an art teacher  his father died when he was 4   She was complex and contradictory   encouraging his creativity and squashing it  He described her as loving  but  she didn t always understand what that meant  She had a sentimental concept of love   She found his gayness terrifying  They lived in Stockton  a conservative  conformist place  and Mac stood out for being theatrical and effeminate  It was the  80s  a time when  queerness was a national conversation because of AIDS  but a negative national conversation  So it was really present in the consciousness of a lot of people  but not in a nice way  When he was 9  Mac got involved in the local children s theater run by a man who had attended Juilliard and was a dynamo and a sophisticate  There he met his three best friends   Marcy  Kat and John  all of whom were queer but not yet out   and they became his chosen family  If his home life was repressive  the world he created with them was openhearted  intellectually curious and supportive  They are still close In 1987  when he was 14  he and Marcy went to San Francisco to attend the AIDS Walk  It was only an hour and a half s drive from Stockton but felt like a world apart  Seeing thousands of gay people marching in the street was thrilling   I d never seen an out homosexual before   Mac told me   I hadn t seen them on TV  I hadn t seen them in movies  I never met one   He was overjoyed  but the scene was also devastating  Amid the displays of celebration and pride were hundreds of people dying of AIDS  their partners and friends pushing them in wheelchairs   It was ironically more beautiful than anything I d ever encountered   Mac said   because I knew that my family wasn t going to rally around me if I was ever dying of AIDS  I mean  my sister would  but my extended family wasn t going to be pushing me in a wheelchair  fighting for my rights  They just would have been ashamed   It was his first experience of what he called  real love  not the pretend love that family often claims   It also introduced Mac to an idea that would become a fulcrum of his work  using your brokenness to build All through high school  he and Marcy would drive to San Francisco  sometimes just to walk around for a few hours  They weren t able to articulate it at the time  but they longed to be among other gay people  to see a possible future for themselves He eventually made it out of Stockton  to San Francisco  and a few years later to New York City  where he enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts  Students were given free tickets to the theater  and Mac went to shows at least four nights a week  seeing everything from lavish Broadway productions to obscure basement experiments  But there was one show he returned to more than 40 times  Bill Irwin and David Shiner s  Fool Moon   a series of clowning vignettes  Mac was particularly fixated on one bit when Shiner called up several audience members to participate in the making of a silent film  Two people would play a pair of lovers  another a murderous  jilted husband  and Shiner would direct them in a scene  Seeing this night after night  Mac noticed that Shiner had developed  a Rolodex of possibilities    dozens of strategies for handling the people he invited onstage  depending on their reactions  It was improvisation guided by mastery   And what I noticed about the audience was that even the smell in the room would get different   Mac said   When he would call the people up onstage  everyone would lean forward  and people would start to get nervous in the room for the people on the stage  And I thought  That s super fascinating  Mac wanted to scale this kind of interaction  How could he take that frisson of excitement  nervousness and collaboration that was happening to those few people onstage and make it happen to an entire room  How could he treat the audience like living sculpture  At a baseball game  everyone stands up  cheers  sings  directs their energy toward the ritual of rooting for a team  Couldn t that same infectious sense of community be coaxed out of an audience in a theater Mac s ideas about how to provoke and mold an audience developed over years of performing in drag clubs all over the city  a scene he was drawn to out of  two parts desperation  two parts joy  two parts circumstance   He wanted to be an actor but was rarely cast   and often he couldn t even get as far as the audition room  He had all kinds of  survival jobs   including  like Gary and Janice  cleaning  The clubs would take anyone  so he started performing there  He was drawn to what he called  monster drag    not female impersonation but grotesque costumes   people pulling Nutella out of diapers and stuff like that    and absurd storytelling  His costumes were handmade  fanciful and bizarre   he d wrap himself in wire and electrical tape  paint himself green and smear his makeup so that he looked deranged  but then out of his mouth would come expert cabaret singing  He liked embodying the contrast between mess and perfection In the clubs  anything could happen  Like Irwin and Shiner  Mac developed a Rolodex for dealing with audience members of all stripes   hecklers  homophobes  hams  Sometimes a couple would be having sex in one corner of the club while he was performing  distracting the audience  Mac would descend the stage and waltz over to sing right near them  stealing the thunder back for himself  When he returned to the stage  all eyes were on him again  He called this strategy  incorporating the calamity    Gary s scheme to make a spectacle out of the corpses in the new play is a variation of this same idea   One night  Mac was competing in a drag competition against a run of the mill female impersonator who was lip syncing  badly  At the end of her number  she pulled out a set of false teeth  to reveal that she had only two teeth of her own underneath  The audience  including Mac  went wild  electrified by her authentic display   She was like   I m not afraid of you  I m not afraid of being vulnerable  I m not afraid of what I really look like  I came in here showing you something that you think is beautiful  let me show you what real beauty is  being brave     He saw that if he wanted to gain the trust of an audience  he would have to sacrifice something authentic of his own  to lay himself bare Dressing in drag is Mac s way of doing this  When I once made the mistake of calling his drag a  persona   or a character he plays  he promptly corrected me   I m just exposing what I look like on the inside   Wearing jeans and a T shirt is his way of hiding  drag is the opposite   it s revealing  with tremendous confidence and panache  who he really is  and making room for the audience to be as odd and authoritative and mischievous and exposed as he is Together with the artist Machine Dazzle  whom he met around 2000 in the clubs and who designs all his costumes  Mac has created his own subgenre of drag  more poetry than clothing  bristling with juxtapositions and winks and historical and artistic allusions  Their sensibility is so intertwined that Mac often doesn t see Dazzle s designs until the moment before going onstage  Dazzle explained the origins of his own maximalism  the costumes are a place to put all the ideas that he has been storing since childhood  when  like Mac  he had to suppress many of his interests and desires   I just had ways of putting things away for a later date   Dazzle told me  There s a bottomless well of creative power that comes from having been told not to be yourself ImageMac on the  Gary  set CreditMickalene Thomas for The New York TimesMost days Mac listens to Nina Simone  One icy afternoon in December  he put on a favorite song of hers   Wild Is the Wind   a cabaret standard about an abandoned lover  He was perched on the edge of his sofa  and when the song began  he folded his arms and legs  making himself small  and began to listen raptly  Simone s version is slower than most  and she sings the first line  Love me love me love me  say you do  in an agony of longing  extending the notes and allowing them to go flat   See   Mac said   She s under pitch  She s heartbroken   She could do anything  he explained  but she chooses not to sometimes  As she continues to sing    Let me fly away with you  for my love is like the wind  and wild is the wind    her voice quakes and quavers  even as she keeps extending the notes  singing slowly as if she s tasting her own pain Mac loves Nina Simone s voice   finds endless new expressive possibilities in it   precisely because of the way she veers off key  One day  years ago  he asked himself why he is so drawn to that quality  He realized that she s  telling stories that aren t always on pitch  you know  Nina s singing about inequality  And heartbreak   Simone is one of the artists Mac draws inspiration from in his lifelong project  taking devastation and making something new Toward the end of  Gary   the argument between Janice and Gary culminates in a line that Gary spits out  risking alienating Janice by insulting her livelihood   Cleaning is immoral   he cries  This is not just the raving of a clown who doesn t want to do dirty work  what he s discovered is just how dehumanizing their job really is  They are maintenance workers being asked to maintain the status quo   to clean up the mess left by murderous rulers before anyone has time to think about what it s doing there in the first place  Cleaning obscures  It creates closure where there should be questioning In  Gary   the metaphor of cleaning is made literal  but it s a leitmotif in all of Mac s work  a preference for flat notes  jagged edges and what he calls  authentic failure   He objects to tidiness in all its forms   his costumes  grand as they are  are often built to fray and shed  glitter littering the stage  he accepts that his big voice  over 24 hours of  A 24 Decade History   will thin into a plaintive growl  his telling of American history preserves songs of cruelty and subjugation alongside anthems of love  Failure  for Mac  can be a kind of offering  What do we make out of what is given Mac is not a crier  but listening to Simone  his eyes filled with tears  Underneath her elongated vocal notes is her jittery  chaotic piano playing that makes you feel the instability of her condition  But then the song changes for a moment   You re spring to me  all things to me   she sings  and then lets out a sigh  or maybe even a grunt  that is rueful and a little acerbic  Mac shook his head admiringly   Just when you think you know who she is   you re like  Oh  she s this vulnerable creature   she s tough   And then  almost immediately  the ache returns in the next lines Her brokenness is her wit and her strength  It has pointed Mac toward a workable path in the world   That s inspiring to me   he said quietly   that you would use your vulnerability and your imperfection as a way to get to the truth   

Despite long and tragic wars with the Japanese  the French  the Chinese and the United States during the last century  Vietnam is a treasure house  It is one of the world s hot spots of biological diversity  according to the science research  There are 30 national parks in a country a bit larger than New Mexico  and about as many kinds of animals as in those pre eminent safari destinations  Kenya and Tanzania In fact  hundreds of new to science species of plants and animals have been discovered in Vietnam during the last three decades  and more are recorded each year  The antelope like saola  for example  Its gentle  streaked face looks as if it has just escaped from a jungle dream painting by Henri Rousseau  Heralded as  the last unicorn  for its rarity  the saola is the largest land dwelling animal discovered anywhere since 1937  A small herd of long lost rhinos  a barking deer and a striped rabbit have also turned up  So has a giant  21 inch long walking stick insect  and many kinds of birds   laughing thrushes    fish  snakes and frogs hitherto unknown or thought to be extinct Vietnam s forests shelter two dozen species of primates   gibbons  macaques  lorises and langurs  often in colors that make the human tribe look banal by contrast  A promotional email I received from Cuc Phuong National Park was tantalizing   The ancient forest contains almost 2 000 species of trees and among them live some amazing and rare animals including the clouded leopard  Delacour s langur  Owston s civet  otters and Asian black bears    owls  flying squirrels  lorises  bats and cats  But in trying to make arrangements to visit  the travel fixers my wife and I contacted were oddly hesitant about natural areas and wildlife  and they kept nudging us back toward mere scenery  or to cities  And then this email   Have you been to Vietnam before  or know of the situation there  It s pretty dire if you are not aware   Dire for wildlife  Very much so  In Vietnam  national parks are primarily in name only  and poaching  often practiced by park rangers  and worse has decimated wildlife  Calls to conservation personnel who live and work in Vietnam reconciled the seeming contradictions  Yes  the country is an epicenter for wild species diversity  No  wildlife travel is not much pursued  and Vietnam has also become a world center for criminal wildlife trafficking Its wild populations  already hemmed in by habitat destruction because of an exploding human population  are also being shot  snared and live captured so efficiently that national parks and other natural areas are now mostly afflicted with  empty forest syndrome   suitable forest habitat from which even small animals and birds have been hunted into local extinction  Other Asian countries are in various stages of the same convulsion  It s frequently said that many new species vanish before science can even discover them  ImageHatinh langurs at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesImageA red shanked douc langur at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center  Nearly all of Vietnam s primates are at risk CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesVietnam s decline is especially intense  For example  in a single remote national preserve set aside for the saola and other rare animals  23 000 cheap but fatally efficient wire snares were found in 2015  the most recent year tallied  Tens of thousands more of these snares are placed each year  as fast as they can be confiscated  Despite intensive surveys  no verifiable sighting of a saola has occurred since a photo was taken of one  six years ago  The last rhino was shot by poachers in the Cat Tien National Park in 2010  Tigers have been effectively hunted out of existence  Only tiny populations of bears and elephants hang on in small  vulnerable pockets  Nearly all of the many primate species are at risk of extinction          g 0407 tra webVIETNAMmap box     max width 600px       g 0407 tra webVIETNAMmap box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g 0407 tra webVIETNAMmap box  g artboard p     margin 0

traditional medicine in Vietnam and neighboring China  Examples from a lengthy catalog of purported remedies include  tiger penises for impotence  bear bile for cancer  rhino horn for a hangover  loris bile to ease the serious airway infections that arise from Vietnam s air pollution Even more of the motivation  surveys have found   is to supply the rampant demand for wildlife meat in urban restaurants  which is very much a status issue   said Barney Long  director of species conservation for the nonprofit group Global Wildlife Conservation   This is not bush meat where poor people are hunting for food   he said   It s a status symbol to take your business or government colleagues out for a wildlife meal  And honestly it s on a scale that is mind boggling  We re talking not about one or two species  but whole communities of wildlife disappearing  After further scouting  my wife and I decided to go anyway  arranging to fly into Hanoi  in the north  and move quickly to Vietnam s green outback  Then we would head south to Ho Chi Minh City  the former Saigon  for a circuit of the parks and natural areas there Over the course of our two week trip  we found that some exquisite wild species hold out  though in threatened circumstances  And we were fortunate  if half willing  witnesses to the struggle by native Vietnamese  and their international conservation allies  to halt what amounts to animal genocide Cuc Phuong  the nation s first national park  is a couple of hours south of Hanoi  It was created in 1962 by Ho Chi Minh  who prophesied that  the current destruction of our forests will lead to serious effects on climate  productivity and life  The forest is gold  If we know how to conserve and manage it well  it will be very valuable   But despite the blandishments in that government issued invitation to the park we d received  there are no more Delacour s langurs in these forests  nor any other kind  No bears  leopards or smaller cats either  unless they are so well hidden that even scientists cannot find them  Adam Davies  director of the Endangered Primate Rescue Center  told me  Instead  the richest collection of rare animals can be found along a quiet narrow park road lined by animal rescue centers that amounts to a kind of conservation superhighway  At the Primate Rescue Center  visitors can see four species of nearly extinct langurs  also called leaf eating monkeys   gibbons and lorises  many of which were rescued from wildlife traffickers  They are doctored back to health  bred when possible  and in especially fortunate circumstances  are returned to the wild  Poachers make the rest of this national park too hostile a landscape to risk releasing most kinds of animals  Mr  Davies said ImageThe Bich Dong Pagoda in Tam Coc  The surrounding area is rich in birdlife  but development is a threat CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesA few steps away are two other rescue centers  One protects dozens of species of turtles  many of striking beauty  all of them endangered  The other is for confiscated leopard cats  civets  the binturong or bearcat   which has been compared to a dust mop that smells like fresh popcorn   and the pangolin  an armadillo like animal whose meat and scales can command  500 a pound on the menus or in the folk cure apothecaries of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City   Pangolin is currently the world s most trafficked mammal  which is a very unwanted title   Mr  Davies said His center reintroduced some critically endangered Delacour s langurs to the wild in the Van Long Wetland Nature Reserve  about 90 minutes down the road  There we boarded a small rowboat at a landing  plied by one of a cluster of local guides  for a half day float within a protected gorge We veered off  along a route no one else in the pack of boats had taken  The langurs  now breeding successfully somewhere out there  stayed hidden  That s the nature of such quests  of course  Enjoy the pretty sojourn  even if your quarry eludes you  Maybe all those other little boats had gone in a better direction Then heading back we heard shouts from a farmer  off in the brush  He was pointing excitedly at some shaking trees on the opposite shore  A rowdy group of 10 langurs ultimately emerged   this species is black with what look like mutton chop side whiskers and white pants   and we spent most of a transfixed hour watching them groom and chase and bask in the intense subtropical sun  With luck  they ll continue to be protected here and not become fodder for the meat or pet trades To see bears  we drove to Tam Dao National Park  high on a long ridge north of Hanoi  A resort town within the park bristles with construction cranes and heavy backhoes  part of the national building boom In the valley below is a bear sanctuary operated by Animals Asia and sometimes open to visitors  We watched two species   moon bears and the smaller sun bears   romp  swim and climb within a specially constructed recreation habitat  Both look like wild haired  punk rock versions of North American black bears and have vivid white chevron collars  They have arrived here from bear bile farms where they live in cruelly close confinement  as their bile is repeatedly extracted until they expire ImageThe future of the birds and wildlife in Thung Nham Bird Park  above  may depend on a construction project in the area CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesThe practice is now illegal  though loopholes make the law difficult to enforce  said Tuan Bendixsen  the director of the center   Bear bile extraction is still going on   he said   You can still buy it down in Hanoi if you want to  Many of the bears he gets  are missing limbs  or are damaged in other ways   he said  which makes their chances for return to the wild slender  And suitable wild land for such releases is increasingly rare  he said  as the human population and the national economy grow The corruption that afflicts Vietnam s one party government  along with the growing economy  are major factors in the disappearance of natural habitat and endangered species  Corruption was given as a major reason for weak protections and slack enforcement by the conservation groups we spoke with  More on animal conservationWar s Other Victims  AnimalsOver decades  armed conflict has reduced animal populations in Africa more than any other factor  according to new research Jan  12  2018 There are issues with corruption in all segments of Vietnamese society  and forest protection is no different   said Andrew Tilker  an American field researcher who tracks the saola and other rare species Some courageous officials push back  and both homegrown and international conservation groups can cite successes  But the consensus view is that the wider prospect for Vietnam s wild species is quickly deteriorating  The country s government has earned a corruption ranking from the group Transparency International that could be charitably summarized as  dismal  We witnessed that clash of aspirations during a stay near Ninh Binh  a couple of hours south of Hanoi  There we had found the loveliest lodging of our trip   and the competition was keen   at a place called Tam Coc Gardens  It s a few stone bungalows hidden within a lush landscape  ringed by colossal limestone rock formations and plateaus we had only seen in watercolor paintings  We had picked the place because it is a half hour bike ride from the Thung Nham Bird Park  We rolled into the park one late afternoon and wondered if we had somehow lost the way  Though touted as an  ecological  destination  the park has been taken over by a tourism corporation with big plans  We walked past broad lawns and wide lakes fringed with forest  all heavily manicured and completely bereft of bird life  On the near shore  jackhammers  chain saws and grinding trucks battered the air in the ambitious expansion of a lakeside resort   not well calculated for maintaining bird habitat ImageA red eared slider turtle at the Turtle Conservation Center in Cuc Phuong National Park CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesImageMuch of the wildlife in Cuc Phuong National Park has disappeared CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesAt length  we located a boat shed and found a woman with a traditional conical hat and a big oar  For a small fee she rowed us and three other passengers out onto the barren looking lake and toward a wall of bamboo  Stow the binoculars  No birds to see  or hear  Maybe it was just the weather Ten minutes in  we began to hear what sounded like an agitated conversation among members of the world s biggest book group  somewhere out of view  Then our boat glided into a rookery with hundreds of herons and storks  each one as big as a 2 year old child  perched  preening or at times filling the sky overhead  It was a delight  but its future may depend on that construction project  and whether the solemn  barren seeming lakes next door are symptomatic of how this landscape will be managed Vietnam is not alone in failing to protect its wild species  of course  In the United States  many of our own  protected  animals are being pushed nearer the edge  Initiatives from the Trump administration have rolled back the designation of some national monuments and would weaken the Endangered Species Act 52 Places to Go in 2019A starter kit for escaping into the world Jan  8  2019If there s hope for Vietnam s natural heritage  we learned  some of it resides with creative  sometimes courageous conservation groups like Education for Nature Vietnam  They push research  criminal investigations  political fights and legal maneuvers forward  Those bring risk  Another source of hope for Vietnam lies in engaging local communities in wildlife protection with economic incentives  The World Wildlife Fund  for example  sponsors sustainable rattan and acacia farming as buffer zones for beleaguered natural preserves along the western border with Laos  In other places  environmental groups pay local people a living wage to patrol the rain forest and collect those thousands of deadly snares Tourism  growing quickly in Vietnam  can also sustain wild areas  though only if it is carefully managed  International tourism arrivals neared 15 5 million in 2018   a startling 64 percent jump above the 2016 figure  which explains the forest of construction cranes we saw ringing the shoreline at the far end of Halong Bay  as high rise hotels surge into Cat Ba National Park s environs  They  in turn  explain the habitat fragmentation and near extinction of the Cat Ba langur and other species that used to inhabit this landscape  About 60 of the animals remain in isolated populations  where feeding and breeding options are nearly foreclosed  In the 1960s  there were some 3 000 We headed south toward Ho Chi Minh City and from there I took a solo trip  riding three or four hours north to spend a couple of days in Cat Tien National Park  On a sweltering afternoon  a dapper young park ranger led a couple of us on a two hour  wildlife trek   This time we really were in a silent forest The only thing we encountered were squadrons of dry ground leeches  They found us very quickly  Blood blossoms appeared on my socks as I stooped to pick the creatures off my ankles   The ranger was wearing high boots   ImageMurphy  a male sun bear at the Bear Rescue Center in Tam Dao National Park  The bile of sun bears is considered a remedy for cancer  such remedies are decimating certain animal populations CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesThe Dao Tien Endangered Primate Species Centre  on an island a few minutes downriver  can show visitors several species  including gloriously exuberant gibbons that careen through the high tree canopy  At times they commence a sudden  nearly deafening concert  It sounds like a symphony of demented slide whistles  sirens and the world s loudest theremins  Gibbon song betrays the locations of these  our kindred species  to hunters in the national park across the river  They are sometimes shot out of the trees over there  and sold to be eaten in the cities Park rangers and others I spoke with at Cat Tien affirmed that its animal populations are declining  that some rangers have been caught colluding with hunters to bring down high value animals  though they are said to be severely dealt with   and that the rangers earn something like  200 a month to start  which makes this a less lucrative career option   and poaching an attractive one I stayed at the edge of the park in the well appointed Cat Tien Jungle Lodge  Its proprietors  Duong Thi Ngoc Phuong and Gary Leong  work to help protect Cat Tien from mass tourism and to build economic ties with impoverished local communities to dissuade them from poaching   Without the animals  there is little reason for the park s existence   Mr  Leong said   We have to give everyone a stake in protecting them  That means  at least in part  creating economic incentives for local people to preserve native species in their natural habitats  And it needs to start soon  wildlife advocates say   Every day we all wake up and say   do we have time  Do any of these species have time  Are we just fighting a war that we ve already lost    said Quyen Vu  the executive director of Education for Nature Vietnam   But if we don t fight  then we definitely have lost  Stephen Nash is the author of  Grand Canyon for Sale
