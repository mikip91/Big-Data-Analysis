LONDON   An end to austerity in Britain does not mean all government departments will see their budgets keep pace with inflation  Conservative finance minister Philip Hammond said on Friday Last year Hammond announced that years of self enforced thrift over government spending was coming to an end  a claim parliament s Treasury Committee criticised as  imprecise  and lacking in detail On Friday he spelled out more about what an end to austerity would mean for a multi year review of government spending due towards the end of the year alongside his annual budget  All Spending Reviews are about prioritisation and efficiency  and it would be odd to define ending austerity as meaning that every department sees an annual real terms increase in its budget   Hammond said in a letter to the chair of the Treasury Committee  Nicky Morgan Day to day spending on public services was likely to rise 1 2 percent a year above inflation over the coming years  compared with an average real terms fall of 1 3 percent a year between 2015 and 2020  and double that in the five years before The last spending review before the financial crisis  conducted by a Labour government in 2007  envisaged real terms cuts to spending on foreign affairs  justice  and the administration of pensions and social benefits  Delivering faster job growth  a higher minimum wage and lower income tax bills for many workers also counted towards ending austerity  Hammond added Morgan said Hammond s comment was  noteworthy  Britain s budget deficit looks on track to drop to its lowest since 2001 02 at just over 1 percent of national income in the 2018 19 financial year that has just ended  down from 10 percent just after the global financial crisis in 2009 10 Last month  Hammond said he could free billions of pounds for extra public spending or tax cuts  as long as parliament resolves its Brexit impasse Britain could ask the European Union for a long Brexit delay next week if crisis talks between Prime Minister Theresa May s government and the opposition Labour Party fail to find a way out of the impasse over the divorce from the European Union It is nearly three years since the United Kingdom shocked the world by voting 52 percent to 48 to leave the bloc  Supporters of Brexit fear betrayal and opponents are pushing for another referendum Hammond last month repeated his forecast that there would be a Brexit deal  dividend  as companies regained confidence  despite criticism from the Treasury Committee over his use of the phrase   Editing by David Milliken

JERUSALEM   Benjamin Netanyahu  Israel s conservative prime minister for the past decade  appeared poised to win a fourth consecutive term in office  and a fifth overall  according to preliminary results early on Wednesday Both Mr  Netanyahu and his chief rival  Benny Gantz  a centrist former military chief  declared victory after Tuesday s parliamentary election  appearing to win the same number of seats in the Israeli parliament  But a count of the broader blocs needed to form a coalition government appeared to give Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party a clear advantage over Mr  Gantz s Blue and White Mr  Netanyahu now seems all but sure to surpass the nation s founding leader  David Ben Gurion  as Israel s longest serving prime minister Victory would also provide Mr  Netanyahu  69  with a renewed mandate as he battles a looming indictment on charges of bribery and corruption A dominant global player who has built a strong economy  Mr  Netanyahu is widely credited with having kept the country secure and delivered a series of long sought diplomatic victories  many of them thanks to President Trump Regardless of the outcome  Mr  Gantz s strong performance was a remarkable achievement for a political newcomer and a brand new party  Mr  Gantz  a career soldier who retired as chief of staff in 2015  entered politics last year for the first time  joining forces with two other former army chiefs in an effort to blunt Mr  Netanyahu s claim that only he could keep Israel safe More than a million Israelis appeared to have voted for Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party  placing it in the position of being the main alternative to Israel s right wing  a spot once held by the Labor Party ImageSupporters of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesInitial exit polls had projected a muddled outcome  and many Israelis went to bed on Tuesday suspended in a post ballot twilight zone  The final tally may not be known until the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients are counted later this week The exit polls of the three main television channels were sufficiently disparate that both sides claimed victory  This is a night of tremendous victory   Mr  Netanyahu said after entering a jubilant campaign celebration around 2 a m  to cheers and chants of  Bibi  king of Israel   I believe that the Lord and history have given the people of Israel another opportunity  a golden opportunity to turn our country into a strong nation  among the strongest nations of the world   he said He said he expected to forge a new coalition with the right wing parties he called his  natural partners   but that he intended to be  the prime minister of all the citizens of Israel  Earlier  Mr  Gantz entered a packed election night headquarters in Tel Aviv to thunderous cheers  declaring   We are the winners   He promised to be  the prime minister of everyone and not just of those who voted for us   and argued  when early exit polls had him in the lead  that the largest party should be the one granted the mandate to form the next government By dawn  Likud and Blue and White appeared to have won at least 35 seats each in the 120 seat parliament  But the right wing and religious parties together commanded a potential majority of at least 65 seats  leaving the center left bloc trailing far behind with 55 President Reuven Rivlin is expected in the next few days to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority ImageSupporters of Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditLior Mizrahi Getty ImagesAs Mr  Netanyahu has drifted steadily to the right  the left has migrated to the center  after years of violence in the second Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s and the absence of a viable peace process since Mr  Netanyahu has benefited from strong support from President Trump  who in the past two years has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal  recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital and just two weeks ago recognized Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights The Trump administration weighed in again on Monday  declaring the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization  By Monday night in Israel  Mr  Netanyahu was boasting on Twitter in Hebrew   but not in English   that this was in fulfillment of  another important request of mine  But Mr  Netanyahu s pursuit of a fourth consecutive term came as he faces indictment for bribery and other corruption charges  The evidence in those cases  which was kept under wraps until after the election to avoid leaks that could tilt the contest against Mr  Netanyahu  are now to be turned over to lawyers in the case  meaning Mr  Netanyahu could be plagued by damaging reports while he tries to assemble a coalition And it could be difficult for him to remain in office once formal criminal charges are lodged against him  possibly as soon as late summer Mr  Netanyahu spent much of the past year undermining law enforcement officials and the gatekeepers of Israel s liberal democracy  railing against the police  the attorney general and what he called the  leftist  mainstream media  trying to delegitimize his critics and organizations working for Palestinian rights  His government has also worked to curb the powers of the Supreme Court Even as Mr  Netanyahu forged diplomatic ties and trading partnerships with new countries  he stymied any prospect of a resolution of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  aided by a weak  divided and at times recalcitrant Palestinian leadership  Veering farther to the right in the final days of the election campaign  he pledged to start annexing parts of the occupied West Bank if re elected  a move he had long resisted He was widely expected in his coalition negotiations to try to trade passage of annexation laws for retroactive immunity to prosecution in the corruption cases against him ImageA woman voting in Ramat Gan on Tuesday  If the vote remains close  it may come down to the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients counted later this week CreditOded Balilty Associated PressBut Israelis as a whole have lost faith in a two state solution  polls show  and the election seemed to bear that out For many Palestinians  the distinctions between Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz were inconsequential Saeb Erekat  the chief Palestinian negotiator  pointed to one exit poll showing that only 18 of the Parliament s members still supported a two state solution  calling this  a consequence of the culture of impunity granted to Israel   What the exit polls suggest is that Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo   he said   They have said  no  to peace and  yes  to the occupation  Early analysis showed a historically low turnout among Arab citizens of Israel  many of whom boycotted the vote out of disillusionment with Israeli politics and with their own politicians By nightfall Arab leaders were frantically trying to rally their supporters  mosques were broadcasting appeals from minaret loudspeakers  and a last minute surge of participation seemed to materialize in some predominantly Arab towns  though that was not captured in exit polls Despite the broad margin of support for a Netanyahu government  coalition negotiations may still prove difficult  with several small parties acting as kingmakers and Mr  Netanyahu vulnerable to political extortion  The question is whether people will climb down from their trees or not   said Abraham Diskin  a professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  referring to the lofty demands and conditions some party leaders have already placed on entering a coalition Mr  Gantz and his allies in the Blue and White alliance have pledged not to join a government with a prime minister facing indictment ImageLaborers hanging a campaign banner depicting Mr  Netanyahu  center  with other candidates of his Likud party  in Jerusalem last month CreditAmmar Awad ReutersLike most Israeli election campaigns  this one ripped open the fissures in Israeli society  With Mr  Netanyahu facing indictment and battling for his political survival against Mr  Gantz  the most credible challenger in a decade  many Israelis said it was the nastiest and most divisive race they could recall With three former army chiefs in Blue and White s top four slots  Mr  Netanyahu was unable to rely on his usual politics of fear  presenting himself as the only candidate able to provide Israelis with security Instead  his campaign focused largely on perceived enemies within Mr  Netanyahu fanned the flames of anti Arab sentiment  warning Israelis that Mr  Gantz would  hand over parts of the homeland to the Arabs   He also joined forces with a racist faction  one of whose members was ultimately barred from running in the election by the Supreme Court On Election Day  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling places in Arab towns in what they said was an effort to capture evidence of any irregularities  but Arab leaders called it a blatant attempt at voter intimidation The dwindling left  for its part  accused Blue and White of being right wing  saying that it was conspiring to join a Netanyahu government Mr  Netanyahu tried to cast the race as one between an experienced world leader and an unproven political novice  His party raised questions about Mr  Gantz s sexual propriety  his vulnerability to extortion by the Iranians after his cellphone was apparently breached  and even his mental stability Mr  Gantz s party said it wanted to put Israel back on course  It fought Mr  Netanyahu s polarization with promises of restoring a sense of unity  decency and democratic values The fate of smaller parties at both ends of the spectrum was unclear and could still prove significant  It s been a long night   Mr  Netanyahu said at his post midnight rally   And it will be a long day waiting for the true results

KAMPALA  Uganda   Rival security forces clashed in Sudan on Tuesday as huge crowds of protesters kept up their vigil outside army headquarters to call for the overthrow of the country s longtime authoritarian president  Omar Hassan al Bashir Seven people were killed on Tuesday  said Sara Abdelgalil  a spokeswoman for the Sudanese Professionals Association  which is organizing the protests The eruption of violence between different armed government forces is a major development in the four month long protest movement against the president  said Magdi el Gizouli  a fellow at the Rift Valley Institute  a think tank based in Kenya  In a way  it has been turned into an internal dilemma between security forces   said Mr  el Gizouli  who is Sudanese  The worse case scenario is that this military security establishment breaks down and they fail to resolve what is now becoming a conflict within   he added The intermittent fighting between different agencies within the country s security forces raises concerns that Sudan could descend into anarchy  That fear is especially acute now because two neighboring nations   Libya and South Sudan   are convulsed by civil war and chaos The protests broke out in December over a surge in the price of bread and quickly escalated into the biggest challenge yet to the three decade rule of Mr  al Bashir  He came to power in a military and Islamist backed coup in 1989 and for much of that time  he has been regarded as a pariah in the West Sudan became a haven for international terrorists in the 1990s   it hosted Osama bin Laden for a

m  when paramilitary forces loyal to Mr  al Bashir opened fire on the protesters in front of the army headquarters  according to one protester  a doctor in his mid 20s Soldiers who are part of the regular army opened up gates to allow protesters to get to safety within the large military compound that is not only home to army headquarters  but to Mr  al Bashir s residence as well  said the doctor  who asked to be identified only by his initials  A M E   citing safety concerns The army responded to the attack by the paramilitary forces with gunfire and they shot about six of them  according to the doctor  who provided a video of protesters huddled on the ground in the dark as gunfire sounded all around them Dr  Mohamed Eisa  a spokesman for the Sudanese American Physicians Association  said that about 22 people   including five soldiers   have been killed since the protests swelled on Saturday  Dr  Eisa  who is based in Cleveland  said his group s tally is based on reports from doctors in Khartoum  the capital Ms  Abdelgalil  the spokeswoman for the protest organizers  said   The positive emerging development is that some of the army forces are protecting the civilians  There was similar fighting between rival security forces early Monday as well  a different witness said After protests broke out in December  Mr  al Bashir s feared National Intelligence and Security Service sought to suppress them with tear gas  detentions  and sometimes live ammunition  By the middle of March  60 protesters had been killed  according to the New York based group Physicians for Human Rights The protests gained momentum over the weekend  when marchers chose a new demonstration route and reached army headquarters with little resistance  There they discovered that individual army soldiers guarding the compound were sympathetic  The army soldiers at times blocked the efforts of the National Intelligence and Security Service to disperse the protesters

since Saturday  At its height  organizers have estimated that hundreds of thousands of protesters have been in the streets The protesters have praised the army for protecting them  In phone interviews  several protesters have begun to express hope that the army will force Mr  al Bashir s ouster Mr  el Gizouli said that while the protesters in Khartoum may view the army favorably  the army is hardly a unifying force beyond Sudan s heartland  Across the country s periphery  the military has sown terror while fighting rebels  One must be reminded that it s the same army accused of treacherous crimes   he said During his long rule  Mr  al Bashir has bolstered security forces outside the military s command structures   which has prevented any one security organ from growing powerful enough to challenge him  He has built up the National Intelligence and Security Service and also supported the Arab militias known as janjaweed that have more recently been constituted as the Rapid Support Forces Those forces were seen moving into Khartoum in recent days and setting up roadblocks  according to witnesses The doctor who witnessed the shooting said that he had spoken to some of the soldiers who let the protesters take cover inside army headquarters  and it was clear these soldiers were acting against their orders The doctor added that one of the soldiers said he feared that all those who disobeyed orders will be executed if this movement fails In a joint statement made through the United States Embassy in Khartoum on Tuesday  the United States  Britain and Norway called on the Sudanese authorities to respond to the demands of the protesters and prepare for a  political transition   The Sudanese people are demanding a transition to a political system that is inclusive and has greater legitimacy   the statement read   The Sudanese authorities must now respond and deliver a credible plan for this political transition  Failing to do so risks causing greater instability   

Faced with an expanding measles outbreak  Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York declared a public health emergency on Tuesday and ordered a program of mandatory vaccination in parts of Brooklyn Such a health order is rare but not unheard of in American history  medical experts said  It has occurred several times  The Supreme Court ruled more than a century ago that mandatory vaccination was legal  although the court drew a distinction between punishing citizens for refusing and actually vaccinating them by force Nonetheless  both of those tactics have been imposed in the past 120 years   as long ago as a 1900 plague outbreak in San Francisco  and as recently as a measles outbreak in Philadelphia in 1991  Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  The New York vaccination order is written in a way that seems to leave open both possibilities  depending on how strictly the city chooses to enforce it  Mayor de Blasio said New Yorkers in the affected neighborhoods who refuse to let themselves or their children be vaccinated could be fined  1 000  But the order issued by the health commissioner  Dr  Oxiris Barbot  said anyone who has not been vaccinated and cannot prove they are immune to measles or produce a medical exemption  shall be vaccinated   Below the commissioner s signature   outside the actual text of the order   is an added warning saying failure to comply is a misdemeanor and can lead to fines or imprisonment  On Tuesday  Dr  Barbot said persistent refusals would be handled on a  case by case basis  and we ll have to confer with our legal counsel  The defining case in the field  according to Daniel A  Salmon  director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health  is the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in Jacobson v  Massachusetts The court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination on the grounds that  when danger loomed  an individual s freedom could be subordinated to the common good The plaintiff  Henning Jacobson  was a Cambridge  Mass   pastor who had been vaccinated against smallpox as a child in Sweden and claimed it had caused him lifelong suffering  He also argued that vaccination was an  invasion of his liberty  under the 14th Amendment  During a smallpox outbreak  he refused to let himself or his son be vaccinated and was fined  5 Massachusetts was then one of 11 states with compulsory vaccination laws  but it did not allow vaccination by force  By a 7 to 2 vote  the court let the fine stand and said imprisonment could also have been imposed But Justice John Harlan wrote for the majority that individuals could not be forcibly vaccinated Yet vaccination by force was used in 1991 in Philadelphia  said Dr  Paul A  Offit  director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia A measles outbreak that year infected over 1 400 people and killed several children  It had begun in two fundamentalist churches that rejected modern medicine and practiced faith healing  A court ordered that the children in those churches be vaccinated  Their families did not resist  They were a peaceful lot   Dr  Offit recalled   Once it was the law of the city  they realized it and they were pretty placid about it   One church s pastor had vaccinated her dog because the law required it  he said  yet her son died of an infection with Hib bacteria  which is prevented by a vaccine routinely given to children at two months  ImageResidents and police gathered outside a library in Brooklyn where Mayor de Blasio made the announcement CreditJohn Taggart for The New York TimesCity and state health commissioners often have vast powers  Most public health laws were written in the 19th century  when cities were regularly swept by waves of cholera  yellow fever and smallpox that killed thousands In the 1892 cholera outbreak  New York City s health commissioner  Dr  Cyrus Edson  was asked by a congressional committee what the limits of his powers were  He answered that he could even seize City Hall and turn it into a hospital In the 1990s  when a few New Yorkers with multi drug resistant tuberculosis   mostly homeless men   refused to take antibiotics  they were held involuntarily in a locked ward of Bellevue Hospital and forced to take medicine until they were no longer contagious Forced vaccination  however  is more politically sensitive than quarantines or forced treatment  Vaccines are given to healthy persons   sometimes infants   instead of to those who are sick and clearly endangering others Smallpox vaccination was made mandatory in parts of Europe as early as 1806  but the first attempt at forced vaccination in this country occurred in San Francisco s Chinatown in 1900  The city nearly exploded into riots  said Dr  Howard Markel  director of the University of Michigan s Center for the History of Medicine Measles Outbreak Explained  Your Questions AnsweredThe disease was declared eliminated in 2000  So far this year  there have been more than 100 cases  Feb  20  2019As he described it in his book  When Germs Travel   the entire neighborhood was cordoned off by police on March 7  1900  less than 24 hours after local health officials tentatively concluded that a scrap wood dealer found dead in a basement cot in a dime a night boardinghouse had perished from plague Plague was then common in China and in 1899 had reached Honolulu s Chinatown  A  controlled burn  of a few plague infested houses ordered by the city board of health had gotten out of control and burned down 4 000 houses  leaving thousands homeless Anti Chinese prejudice was rampant in California  and the Chinese were terrified that what had happened in Hawaii would be repeated The San Francisco quarantine was lifted on March 9  in part because employers needed their workers  Health inspectors and police began searching the community for the sick  beating anyone who resisted In May  the surgeon general in Washington telegraphed orders that federal health officials should take over response to the outbreak  cordon off Chinatown again  prevent all Chinese and Japanese people from leaving the city  disinfect all their homes   and inoculate them all with an experimental plague vaccine  The national panic was so great that the secretary of the Treasury briefly issued orders that all Asians could be denied transport by common carrier anywhere in the country  The vaccine had been invented just three years earlier by Waldemar Haffkine  an Orthodox Jew who had been driven out of Russia by anti Semitism and had moved his laboratory to India The second quarantine went on for weeks  and Chinatown faced starvation until local merchants donated food  The Chinese press reported that the Haffkine vaccine had killed some Indians and that a few Chinatown residents who accepted it had fallen ill The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association  a civic group  sued  and a federal district judge stopped the vaccinations  saying the order singled out Asians for no medical reason  Ultimately  the vaccination effort was dropped because the governor asked President William McKinley to step in  The local federal health official had started issuing orders so sweeping that they effectively prevented all Californians from leaving the state without his permission Even fining people for refusing to be vaccinated has a complex history  Dr  Salmon said  In Britain  he noted  fines have sometimes been imposed repeatedly for repeated refusals  People lost their houses and became martyrs   he said Also  fines create inequities because some can afford them and some cannot   You end up punishing people based on their ability to pay   Dr  Salmon said There is almost always a backlash  In Britain  the Vaccination Act of 1853 galvanized the creation of an anti vaccination movement  and in the United States  the Anti Vaccination League of America was founded three years after Jacobson v  Massachusetts was decided Earlier reporting on the measles outbreakNew York Declares Measles Emergency  Requiring Vaccinations in Parts of BrooklynApril 9  2019

WASHINGTON   The top federal ethics watchdog said on Thursday that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s sale of his stake in a film production business to his wife did not comply with federal ethics rules  and it would not certify his 2018 financial disclosure report as a result Although Mr  Mnuchin will not face penalties for failing to comply  he has been required to rewrite his federal ethics agreement and to promise to recuse himself from government matters that could affect his wife s business Mr  Mnuchin in 2017 sold his stake in StormChaser Partners to his then fiance  Louise Linton  as part of a series of divestments before becoming Treasury secretary  Since they are now married  government ethics rules consider the asset to be owned by Mr  Mnuchin  potentially creating a conflict of interest for an official who has been negotiating for expanded access for the movie industry as part of trade talks with China The controversy over Mr  Mnuchin s finances has become an unwanted distraction in recent weeks as the Trump administration has been engaged in intense negotiations with China on a wide range of trade matters  While Robert Lighthizer  President Trump s top trade official  has been leading the talks  Mr  Mnuchin has been the point person for promoting the film industry because of his background as a Hollywood producer and investor Mr  Mnuchin said last month at a Senate hearing that he was told by Treasury ethics officials that he was allowed to sell his stake in StormChaser to Ms  Linton  an actress and producer  However  the Office of Government Ethics was not made aware of that guidance and had not approved it In a letter to Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Finance Committee  the ethics office said that it could not certify Mr  Mnuchin s report but that because he had modified his ethics agreement and agreed to recuse himself from matters that might affect StormChaser s film business  he and Ms  Linton could continue to hold the asset Several Trump administration officials have faced red flags and ethical questions over their financial holdings  In February  the ethics office declined to certify the 2018 financial disclosure of Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  because of an inaccuracy in his report The Treasury s assistant general counsel  Brian J  Sonfield  said that the department s former top ethics official had cleared Mr  Mnuchin s arrangement  according to a letter he wrote this week to Emory Rounds  the director of the ethics office  He said that the Treasury believes that Ms  Linton s ownership of the business is  consistent with all applicable ethics laws and regulations  In a separate letter to Mr  Sonfield this week  Mr  Mnuchin wrote that  unless he receives a written waiver  he will recuse himself from any government activity that could benefit StormChaser s movie business  He added that StormChaser did not own or have financial interests in films that are being marketed internationally  He also said he would recuse himself from any tax policy matters that could affect the kinds of independent films that StormChaser holds  If while I am secretary the nature of StormChaser s business practices or the types of films it owns or produces changes  I will seek further guidance from the department s ethics official  who will consult with O G E    Mr  Mnuchin wrote A Treasury spokesman  Tony Sayegh  tweeted a statement saying that the ethics issue was the result of a technical difference between federal ethics officials and Treasury s ethics staff  We are pleased that OGE has approved an updated ethics agreement recognizing that he may hold an interest in that asset   Mr  Sayegh said It is extremely rare for cabinet officials to not have their financial records certified  said Virginia Canter  a former senior ethics counsel at the Treasury Department  In 2001  Paul H  O Neill  President George W  Bush s Treasury secretary  divested his holdings in Alcoa  an aluminum producer  because of conflicts of interest Ms  Canter said she was surprised that Mr  Mnuchin was blaming Treasury s ethics officials for the lapse  arguing that it was ultimately his responsibility to meet the government s requirements  What s he doing being involved in intellectual property matters that could affect the entertainment industry in the negotiations with China   Ms  Canter said   It raises an appearance issue  The explanation from Mr  Mnuchin did not satisfy some Democrats on Thursday Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the top Democrat on the Finance Committee  said that he remained baffled by how the Treasury and the ethics office handled the matter and that he planned to review Mr  Mnuchin s modified ethics agreement  Before being confirmed by the Senate  he signed an ethics agreement that said he would divest from StormChaser Partners L L C    Mr  Wyden said   Rather than divest  he violated the spirit of his ethics agreement by selling his interest to his then fiance and then he violated the letter of the agreement when he reacquired the assets upon their marriage   

  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in position to win a fourth consecutive term on Wednesday  with nearly all of the votes counted  By Wednesday evening  the rival Blue and White alliance led by Benny Gantz had conceded the race  though ballots were still being counted   After the final tally  it will be up to President Reuven Rivlin to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority  But Mr  Netanyahu s Likud bloc had a strong numerical advantage in being able to form a governing coalition   Regardless of the final result  the election illustrated the deep divisions under Mr  Netanyahu  69  who has led Israel for a decade of relative security and prosperity  More than a million Israelis voted for Blue and White  a record for a new party  placing it in the position of being the main alternative to Israel s right wing  a spot held for decades by the Labor Party  See Mr  Netanyahu s road through Israeli history in photos

control of the government  We didn t win on this round   Yair Lapid  one of the alliance leaders  said Mr  Gantz  who had once been seen as a viable contender for prime minister  speaking to a crowd in Tel Aviv a short time earlier  said he would respect the decision of the president to choose the party leader he saw fit but vowed to fight on  in any way I can   At the moment  with the blocs

of the people  of the president  We will serve them from any position that we will be in the future  Mr  Gantz  a retired lieutenant general and former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces  had reached out for allies across the political spectrum and sought to make Mr  Netanyahu s expected indictment on corruption charges the main issue in the race The ballots are still being counted   a final tally is not expected until tomorrow   and after that  President Rivlin will choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority to head the government

cameras at polls and boasts of low turnoutA public relations firm has claimed credit for placing cameras in Arab polling stations in support of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  boasting that the effort helped lower voter turnout  according to posts on the company s Facebook page The company  Kaizler Inbar  in a public Facebook post wrote   Thanks to us placing observers in every polling station we managed to lower the voter turnout to under 50 percent  the lowest in recent years   according to a translation in the Israeli news outlet Haaretz The company said it worked with Likud to distribute the cameras  The company is headed by Sagi Kaizler  a former leader of a West Bank settler group  who confirmed to Haaretz that his company was behind the Likud funded effort A photo of staff members standing alongside Mr  Netanyahu and his wife  Sara  was posted with the note On Election Day  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling stations in predominantly Arab towns  Some of the cameras were concealed  as seen in videos online  Likud said the cameras were deployed to record evidence of potential voter fraud The Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint on Tuesday over the cameras  calling the tactic voter intimidation  The police confiscated dozens of the cameras  and the Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said filming in polling stations was prohibited   MEGAN SPECIAImageAn event in Jerusalem this month for Shas  an ultra Orthodox party  Shas has pledged to support Benjamin Netanyahu in a governing coalition CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesParties on the right line up behind NetanyahuFour right wing and religious parties had publicly pledged by Wednesday morning to support Mr  Netanyahu in his bid to form Israel s next governing coalition  Those commitments  if they hold  leave him just one seat short of a parliamentary majority and a fourth consecutive term in office The four parties   Kulanu  the Union of Right Wing Parties  and the ultra Orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism   are projected to win a combined 25 seats  Together with the 35 seats that Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party is projected to win  such a coalition would have 60 seats in the 120 seat Parliament Also among what Mr  Netanyahu terms his  natural partners  is the hard line Yisrael Beiteinu party  led by Avigdor Lieberman  which is projected to take five seats The party has joined coalition governments led by Mr  Netanyahu in the past  but Mr  Lieberman was holding out on Wednesday  saying he was waiting for the final tally of votes  including the ballots of soldiers  prisoners and hospital patients that are to be counted later this week Mr  Lieberman served as foreign affairs minister and then defense minister under Mr  Netanyahu  but resigned from the government in November  complaining of a soft policy toward Hamas  the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza A

next steps depend on Israel s president  a Netanyahu foePresident Reuven Rivlin will decide whether to invite Mr  Netanyahu to form a governing coalition  though the two men have made little secret over the years of their mutual loathing  The president s office said Wednesday that he would begin consulting party heads next week to gauge their choices for prime minister In what the office described as a  historic and pioneering decision   it plans to broadcast those meetings live  in the name of transparency   That move may offer Mr  Rivlin protection from possible barbs from Mr  Netanyahu if the process does not go as the prime minister would like  Here is a guide to The New York Times s coverage of the Israeli election  The origins of the animosity between the president and prime minister are unclear  but it burst into the open when Mr  Rivlin  a veteran of Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party and a former speaker of Parliament  was running for the presidency in 2014 So determined was Mr  Netanyahu to thwart Mr  Rivlin s candidacy that he tried to recruit Elie Wiesel  a Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate  for the job   even though Mr  Wiesel  who has since died  was not an Israeli citizen at the time  When that failed  Mr  Netanyahu floated the idea of abolishing the largely ceremonial office Mr  Rivlin  79  has spoken out forcefully against the government s attempts to curb the independence of the courts and the media  and what he called a lack of  statesmanship  under Mr  Netanyahu    ISABEL KERSHNERImageThe settlement of Beitar Illit  Making an appeal

where I will continue to fight for them  In November  Mr  Bennett sought to be named defense minister  but the prime minister turned him down The New Right broke away from a more established right wing party  aiming to free itself of the influence of ultra Orthodox rabbis and more extremist elements in the pro settler community  But it defined itself by what it was not  rather than what it was  and its election ads were widely seen as sophomoric  They were rising stars with a solid base of support  which they abandoned   said Tal Shalev  a political reporter for Walla  a news site Mr  Bennett and Ms  Shaked had expected to compete with Mr  Gantz for support from the center right  Instead  those voters appeared to turn to other parties on the right  believing Mr  Netanyahu s dire warnings that a Gantz victory would mean a return to left wing government Ms  Shaked  the justice minister  is highly popular among Likud activists  many of whom see her as a future prime minister

outside the White House   Everyone said you can t have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians  I think we have a chance  and I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won  Mr  Trump has reversed generations of United States policy  moving the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv  and recognizing Israel s authority over the Golan Heights  which much of the world has condemned Those moves  urged by the Israeli leader  bolstered Mr  Netanyahu s political standing at home  particularly on the right  Days before the election  he said he would annex parts of the occupied West Bank   another goal of the Israeli right  despite international and Palestinian objections that such a move could doom the prospects for a peace agreement Mr  Trump has promised to

We ve ended this live briefing for the night  We will have another one on Wednesday  Here s what happened today   Exit polls show a dead heat in the race between Benjamin Netanyahu  the polarizing

until early morning Israel time  late tonight in the U S  It will then be up to President Reuven Rivlin to choose the party leader he believes has the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority   Regardless of who becomes the next prime minister  the election has already proven to be a humbling setback for Mr  Netanyahu  69  who has built a strong economy  kept the country safe and

preliminary exit polls The muddled projected outcome left Israel teetering at a critical juncture between an ever sharper turn to the right or a more moderate reset of the political order The exit polls of the three main television channels were sufficiently disparate that both sides claimed victory In a head to head matchup  two of the polls showed Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party ahead and a third showed him in a draw with Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  But including the broader blocs supporting each party  two polls showed the Likud bloc ahead and the third was a draw Just after midnight  Mr  Gantz made a triumphant entrance at his party headquarters to the cheers and chants of supporters  and gave a victory speech even though victory was not assured Calling it  a historic day   Mr

parties is able to win seats in the Parliament when all the votes are counted  those extra seats could swing the determination of the winning coalition and thus the next prime minister When will we

counting was expected to continue until at least 3 a m  Israel time  8 p m  Eastern   and possibly hours later  By Wednesday morning  the Central Elections Committee should release close to final

already busy on Tuesday night trying to secure recommendations and support from his so called  natural partners  among the right wing and religious parties A caveat on exit pollsThe final outcome was likely to be swayed by several small parties that were teetering just above or below the electoral threshold  according to the exit polls  Avigdor Lieberman  the leader of one such party  the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu  said it was  too early to draw conclusions  The exit polls of the 2015 election serve as a cautionary tale  They anticipated a tie between Likud and the center left Zionist Union  with most projecting 27 seats for each  In the final count  Likud prevailed with 30 seats and the Zionist Union won only 24 In another variable on Tuesday  the exit polls may not have

the polls before it was too late But among Arab voters  where a boycott movement appeared to be having a strong effect  the haranguing was especially intense  The right is planning to crush the Arab

have voted to preserve the status quo  they have said  no  to peace and  yes  to the occupation  Just days ago  Mr  Netanyahu unexpectedly promised to begin extending Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank if re elected  The move would probably doom a two state solution and appeared to be a last ditch effort to rally his right wing base Mr  Gantz s Blue and White party has come out against the idea of annexing West Bank settlements  but it has been vague about allowing a Palestinian state alongside Israel Netanyahu s party places hidden cameras at Arab pollsA boycott campaign wasn t the only reason for poor turnout among Arab voters  Early Tuesday  Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party acknowledged sending more than 1 000 activists with cameras into polling places in Arab towns At least some of the Likud observers concealed the cameras  as online videos showed  Likud said the move was aimed at capturing evidence of any irregularities According to Israeli news reports  the Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint  calling it voter intimidation  the police confiscated dozens of the cameras  and the Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said filming in polling stations was prohibited Just before 9 p m   the left wing party Meretz  which was counting on Arab support to clear the threshold to be seated in Parliament  appealed to elections officials to keep the polls open in Arab villages an extra hour to allow in any voters who had initially been scared off by the cameras How it worksVoters cast ballots for parties  not candidates  Thirty nine parties are participating  The percentage of the vote determines a party s number of seats in the Knesset  or Parliament  Any party needs at least 3 25 percent of the vote for a seat Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and Mr  Gantz s Blue and White alliance are expected to gain more seats than any other group  But each will fall far short of achieving a 61 seat majority on its own  meaning that a new government will almost certainly be formed by a multiparty coalition  See our guide to the Israeli elections  Possible outcomesImageA poster of the Blue and White party leaders in Tel Aviv  depicting from left

smaller right wing parties Blue and White wins the most seats  Mr  Gantz and his partners might be able to reach a majority with a combination of smaller parties on the left and right Unity government of Likud plus Blue and White  While Mr  Gantz has vowed never to serve in a government led by Mr  Netanyahu  there has been speculation that their parties might negotiate to form a unity government if neither can attain the sufficient number of seats  Such a possibility would increase if some smaller parties needed by Mr  Netanyahu and Mr  Gantz fail to make the 3 25 percent threshold Any party that wins at least 3 25 percent of the vote gets at least three seats in Parliament  but if parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes are discarded

HONG KONG   Nine democracy activists on Tuesday were convicted by a Hong Kong court on public nuisance charges for their roles in the protest movement that led to the monthslong occupation of major intersections in the city five years ago The activists face prison terms of up to seven years The protests  which became known as the Umbrella Movement  galvanized the city and sought to force Hong Kong s top official to step down and the government to accept more democratic means to elect future leaders While the protests had no formal leaders  three of the people on trial   Chu Yiu ming  a retired pastor  and two professors  Benny Tai and Chan Kin man   were founders of Occupy Central With Love and Peace  one of the main groups advocating civil disobedience to demand changes to Hong Kong s electoral system The three were convicted of conspiracy to commit public nuisance  Mr  Tai and Mr  Chan were also convicted of incitement to commit public nuisance The convictions were swiftly criticized by Hong Kong democracy advocates  human rights groups and politicians in the United States and Britain  At a time when most people would have thought that the aim of the Hong Kong government should be to bring the whole community together  it seems appallingly divisive to use anachronistic common law charges in a vengeful pursuit of political events which took place in 2014   Chris Patten  the last colonial governor of Hong Kong  said in a statement Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  and Representative James P  McGovern  Democrat of Massachusetts  said in a statement that the convictions  effectively punish peaceful political dissent and narrow the space for free expression and peaceful assembly  The Occupy Central founders had envisioned a sit in of two or three days  but student protesters who occupied a square near the Hong Kong government headquarters pre empted their plans  When the police used pepper spray and later tear gas against the student protesters  thousands of people took to the streets The Umbrella Movement  which took its name from the shield protesters used against pepper spray  lasted 79 days  with participants camping out behind homemade barriers on the streets of some of the city s busiest districts ImageDemonstrators near the Hong Kong government headquarters in September 2014  When the police used pepper spray and tear gas against student protesters  thousands of people took to the streets CreditDale De La Rey Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe activists on trial argued that they were being disproportionately blamed for acts of civil disobedience meant to help the people of the city  This is a case about some Hong Kong people who love Hong Kong very much and believe that only through the introduction of genuine universal suffrage could a door be opened to resolving the deep seated conflicts in Hong Kong   Mr  Tai said in a closing submission during the trial last year Judge Johnny Chan of the District Court rejected the argument of the Occupy Central leaders that the protest was an appropriate exercise of free speech  finding that they knew  the occupy movement would impinge unreasonably upon the rights of others  The protests have been followed by a long stretch of frustration and defeat for pro democracy activists Hong Kong s leader at the time  Leung Chun ying  refused to step down  though he did not seek another term in 2017  Lawmakers rejected a proposal that would have allowed Hong Kong voters to directly elect their leader  known as the chief executive  but only from a slate of candidates approved by a pro establishment election committee Some young activists took to politics after the defeat of the Umbrella Movement but found themselves blocked from holding office In 2016 and 2017  Hong Kong courts removed six lawmakers for altering their oaths of office to include phrases of protest that echoed the calls of the Umbrella Movement  Several others have been disqualified from running in recent elections by officials who have ruled that they do not sincerely believe that Hong Kong is an  inalienable part  of China Hong Kong  a former British colony  returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a  one country  two systems  arrangement that allows it to maintain its own local government and legal system  with far more robust protection of civil liberties than in mainland China  The Basic Law  Hong Kong s local constitution  envisions a directly elected chief executive  but the central government has maintained that the candidates must pass a strict nomination procedure  which helped set off the 2014 protests In addition to the three Occupy Central founders  Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka chun  both current lawmakers  Lee Wing tat  a former lawmaker  Tommy Cheung and Eason Chung  who were student leaders  and Raphael Wong  a member of the League of Social Democrats  a pro democracy party  were convicted of public nuisance charges The government has prosecuted 266 people over the Umbrella Movement  with 118 convicted  according to a tally last year by Kong Tsung gan  a Hong Kong writer and activist Last year  Hong Kong s highest court overturned prison sentences of six to eight months given to three student leaders  Joshua Wong  Alex Chow and Nathan Law  But the court also affirmed tougher sentencing guidelines for future offenses that  cross the line of acceptability  including acts of incitement  particularly so if violence is involved   

The number of executions around the world fell by about a third in 2018  reaching the lowest level in at least a decade as several countries scaled back or abolished the death penalty  Amnesty International said in a report released on Wednesday The global decline was driven largely by Iran  where executions were halved because of legal reforms that included eliminating the death penalty for a number of drug related crimes  The trend points toward a world ridding itself of the death penalty   said Oluwatosin Popoola  Amnesty International s adviser on the death penalty Over all  at least 690 people were executed last year  compared with 993 the year before  the organization said  Despite the reforms  Iran still executed more than 250 people last year  second only to China  Iran was followed by Saudi Arabia  Vietnam and Iraq in executions ImageCritically  though  the report s headline figure omits the thousands of estimated annual executions carried out by China  which Amnesty International calls  the world s top executioner   The group stopped providing estimates for China a decade ago  after the government there began misrepresenting the numbers  which are only minimum estimates ImageDemonstrators in Rome last year called for the abolition of the death penalty CreditAP Photo Andrew MedichiniThe country by country figures  published annually by Amnesty International since 2008  are based on what the group can reasonably confirm through official and informal sources  Some countries  such as China  consider death sentences to be a state secret  while little information can be gathered on others that are too restrictive or marred by conflict  such as North Korea or Syria While even repressive governments like Iran s have taken steps to reduce death sentences  executions still rose  albeit in small numbers  in Belarus  Japan  Singapore  South Sudan and the United States In the United States  25 people were executed last year  slightly up from the year before  Executions in the country peaked in 1999  when 98 people were put to death  according to the Death Penalty Information Center In Sri Lanka  President Maithripala Sirisena announced plans to resurrect the death penalty after a 40 year moratorium  while Thailand carried out its first execution in a decade Amnesty International also expressed concern about an increase in death sentences in some countries  In Iraq  for example  the number of people sentenced to death last year quadrupled to 271  In Egypt  717 were sentenced to death last year  compared with 402 the year before Still  the group found that the death penalty is generally on the decline  with a growing number of countries limiting its use or banning it outright  as Gambia and Malaysia announced last year  By the end of last year  142 countries had abolished the death penalty by law or in practice  

JERUSALEM   His army nickname was Benny Huta  a Hebrew pun that translates as  Benny Chill   And in his first ever run for office  Benny Gantz never let anyone see him sweat  no matter the live television gaffes  embarrassing leaks or rumors about personal improprieties that occasionally tripped up his candidacy for prime minister His centrist  flag hued Blue and White party did better than any new Israeli faction ever had before  earning more than a million votes and around 35 seats in Parliament on Tuesday  That was the same as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud party did  though smaller right wing factions tilted the election sharply to the incumbent It was quite a showing after just a few months in politics  Now  Mr  Gantz  a three star general and former Israeli military chief  is laying in for a siege against Mr  Netanyahu that his allies expect could last into 2020  Nothing will drive us from our goal   Mr  Gantz said Wednesday night With Mr  Netanyahu expected to form the most right wing and ultra Orthodox government Israel has ever seen  it will probably be a bumpy road even before a coalition is formed The issue of military conscription is likely to put secular and ultra Orthodox parties in his coalition immediately at odds  Mr  Netanyahu s expected indictment is looming  and may come as soon as July  And then there is the wild card of a Trump administration peace plan   one that some of his coalition partners could well find unacceptable   that could be announced at any time ImageA Blue and White campaign poster in Tel Aviv  From left  Moshe Yaalon  Mr  Gantz  Yair Lapid and Gabi Ashkenazi CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesOn Wednesday  Mr  Gantz s partner in Blue and White  Yair Lapid  offered a warning to Mr  Netanyahu and the Likud   We are going to make your lives miserable   We will turn the Knesset into a field of battle   he said   And we will do one more thing  We will show the citizens of Israel how a real  true alternative looks  Yet as a candidate  Mr  Gantz  with his hooded eyes  mild manner and above all his willingness to let Mr  Lapid take over as prime minister after two years of their term  left many voters wondering if he had the fire in the belly   or as Israelis call it  the  knife in the teeth    to defeat Mr  Netanyahu And on Wednesday  he spoke less militantly than Mr  Lapid of his plans as opposition leader  I have come not for power  I came for a goal   he said   I came for Israeli society  I came from a place of great love for Israeli society and a place of great love for the country  For Mr  Gantz  merely holding his seven week old party together would be its own achievement  Blue and White comprises left  centrist and right wing politicians who were able to get behind a noncontroversial platform  but have not yet had occasion to fight over actual legislation It is a merger of three parties  Mr  Gantz s Israel Resilience  itself a fledgling party  a small  more hawkish faction led by Moshe Yaalon  a former defense minister and army chief who is a veteran of Mr  Netanyahu s conservative Likud party  and Yesh Atid  an established centrist party led by Mr  Lapid  a former finance minister  A third army chief  Gabi Ashkenazi  also occupies a top leadership spot ImageMr  Gantz and his wife  Revital  casting their votes in Rosh Haayin  Israel  on Tuesday CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesAll four put their egos aside for the campaign   though that was with an outcome in mind that did not involve sitting in the opposition Blue and White will also have to resist what are certain to be the wily Mr  Netanyahu s efforts to divide and conquer  and there are several visible seams Mr  Netanyahu could test  The prime minister could woo the half dozen right wing members with legislation they want  straining the discipline of their new party  He could also offer the defense ministry to Mr  Gantz or either of the other retired generals Mr  Lapid  who built Yesh Atid into a national organization in pursuit of his own ambition to become prime minister  may see himself as a more capable leader of the opposition in Parliament than Mr  Gantz  And other party members with important jobs like Avi Nissenkorn  the chairman of the labor federation Histadrut   Israel s A F L  C I O    may grow impatient as lawmakers in the minority Mr  Lapid  the most seasoned spokesman of the bunch  tackled those doubts head on   I see an ensemble   he said   They will try to break us up  They will not succeed  Analysts have speculated that a Trump peace plan might prompt Mr  Netanyahu to appeal to Mr  Gantz to form a broad national unity government  But Yoaz Hendel  a former Netanyahu spokesman who was No  2 in Mr  Yaalon s Telem Party  said Mr  Gantz would have little trouble resisting such advances  I don t see any reason to help Netanyahu with a Trump plan   Mr  Hendel said   If he has his own coalition  I offer him to do it by himself  I don t see any reason to give him a defense shield  ImageBlue and White supporters on Election Day CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesMr  Gantz ran on a slate dedicated to integrity  clean government and repairing the system  The party offered voters something less than a revolution  But the mild tones of its campaign appealed to a widespread yearning among many Israelis to return to an older  possibly idealized Israel  where leaders were modest to the point of frugality and put the good of the country before party or personal interests Mr  Gantz spoke of being a prime minister for all Israeli citizens  Jews and non Jews alike  itself a noteworthy statement in the current environment  But he ruled out forming a coalition with the leaders of Arab parties  And to appeal to as many voters as possible  he espoused no firm policy positions and said little about fundamental issues like the Israeli Palestinian conflict Born to parents who survived the Holocaust  became Zionist pioneers and helped found a farming community in the early years of the state  Mr  Gantz speaks English with a thick Israeli accent and is understated to the point of appearing bashful He lives unostentatiously in Rosh Haayin  in central Israel  in a suburban neighborhood of neat  semidetached homes built for army officers  His hobbies include attending communal singalongs of Hebrew oldies like  Hareut   his favorite  a haunting rendition of a poem by Haim Gouri  who died last year  The song memorializes the comradeship of those who fought in the 1948 war surrounding Israel s creation Mr  Gantz grew up in a religious family in Kfar Ahim  a cooperative agricultural village near the border with Gaza  His father  Nahum  was from Romania  His mother  Malka  who was Hungarian  was liberated from the Bergen Belsen concentration camp In an emotional address at the launch of the Blue and White alliance in February  Mr  Gantz related that 75 years ago  Mr  Lapid s father  Tommy  and Mr  Gantz s mother shared a room together in the Jewish ghetto in Budapest ImageMr  Gantz  right  and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  second from left  in 2011 CreditGali Tibbon Agence France Presse   Getty Images And now we stand here before you  the son of Tommy  of blessed memory  and the son of Malka  of blessed memory  sharing one stage   he said   Because the state of Israel is a miracle  Mr  Gantz s parents were friends with Shimon Peres  who served as Israel s prime minister and later as president  said Ayelet Frish  a strategic consultant who worked for Mr  Peres  who died in 2016  He s as straight as an arrow   she said of Mr  Gantz   He is not quick to take decisions  but he knows how to take them  In his long career  Mr  Gantz spent two years as Israel s military attach in Washington  and once rode across the United States on a Harley Davidson  He retired from the Israel Defense Forces in 2015 Fania Oz Salzberger  the daughter of Amos Oz  the Israeli writer and peace advocate who died last year  said her father and Mr  Gantz  were respectful friends  though Gantz is politically right of Oz   Gantz often visited my ill father   she said on Twitter   They talked a lot  And father told us   A good leader must understand human nature  read the map  have courage and compassion  That s Gantz    

Israel stood still for a moment this week so it could bring home the remains of Sgt  Zachary Baumel  a soldier who perished in battle in 1982  This was in the midst of the most bitterly contested election the country has had in decades  with important things at stake  the probity of government  relations with the Diaspora  the limits of the settlement enterprise  the possibility of peace There are things that matter more  Keeping faith with the fallen and bereaved is one of them Anyone who has lived in Israel gets this  It s a young and improvising state resting atop an ancient and profound civilization  At the heart of the civilization is common memory  Elections come and go  memory accretes  It is to everyday life what geology is to flora and fauna  grounding  shaping  slow moving  still growing  Memory is the true land of Israel The Israeli government spent 37 years tracking Baumel s remains to Syria and negotiating their recovery through Russia  The country will expend similar efforts to bring home other fallen soldiers held in enemy hands  It s the core of the Jewish state s social contract  It may not be able to keep its people safe  much less make them rich  But it will never forget or forsake them That s something to consider when it comes to the election  too  In Washington last month I interviewed Benny Gantz  the former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces who now leads the Blue and White party  the principal challenger to Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud Gantz doesn t communicate a political agenda so much as he does a character and an attitude  He s an Israeli of the old school  confident  to the point  unassuming   a man who tries  but doesn t quite succeed  in hiding his warmth  In our interview he described himself as a security hawk and a  moderate capitalist   but otherwise his ideology is mainly about not having one The interview itself was unremarkable  Gantz had a slight lead in the polls at the time  he s now in a dead heat  though the outcome of the election will depend on how smaller  coalition making parties fare   and he seemed to be taking care to say nothing that would get him into trouble  Here  condensed for clarity  is what stood out ImageIsraeli soldiers carring the coffin of Sergeant Zachary Baumel during a military funeral at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem CreditAbir Sultan EPA  via ShutterstockOn Netanyahu   Very smart  a good manager  a good politician  He s what so many Israelis would like to see  in a prime minister   In the last four or five years  something happened to this guy  I don t know what happened  It s unexplainable  On Palestinian statehood   Israel needs to stay a Zionist country with a Jewish majority in a democratic system  Eventually  Palestinians should have some kind of independency  On egalitarian prayer spaces   The Western Wall is long enough to accommodate everyone  On Israel s security needs vis  vis Palestinians   We should maintain security for a perimeter outside  Palestinian areas   Conduct security inside  If we don t  it will endanger Palestinians themselves  The economies should eventually be merged  On relations with the U S    We share the same values and moral standards and we share the same interests  And it stands for both sides of the aisle  On whether he would serve in a coalition with Netanyahu  either over or under him   No  On what distinguishes his party from Netanyahu s   We have left and right  religious and secular  Druse  ultra Orthodox women  Unity is very important  We cannot agree on everything but we must agree on the framework    Netanyahu currently lives off this separation  between various Israeli groups   I m talking about my priorities  but I m talking to everyone  He s appealing to his base  That last observation is the essential point  In many ways  Israel has defied expectations and done remarkably well over the past decade  Much of this has been Netanyahu s doing But it has come at the cost of increasing divisions between Israeli and American Jews  And intense divisions between Orthodox and non Orthodox Jews  And embittering divisions between Jewish and non Jewish Israelis  And between the hard right and everyone it deems a sellout   an ever growing group when one practices the politics of loyalists versus traitors  as opposed to the politics of friends and potential friends None of these quarrels are about Israel s enemies  who are real  deadly and growing in number  But the quarrels have become enemies in themselves  Israel is powerful enough to defeat any of its regional adversaries  in almost any combination  It can survive the challenge of the Palestinians and binationalism  too  Whether it can survive its own descent into sectarian and ideological tribalism is another matter Which is why the return of Baumel s remains seems so propitiously timed  Israeli pundits think it will help Netanyahu s re election chances  on the view that it makes him seem more capable and statesmanlike I wouldn t be so sure  Baumel s short life  tragic death and hard fought homecoming are potent reminders of all the ties that still unite the Jewish state  for all the differences  They are what commends Gantz s candidacy  whether he wins this time or not The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think

WASHINGTON   Temporary status is a seemingly permanent condition of the Trump administration The resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen as homeland security secretary on Sunday means that another cabinet officer who reports directly to President Trump will have the word  acting  next to the official title at a major department of government Interim secretaries are also in place at the Departments of Defense and of the Interior  and at the Office of Management and Budget  the Small Business Administration and ambassador s office at the United Nations  Mick Mulvaney  Mr  Trump s chief of staff  is also serving in an acting capacity  I like acting  It gives me more flexibility  Do you understand that   Mr  Trump told reporters in January before departing to Camp David   I like acting  So we have a few that are acting  We have a great  great cabinet  But there are concerns about having men and women in such high level jobs without having been subjected to Senate confirmation for those posts  Leaving cabinet secretaries unconfirmed in their roles could give the president even more leverage over them  or could leave them without full authority in the job  The Senate grappled with this question in the very first Congress when it ordered George Washington to send nominations to the Hill at a reasonable pace   said Paul Light  a professor of public service at New York University who has written extensively on the appointment process   Senators rightly worried that presidents might use acting appointees to evade oversight and institutional prerogatives  Yet  we haven t heard a word from the Senate on the Trump administration s abuse of its acting authority  Justice Clarence Thomas argued in a concurring opinion in a 2017 case that there was seemingly no constitutional basis for having  acting  cabinet members and that there needed to be limits on a president s power to fill the highest positions without Senate confirmation The Constitution requires that the president obtain  the advice and consent of the Senate  before appointing cabinet officials  Legal scholars also questioned the president s power to use the  acting  authority in replacing Ms  Nielsen  To me  the real difference is avoiding Senate confirmation   either because the individuals he wants running these agencies can t be confirmed even by a Republican controlled Senate  or because he s worried about the kinds of questions they d have to answer and or concessions they d have to make in order to be confirmed   said Stephen Vladeck  a law professor at the University of Texas   Either way  that s an alarming argument for bypassing a Senate controlled by his own party  Mr  Trump announced in a tweet on Sunday that Kevin McAleenan  47  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  will be Ms  Nielsen s replacement  as  acting  homeland security secretary at a time when the president has said there is a security crisis at the border with Mexico because of a flood of migrants trying to gain entry into the United States The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other Some acting officials like Patrick M  Shanahan  the acting defense secretary who had been deputy defense secretary  have been confirmed by the Senate but not in the post in which they serve  David Bernhardt  the acting interior secretary  had already been confirmed as the department s deputy and is undergoing confirmation by the Senate for the top job Mr  Trump had long publicly said he was satisfied with the performance of Ms  Nielsen  He expressed similar optimism for her acting successor  I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job   Mr  Trump said in his tweet No matter whom Mr  Trump selected  it would take time to get fully operational  Government agencies  Mr  Light noted  must  wade through piles of internal paperwork assigning responsibilities and signature authorities to one acting after another  Career government officials  wonder when vacancies will be filled  how long the actings will stay and whether they ve got the right name on the organization chart to move forward on major issues such as the Max 8 groundings   he said  referring to the airliner involved in two fatal crashes Oversight by ethics and accountability agencies within the government is also constrained   The result is a fundamental collapse in ordinary accountability   Mr  Light said In her resignation letter  Ms  Nielsen said she hoped the incoming secretary would  have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse  But the support of Congress may be difficult to obtain  notably among Democrats  who have said Mr  Trump is usurping the role of a coequal branch of government  Without confirmation hearings  there s less of a chance for the Senate to meaningfully play a role in identifying who will be in charge of these critical government functions  and thus less accountability for episodes like Acting Secretary Shanahan s ties to Boeing   Mr  Vladeck said   Second  an acting secretary may have the same control over his or her own agency as someone who is Senate confirmed  but traditionally  Senate confirmed officers have more pull in any interagency conflict  and so it has the effect of skewing the authority of different agencies toward those with permanent heads  What is more  Mr  Trump has relentlessly said there is a  crisis  on the border  yet the two cabinet departments most directly responsible for dealing with the situation  Homeland Security and Defense  do not have permanent leaders  It s striking how many of the secretaries of the largest departments of this government are acting at this point   Senator Chris Coons  Democrat of Delaware  said Monday on CNN  

ImageIt has been more than a year since logging was ordered stopped in the Bialowieza Forest  but the scars are  still visible CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York TimesBIALOWIEZA  Poland   The forest floor is a graveyard  strewn with fallen spruce and oak trees  But beneath the broken limbs and rotting leaves  thousands of species of insects are feeding in Bialowieza Forest  Fungi of many types are found only here  and sprout all year round  More are discovered every year  More than 200 species of birds  including rare woodpeckers and owls  fill the air with song  There is more life in

MantovaniImageEnvironmental activists checking lichens on trees CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York TimesIt has been more than a year since the European Court of Justice ordered an end to logging in the forest  finding that it posed a clear threat to the United Nations World Heritage site  The scars  though  are still visible   from the tracks gouged into the earth by the heavy machinery used to cut down thousands of ancient trees to the gaping holes in the canopy created by their removal The ruling was a major defeat for Poland s governing Law and Justice party  which supported the logging  Warsaw initially defied the court order  but relented when faced with a fine of 100 000 euros  about  124 000  for each day it violated the directive The battle over Bialowieza is just one of many being waged by the right wing government against the European Union  which has accused Poland of posing a risk to democratic values and the rule of law by trying to pack its courts and restrict press freedoms  Now there are fears that the Polish government is once again drawing up plans to increase logging in the area  skirting the ruling by increasing the quota for wood in hundreds of

the German occupation of Poland  Hermann Goering was so enamored of the forest that he drew up plans to create the world s largest hunting grounds and establish a Nazi Jurassic Park of sorts  reintroducing prehistoric animals to the landscape As the playground of the rich and powerful  Bialowieza was spared the fate of so many of the Continent s other forests  most of which were razed and some of which were turned into intensively controlled versions of nature  The order imposed on some of these European forests is remarkable  especially to anyone used to the untamed national parks in the United States and Canada  Armies of forest rangers relentlessly clear dead wood and underbrush to create near perfect carpets beneath the pines  The woods can feel more like nurseries than wild spaces  We have forgotten what nature looks like   Professor Kowalczyk said But Bialowieza has remained wild and unruly  Its remoteness and mostly pristine condition helped make it the site of one of the Continent s great conservation victories   the reintroduction of bison after the last free roaming animal was hunted and killed in 1919  The forest is now home to Europe s largest herd of bison  or wisent  Most people  when they think about forests  think about managed nature   said Professor Kowalczyk  who first came to Bialowieza in the 1980s   This place is so different than any forest I had ever seen  ImageStudents during a presentation on environmental awareness at the forest in 2017 CreditAndrea MantovaniImageThe trial of Lukasz Lyskawka  left  an activist convicted of assaulting forest guards CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York Times While the bison was a big success story  a much smaller creature  the hairy little bark beetle  set off the logging fight Spruce trees  especially when in a weakened state  make a perfect mating ground for the beetles  The male bores into the tree  creating a chamber where he will release pheromones to attract females  He will mate with several of them  who in turn will deposit dozens of eggs in the chamber before flying off to find new mates  The larvae left behind will feed on the vascular tissue of the tree  By the time they pupate  the damage they have done often has sucked the life from the spruce The tracks from the beetles  known as printers  can still be spotted in felled trees all across the forest Warmer winters  brought on by climate change  have allowed the population to explode  And the preference of forest managers for spruce trees has expanded the territory where they can thrive By 2016  it was clear that the beetle infestation in Bialowieza was devastating large tracts of trees  including stands hundreds of years old ImageSlawomir Dron  in the orange vest  manages a cafe at the entrance to the forest

raise her children CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York Times For many scientists  the best way to manage the infestation was to leave it alone  letting nature take its course  The bark beetle has been a part of the ecosystem for hundreds of years   said Adam Bohdan  a biologist from the Wild Poland Foundation   This phenomenon is a natural adaptation to the new climate situation  But the Polish government did not agree  It argued that the lack of human intervention in the forest would doom it  So Jan Szyszko  the environment minister at the time  ordered a large scale logging campaign  allowing heavy machinery to roll into pristine stands of trees  We will rebuild the valuable habitats in the Bialowieza Forest by removing dead trees as much as is necessary  and restoring the oaks and ashes   Mr  Szyszko declared in 2016 The move was greeted with outrage  with protesters descending on the forest  setting up an encampment and forming human blockades to try and stop the heavy machinery An army of more than 1 000 forest rangers from around the country was dispatched to a small village on the border of Belarus ready to confront the activists ImageOne of the last wood factories in the forest CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York TimesImageThe hotel Zubrowka in Bialowieza is frequented by a cosmopolitan clientele CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York TimesAt times  tempers boiled over into violence  Skirmishes broke out as activists engaged in coordinated acts of civil disobedience  But it was not until the European court threatened financial penalties that the logging ended A report issued by Unesco in February found that the  logging operations and other forest management activities have disrupted the ecological and natural processes in the property  But it was not beyond repair  according to the report  And the forest is much quieter now  New life is replacing the old although beetles remain a problem with no easy solution  In the natural forest  there is two times more dead wood than in the managed part of the forest   said Mr  Bohdan  who took part in the protests a year ago   It is really a unique laboratory   But all the time   he said   there is a worry that they will start logging again   Joanna Berendt contributed reporting ImageThe Hajnowka Cemetery at the gate of the forest CreditAndrea Mantovani for The New York

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  For years  Todd R  Howe reaped the rewards of being a Cuomo family loyalist He had worked for Gov  Mario M  Cuomo in the 1980s  and then for his son  Andrew  in the 1990s  He traded on his reputation as an Albany insider and earned up to  750 000 a year as a lobbyist and consultant  He vacationed in St  Lucia and drove a Porsche Then came a precipitous fall that took him from influencing the powerful in Albany to working as a groundskeeper in Idaho  In 2016  Mr  Howe pleaded guilty to eight felonies and agreed to testify for the prosecution in a sprawling public corruption case that has loomed over Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo s administration for more than two years Seven people were eventually convicted or pleaded guilty in cases that hinged on testimony from Mr  Howe  For that  he was rewarded on Friday with a sentence that included no prison time The fallout from the case has relentlessly shadowed Mr  Cuomo  Though prosecutors never accused the governor of any wrongdoing  and he has distanced himself from Mr  Howe  political opponents have repeatedly asked what Mr  Cuomo knew  During Mr  Cuomo s re election campaign last year  his rivals outright accused him of complicity One of Mr  Cuomo s former top lieutenants is now in prison  a conviction that Mr  Cuomo called  personally painful   A former economic development adviser was convicted  too  and one of the governor s signature upstate projects was tainted The governor coasted to re election last year  winning commanding victories in both the primary and general election  But the trials made clear he had come up short on one of his earliest campaign promises   to clean up Albany and restore public trust in government On Friday  the series of corruption cases seemed to have found an ending  at least legally  when Mr  Howe appeared in federal court in Manhattan  He was the last of the eight people felled by the corruption scandal to be sentenced While the governor s aide  Joseph Percoco  received six years in prison after being convicted on three charges  the judge  Valerie E  Caproni  sentenced Mr  Howe to five years of probation The light sentence recognized Mr  Howe s turn as the star witness in the case   He had faced up to 14 years in prison for his eight felonies   Testifying during Mr  Percoco s trial  Mr  Howe had offered an intimate  unvarnished and damning view of the highest levels of state government He described setting up a fund raising breakfast for Mr  Cuomo with developers who wanted state business  arranging a paid fishing trip between developers and Mr  Percoco  and ultimately facilitating more than  300 000 in bribes to Mr  Percoco for his help in securing state deals Judge Caproni said before imposing her sentence that Mr  Howe s actions had fed the cynical view that state government was  all about who knows who and who s greasing whose palm   Howe knew how to get someone in the good graces of Andrew Cuomo   she said Mr  Howe  asking for leniency  described the atmosphere in Albany that he said drove him to corruption  I had to stay relevant  and I had to stay successful   he told the judge   It was a tough environment to be in  but I did the things I needed to do to be relevant  Mr  Howe earned little sympathy during the trial itself  Prosecutors and defense lawyers revealed unsavory behavior ranging from embezzlement to doctoring emails to lying to his dog walker He was even thrown into jail in the middle of Mr  Percoco s trial  when he admitted that he had tried to defraud his credit card company at the same time that he was cooperating with the government Mr  Howe called his six months in jail in Brooklyn  a horrible situation for me   but also a  learning experience   It made me realize all the things I had lost   he said Perhaps because of Mr  Howe s unsavory history and its potential to undermine the prosecution s case  the government did not call him to testify in a second  related corruption trial  though his name was mentioned frequently there  too  That trial led to the conviction of Alain E  Kaloyeros  Mr  Cuomo s economic development guru Since Mr  Howe s release from jail  he and his wife have been living in Ketchum  Idaho  Mr  Howe works as a groundskeeper at a ski resort  maintaining a playground for the wealthy rather than patronizing one himself  as he once might have done As part of his guilty pleas  Mr  Howe must repay his old law firm  1 7 million that he embezzled and forfeit an additional  2 8 million  Their simpler life centers around the beauty of the surrounding mountains and peaceful time spent together   Mr  Howe s lawyers wrote in court papers  They said Mr  Howe had escaped from  the snaking vines of the lobbying network  After the sentencing  Mr  Howe  a wide grin on his face  shook hands with a few people in the courtroom  His lawyer  Savannah Stevenson  said Mr  Howe was  humbled  grateful and pleased  by the decision As he left the courthouse  Mr  Howe was asked if he had any message to give to Mr  Cuomo  He shook his head slightly   No   he said  

Kevin K  McAleenan  the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection  will become the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security  President Trump said in a tweet on Sunday The announcement came shortly after Mr  Trump said Kirstjen Nielsen was leaving the position  ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the agency  which oversees border security  among other duties  She had taken the job in late 2017 Mr  McAleenan  47  will oversee an agency that has at times been a target of the president s dissatisfaction over an increase of migrants illegally entering the United States at the southwestern border  I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job   Mr  Trump said in his tweet In her resignation letter  Ms  Nielsen said she hoped the incoming secretary would  have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse  Mr  McAleenan has a law degree from the University of Chicago and practiced law in California before he worked for the government  He held a variety of positions at the border protection agency before becoming its deputy commissioner in 2014 under the Obama administration  He won the country s highest civil service honor  the Presidential Rank Award  in 2015 Mr  McAleenan became the acting commissioner of the agency in January 2017 and was formally sworn in as commissioner in March 2018  He focused on counterterrorism  border security and trade enforcement  oversaw about 60 000 employees and managed a budget of over  13 billion  according to the agency As the nation s top border enforcement officer  Mr  McAleenan also helped carry out the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy to prosecute parents caught crossing the border illegally  which led to family separations  That policy was reversed  but the effects remain  In court documents filed on Friday  the government said it might take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the border In an interview in August  Mr  McAleenan said that  a better system would allow us to keep families together for the entirety of the immigration proceeding  which takes an average of 45 days  He added that there should be a penalty for crossing the border illegally  It s not a victimless crime   he said   Not only are the people at risk  so are our agents who need to apprehend or rescue them  It s also a diversionary tactic for smugglers who use family groups to tie down our agents while drugs are moved behind them  Mr  McAleenan said his job as the agency s commissioner was to enforce laws  not make them Last month  Mr  McAleenan was the public face of new government data showing that unauthorized entries at the southwestern border were reaching record breaking numbers  more than 76 000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February  an 11 year high  The system is well beyond capacity  and remains at the breaking point   he told reporters  adding that  this is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis  At a Senate hearing last month  he suggested ways to address that crisis  The United States government should support governments in Central America to improve economic opportunities there  he said  and work with the Mexican authorities to clamp down on transnational criminal organizations that prey on migrants  And we must invest in border security   he said   A modern border barrier system  additional agents and officers  additional technology at and between ports of entry  and air and marine support  And we must also have a whole of U S  government approach to address children s unique medical needs and the undeniable humanitarian challenges we are facing   

CHANGSHA  China   Inside a fishing gear store on a busy city street  the owner sits behind a counter  furiously tapping a smartphone to improve his score on an app that has nothing to do with rods  reels and bait The owner  Jiang Shuiqiu  a 35 year old army veteran  has a different obsession  earning points on Study the Great Nation  a new app devoted to promoting President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party   a kind of high tech equivalent of Mao s Little Red Book  Mr  Jiang spends several hours daily on the app  checking news about Mr  Xi and brushing up on socialist theories Tens of millions of Chinese workers  students and civil servants are now using Study the Great Nation  often under pressure from the government  It is part of a sweeping effort by Mr  Xi to strengthen ideological control in the digital age and reassert the party s primacy  as Mao once did  as the center of Chinese life  We must love our country   said Mr  Jiang  one of the top scorers on the app in Changsha  the capital of the southern province of Hunan   We are getting stronger and stronger  While many people have embraced the app as a form of patriotism  others see it as a burden imposed by overzealous officials and another sign of a growing personality cult around Mr  Xi  perhaps China s most powerful leader since Mao s time  He is using new media to fortify loyalty toward him   said Wu Qiang  a political analyst in Beijing  He likened Study the Great Nation to the little booklet of Mao quotations that was widely circulated during the chaotic and violent Cultural Revolution Since its debut this year  Study the Great Nation has become the most downloaded app on Apple s digital storefront in China  with the state news media saying it has more than 100 million registered users   a reach that would be the envy of any new app s creators But those numbers are driven largely by the party  which ordered thousands of officials across China to ensure that the app penetrates the daily routines of as many citizens as possible  whether they like it or not Schools are shaming students with low app scores  Government offices are holding study sessions and forcing workers who fall behind to write reports criticizing themselves  Private companies  hoping to curry favor with party officials  are ranking employees based on their use of the app and awarding top performers the title of  star learner  Many employers now require workers to submit daily screenshots documenting how many points they have earned ImageJiang Shuiqiu  who runs a fishing store in the city of Changsha in Hunan Province  has been lauded in the local news media for his high score on the app CreditJavier Hernandez The New York TimesPropaganda is ubiquitous in China  but experts say Study the Great Nation is different because the government is forcing people to use it and punishing those who cheat or fall behind The app allows users to earn points for staying on top of news about Mr  Xi  Watching a video about his recent visit to France  for example  earns one point  Getting a perfect score on a quiz about his economic policies earns 10 The app comes as Mr  Xi  who rose to power in 2012  is leading a broader crackdown on free speech in China  imprisoning scores of activists  lawyers and intellectuals  and imposing new restrictions on the news media  Mr  Xi has spoken frequently about what he calls the need to guard against online threats  He has warned that the party could lose its grip on power if it does not master digital media  There is no national security without internet security   Mr  Xi said in a speech this year   If we cannot succeed on the internet  we will not be able to maintain power in the long run  David Bandurski  co director of the China Media Project  said the app was a way for Mr  Xi to ensure that Chinese families are invested in the life of the party at a time when many dismiss propaganda as stilted and irrelevant  Loyalty to the party   Mr  Bandurski said   means loyalty to Xi Jinping  Study the Great Nation in some ways harkens back to the Mao era  when the chairman s portrait hung in living rooms and families studied his words feverishly  While Mr  Xi cannot yet match Mao s grandeur  he has borrowed from Mao s playbook in his quest to be seen as a singular  transformative force The app features a television series called  Xi Time  and Mr  Xi s quotations on topics like building a strong military and achieving a  Chinese dream  of prosperity and strength  The app recommends stories about Mr  Xi on its home screen and sends push notifications highlighting  golden sentences  from his latest speeches  Even the Chinese name for the app is a play on Mr  Xi s name The app  which also offers lighter fare about traditional Chinese culture  history and geography  presents a censored version of current events  Topics such as China s mass detention of Muslims are not included At Hulunbuir University in northern China  school officials monitor the scores of more than 1 100 teachers and students who use the app as part of the school s efforts to spread Mr  Xi s ideas  known in China as Xi Jinping Thought  Everyone studies voluntarily and has very high scores   said Bai Mei  an ideology instructor at the university Not everyone is as enthusiastic  In interviews  students and workers complained that superiors publicly chastised them for low scores  Others said bosses threatened to deduct pay or withhold bonuses if they did not use the app more frequently  They did not want to provide their names for fear of punishment  but some have complained online  What kind of phenomenon is this   one user wrote on Weibo  a popular social media site  complaining of a salary deduction   My God  what has happened to the party now  ImageA screen grab from the Study the Great Nation app  Since its introduction this year  it has become the most downloaded app on Apple s digital storefront in China Critics say Mr  Xi is intruding into the private lives of Chinese citizens in a way the party has typically avoided since the Mao era  The app makes the party s messages difficult to ignore  awarding points only when an article has been read completely and a video has been watched for at least three minutes  You cannot divert attention away from it   said Haiqing Yu  a professor who studies Chinese media at RMIT University in Australia   It s a kind of digital surveillance  It brings the digital dictatorship to a new level  The app  which was developed by the party s Propaganda Department and the technology giant Alibaba  is available on the Apple app store as well as Android app stores in China  The Propaganda Department keeps user data It is unclear how closely the government tracks users of Study the Great Nation  but the app requires people to provide a mobile number to register and a national identification number to access videoconference and chat features The Propaganda Department declined to comment  as did Alibaba  which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange Given the pressures to use the app  a cheating industry involving at least a dozen products has flourished  A man who listed his contact information in an online advertisement for cheating software said in an interview that many of his more than 1 000 customers saw the app as a burden imposed by bosses  He declined to provide his name for fear of retribution The government has moved swiftly to prosecute cheating and limit criticism of the app  The police in the southeastern province of Jiangxi last month detained a man who sold cheating software for about  13  The police said the man was running an illegal business The state run news media teems with glowing reviews of the app  including stories about diligent hospital workers and kindergarten teachers who open Study the Great Nation as soon as they awaken  even before they drink water or go to the bathroom The app has inspired  videos by prison guards  raps by children and adulatory song and dance routines by power plant workers  Some party members have suggested the app can be used as a dating tool to screen potential mates   If you see a guy on the subway using the app   says one cartoon   you should marry him   In Changsha  which coincidentally is an hour s drive from Mao s childhood home  the local news media has lauded Mr  Jiang  the owner of the fishing gear store  for his high scores  He and his wife sometimes answer questions on the app together at dinner  alongside their 9 year old son Mr  Jiang said his military training had inspired him to devote himself fully to Study the Great Nation  By using the app  he said  he has grown even more patriotic  President Xi has a dream of great renaissance   he said   When young people are strong  the nation is strong   

Ernest F  Hollings  a silver haired South Carolina Democrat who served 38 years in the United States Senate in an era of rising prosperity and often painful accommodation to racial tolerance in his

s senior senator  Mr  Hollings became governor  ran for president and was a revered populist who took care of the military  business interests and the folks back home Together  they were the nation s longest serving Senate pair from one state  When Mr  Thurmond died in 2003 at 100  he had been the Senate s longest tenured member after 48 years in office  Moreover  Mr  Hollings was junior senator for 36 years  itself a record  and his tenure of 38 years and 55 days  including more than two years fulfilling the term of a senator who died in office  made him the eighth longest serving senator Mr  Thurmond  a Democrat who switched to the Republican Party  never relented in his opposition to full equality for black Americans  Mr  Hollings  while remaining a fiscal conservative  evolved into a social moderate  riding winds of change that swept the South as proponents of civil rights won court cases  staged protests and endured brutalities that shocked the nation s conscience Having grown up in segregated Charleston  attended a segregated college and served in a segregated army  Mr  Hollings had little contact with poor black people and initially opposed civil rights legislation  Guided by N A A C P  officials  he toured poor black and white areas of his state in 1968 and 1969  and what he saw shocked him  rat infested slums where families subsisted on grits and greens  children

dignity   Weeks later  Harvey Gantt enrolled at Clemson without incident as its first black student By 1984  during a hopeless campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination  he called himself a centrist   strong on defense and liberal on social issues   He built his campaign around a spending freeze but endorsed racial amity  the fight against poverty and a shift away from the Reagan administration s use of military force and covert operations in Central America And by 2005  when he left the Senate  Mr  Hollings had established a long record of support for civil rights  He had also endorsed the Rev  Jesse Jackson for president in 1988  and had voted in 1991 to confirm Clarence Thomas as the second black justice of the Supreme Court ImageMr  Hollings with his wife  Patricia

Mr  Biden scrambled to defend himself and contain the crisis  the first of his possible presidential bid On Monday  a second woman accused Mr  Biden of touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable  intensifying the scrutiny of the former vice president s physical interactions with women It wasn t until Wednesday that Mr  Biden addressed the allegations in a video  saying he realized that  social norms have begun to change   But it wasn t an apology He made a convoluted  joking attempt to deal with the issue on Friday  at a conference in Washington   I m sorry I didn t

KANDAHAR  Afghanistan   Dozens of Afghan forces and Taliban fighters were killed in overnight fighting across Afghanistan  officials said Tuesday  as violence intensified ahead of another round of peace efforts to end the 18 year old war The worst of the attacks were in Kandahar Province  where the Taliban targeted an Afghan border post late Monday  killing at least four service members  according to local officials  Kasim Azad  the secretary of Kandahar s police chief  confirmed the attack and said four members of the border forces were killed But other officials put the death toll as high as 18 and said that at least eight other people were unaccounted for  possibly taken by the Taliban  Mr  Azad said 17 Taliban fighters had also been killed  The Taliban claimed to have overrun the border post  but the Afghan defense ministry said all of the attacked border posts remained under government control The violence comes a day after three American soldiers were killed near Bagram Air Base outside Kabul  Although Defense Department officials initially said that a contractor had also been killed in the attack  on Tuesday they revised their account to say that the contractor had only been wounded That attack brought the deaths of American troops in Afghanistan this year to seven  About 14 000 United States troops are currently in Afghanistan  though President Trump has asked administration officials to prepare for cutting that number in half Fighting has intensified despite a call on Sunday from Zalmay Khalilzad  the United States special envoy for Afghan peace  for a reduction in violence in the coming weeks as another round of talks are expected to get underway in the Gulf state of Qatar Those talks will be the first time the Taliban meet with Afghan government representatives in recent years  However  they are attending as part of a larger group representing all sects of the Afghan society rather than as an official government delegation Despite several rounds of negotiations with American diplomats  where the two sides are close to reaching a deal  the Taliban have so far refused direct negotiations with the Afghan government  American and Afghan officials hope the informal meeting can pave the way for direct negotiations between the two sides The violence on Monday is part of a deadly fight in the northwestern province of Badghis for the control of the Bala Murghab district  which falls on an important smuggling route along the border with Turkmenistan  The district has faced heightened pressure in recent months and it has been almost a week since the Taliban began a major offensive there At least 30 Afghan forces were killed in the initial days of fighting and the casualties have mounted since  The Afghan defense ministry said that more than 100 Taliban fighters have been killed   although those numbers could not be independently verified and the Afghan government is known to exaggerate enemy casualties The struggle of the Afghan forces has exposed their vulnerabilities ahead of what is expected to be a tough fighting season as both sides aim for battlefield gains that will increase their leverage in the peace talks It has also raised concerns that Afghan forces will surrender or flee under Taliban pressure rather than fight  particularly with the Taliban offering them better treatment for doing so  Last month  the Taliban captured about 150 Afghan forces after they fled to Turkmenistan  which turned them back  

OTTAWA   Canada is expecting foreign interference in its national election in October  and is considering stronger regulation of social media companies to ensure they block meddling in the voting  the minister responsible for election integrity said on Monday The minister spoke after the release of an updated report by Canada s electronic eavesdropping and security agency on online interference by other countries in the Canadian election  We judge it very likely that Canadian voters will encounter some form of foreign cyber interference related to the 2019 federal election   the report said   However  at this time  it is improbable that this foreign cyber interference will be of the scale of Russian activity against the 2016 United States presidential election   Canada is a target of choice for those who seek to undermine our democracy   said the minister  Karina Gould  at a news conference in Ottawa The report does not indicate what countries are likely to attack Canada  and both Harjit Sajjan  the defense minister  and Shelly Bruce  who heads the electronic security agency  declined to elaborate Ms  Gould also criticized Google  Twitter and Facebook for not providing the Canadian government with the same degree of information they have offered Europe about their efforts to mitigate possible election interference  We have not really seen that much progress with them   she said  adding that the major social media platforms have declined to give the government regular updates about what they are observing and what they are doing to prevent any misbehavior  There s a lot left to be desired in terms of how seriously they re taking these issues   she said Kevin Chan  the head of public policy for Facebook Canada  said the company plans to introduce new rules for paid political advertising in Canada and is making efforts to block foreign meddling in elections  We take the protection of election integrity on our platform extremely seriously at Facebook  and we want to be a force for good in Canadian democracy   he said in a statement ImageKarina Gould was sworn in as the Canadian minister responsible for election integrity in 2017 CreditSean Kilpatrick The Canadian Press  via Associated PressColin McKay  head of government policy at Google Canada  said the company had met several times with several branches of the Canadian government to discuss  transparency  cybersecurity and information  The company is also working with Canada s Canadian Center for Cyber Security  a government agency  on preventing malicious attacks  Twitter declined to comment  We have every intention of continuing our close work with government to protect Canada s democratic institutions and election activities   Mr  McKay said in a statement The company did not address Ms  Gould s call for formal regulation Ms  Gould said Canada was reviewing its laws to see how they can be used to force action by online companies  and also considering new legislation It is also reviewing steps by other countries  including Britain s proposal on Monday to set up a social media regulator  and recent changes to Australia s laws that  among other things  could lead to the jailing of  executives from social media companies if they do not  expeditiously  remove content with graphic violence on their platforms  We are having active conversations with our partners and allies around the world as to what this would look like in the Canadian context   Ms  Gould said She added   The platforms have been able to avoid being held to account for what takes place on their platforms for too long  Separately on Monday  Facebook banned several Canadians and groups that promote white supremacy In a statement  the company said it was shutting down accounts held by Faith Goldy  a far right former mayoral candidate in Toronto  and several groups including the Soldiers of Odin and the Canadian Nationalist Front The report was issued by the Communications Security Establishment  which is a branch of the military and headed by Ms  Bruce  It issued a similar report in 2017 Earlier this year  the government set up a committee with representatives from the civil service  the security service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to look for signs of interference in this year s vote The report found that any interference is likely to be limited to the spread of misinformation during the campaign  It concluded that any interference in voting results was highly unlikely because Canada still uses paper ballots in national votes  

JERUSALEM   Benjamin Netanyahu s apparent re election as prime minister of Israel attests to a starkly conservative vision of the Jewish state and its people about where they are and where they are headed They prize stability  as well as the military and economic security that Mr  Netanyahu has delivered Though in many ways they have never been safer  they remain afraid   especially of Iran and its influence over their neighbors  against which Mr  Netanyahu has relentlessly crusaded  They are persuaded by his portrayal of those who challenge him  whether Arab citizens or the left  as enemies of the state  They take his resemblance to authoritarian leaders around the world as evidence that he was ahead of the curve They credit Mr  Netanyahu  whose strategic vision values power and fortitude above all  with piloting Israel to unprecedented diplomatic heights and believe still more is possible  And they are loath to let anyone less experienced take the controls  Let s be honest with ourselves   said Michael B  Oren  a former Israeli ambassador to Washington   Our economy is excellent  our foreign relations were never better  and we re secure  We ve got a guy in politics for 40 years  We know him  the world knows him   even our enemies know him  Not everyone is so enamored of him Mr  Netanyahu s coalition appears to have won 65 of the 120 seats in Parliament  But his positions on the issues differed little from those of his main challenger  Benny Gantz  suggesting that close to half of the electorate would have simply preferred someone else in the job As he assembles a new coalition  how Mr  Netanyahu manages that divide will be his first test  With a new term and an expanded Likud party  he could form an even larger right wing coalition of secular  ultra Orthodox and even some extremist lawmakers   or  if he chooses  he could to try to forge a national unity government that brings in centrists Whatever he decides  Mr  Netanyahu has been afforded the opportunity to lead Israel through a serious turning point in its history as both a Jewish and a democratic state  if his legal troubles do not topple him first An election that was all about personality and character   whether Mr  Netanyahu s likely indictment on corruption charges made him unfit to continue in the job  or whether Mr  Gantz  was up to it   left little room for issues of policy To his credit  Mr  Gantz  who conceded on Wednesday  won a record number of Parliament seats for a new party  But Mr  Netanyahu proved once again that his talents  stamina and willingness to do what it takes to win are all unmatched in Israeli politics But serious concerns for Israel that were essentially set aside in the campaign are fast approaching  As he surpasses David Ben Gurion  Israel s founding leader  as its longest serving prime minister this summer  Mr  Netanyahu will be unable to ignore any of them for long Peace with the Palestinians remains as unlikely as ever  despite the possible wild card of a long awaited proposal from the Trump administration  Mr  Netanyahu s right wing allies  to whom he may be even more beholden under his next coalition  are champing at the bit to pursue annexation of the occupied West Bank In desperation to rally the pro settler base  Mr  Netanyahu said publicly three days before the election that he would begin applying Israeli sovereignty to parts of the West Bank that the Palestinians demand for their future state  Opponents believe this would set off a new Palestinian uprising  bring to fruition the apartheid regime the Israeli left has long warned against  or both ImageConstruction in the Israeli settlement of Beitar Illit last year  Mr  Netanyahu said during the campaign that he would begin applying Israeli sovereignty to parts of the occupied West Bank CreditMenahem Kahana Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesEven without annexation in the mix  Mr  Netanyahu s settler  and ultra Orthodox dominated government  and his effusive embrace of President Trump  have rapidly alienated Israel from predominantly liberal and less observant American Jews  the largest diaspora community and a pillar of Israel s security since its founding Israel is becoming a partisan issue in the United States like never before  already forcing those seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020   including Bernie Sanders  Pete Buttigieg and Beto O Rourke   to distinguish their support for Israel from their disapproval of Mr  Netanyahu s policies Finally  though it has received little notice outside Israel  a power struggle between the judiciary   one of the country s last redoubts of assertive liberalism   and ascendant ethnonationalists has been building toward a showdown that could sharply alter the nature of Israeli democracy While conservatives have been working to curtail the Supreme Court s power through legislation  the court itself has been laying the groundwork to assert judicial review over even the so called basic laws that Parliament considers the building blocks of an eventual constitution  which Israel now lacks  Imagine the American Supreme Court judging the constitutionality of part of the Constitution itself   said Gadi Taub  a historian and Hebrew University professor who opposes settlements and annexation but supports a rollback of judicial authority Mr  Netanyahu has not led the effort to rein in the Supreme Court  but he has railed against the legal system as a whole  over the long running police corruption investigations that have led to his expected indictment on bribery and fraud charges That campaign  too  is expected to present a challenge for Israel s democratic system  Mr  Netanyahu is now almost certain to try to extract a deal from his coalition partners to pass a law retroactively granting him immunity from prosecution Israelis have grown accustomed to Mr  Netanyahu s bullish PowerPoint assessments of the country s condition  10 years of uninterrupted economic growth  its best ever credit rating  and diplomatic openings and new trading partners in Africa  Asia and Latin America  During the campaign  they also got used to clips showing Mr  Trump granting recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital and of Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights  both coveted national goals ImageMr  Netanyahu with President Trump and other officials in March  as the United States recognized Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesDorit Rabinyan  an author who calls herself left wing  said Israelis feared Mr  Netanyahu s exit as if they would be  orphaned   And she confessed to having a tinge of the same feeling herself   I m anxious about it at the very same time that I m hopeful about it   she said Critics point to a yawning income gap between those prospering in Israel s high tech industry and those in the middle class or living outside the major cities  A housing crunch  clogged highways and a crushing cost of living are keeping many young adults in their parents  homes and driving others to emigrate That gave Mr  Netanyahu s opponents on the left and even the center right ample ammunition  He s provided short term profits at a very high long term price   said Ari Shavit  a Jerusalem born journalist who has followed Mr  Netanyahu throughout his career   Netanyahu s Israel is mortgaged  And we are going to pay dearly  Mr  Shavit said the same could be said for Mr  Netanyahu s failure to use Israel s position of strength and strategic comfort    this golden moment    to take on its single most existential issue  the Palestinian conflict  and for his exploitation of Mr  Trump s largess at the cost of  endangering the relationship with Democratic America  younger America and the next administration in Washington  Mr  Taub said he expected Mr  Netanyahu to continue his decade long practice of slow walking settlement expansion  as the right complains  and sabotaging peace talks  as the left complains  Gantz  with his high talk of values  optimism  change  sounded like Obama in 2008   Mr  Taub said   But no one in Israel thinks there s really an option to annex the West Bank or make peace  So it will be the triumph of the status quo  ImagePalestinian protesters facing Israeli troops in the West Bank  Analysts believe the extension of Israeli sovereignty could touch off a Palestinian uprising CreditAbbas Momani Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBut Mr  Oren said he believed that a Trump peace plan was forthcoming  and that Mr  Netanyahu was best suited to reach a deal  at last  no matter how much his coalition partners fought it  It s the old adage  The left makes war  the right makes peace   Mr  Oren said   Netanyahu will be extremely loath to say no to Trump  which could prove to be the success of that program  On the West Bank  however  few share that view Ghassan Khatib  a professor at Bir Zeit University and former spokesman for the Palestinian government  said Mr  Netanyahu s long tenure had already left behind two devastating casualties  any hope for a two state solution and any support for moderate Palestinian leadership  whose investment in a diplomatic solution to the conflict Mr  Netanyahu has discredited Mr  Khatib said that Mr  Netanyahu  by politically empowering the extreme right wing in recent years  had contributed to a radicalization that has made Israelis averse to peacemaking   The Israel that we talk about now is not the Israel we negotiated with 25 years ago   he said   I think that Netanyahu s taking us into some kind of apartheid reality  It is precisely because Mr  Netanyahu has been so successful that some on the left argue that his leadership is undermining Israel s seemingly irrepressible democracy Anshel Pfeffer  the author of  Bibi   a critical biography of Mr  Netanyahu  said he believed that by campaigning as the  indispensable man   Mr  Netanyahu had  created a narrative where it s illegitimate or irresponsible to replace him  ImageCampaign posters in Rheovot  Israel  Mr  Netanyahu is on track to surpass David Ben Gurion  Israel s founding leader  as its longest serving prime minister CreditDan Balilty for The New York Times There s a certain justification for that   Mr  Pfeffer said  The left wing always said   Here s the deal  If you don t solve your issues with the Palestinians and end the occupation  and resolve your outstanding issues with Arab countries  you won t realize your incredible potential     he said   You ll have a spartan lifestyle  you ll have to go to war all the time  and the world may isolate you   the diplomatic tsunami  And it s inarguable that in the last 10 years  Netanyahu has broken this paradigm  Yet  at the same time  Mr  Netanyahu has fueled and directed the right wing s animosity at predominantly liberal institutions like the courts  the police  higher education and the news media  To the left  Israeli democracy is on the defensive  To the ethnonationalist right  which succeeded last year in enshrining Israel s self definition as the nation state of the Jews in a basic law  it is in need of an adjustment  Somebody told me that Israel went really far on the democracy side  and now we have to rebalance it   said Dahlia Scheindlin  a liberal pollster and writer   They see it as a corrective  that Israel has too healthy a democracy  Some  including Mr  Gantz  have warned that Mr  Netanyahu was headed down a path toward a regime like that of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey Mr  Pfeffer said Israel was not there yet  Those other countries don t have the institutions that can indict the prime minister   he said   It hasn t happened here  the media and judiciary are still strong  But once you erode democracy  you make it much easier for the incumbent to win  ImageJerusalem s Old City in 2017  Mr  Netanyahu s government  and his effusive embrace of President Trump  have

WASHINGTON   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo left open the possibility on Wednesday of entering a conflict with Iran without first seeking explicit congressional approval  telling senators  there is no doubt there is a connection  between Al Qaeda and Iran His comments came two days after the Trump administration designated Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist group  and were likely to fuel concerns of American military action against the country Senator Rand Paul  Republican of Kentucky  pushed Mr  Pompeo to commit that the Trump administration would not attack Iran under a war authorization allowing the use of military force against Al Qaeda and other extremist groups responsible for the terrorist attacks of Sept  11  2001 Mr  Pompeo demurred  saying he would  prefer to just leave that to lawyers  Mr  Paul  a libertarian who promotes isolationist policies  said he was troubled by Mr  Pompeo s response   I can tell you explicitly  you have not been given power or authority by Congress to have war with Iran   he said in the exchange at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Mr  Pompeo pivoted  noting ties between Iran and Al Qaeda   There is no doubt there is a connection  Period  Full stop  After the Sept  11 attacks  and as American forces prepared to bomb Afghanistan  more than a dozen senior Qaeda members fled to Iran  The circumstances of their living conditions were murky  but at least some were detained and later traded  in a prisoner swap with a Qaeda branch in Yemen  Hamza bin Laden  a son of Osama bin Laden  was believed to be among those living in Iran after the 2001 attacks  he is now considered a rising Qaeda leader Over several administrations  American officials have interpreted and stretched the 2001 authorization for use of force against the perpetrators of the Sept  11 terrorist attacks as granting legal permission to wage an armed conflict against not just Al Qaeda and the Taliban  but also other Sunni Islamist groups with links to Al Qaeda in the Middle East and North Africa It is not clear how the Trump administration could plausibly say Iran is an ally of Al Qaeda and participated in the Sept  11 attacks  Among other things  Al Qaeda and its affiliates are Sunni extremists who consider adherents of the Shiite branch of Islam  like Iran s government  to be heretics Mr  Pompeo has been a ringleader in the Trump administration s pressure campaign against Iran  The terrorist designation that he announced on Monday was the first by the United States against an official entity in another country s government It also appeared to pique Mr  Paul s questioning about whether the United States was outlining a foundation for war  Mr  Pompeo called the designation against the Iranian military unit a  recognition of reality  Additionally  Mr  Pompeo was asked to affirm support for a two state solution in the Israeli Palestinian conflict  as have previous Republican and Democratic administrations  He declined to answer when asked to describe what the United States would do if the Israeli government tried to annex the West Bank  widely seen as the foundation for a Palestinian state  The old set of ideas aren t worth retreading   he said in a reiteration of answers he gave at a Senate hearing on Tuesday   They have simply not succeeded  Pressed by Senator Tim Kaine  Democrat of Virginia  on whether a two state solution was an  old idea   Mr  Pompeo replied   I would argue that millions of man hours have been spent to try to build out a two state solution  It hasn t worked to date  it may work this afternoon  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  who appeared to win a fifth term Tuesday  said last weekend that he would apply sovereignty to some or all of the West Bank if re elected  A framework for peace negotiations is likely to be unveiled soon by Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law and Middle East adviser  although it is not expected to insist on a two state solution or on ceding sovereignty to the Palestinians Mr  Pompeo said the peace framework would contain  things that neither of them like   referring to Israeli and Palestinian leaders   but things that the Gulf States think make sense  Mr  Kushner has sought approval for his plan from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia  but the kingdom has been critical of Mr  Trump s decision in 2017 to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  who emerged from this week s election poised to win a fourth consecutive term  may benefit from an effort by his right wing coalition to protect him from prosecution on possible corruption charges At least one right wing party expected to join his new governing coalition has been open about its goal of passing a law granting immunity to Israeli Parliament members  including prime ministers Mr  Netanyahu  who worked on Wednesday to consolidate support for a new coalition  is on track to become Israel s longest serving prime minister  but also the first to be charged with a crime while in office  If Netanyahu gains the public s trust in the coming elections   Bezalel Smotrich  leader of the Union of Right Wing Parties  wrote on Twitter last month   it will be imperative to enact a law that will prevent him standing trial  Mr  Smotrich said parliamentary immunity was necessary to honor the people s democratic choice and ensure smooth government  By Wednesday  his party was projected to win five seats in the 120 seat Knesset  or parliament An aide said on Wednesday that Mr  Smotrich was demanding the post of justice minister and another leader of his party wanted to be minister of education ImageBezalel Smotrich  center  the leader of the Union of Right Wing Parties  said it was  imperative  that legislation be enacted to prevent Mr  Netanyahu from standing trial CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesMany countries grant lawmakers immunity  Israel too used to have such a law Until 2005  Israeli lawmakers had immunity that could only be removed by a vote of Parliament  The law was changed in 2005 after Supreme Court petitions to lift immunity in several cases where Parliament had denied it Mr  Netanyahu could request immunity by an act of Parliament now without a new law  but legal experts said the Supreme Court would be likely to reverse the decision for fear of harming the public s trust in government institutions Two ultra Orthodox parties whose support Mr  Netanyahu will need to help him build a governing majority are unlikely to oppose legislation restoring automatic immunity for members of Parliament Two of their leaders  Yaakov Litzman  of United Torah Judaism  and Aryeh Deri  of Shas  have recently been under police investigation themselves  Moshe Gafni  a lawmaker from United Torah Judaism  said his party would wait and see how Mr  Netanyahu s cases proceeded Israel s attorney general said in February that he planned to indict Mr  Netanyahu on charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  Mr  Netanyahu  who denies any wrongdoing  is entitled to a hearing before an indictment is issued Mr  Netanyahu has said in the past that he would not promote a new immunity law  But when pressed in a television interview days before the election  he was more evasive  saying only that he was currently  not dealing  with the issue Some potential coalition partners have spoken out against an immunity law  saying they oppose any personalized and retroactive legislation designed to help Mr  Netanyahu  Some senior members of his own conservative Likud party have expressed similar sentiments ImageThe Jewish settlement outpost of Yishuv Hadaat in the West Bank  in 2016  Critics say Mr  Netanyahu may promise right wing parties that he would support the annexation of Jewish settlements in occupied territory in exchange for their support for an immunity law CreditUriel Sinai for The New York TimesYuli Edelstien  the No  2 in Likud and long time Parliament speaker  told reporters last week that Mr  Netanyahu  like everybody else  should be treated as innocent until proven guilty  Regarding immunity  Mr  Edelstein said   No one is seriously discussing this kind of legislation in the Israeli Knesset  But Mr  Netanyahu s critics suspect that he may promise right wing parties that he would support the annexation of some Jewish settlements in the West Bank in exchange for their support for an immunity law The liberal Haaretz newspaper said Wednesday that the two goals of the emerging government  could be summed up as  immunity in exchange for sovereignty   In a surprise announcement a few days before the election  Mr  Netanyahu pledged  to begin extending sovereignty into the occupied West Bank  a popular cause on the Israeli right and within his own party  He had resisted such a policy in the past  and much of the world would consider it a violation of international law Mr  Smotrich s aide  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be able to discuss internal party affairs  vehemently denied any linkage between immunity and sovereignty  He said Mr  Smotrich had never discussed the immunity law with Mr  Netanyahu  and needed no encouragement or payback to support either immunity or annexation Shortly before Mr  Netanyahu s unexpected announcement  Mr  Edelstein  the Likud official  said he had not heard of any proposal to impose sovereignty in the West Bank  though Likud favored it in principle Amir Fuchs  an expert in legislative processes at the Israel Democracy Institute  a nonpartisan research group in

LONDON   With the clock ticking down toward last minute talks in Brussels on Britain s withdrawal from the European Union  Prime Minister Theresa May this weekend took another step away from hard line anti Europe lawmakers in her Conservative Party and sought to portray herself as committed to compromise talks that stalled last week But opposition Labour leaders on Sunday maintained that Mrs  May had not yet bent to any of their demands on the withdrawal  known as Brexit  And whatever overtures she makes to Labour  analysts said  she will struggle to guarantee that her successor as prime minister or a future Parliament will not rip up any compromise deal   a major sticking point in the cross party talks Mrs  May this week was expected to seek another delay to Britain s departure from European leaders who have expressed anger at her reluctance to change strategy only days before they were to meet to consider her request  She is also trying to pressure Labour lawmakers who may be searching for an excuse to back a deal to avoid being seen as thwarting Brexit Let me explain what s happening with Brexit pic twitter com gjGkvFk8fT  Theresa May   theresa may  April 7  2019 But while Mrs  May appeared to soften her tone in a statement late Saturday  any compromise talks face an extremely challenging road ahead  Presumably  there is some aspect of trying to convince the E U  of her good faith in those talks   said Tim Bale  a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London  But he said the European leaders  now schooled in the stubborn realities of domestic British politics  were likely to see that a compromise between Mrs  May and Labour s leader  Jeremy Corbyn  remained very far off ImageMrs  May in the House of Commons in London on Wednesday  On Saturday  she suggested a compromise could be worked out around a more limited goal  regaining control over immigration from continental Europe CreditMark Duffy UK Parliament The other game she s playing   Professor Bale said   is to try to prove to everybody outside the country and inside the country that she s genuinely tried  and therefore the only solution is to back her original deal  That would most likely take the form of government efforts to allow Parliament to vote on a series of different Brexit plans  from her deal to softer proposals preferred by Labour lawmakers  Parliament has tried that before  only to find itself unable to give any plan a majority of votes  But Mrs  May has suggested she may try to restart the process and put the government s weight behind whichever plan had the most support Mrs  May had vowed for months that she would back only a Brexit plan that eventually took Britain out of Europe s main economic structures  but on Saturday night she suggested that a compromise could be worked out around a more limited goal  regaining control over immigration from continental Europe That would open the door to a plan that met some of Labour s demands  namely for Britain to remain in a European customs union  Britain would not charge tariffs on European products under such a plan  preventing the country from striking trade deals with other countries but also preserving reasonably frictionless trade with the bloc  Britain s biggest trading partner But government officials said on Sunday that any suggestions of openness to a customs union compromise were speculative  And while Labour leaders stressed that talks had been cordial and that both sides remained interested in seeking a compromise  they said the prime minister had not yet budged on substantive pieces of her deal ImageTrucks at the Port of Dover in February  The prospect of high tariffs on European goods is one of the worries about a so called hard Brexit CreditToby Melville Reuters The sad thing is at the moment we haven t seen overall any real changes to the deal   Rebecca Long Bailey  a senior Labour official who has been involved in the negotiations  said in a televised interview   But we re hopeful that that will change in coming days  and we re willing to continue the talks  as we know the government are  Cross party talks between Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn stalled on Friday  and despite both sides saying they were willing to return to the table  neither the government nor Labour officials gave any indication on Sunday of a concrete schedule for further talks British news media reports said Mrs  May had argued in talks with Labour that her original plan  while it did not explicitly keep Britain in the customs union  achieved the same goal by other means  Her plan has been voted down three times in Parliament Mrs  May s statement on Saturday appeared to be an effort to signal new openness to those talks  suggesting that a deal could be worked out so long as it ended free movement  the right of Europeans to work and travel throughout the bloc  Labour also formally supports ending free movement  though it has lately also supported plans that would preserve it  The fact is that on Brexit there are areas where the two main parties agree   Mrs  May said   We both want to end free movement  we both want to leave with a good deal  and we both want to protect jobs  ImageDonald Tusk  the president of the European Council  center left  last month with Jean Claude Juncker  the president of the European Commission  Mr  Tusk supports

swell of pressure from within his party to reject any compromise that does not include giving Britons a second public vote on leaving Europe with a deal or canceling Brexit altogether That goes well beyond what Mrs  May said on Saturday that she was willing to consider What awaits Mrs  May if she agrees to a compromise deal is perhaps an even bigger tremor in the Conservative Party  Some Conservative lawmakers have threatened new attempts to oust her if she allows Brexit to be delayed long enough that Britons are asked to vote in European Parliament elections in May   Their options for how to remove her  though  are limited after an earlier attempt failed  Reports in the British news media on Sunday said that Mrs  May was offering legal guarantees to protect Labour lawmakers from their biggest fear   that a staunch pro Brexit successor to Mrs  May would rip up the parties  compromise plan and embark on a much more complete split with Europe  The move was described in The Sunday Times  a British newspaper  as the  Boris lock   a nod to Boris Johnson  the extreme anti Europe lawmaker who is angling to follow Mrs  May as prime minister and may be inclined to upend her plan  ImageA pro Brexit supporter in London last week  Mrs  May has conceded that efforts to convert hard line anti Europe Conservative lawmakers to her Brexit deal have failed CreditDylan Martinez ReutersBut the outlines of Britain s future relationship with Europe  including a possible customs union  would be made in a nonbinding part of Mrs  May s exit deal  making it difficult to protect from future attempts to derail it Professor Bale  of Queen Mary University  said that while she might be trying to provide cover for Labour lawmakers already inclined to back her deal  there was little of substance she could offer them  Any guarantees given to Labour on that score would not be worth the paper they re written on   he said In the backdrop of Mrs  May s efforts to temper her approach is a chorus of European leaders accusing Mrs  May of having so far failed to come up with a fresh plan to break months of Parliamentary stalemate French officials went so far as to say that if Mrs  May failed to outline a new plan with  credible political backing   they would treat it as a decision to greenlight a no deal exit  a possibility that experts say would be disastrous for Britain s economy European leaders will meet on Wednesday to consider Mrs  May s request for another delay to Brexit  The Irish prime minister  Leo Varadkar  whose country stands to be badly affected by a no deal exit  said he expected European leaders to postpone Brexit to avert that outcome  however angry they might be about Britain s conduct Donald Tusk  the president of the European Council  was pushing European leaders to offer Mrs  May a one year extension for Brexit while keeping open the possibility of an earlier withdrawal if Britain ratifies a deal  

JERUSALEM   Struggling to rally right wing voters before Tuesday s elections  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he would start to extend Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if given a fourth consecutive term Such a move has been ardently sought by the settler movement but resisted until now by Mr  Netanyahu  and by more moderate Israelis  as a potentially fatal blow to a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  In the eyes of most of the world  it would also be a violation of international law that bars the annexation of land seized in war But Mr  Netanyahu trailed his main challenger  Benny Gantz  a former army chief of staff  in final polls of the campaign published Friday  And he has been frantically trying to mobilize conservative Israelis to vote for his Likud party rather than for other  more extremist parties whose leaders have joined his government but have often portrayed him as more of a brake on the settler movement than an accelerator Mr  Netanyahu was pressed in a live television interview Saturday night over why he had not already annexed settlement blocs like Maale Adumim and Gush Etzion  two large Jewish communities built on occupied territory on the outskirts of Jerusalem  He vowed to begin the effective annexation of those and other  more isolated areas under Jewish control  The question you re asking is an interesting one  Will we move on now to the next stage   he said   And the answer is  yes  We will move on to the next stage  Asked by his interviewer if that meant he would annex the settlement blocs  Mr  Netanyahu said yes  but that he would not stop there  I m going to apply sovereignty  but I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlement points  because from my perspective every such point of settlement is Israeli   he said   We have a responsibility as the Israeli government  I won t uproot anyone and I won t place them under Palestinian sovereignty  I ll look out for everyone  The West Bank is home to about 2 8 million Palestinians and more than 400 000 Jewish settlers Mr  Netanyahu did not say whether he would seek to annex areas now under Palestinian control under the Oslo Accords Applying sovereignty to Israeli settlements on West Bank land that the Palestinians demand for a future state  presumably along with the roads and infrastructure tethering those places to the rest of Israel  would leave the Palestinians at best with an archipelago of disconnected territory  The West Bank is now under Israeli military jurisdiction  though settlers are subject to civilian law  as Israeli citizens ImageA Palestinian family tending their vineyard in the West Bank with the the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the background  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he will begin extending Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if re elected CreditTomas Munita for The New York TimesThe chief negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization  Saeb Erekat  responded to Mr  Netanyahu s statements by attacking both him and the Trump administration  The White House has long promised a proposal for a  deal of the century  to end the Israeli Palestinian conflict But in the meantime  it has showered Mr  Netanyahu with priceless political gifts   from last year s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital to last month s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights   while battering the Palestinians with aid cuts and public scoldings  Such a statement by Netanyahu is not surprising   Mr  Erekat said on Twitter   Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity  particularly with the Trump administration s support and endorsement of Israel s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine  He added   We ll continue to pursue our rights through international forums  including the international criminal court  until we achieve our long overdue justice  Shalom Lipner  a former aide to Mr  Netanyahu and several other prime ministers  said Mr  Netanyahu might well believe the Trump administration could allow him to proceed with annexation  But he called the promise  the ultimate Hail Mary pass   and one that came with little political risk  The only reason it s even credible now is because of what he s been able to coordinate with Trump   said Mr  Lipner  an analyst at the Atlantic Council   Maybe he can actually get Trump to sign off on that as well  But if it became clear it s not in the cards right now  then he can just say   Sorry  I can t swing it  Conditions change    Read our guide on Israel s elections  In the television interview  Mr  Netanyahu vowed not to divide Jerusalem or  uproot any settlement   and said he would  ensure that we will control the territory west of the Jordan River   meaning the entire West Bank When asked if he would push through before Tuesday the much delayed evacuation of Palestinians living in Khan al Ahmar  a Bedouin village near the Maale Adumim settlement bloc  he reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state on the West Bank  I don t know whether it will be before the elections   he said of the Khan al Ahmar expulsion  which set off intense international criticism after being marked for demolition to make way for an expanded Jewish settlement But  he added   We have to control our destiny  and that is going to be impossible if we place there an independent  Arab entity   an Arab state  for all intents and purposes  A Palestinian state  That will endanger our existence   

WASHINGTON   The Treasury Department allowed the influential Russian oligarch Oleg V  Deripaska to satisfy the terms of his divorce by transferring tens of millions of dollars in stock to benefit his children as part of a deal to lift United States sanctions on his corporate empire  according to the Trump administration and an interview with Mr  Deripaska The deal  announced by the Trump administration in December without publicly disclosing its details  included a clause providing for the completion of a transfer of 10 5 million shares of Mr  Deripaska s main holding company  EN   to a trust fund for the two teenage children he had with his former wife  Polina Yumasheva The couple divorced last year  and their settlement  which called for him to provide funds for their children  was finalized before Mr  Deripaska and his companies were sanctioned in April 2018  according to representatives of the Treasury Department  Mr  Deripaska and EN  The transfer has drawn the ire of Senator Ron Wyden  Democrat of Oregon  who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee  which has jurisdiction over the Treasury Department  He said in a letter sent late last month to Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  that the transfer of the EN  shares   which had a value of more than  78 million at the close of business on Monday    constitutes a clear benefit to Deripaska and his children   and conflicts with Treasury Department claims that neither would benefit from the sanctions relief deal The sanctions were intended to punish seven oligarchs and their companies   including Mr  Deripaska  EN  and the giant aluminum company it controls  Rusal   for their affiliations with a Russian government that  engages in a range of malign activity around the globe   including election interference  Mr  Mnuchin said at the time When the Treasury Department announced the deal with Mr  Deripaska s companies to lift the sanctions  it cast the move as an effort to stabilize global aluminum markets roiled by the sanctions  and said that Mr  Deripaska would not personally benefit  As part of the deal  he agreed to relinquish control of the companies and sell off a significant portion of his ownership  with proceeds going into blocked accounts that he would not be able to access But members of Congress on both sides of the aisle blasted the deal as soft on Russia  and unsuccessfully tried to block it from going into effect  Those concerns were inflamed further when it was revealed that the confidential  legally binding document detailing the agreement showed that Mr  Deripaska and his allies would retain majority ownership of EN  The agreement specified that 1 64 percent of the shares of EN  would be transferred to an entity called the Liberi Foundation  for which there was no easily traceable public record  After receiving inquiries from journalists  EN  officials said Liberi was a trust fund for Mr  Deripaska s children But when asked by Mr  Wyden at a Senate Finance Committee hearing late last month about the arrangement  Mr  Mnuchin said of Mr  Deripaska that  his children did in no way benefit from sanctions relief  A Treasury Department spokeswoman sought to clarify Mr  Mnuchin s statement last week  saying that  Deripaska s children were legally entitled to shares stemming from a divorce settlement that predated the sanctions  Larissa Belyaeva  a spokeswoman for Mr  Deripaska  said in a statement that he  disclaimed all rights to claw back those shares  She added   Nor did his children benefit as all that was honored was a pre existing legal entitlement to settle shares as part of a divorce settlement  She said the votes from the shares would be cast by independent trustees appointed by the Treasury Department Independent trustees also will control the votes associated with shares owned by other people or entities with connections to Mr  Deripaska  They include his charitable foundation  his former wife  her father and a family linked firm called Orandy Capital Limited  as well as shares being transferred to VTB  a Russian government owned bank under limited United States sanctions that had lent Mr  Deripaska large sums of money And in a rare interview late last month  Mr  Deripaska said of the transfer to Liberi   It s a small portion of the shares  And it was part of my settlement with my wife  which was set long before  Last month  Mr  Deripaska sued the Treasury Department and its officials  including Mr  Mnuchin  to reverse the sanctions that remain in place on him personally  claiming that he was deprived due process and that the sanctions cost him billions of dollars and made him  radioactive  in international business circles In the interview with The New York Times  he blasted the sanctions as targeting him solely because he was a prominent Russian who has  a popular brand in the U S  He accused the Treasury Department of misrepresenting him in its justification for the sanctions  In announcing the sanctions  the department had noted that  Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state  Mr  Deripaska explained the statement to mean that  it was just who I am   I am Russian   he said   And unfortunately  I was sanctioned because I am Russian  He added   I m not planning to leave Russia to buy a hockey club  a football club  to spend crazy money on luxury things outside my country  I spend most of my time here  My kids are here  And my future also will be in Russia   

Israel s parliamentary election on Tuesday brings an end to a neck and neck campaign that saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  the veteran politician of the Israeli right and one of the country s longest serving leaders  facing the strongest challenge in years  Mr  Netanyahu s tenure has been marked by a collapse of peace talks with the Palestinians  confrontation with Iran  armed conflict with Hamas  and hostility toward what he views as plots to isolate and delegitimize the Jewish state But Mr  Netanyahu has also overseen an era of healthy economic growth and stability  thawed relations with Sunni Arab leaders and expanded Israeli trade ties in Africa  Latin America and Asia   Read more on Mr  Netanyahu s ties with President Trump that have emboldened him to take policy risks  The prime minister is entangled in corruption scandals that could lead to his indictment  And he faces stiff competition from a new rival  Benny Gantz  the leader of a trio of former generals who could end Mr  Netanyahu s 10 uninterrupted years as prime minister But Israeli elections are complicated and unpredictable  with many parties vying for votes and at times forming opportunistic alliances to secure a parliamentary majority ImageThe Blue and White alliance is led by Benny Gantz  center  and two other veteran generals  They have teamed up with a centrist party led by Yair Lapid

White alliance  a coalition named for the colors of the Israeli flag  slightly ahead of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  a dominant force on the Israeli right for decades Their policy stances are similar  a reflection of how Israeli politics have moved increasingly to the right under Mr  Netanyahu  But while Mr  Gantz has sought allies from across the spectrum  Mr  Netanyahu has reached out to the far right to strengthen his prospects for a parliamentary majority  He even has promised to begin extending sovereignty over the occupied West Bank  which the Palestinians want for a future state  if he is re elected The Blue and White leaders are drawing on their military backgrounds to counter Mr  Netanyahu s contention that only he can protect Israel  Mr  Gantz and his colleagues have also focused on the corruption accusations against Mr  Netanyahu  his biggest vulnerability  to press their case that new leadership is needed They have attracted backing from smaller centrist parties  And what remains of the left leaning opposition has thrown its support behind Mr  Gantz for prime minister  The Labor Party would be likely to recommend Mr  Gantz for the premiership after the election What makes this election different Mr  Netanyahu could be indicted  Israel s attorney general announced last month that he planned to bring charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  A final decision on charges is likely by year s end  Under the current law  Mr  Netanyahu  if re elected  would not have to resign until a final conviction  although new legislation or public pressure could force him to step down  Mr  Netanyahu has described the charges as a baseless partisan witch hunt  But with a first sitting prime minister to be charged  Israel would be entering uncharted legal and political terrain The uncertainty has worked against Mr  Netanyahu in the prelude to the vote   The attorney general s report has done something that has never happened in Israel s 70 year history  and that is that a prime minister is under a legal cloud   said David Makovsky  an expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  The election also is the first time that three former heads of the army  the Israel Defense Forces  have united to run for office  The Blue and White alliance is led by Mr  Gantz and two other veteran generals  Gabi Ashkenazi and Moshe Yaalon They have teamed up with a well known centrist party  Yesh Atid  led by Yair Lapid  a former journalist  television host and finance minister  Mr  Gantz has agreed to hand off the prime minister position to Mr  Lapid after two and a half years if their parties win  While Mr  Netanyahu has a strong record of defending Israel  the Blue and White alliance s military credentials have made it more difficult for him to attack Mr  Gantz and his colleagues as weak on security   The question is  will it neutralize the advantage that Netanyahu has accrued over his previous four terms of being  Mr  Security    Mr  Makovsky said   He s said the words Israelis want to hear   I ll keep you safe    How does the voting work Voters cast ballots for parties  not individual candidates  to fill seats in the 120 member Knesset  or Parliament  The seats are divided proportionally based on the percentage of the vote each party receives  Any party that wins 3 25 percent or more of the vote gets at least one seat  If parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes won t be counted  That will raise the share of seats given to the other parties  If one party were to win at least 61 seats  it would be entitled to form a government  But this has never happened in Israeli politics  So once the seats have been apportioned  parties try to cobble together coalitions that control a majority of seats  ImageAn election billboard for the New Right party  with which Likud is expected to align CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat might those alliances look like Polls have suggested that Likud and Blue and White will each get about 30 seats   meaning both will be seeking alliances with smaller parties  Likud is expected to align with a  right wing party known as the New Right  and with an extreme right alliance known as the Union of Right Wing Parties  which includes Jewish Power  widely criticized as an extremist  anti Arab racist party  Potential Blue and White coalition

opportunity  Typically  but not always  that opportunity goes to the leader of the party with the most votes  who then has 42 days to try  If that party leader fails  the president turns to another to attempt to create a coalition  So it could take a few months It also is possible that the Likud and the Blue and White coalition would join forces and create a national unity government  In theory  Mr

governing coalition in Israel  And some Israeli Arab voters have vowed to boycott the election  partly in protest of a new law pushed by Mr  Netanyahu declaring Israel as the  nation state of the Jewish people   Critics have called the law racist and undemocratic What about Palestinians in occupied territory They are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote in the election  About 4 75 million

Nevertheless  it could be affected Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law  who has been leading the administration s efforts to draft the plan  said it would not be made public until after the election Many Palestinians already have dismissed the plan   whatever it may contain   because they see Mr  Trump as siding with Israel  But the plan also faces a threat from the parties of the Israeli extreme right  which see any concessions to the Palestinians as unacceptable  If Mr  Netanyahu needs those parties to form a coalition  Mr  Trump s peace plan may be doomed However  if Blue and White wins or

PARIS   The moment of truth approached on Monday for President Emmanuel Macron s strategy for sucking the wind out of the Yellow Vest protest movement  as his prime minister presented the conclusions of a three month national consultation in which some 1 5 million French citizens let the government know what they wanted The answer  Lower taxes  in a country with the highest tax burden   46 percent of gross domestic product   of any developed nation  But where  and how  to do so  presents the French government with a tricky conundrum  The same citizens did not come out for any reduction in France s expansive social safety net or generous provision of public services Whether the government s formula for resolving the dilemma  which has yet to be determined  will be enough to satisfy the for now quiescent protest movement is uncertain  The Yellow Vests rejected the  Great National Debate  from the beginning  though the protest movement has hit its lowest ebb in numbers and public support Mr  Macron s subordinates insist that they have heard the message   We ve reached zero fiscal tolerance   Prime Minister douard Philippe told an audience of officials at the Grand Palais in Paris Monday  presenting the conclusions of the project  We ve got to lower taxes   Mr  Philippe said   There is an immense fiscal exasperation  It is now up to Mr  Macron himself to find concrete measures to translate the citizens  demands in the coming weeks  The Yellow Vest protest itself began as an uprising over a raise in gas taxes  which Mr  Macron rescinded soon after Mr  Macron came up with the  Great National Debate  idea as the Yellow Vest demonstrators were wreaking havoc in French cities  smashing in store windows and prompting some in the president s own circle to fear for his future  Half in desperation  he reached for a surefire national sedative  Let the French talk it out Local talk fests  spearheaded by the president himself  aired citizen grievances  with the hope of stifling a principal Yellow Vest complaint  that the French were not being heard  Plenty now have been  though how representative the talkers were has itself become a matter of debate ImagePrime Minister douard Philippe  second from right  delivered the findings of France s  Great National Debate  in Paris on Monday CreditPhilippe Lopez Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMany of those who attended around 10 000 local debates were elderly or retired  in a country where the retirement age is a mere 62  and there are many  many citizens with lots of time on their hands But the endless hours of meeting with local officials  often with  Mr  Macron doing most of talking  may have more successfully bludgeoned the Yellow Vests into submission than any number of riot police Only 22 300 people marched in the Yellow Vest protest across France Saturday  the lowest turnout yet  and less than a tenth of those who took part in the first marches on Nov  17 last year  And only about 35 percent of the French still support them  less than half the figure at the movement s peak Mr  Macron  by going week after week deep into the country and standing for hours on end lecturing and taking questions  has clawed back some of the popularity he lost at the height of the Yellow Vest movement He is now supported by some 29 percent of the French  according to an IFOP poll last week  around his level of support at the beginning of the protests  After weeks of trailing Marine Le Pen s far right Rassemblement National party  formerly the National Front  in polls for May s elections to the European Parliament  Mr  Macron has finally crept out in front  Renewing dialogue and deflating the anger   in one sense  he s succeeded   said Chlo Morin  a public opinion expert at the Ipsos consultancy in Paris   But  it was just one part of the French  who participated in the  Great National Debate   said Ms  Morin  It was a certain category of the population  and not necessarily a representative one  city dwellers  those who are reasonably off  So  it s been a relative success   she said   He s managed to regain his base of popularity   with his electorate  and with the right  But the large segment of the population that once identified with the Yellow Vests is another matter  I have a fear that whatever decisions Emmanuel Macron takes  even if they are strong ones  that knowing the Yellow Vests as I do  there is a kind of suicidal tendency  a tendency to say   All politicians are rotten    said Sonia Krimi  a 36 year old member of Parliament in Mr  Macron s party

president  and she has in the past expressed sympathy for the protesters  It s like two parallel lines   she said  referring to the government and the Yellow Vests   and the lines never join  Others also expressed concerns about the representativeness of the government s sample  The problem is  who actually came to the debates  in relation to those we never hear from   asked Jean Michel Clment  a parliamentarian who left Mr  Macron s party last year   It was people who were already in the know  Those who weren t either didn t come or didn t talk  Whatever the source  the government insisted it has heard   We ve gotten the message loud and clear   Mr  Philippe  the prime minister  said at the Grand Palais Monday The  message  as received by Mr  Philippe translated into a series of abstractions that could be difficult to translate into concrete policy  He said the French who took part had also expressed concerns about  isolation  abandonment and indifference  from public officials  about having  a democracy that is more representative and efficient   and about climate change  As for the conclusions that are to be drawn  I m waiting to hear them   said Mr  Clment   We re faced with some contradictions  We re hearing less taxes on one side  and on the other more public services  So its going to be a complicated equation   he said   A delicate exercise  On the streets of Paris there was skepticism all around  as there often is   The Great National Debate won t put an end to anything   said Marc Flandrin  48  a butcher in the suburb of Alfortville   Soon it will be the turn of the retired people to demonstrate  I think that in September it is going to get worse  Marc Denis  a 51 year old auditor for the national railway company  the S N C F   approved of the debate  but wondered whether it would change anything   I don t think the Yellow Vest movement will end   he said   It is now rooted in France  Ms  Krimi  the parliamentarian  said   It s too early to talk of success or failure   It s a complex situation  and it needs a complex response   she said   There has to be a political vision  People are sick of politicians and their promises   

WASHINGTON   For President Trump  a threat is frequently his first impulse He is forceful  declarative and speaks with unvarnished conviction  He has made the theme of promises made  promises kept the anthem of his re election effort But his threats often remain just that  The most recent example was when Mr  Trump backed down from a vow to close the border with Mexico  instead saying he would give one of the United States  most essential trading partners a year to deal with the migrant crisis  This came only a day after he had threatened to act if Congress did not bend to his will on the issue  The price of Mexican avocados spiked  but the government of Mexico seemed unmoved  Mr  Trump has warned Mexico of an impending border closing at least three times before  in October  November and December  On Friday  before leaving for a trip to the border town of Calexico  Calif   Mr  Trump suggested that his threat against Mexico was still in his holster   I never changed my mind at all  I may shut it down at some point  but I d rather do tariffs   he said Here is a look at some of Mr  Trump s more high profile threats Closing the border with MexicoIn retreating from his threat to close the border  Mr  Trump was withdrawing the warning that he issued strongly last week  But on Friday  he offered up another one  He said that the trade deal that the United States had reached with Mexico and Canada  known as the U S M C A   would not apply if Mexico does not stop Central American migrants from illegally entering the United States  If for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from  the U S  will be forced to Tariff at 25  all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us  If that doesn t work  which it will  I will close the Border   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter  This will supersede USMCA   Mr  Trump added  He also threatened an  economic penalty  on Mexico  for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border  Congress has not yet voted on the trade deal  If it does approve the pact   and the president tried to unilaterally abrogate selective provisions of the agreement   it would provoke numerous legal challenges  as well as an uproar from foreign leaders and members of Congress A bullhorn to RussiaThe president warned Russia in March to  get out  of Venezuela after Moscow dispatched military personnel to the country and offered to send the government of President Nicols Maduro shipments of food and medicine  He has consistently said that Mr  Maduro must step down and has strongly suggested that United States military intervention was on the table  He also urged the Venezuelan military to rebel  None of those threats have been effective  Mr  Trump has accused the Russian government of bolstering Mr  Maduro while the United States has been rallying support behind Juan Guaid  the opposition leader While the United States issued another round of sanctions and visa restrictions last month  Russia has shown no outward signs of backing down  and Mr  Maduro has refused Mr  Trump s calls that he resign Telling General Motors to reopen a plant  or else  he would cut subsidies Mr  Trump has frequently threatened companies  particularly if they were moving jobs overseas  He has directed some of his sharpest language toward General Motors  and Mary Barra  its chief executive  He has demanded that G M  reopen a plant in Lordstown  Ohio  that the company said it closed because consumer demand had shifted away from the smaller vehicles produced at the plant  He had earlier threatened to cut subsidies for the company and to recoup federal money it had received from the bailout at the height of the financial crisis of 2008 The company has not acceded to his demands  and so far has not suffered any penalty from the government Threats against the mediaBeyond regular Twitter posts denouncing the  fake news   Mr  Trump has also threatened to take regulatory and legal actions against news outlets and television programs In October 2017  Mr  Trump suggested that he would revoke NBC s broadcast license after the network published a report he objected to   only to be indirectly refuted days later by Ajit Pai  the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  who said that his agency  does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content   Nonetheless  Mr  Trump revived the threat in September 2018 One program on the network in particular has drawn the president s ire   Saturday Night Live   which Mr  Trump has said  should be tested in courts   investigated by the F C C   or   rather vaguely    should be looked into  In the fall  after the White House suspended the credentials of Jim Acosta  the chief White House correspondent for CNN  Mr  Trump threatened retaliation against other reporters if they did not  treat the White House with respect  Mr  Acosta s press badge was restored and no other White House reporters have had their credentials suspended since Trying to overturn a constitutional rightMr  Trump also threatened in 2018  to end birthright citizenship  a constitutional guarantee that could only be undone by amending the Constitution  In an interview with Axios at the time  the president called the concept  ridiculous  and said  it has to end  After strong pushback from within his party    Paul D  Ryan  the House speaker at the time  said the president  obviously  could not terminate a constitutional right by executive order   Mr  Trump retreated California on his mindThe liberal state has drawn Mr  Trump s displeasure   and Twitter threats   several times during his presidency In November  Mr  Trump blamed wildfires ravaging California on what he deemed  gross mismanagement of the forests   warning the state to  remedy now  or no more Fed payments    The criticism was misleading  as the majority of California s forests are federally managed  and the causes of wildfires are complicated and include climate change  Two months later  in January  Mr  Trump said that state officials had not made adequate remedy and reissued his threat   Unless they get their act together  which is unlikely  I have ordered FEMA to send no more money   referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency The state scrambled to make sense of Mr  Trump s renewed threat  and lawmakers from both parties criticized the move  A month later  a spokesman for FEMA told BuzzFeed it had never received a directive The agency continued to provide assistance to residents affected by the fire  On the same day that Mr  Trump delivered his second warning  FEMA extended the deadline for California residents to apply for disaster assistance to  Feb  15   It had been Jan  31   Federal cost sharing for debris removal actually increased to 90 percent from 75  percent  and the agency provided more than  347 million in grants and loans to affected residents A veiled warning to James B  ComeyAfter he fired James B  Comey  the former F B I  director  in May 2017  Mr  Trump urged him to think twice about speaking with reporters and referred to secret recordings of their conversations  James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter For weeks  Mr  Trump and his aides refused to confirm or deny the existence of such recordings or to clarify if he was simply rebutting Mr  Comey s claims that he had been asked by the president to pledge his loyalty Mr  Comey testified before Congress in June  telling lawmakers   Lordy  I hope there are tapes  Mr  Trump then cleared it up himself on Twitter  denying that he had taped Mr  Comey in the first place   I have no idea whether there are  tapes  or recordings of my conversations with James Comey  but I did not make  and do not have  any such recordings   

TIANJIN  China   At a port in Germany  150 Steinway pianos are waiting to be shipped to this gateway city for the grand opening of the Juilliard School s second campus  The air in Tianjin is so dry that the pianos will require climate controlled rooms  helping to nearly double the cost of the state of the art campus to  225 million The extra money is not coming from Juilliard  The local government is footing the bill  And that could become a problem for officials struggling with debt after an epic spending spree to develop a new commercial center from scratch Welcome to Yujiapu Financial District  which promotes itself as China s Manhattan  but may better be seen as a monument to the breakdown of the Chinese growth model  Four fifths of the office space stands empty  Construction on other buildings has stopped  leaving skeletons in the sky  A sprawling mall has few shoppers  Inside  a pet store has no animals  The businesses and residents that local officials had hoped to attract have yet to show up  Juilliard  which is expected to draw in students and their families  will open its doors next fall  a rare Western institution taking a chance on this district Zhang Zhiyi works as a recruiter for an online education company in a nearby office building  The lonely landscape has translated into a good deal for commercial renters  New tenants get a full year rent free  Deals abound  the 28 year old said   The other buildings aren t really full  either  Chinese local governments are swimming in debt  By official accounts  that debt totals  4 5 trillion  By unofficial estimates  it could be as large as  10 trillion  No one knows for sure because much of the borrowing for projects like the Tianjin Juilliard campus is rarely disclosed China has long borrowed heavily to build and then counted on breakneck economic growth to pay it back  The script  Sell vast amounts of land to developers  borrow to subsidize construction  and jobs and new cities will result  It was a model that helped China build its skyscrapers and high speed rail lines and ushered in an era of prosperity But China is not growing as fast as it used to  and it is not clear that the  build it and they will come  model will save Yujiapu and other places with big debts  The national government now must find other ways to spur growth   without making the debt problem worse ImageThe construction site of the Juilliard School in Yujiapu  The campus will open its doors next fall  the rare Western institution taking a chance on this district CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York Times China s economy has depended on building for the future  and there are considerable signs that they have overbuilt   said Logan Wright  director of China research at Rhodium Group  a consulting firm  adding that debt and overcapacity could hold back growth  That probably means much slower economic growth in the next decade compared to China s recent path   he said  Tianjin government officials did not respond to a request for comment  Tianjin  a coastal city just a short train ride from Beijing  had one of the highest growth rates in China  Its success made headlines  and local officials credited  Tianjin spirit  Tianjin speed and Tianjin benefits   Then the economy slowed  And local officials in the Binhai New Area  a special economic zone of Tianjin that includes Yujiapu  admitted they overstated growth  They slashed  50 billion from its original figure for 2016  bringing economic output to  100 billion  Today  Tianjin is one of the slowest growing regions of China and one of the most financially troubled  By the broadest measure of borrowing in China  called total social financing  Tianjin s government  corporations and households owe more than  760 billion  according to an estimate by Rhodium Group  The annual interest owed by all borrowers in Tianjin totaled 12 times its annual nominal economic growth  Rhodium said  citing the most recent numbers ImageAn empty underground shopping mall in Yujiapu CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesIf Yujiapu really is the Manhattan of China  it has a way to go to catch up to the real thing  Its avenues  some nearly as wide as Broadway  are eerily quiet  Many buildings just a few blocks from the Tianjin Juilliard School remain unfinished  The finished ones are mostly empty On one recent weekday visit  the door to the sales office for a hulking  unfinished residential building several blocks from the Juilliard campus blew open in the wind  No one was inside  Many of the six lane roads in the city lack crosswalk lights  in part because they are not needed  Across the Hai River from Yujiapu is another ghostlike district  Xiangluowan  where the local government encouraged private Chinese developers to build on their own dime  They did  but no one came  Dozens of the buildings in this district are now collateral for huge overdue loans that are being held by local banks ImageZhang Zhiyi  a recruiter for an online education company  said the lonely landscape in Tianjin had translated into good deals for commercial renters   The other buildings aren t really full  either   he said  CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesFor now  Tianjin can continue to borrow for projects like the Juilliard campus because it has a powerful patron in Beijing  said Victor Shih  an associate professor at the University of California  San Diego  and an expert on the Chinese economy  That official  He Lifeng  was once the No  2 Communist Party official in Tianjin  Mr  He now heads the central government agency that approves all major development projects  meaning he can authorize banks to lend more money to Tianjin   If the political will collapses for the Binhai area  then the bank loans will begin to dry up and the whole area is in trouble   Mr  Shih said Officials at the National Development and Reform Commission  the agency where Mr  He works  did not respond to a request for comment ImageIt s quiet in the Yujiapu Financial District  which promotes itself as China s Manhattan  Businesses that local officials hoped to attract have yet to show up  CreditGiulia Marchi for The New York TimesDespite the empty buildings  the local government keeps borrowing  Last year  Tianjin and entities related to the local government raised  36 billion through new loans  according to data from the People s Bank of China  the country s central bank  Many residents believe Yujiapu s problems have been overstated and try to cast its emptiness in a positive light  Mr  Zhang  who works for the online recruiter  said technology companies looking for alternatives to expensive places like Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen could find Tianjin attractive   Now  there are quite a lot of internet companies  including some e commerce platforms   he said  speculating that these companies could move into his building in the future Michael Hart  a real estate consultant in Tianjin  said a resurgence of growth could save the city from its problems  It s like going to see a five act play   Mr  Hart said  referring to Yujiapu s critics   and you re halfway through Act 1 and calling it a lousy play  For Alexander Brose  the chief executive of the Tianjin Juilliard School  the district will soon benefit from the prestige of the Juilliard name to attract people  On a recent day  he toured the construction site  pointing to what he expected to see next year  Here  a 687 seat concert hall  he said  Over there  a recital space that can hold 299 people  And in the corner  a 250 seat black box theater  He paused  looking at the hundreds of construction workers welding  hammering and moving steel  and said  referring to the local government   I think they are looking at this as a feather in the cap of this new project   

KIRYAT GAT  Israel   The surprise candidate shaking up the last days of the campaign before Israelis head to the polls on Tuesday is a far right nationalist libertarian who advocates small government  legalizing marijuana and a free market economy While the candidate  Moshe Feiglin  the leader of the Zehut party  remains on the fringes in the election  his message is attracting enough young and disaffected voters that he could emerge as kingmaker in a close race between the two main contenders  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz  a former army chief  Under Israel s parliamentary system  even a few seats could be enough to give one side or the other a majority coalition While the pro marijuana stance has received some notice  it is his economic message that is resonating with young voters who are fed up with Israel s same old politics and exorbitant cost of living  I don t smoke   said Dor Thaler  24  who runs an e commerce business and was attending a recent town hall meeting in Kiryat Gat  a working class town in southern Israel   But I like everything else about his platform  An iconoclastic pied piper  Mr  Feiglin  56  is pledging to upend the customs and tax system by introducing a flat tax and gradually eliminating import duties and quotas  He wants to privatize hospitals and dismantle the state monopoly over land distribution  which he says will create affordable housing  Read our guide to the Israeli elections  His political agenda tends toward an extreme nationalism that critics call dangerous  He advocates a one state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  that would be one Jewish state  and the takeover by Israel s rabbinical authorities of Jerusalem s most contested holy site   the sacred compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary  He also proposes eventually rebuilding the Jewish temple there ImageThe Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem  part of what Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and what Jews refer to as the Temple Mount  Mr  Feiglin has called for Israel s rabbinical authorities to take over the site CreditUriel Sinai for The New York TimesHis platform  published as a 355 page book  titled  To Be a Free Jew  Operating Manual for the State of Israel   topped the nonfiction best seller list of a major Israeli book chain in late March At the town hall meeting in a dingy synagogue annex in Kiryat Gat he swept into the room to the chorus of a popular Israeli hit   He Who Believes Does Not Fear   There is a revolution here  a true revolution   Mr  Feiglin said   It s so different   he said  that young people are drawn to it  like butterflies to the light  Referring to the Palestinians as  tribes  Arabs or whatever   he said Israel had lost its most important weapon  the justice of its cause  By endorsing a two state solution that envisages a Palestinian state alongside Israel  he told his audience   You have turned yourself into a colonialist and an invader in your own country  His alternative  Impose Israeli sovereignty on the West Bank and Gaza  provide assistance to Palestinians who want to emigrate  and grant permanent resident status to those who remain if they pledge allegiance to the Jewish state Critics view his agenda as a crazy hodgepodge of ideas bordering on the anarchic and Messianic  There isn t enough space to fully describe Feiglin s right wing  ultranationalist and dangerous vision   the liberal Haaretz newspaper warned in an editorial this week titled   Joints on the Temple Mount  ImageMr  Feiglin  right

and received wide coverage in the mainstream news media  Two days later  he went on a bar crawl in a trendy area of downtown West Jerusalem  Appearing unannounced  he received a warm welcome in one establishment but was jeered at another In a pallid parade of establishment politicians Mr  Feiglin stands out as a colorful  convention busting alternative  said Batia Siebzehner  a sociologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  Today the elections are not about a worldview or political view  but about personalities   Ms  Siebzehner said She described him as  a bit of a clown  and  a bit of a hippie   but an extremist nonetheless  The somewhat Messianic vision of being on Temple Mount   I don t think the young Israelis understand the consequences   she said   It s a type of a gimmick  It s a kind of revolt  a revolt against everything  Recent polls predict that Mr  Feiglin s party could win from four to seven seats in the 120 seat Parliament  If the election is close enough  his bloc could determine who leads the next government ImageMr  Feiglin s campaign platform  published as a book titled  To Be a Free Jew  Operating Manual for the State of Israel   is a best seller in Israel CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesMr  Netanyahu  who is facing corruption charges and battling for his political survival after a decade in power  is polling neck and neck with Mr  Gantz Mr  Feiglin has said he is willing to join whichever coalition makes him the best offer He is demanding the legalization of cannabis  the post of finance minister and  if his party wins enough votes  the education ministry too Mr  Feiglin has long been in the public eye as a far right activist and leader of the  This Is Our Land  movement  In the 1990s  he was sentenced to six months in prison for sedition after protesters blocked roads throughout the country to try halt the Oslo peace process  In 2000  he joined Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and failed in four bids to become party chairman  He was elected to Parliament in 2013 and served a two year term  Israeli politics isn t subtle  Read about how from the far left to the far right  political ads are aimed at riling up the base  He has long lobbied for the wider availability of medical cannabis and has spoken of how his wife uses the drug to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson s disease  He now advocates freeing all cannabis from state control Israel partly decriminalized recreational use of marijuana in a law that took effect this week  imposing fines for possession but opening criminal proceedings only after a fourth offense  Cannabis promoters say that is not enough But legalization did not even come up in the Kiryat Gat meeting Mr  Feiglin talked about the high prices of groceries  his plans for breaking what he calls the state land cartel  and the Oslo accords  which he wants to abrogate  People think it s all about legalization   he said in a brief interview on his way out of the hall   It s not  It s about all the rest   

LONDON   Some British citizens planning to travel abroad already have a tangible sign of what life will look like once the country is no longer a member of the European Union  new passports missing  European Union  on the front cover Last month  even as lawmakers wrestled over the principal terms of the withdrawal process known as Brexit  the Home Office said that the design of new passports would change after March 29  the initial date set for Britain s departure For a while  both the old and new designs will be made and both are valid for travel  the Home Office said  adding   You will not be able to choose whether you get a passport that includes the words European Union or a passport that does not  While Brexit itself has been delayed   the original departure deadline was extended to April 12  and Prime Minister Theresa May has asked Brussels for a further postponement   the passport changes have moved forward as planned One early recipient  Susan Hindle Barone  posted images of her new and old British passports on Twitter on Friday  asking others to  spot the difference  Both passports have burgundy covers dominated by a golden coat of arms  But on one  the words  European Union  were missing from the top  Truly appalled   Ms  Hindle Barone wrote   I didn t notice it until I looked at them next to each other  It makes me feel sick  In an email on Saturday  Ms  Hindle Barone  a supporter of remaining in the European Union wrote   I was just shocked and dismayed to see the change to the passport as we haven t left the E U  yet  It s not the passport itself  but what the changes symbolize   something which I believe to be completely futile  What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union A Home Office spokeswoman told the BBC that  in order to use leftover stock and achieve best value to the taxpayer   British passports with  European Union  will still be issued for  a short period  Among the chief uncertainties surrounding Brexit was how traveling to Europe would change  depending on whether Britain reached a deal with the bloc  In posters on public transport and the internet  the government has warned people to renew their passports early if they planned to travel as the Brexit process was unfolding Drivers who held pink plastic permits under European Union standards were told to get ready to apply for international licenses in case Britain left without a deal  Here is what a no deal Brexit would look like  But for Britons  whose passports sometimes are their only form of identification  the document has come to symbolize Brexit  When the government announced that it would return to the old blue passports after Brexit  hailed by Mrs  May  who supported remaining in the bloc  as  an expression of independence   those in favor of the withdrawal saw a strong sign of their country reclaiming control Their joy was soon tempered by news that the documents would most likely be manufactured in France The symbolism of seemingly mundane documents is not limited to passports  In 2015  a year after Scotland voted not to declare independence from the United Kingdom  the government placed the British flag on driving licenses issued in England  Scotland and Wales in a bid to foster national unity  Driver s licenses are handled differently in Northern Ireland   The transport minister at the time  Tariq Ahmad  described the addition as  a true celebration of one nation Britain  The European Union requires its members to make passports with certain security elements  but it does not mandate a uniform design  Nearly all 28 member countries have adopted the recommended layout  the name of the bloc on top  followed by the name of the country  a coat of arms and the word  passport   with translations of information on the cover in all 24 official languages inside Only Croatia  which joined the bloc in 2013  has continued to issue a dark blue passport Britain first issued blue passports in 1921  It had 32 pages and was written in French  according to the Home Office  Passports carried the signature of the foreign secretary until 1947  The covers were changed to burgundy in 1988 to align with Britain s European partners Britons eager to start using a blue passport will have to wait until at least the end of the year  when the government will begin phasing them in  But burgundy booklets will continue to be issued until early 2020  

On Thursday General Khalifa Hifter  the leader of eastern Libya militias  ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli  the capital  where the country s internationally backed Government of National Accord is led by Prime Minister Fayez al Sarraj Ghassan Salame  the United Nations envoy to Libya  had recently urged opposing Libyan factions to come together at a U N  brokered national conference in mid April to lay the groundwork for elections and pull Libya back from the brink  By ordering his forces toward Tripoli when U N  Secretary General Antnio Guterres was in the city to help organize the national conference  General Hifter has made his disdain for the peace efforts clear The septuagenarian commander  who is backed by the United Arab Emirates  France  Egypt  Russia and Saudi Arabia  was aiming to scuttle the conference in a brazen bid for power  But he has encountered more resistance than he expected Despite appeals from the United Nations for stronger American diplomatic engagement  especially to restrain meddling by General Hifter s foreign backers  the Trump administration has long been uninterested in Libya  Recently  it seems to be warming to General Hifter  according to foreign diplomats we have spoken with  Such support from the Trump administration aligns well with the White House s ties to General Hifter s backers in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh  and President Trump s preference for authoritarian leaders A former officer in Muammar el Qaddafi s army  General Hifter broke with the dictator in the 1980s and received C I A  support before fleeing to Virginia  where he lived for two decades  He returned to Libya shortly before the NATO intervention in 2011 hoping to lead the revolution against Colonel Qaddafi  Sidelined by the rebels  he re emerged in 2014  waging a battle against Islamists in the eastern city of Benghazi  After years of fighting  he gained control over eastern Libya  Then he set his sights on Tripoli In recent days  clashes have broken out around the capital between General Hifter s forces and militias loosely allied with Mr  Sarraj s government  The country is entering a state of civil war The United Arab Emirates and Egypt have provided military support to General Hifter s campaign  according to U N  investigators  He was further emboldened after meeting King Salman of Saudi Arabia in late March  These Arab states back the Libyan general because he has vowed to eliminate political Islamists they oppose from Libya  France has been another key supporter and has provided clandestine advisers to his forces  The continued interference of these powers has undermined the efforts of the United Nations to mediate a peaceful solution Although the United States has officially backed the Tripoli Government of National Accord  continued American ambivalence on Libya or  worse  active support for General Hifter  could push Libya into greater conflict  This disorder could strengthen the Islamic State  which carried out a spate of attacks in Libya last year It s not hard to see why the White House could be drawn to General Hifter  Libya has the largest oil reserves in Africa  and the Trump administration reportedly sees Libya s oil production as important in keeping global prices low  In the past year  General Hifter s forces have secured oil facilities in Libya s central and southern regions  boosting output  He has highlighted his role in fighting terrorists  garnering favor among parts of the American military and intelligence agencies  He allowed the C I A  to establish a base in the eastern city of Benghazi  which he controls General Hifter also has Libyan supporters  His promise to establish order has been welcomed by Libyans exhausted by years of chaos and outraged at the failings of the weak Government of National Accord Despite this allure  he does not serve American interests  Nor is he the national savior he purports to be  He claims to be eradicating militias and building a professional army  but his forces depend heavily on militias  some of whom have committed war crimes  His common labeling as an anti Islamist is belied by his backing of Salafist armed groups  But most alarming is his apparent disdain for electoral politics  He has said that Libya is  not ripe for democracy   The recent history of the Arab world shows that such absolutism is not a formula for stability In General Hifter s case  the danger of more conflict is made even worse by the fact that he is not as strong as he seems  For all his aspirations  the general is unlikely to fully unite or subdue the country s factions and militias  His rise to power could provoke resistance by groups that fear reprisals and a return to dictatorship To avoid an escalation  American diplomatic intervention is needed now  Many Libyans actually want more American involvement  In our conversations over the years  it is clear that the United States still retains credibility in Libya as a relatively honest broker  especially when compared with the Europeans and Arabs pursuing competing and narrow interests In the summer of 2018  when General Hifter s forces seized oil facilities in central Libya  American diplomats  working alongside the U N  envoy  prevented these vital assets from falling out of the control of the internationally recognized government in Tripoli In the current crisis  similar American resolve is needed again  The Trump administration should issue a public censure of General Hifter and press for sanctions   both its own and through the United Nations   against the general for subverting efforts at a peaceful settlement and violating Security Council resolutions  In the past  such punitive measures have been applied to other militia leaders who have attacked the capital  Beyond this  greater American diplomatic leadership is needed to shift European and Arab states from backing an authoritarian to supporting a more inclusive path The United States cannot solve all of Libya s manifold problems  but the next several weeks offer a crucial window  and decisive American diplomacy could make all the difference  Without it  Libya risks spiraling into wider violence Frederic Wehrey is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of  The Burning Shores  Inside the Battle for the New Libya   Jeffrey

With the election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a fourth consecutive term  Israel reached a fateful moment  Mr  Netanyahu has set a course that could end Palestinian chances for statehood  threaten Israel s democratic character and deepen the alienation between its right wing coalition government and a majority of American Jews  Mr  Netanyahu can still choose to try to repair the damage from an ugly campaign  During an election night celebration  he promised to be  the prime minister of all the citizens of Israel   We hope he will  although he has not governed that way up to now and has formed alliances with extreme right wing parties Benny Gantz  a centrist former military chief and Mr  Netanyahu s main rival  conceded defeat on Wednesday  paving the way for Mr  Netanyahu to become Israel s longest serving leader Still  forming a government is expected to take weeks of horse trading  In theory  a broad coalition based on Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party and Mr  Gantz s Blue and White Party  formed only a few weeks ago with two other military chiefs  could be the best option  forcing Mr  Netanyahu to compromise on his extreme policies  But analysts say it s far more likely he will stitch together a coalition that depends on ultra Orthodox and ultranationalist parties  driving the government further to the right and worsening the country s political divide  One question hanging over Mr  Netanyahu s victory is his likely indictment on corruption charges involving donors and friendly media outlets  The scandal could cut short his tenure  On Mr  Netanyahu s watch  Israel has evolved into an economically vibrant  technologically innovative country that has improved ties to leading Arab states  even if the only peace agreements are still with Egypt and Jordan  and expanded a number of international relationships  including with Russia  China and India Israel also is strong enough  either by itself or with the United States  to defeat any enemy  Yet its people remain fearful  especially of Iran   And some Israelis are even fearful of their fellow citizens who are Arabs  Mr  Netanyahu successfully exploited these fears to his political advantage He has accelerated construction of thousands of new housing units for settlers in the West Bank and removed Arabs from their homes in East Jerusalem  steadily shrinking the land available for a Palestinian state In a desperate bid to secure re election  Mr  Netanyahu publicly aligned with a tiny party  Otzma Yehudit  or Jewish Power  led by followers of the extreme nationalist Meir Kahane  the Brooklyn born rabbi whose Kach party was outlawed in Israel in the 1980s and placed on the American list of terrorist groups in 1997  Otzma Yehudit advocates annexing the occupied territories  expelling  enemies    widely understood to mean Arabs   and seizing the Temple Mount  a move tantamount to declaring war on Islam  Once Mr  Netanyahu crossed this line  perhaps it should not have been surprising that days before the voting he went even further and said he would begin effectively annexing parts of the West Bank that are expected to be incorporated in any Palestinian state Standing behind him in all this has been Donald Trump  who inserted himself on behalf of an Israeli leader in ways no previous American president has  Mr  Trump moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv  recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  closed the consulate in East Jerusalem that is the link with the Palestinians  and sharply reduced humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians in an apparent attempt to force them to abandon their dreams of an independent state At a congressional hearing on Tuesday  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did what was once unthinkable   he refused to publicly recommit the United States to a two state solution and to say whether it opposes unilateral annexation of the West Bank In the process  the United States and Israel have upended decades of American policy  United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreements like the 1993 Oslo Accords  which said the borders of Israel and Palestine  the future of Jerusalem  security arrangements and the fate of Palestinian refugees would be negotiated by the two parties Under Mr  Netanyahu  Israel is on a trajectory to become what critics say will be an apartheid state like the former South Africa   a country in which Palestinians will eventually be a majority  but without the rights of citizens  That s not good for Israel  nor for the United States Ami Ayalon  a former head of Shin Bet  Israel s internal security service  says his country refuses to confront a basic dilemma about what it wants to be in 40 years  He told The Times that the war most Israelis think they are fighting   over the recognition  sovereignty and security of their state   was actually won decades ago  The war now being fought is over expanding Israel s eastern border by building more settlements and demanding a Palestinian state alongside Israel  We are doing everything in order to create a virtual reality in which Palestinians cannot exist   Mr  Ayalon said   It is not a just war   he added   It will be a catastrophe if we should win  It is the end of our Zionist dream  More commentary on Israel in The TimesOpinion   Thomas L  FriedmanBibi Trump and Donald NetanyahuApril 10  2019Opinion

LANSING  Mich    Bruising political fights are usual business in Becky Debowski s eighth grade social studies classroom  From a model Constitutional Convention to a bare knuckle debate in Congress over slavery  she regularly has students assume roles of partisans throughout American history  like Abraham Lincoln and John C  Calhoun After the exercises  the class comes back together to debate whether the nation lived up to what the state of Michigan calls  core democratic values   such as equality  liberty and diversity  For decades  the values have been the heart of the state learning standards in social studies  a doorstop of a document that guides what teachers of history  civics  economics and geography cover in their lesson plans  I m really proud of my students   Ms  Debowski said   They can handle the complexity   So she was angry last year when she learned of a proposed revision of the state standards  in which the word  democratic  was dropped from  core democratic values   and the use of the word  democracy  was reduced The changes were made after a group of prominent conservatives helped revise the standards  They drew attention to a long simmering debate over whether  republic  is a better term than  democracy  to describe the American form of government That the two sides in that tussle tend to fall along party lines  each preferring the term that resembles their party name  plays no small part in the debate  But members of the conservative group also brought to the table the argument that K 12 social studies should be based on a close  originalist reading of the United States  founding documents They contended that the curriculum ought to focus more on the nation s triumphs than its sins  And they pushed for revisions that eliminated  climate change    Roe v  Wade  and references to gay and lesbian civil rights After a local publication  Bridge Magazine  reported the changes  the backlash in this political swing state was intense  In response  the state brought a broader group of Michiganders into the process to redraft the standards  which will be presented to the State Board of Education on April 9  The board  an elected body with eight members  will then vote on whether to adopt the document  Social studies is not rocket science   said Jim Cameron  who led the committee s work   It s more difficult  Defining American ValuesThe United States  unlike many other developed nations  lacks a national curriculum that defines what students should know  Each of the 50 states can create its own learning standards These documents are closely examined  While schools can teach material not included in them  they shape the content in standardized tests  and many educators rely heavily on the standards as they craft lesson plans  Student teachers are trained to use them Activists have long seen influencing state standards as an effective way to shape the next generation of voters  In 2010  conservatives on the Texas State Board of Education removed the word  democracy  as a description of American government  prompting protests  Georgia has also debated the term  eventually settling  in 2016  on standards that use the phrase  representative democracy republic  The Michigan conservatives   who prefer  constitutional republic    say their arguments are historical  not partisan ImageThe kindergarten section of the new draft of the Michigan social studies standards  Previously  conservatives pushed for the nation to be called a  constitutional republic  founded on  core values   not  democratic values   The previous draft also used the term  roles of the citizen  instead of  civic participation   When you read Article IV  Section IV  it says you re guaranteed a republican form of government   said Patrick Colbeck  a Republican former state senator  citing the United States Constitution While the founders were indeed skeptical of direct democracy  mainstream historians  political scientists and legal scholars say that the United States is both a representative democracy and a republic   and that there is no contradiction between those terms A democracy is government by the people  who may rule either directly or indirectly  through elected representatives  A republic is a form of government in which the people s elected representatives make decisions Some of the country s political processes  like ballot referendums  are more democratic than others  like the Electoral College  Grappling with that complexity is key to understanding American government  according to social studies experts The Michigan Department of Education invited Mr  Colbeck to participate in the standards writing process after he submitted a 13 page critique of a 2015 draft of the document  Mr  Colbeck  a former aerospace engineer who became active in politics through the Tea Party movement  saw liberal bias throughout the standards Asked to name the influences on his view of American history  Mr  Colbeck cited Dinesh D Souza  the right wing commentator  and a radio talk show hosted by Levon R  Yuille  a pastor and anti abortion activist  I wanted to make sure there was a seat at the table for a conservative worldview   Mr  Colbeck said After the proposed revisions garnered local media attention  hundreds of people flocked to community meetings to voice their outrage about what they considered conservative bias  Thousands more registered their objections online Ms  Debowski  the eighth grade social studies teacher  was among those against replacing  democratic values  with  core values   She was capable  she said  of explaining the difference between party names and political concepts   It belittles my subject   she said Many of the students who protested were less worried about terminology than about the way the standards dealt with gender and race  Alex Hosey  a 16 year old high school sophomore in East Lansing  objected to what had been left out  such as any mention of redlining  which contributed to the racial segregation of Michigan cities  Hiding our nation s sins isn t the right way to do it   he wrote in a letter to the State Board of Education   Teach us about everything   the good and the bad  so we can learn to think for ourselves  ImagePatrick Colbeck  a Republican former state senator  participated in the standards writing process CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesImageMarsha Lewis  a Detroit assistant principal and a chairwoman of the bias review group CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesBack to the Drawing BoardUnder fire  the state education agency asked for volunteers to help rewrite the standards yet again   for the third time in five years Out of 144 people who applied  116 were selected  They included teachers  college professors  parents  students and retirees  They were placed on subcommittees dealing with every aspect of the document  from American history  civics and economics to  bias review   and sorted through thousands of pages of public comments They added depth to sections on indigenous peoples  history  Roe v  Wade  climate change and gay and lesbian rights were all restored  The bias review committee suggested the terms  enslaved people  or  enslaved Africans  instead of  slaves  The overall goal was that every Michigan student   a third of whom are nonwhite   would be able to  see themselves  in the social studies standards  said Marsha Lewis  a Detroit assistant principal and a chair of the bias review group But in the days before the document was to be sent to the State Board of Education  fundamental questions about how to describe American government and citizenship had not been resolved It was not just that some Democratic leaning committee members liked the term  democracy  while some Republican leaning members preferred  republic   The debate was really about bigger disagreements that transcended party lines  about how to deal with populism and protest  and about whether the United States is a unified entity of citizens or a conglomeration of groups divided by race  class  language and other identities On March 7  the heads of all the subcommittees gathered at the Historical Society of Michigan in Lansing to go through the draft one last time  The laptop screen of the head writer  a district social studies consultant named Dave Johnson  was projected onto the wall as he made last minute revisions in a Google document Should  responsible citizenship  be replaced with  civic participation   in an effort to include undocumented students Were elementary school students ready to learn about the right  stated in the Declaration of Independence  to  alter or abolish  a government  There s a treason clause in the U S  Constitution   said Michael Libbee  a professor of geography at Central Michigan University  It s only treason until it works   replied Ellen Zwarensteyn  executive director of the Michigan Center for Civic Education In the end   alter or abolish  was included  though the number of mentions was greatly reduced  The writers replaced many  but not all  instances of the word  citizenship  with  civic life  or  civic participation  After lunch  Mr  Cameron  the committee leader and a state education consultant  tacked to the walls poster pages of handwritten suggestions from African American and Asian American community groups Among their suggestions were to add references to Korematsu v  the United States  the Supreme Court case that allowed Japanese internment during World War II  They also asked for mentions of the Chinese Exclusion Act  the Flint water crisis  the  MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter Ms  Zwarensteyn took careful notes  Some of the most rigorous debates had occurred on the civics subcommittee she helped lead  where Michael Warren  a circuit court judge  was a strong conservative voice  Judge Warren preferred the term  first principles  to  democratic values   and had pushed for the civics standards to be based on a close reading of the founding documents ImageMichael Warren  a circuit court judge  was a strong conservative voice CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesImageEllen Zwarensteyn  executive director of the Michigan Center for Civic Education CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York TimesThe list of core values that the standards writers eventually agreed on was  equality  liberty  justice and fairness  unalienable individual rights  including life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness   consent of governed  truth  common good  And after months of sometimes bitter debate  the group decided these values could still be called  democratic   As part of a compromise  the nation s political system would be referred to primarily as  American government   but also  in some instances   constitutional government  and   yes    democracy  Korematsu and the Flint water crisis made it into the standards  Redlining  the Chinese Exclusion Act   MeToo and Black Lives Matter did not  Neither did James Madison  to the consternation of Mr  Warren Mr  Colbeck  the former state senator who had helped write the previous draft  was displeased  Calling the nation a democracy was not  politically neutral and accurate   he said There will still be time for public comment and revision  Education officials plan to introduce the new standards in  listen and learn  meetings across the state this spring If the Board of Education  which after November s election went from a 4 4 partisan split to a 6 2 Democratic majority  votes to adopt the document  the state will begin training teachers on how to use the new standards Then  most likely in the next decade  policymakers will outline new priorities for Michigan schools  and they will ask educators and experts to rewrite the standards once again  The process of retelling the nation s history   deciding what gets left out and who is heard from   never ends  

The package of eccentric ideas known as modern monetary theory   for example  that annual deficits are too small  and that the United States can essentially print money to pay off its debt   has been on the receiving end of a remarkable level of vitriol In policy circles  heavyweight economists have churned out scathing attacks  In the business arena  titans like Laurence D  Fink and Bill Gates have labeled it  garbage  and  crazy talk   And in academia  when the University of Chicago s Booth School of Business asked top scholars about a couple of its claims  they split between the 28 percent who disagreed and the 72 percent who strongly disagreed But M M T   as it s known  is attracting a conspicuous number of fans in an unexpected place  Wall Street  Money managers  chief executives and business analysts maintain that the approach offers several important and overlooked insights  and far from finding it fanciful or deranged  they are using M M T  to build economic forecasts and even trading strategies  I don t look at labels in terms of what s on the left and the right   said Jan Hatzius  the chief economist at Goldman Sachs   I try to look at what makes me have a better chance of getting the forecast right  and I do find some of the ideas useful  So does Paul A  McCulley  a former chief economist at the behemoth asset firm Pimco  Ideas like M M T  that rub against the grain of conventional economics  he said  have  for all of my career been a very useful framework for analysis  That framework helped produce billion dollar gains for the company after the 2008 financial crisis  Dismissing alarms about outsize government debt and white knuckle interest rates  Pimco instead bet successfully that rates would remain low  When it came to decision making during this period  Mr  McCulley said  M M T  and other unorthodox approaches helped him  get it right  Richard C  Koo  chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo  said he had been telling his clients for years that  even with huge budget deficits in the U S   interest rates would actually come down  not go up  Wall Street is not immune to the herd mentality  but Mr  Koo and several other analysts argued that academic economists had a vested interest in certain theories and were  therefore  more likely to suffer from groupthink In an article posted on Wednesday on the website of Grantham  Mayo  Van Otterloo   Company  known as GMO  the strategist James Montier wrote   For me an economic approach must help me understand the world  and provide me with some useful insights  preferably about my day job   investing   On those measures  let me assure you that M M T  thrashes neoclassical economics  hands down  And Daniel Alpert  a managing partner of the investment bank Westwood Capital  credited the theory with preventing him from panicking that rates would soar when the Federal Reserve set off a brief  taper tantrum  in 2013 and announced it was easing its stimulus program Over the past couple of years  he said  the Fed tried everything    it did a belly dance to get long term interest rates up    and it didn t work M M T   Mr  Alpert said   successfully debunks 40 years of misassumptions of how markets and public credit work  Explaining M M T  s AppealProgressive politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York are among the most vocal supporters of M M T   but the theory s appeal crosses political lines in part because it offers a narrative for a series of events that the established wisdom failed to anticipate or explain Big government deficits  for instance  were supposed to mop up available pools of capital and drive up interest rates  which would  in turn  elbow out private investors  damage growth and feed inflation But the last decade was different  When deficits soared after the recession  interest rates fell and savings rates climbed  Investors are awash in capital  The economy has been expanding  slowly  for 10 years  with unemployment and inflation rates ensconced at record low levels One reason for the misjudgments may be that the economic models that confidently strode down the mainstream were hammered out in the decades after World War II  when American companies had an enormous appetite for capital investment   We don t live in that world anymore   said Mr  Koo of Nomura  Today  vast fortunes shift across oceans in an instant  currencies are untethered from gold  and your local coffee shop may no longer accept cash Technological advances  demographic shifts and persistently lower interest rates have further altered the global economy  Mohamed A  El Erian  chief economic adviser at the financial firm Allianz  wrote in an email that  modern monetary theory has merit in stimulating debate  on whether those changes provide  for governments to run larger economically sustainable deficits than was previously thought possible  Besides the risk of government deficits  M M T  throws out a drawerful of other venerable assumptions with Marie Kondo esque ruthlessness  To start  it instructs you to erase that textbook drawing of a white haired Uncle Sam collecting tax dollars from the public and then using them to pay for military weapons  highway repairs  federal workers  wages and more Tax revenues are not what finance the government s expenditures  argues Stephanie Kelton  an economist at Stony Brook University and one of the most influential modern monetary theorists  What actually happens in a country that controls its own currency  she says  is that the government first decides what it s going to spend  In the United States  Congress agrees on a budget  Then government agencies start handing out dollars to the public to pay for those tanks  earth movers and salaries  Afterward  it takes a portion back in the form of taxes  If the government takes back less than it gave out  there will be a deficit  The national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all of the dollars that were spent into the economy and not taxed back  and are currently being saved in the form of Treasury securities   Ms  Kelton said Ms  Kelton  a frequent speaker at business and financial conferences and the chief economic adviser to Mr  Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign  points out that every dollar the government spends translates into a dollar of income for someone else  So a deficit in the public sector simultaneously produces a surplus outside the government The reverse is also true  Ms  Kelton maintains  and that can lead to trouble  The seven biggest American depressions or downturns going back 200 years  she said  were all preceded by government surpluses Ms  Kelton complains that modern monetary theorists are often incorrectly described as contending that  deficits don t matter   Of course they matter  she said What she disagrees with is the reason given  In her view  deficits are not a sign of excessive spending or necessarily a forerunner of inflation  They can be too big  especially if they are not used to increase the nation s productive capacity  or if there is a shortage of labor  raw materials and factories  If Congress authorizes too much spending and businesses are not nimble enough  to absorb it  there can be bottlenecks and price pressure  she acknowledged But she argues that it is much more likely that deficits are too small  depriving the economy of critical investments  The best way to stabilize the economy and ensure full employment and a humming economy  she said  is to have the federal government guarantee every American a job The notion that surpluses could cause economic downturns flips conventional thinking  Yet the idea of sectoral balances   that government or nongovernment deficits are offset by surpluses on the other side   is what some financial economists find so illuminating  even if they stop short of endorsing all of the theory s tenets  It is a great way of summarizing whether households and firms are living beyond their means   said Mr  Hatzius of Goldman Sachs   It is a great indicator of potential financial crises  In his view  giant private sector deficits are much more alarming than public sector ones because households and companies are at much greater risk of losing access to credit in a downturn  Unlike the Treasury  they can t print money   or issue bonds   when they run out Mr  McCulley  now retired from Pimco  used the same kind of analysis to guide his investing decisions after the financial crisis  He figured the only way that private borrowers could shrink their vast storehouse of debt was to have the government buy up those assets  He was unconcerned that the federal deficit would balloon as a result Pimco s view during the crisis  he said  was  shake hands with the government   because it had the largest checkbook  That is why the firm invested heavily  for example  in the federally guaranteed mortgage backed securities that most other firms were shedding Mr  Koo of Nomura has further developed the idea of sectoral balances to explain the most recent wave of recessions and argue for larger government deficits  The problem that major economies in Japan  Europe and the United States have today  he said  is that despite low interest rates  investment opportunities in domestic markets don t offer sufficient returns to lure borrowers to go into debt  using the vast pools of available savings That means  the government has to spend money to keep the economy going   he said  And as long as the government invests in projects that produce an economic return greater than the yield on 10 year Treasury notes   currently about 2 5 percent    this will never be a burden on taxpayers  Ray Dalio  the founder of Bridgewater Associates  one of the world s largest hedge funds  made a similar point in a paper he released recently about saving capitalism  Without any specific reference to M M T   he noted that  policymakers pay too much attention to budgets relative to returns on investments  The View From St  CroixA couple of M M T  s academic strongholds are the University of Missouri Kansas City and the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College  And there  too  Wall Street s attraction to the theory has played a role Warren Mosler  a hedge fund mogul who resides in low tax St  Croix  helped bankroll some of the work at those schools  donating money for student scholarships and conferences Mr  Mosler developed some of the ideas underlying M M T  from his own observations of financial operations  and has written a couple of short treatises He is used to doubters   It s astounding   he said  How could the Fed chairman be wrong  he mused  and  somebody sitting in St  Croix in a pair of shorts be right  Ron Biscardi  chief executive of the investment firm Context Capital Partners  was one of those persuaded by the guy in shorts  When he read Mr  Mosler s book  the ideas struck him as both revolution and revelation Mr  Biscardi s company also runs conferences for the hedge fund industry to which he has invited Ms  Kelton as a speaker  He had recently returned from one at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach that featured tte  ttes between hundreds of investors and alternative asset managers and a keynote speech by Gary Cohn  the former director of the Trump administration s National Economic Council Mr  Biscardi described himself as a libertarian and conservative  To him  modern monetary theory means not only more government spending on infrastructure  but also lower taxes on the wealthy  After all  if government deficits can grow larger  there s no need to raise as much revenue To many mainstream economists  though  M M T  is a confused mishmash that proponents use to support their political objectives  whether big government programs like  Medicare for all  and the Green New Deal or smaller taxes  Think of the Mirror of Erised in the Harry Potter saga  which shows the heart s desire   a tantalizing prospect that ultimately brings ruin From this perspective  M M T  is a version of free lunchonomics  leaving the next generation to pay for this generation s profligacy Although several prominent mainstream economists have recently revised their thinking about the risks of large government debt  they continue to reject other tenets of M M T At some point  they insist  if the government just creates money to pay the bills  hyperinflation will kick in  The idea that deficits don t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong   the Federal Reserve chairman  Jerome H  Powell  testified before the Senate Banking Committee in February Reckoning With KeynesNarayana Kocherlakota  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 2009 to 2015  is aware of the conflicts between M M T  and the traditional framework developed by John Maynard Keynes  in which it is rooted But he is more struck by their similarities rather than their differences  Both recommend that government should spend when the private sector isn t doing enough to employ the nation s work force  raw materials and factories to prompt growth  Both deem inflation to be insidious The inflationary threat looms particularly large for economists of his generation  Mr  Kocherlakota  55  said  For them  the seminal experience was the scarring inflation of the 1970s   The big lesson was that resources are always scarce   he said But over the past decade  he said  his thinking has evolved  Now Mr  Kocherlakota is more inclined to believe that scarcity is not the overriding problem and that the federal government could spend more without risk of excessive inflation If you put aside the theoretical disputations  Mr  Kocherlakota said  the important question is  How far is the United States from reaching the limits of its capacity Even with a jobless rate under 4 percent  he believes there is room to maneuver Mr  Kocherlakota said that compared to those within the Fed  chief executives  financiers and analysts who operate internationally tend to be more open to modern monetary theory in their analyses of government deficits and inflation  Folks who take a global perspective are much more likely to see a lot of unused capacity   he said  They realize  inflation is not built at home anymore  it s built through global pressures  Mr  McCulley  the Pimco alumnus  would put his money on that  Increasing the deficit so that the government could invest in infrastructure and the labor force  would not make me bearish on the stock market at all   he said  At all   he repeated   If anything  it would make me bullish   

PHOLA  South Africa   President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa assumed power promising a  new dawn   But just over a year later  he can t keep the nation s lights on A month before a national election  the worst rolling blackouts in years are regularly plunging South Africans into the dark  With annoying frequency  warnings of  load shedding  pop up on cellphones  referring to the power cuts imposed to prevent a collapse of the national electricity grid Takeout dinners by candlelight are hastily arranged in the cities  Meals are prepared over coal braziers instead of electricity in places like Phola  a township in a region dotted with power plants  about 75 miles east of Johannesburg  South Africa s biggest city  You wake up and there s no hot water  You can t bathe  you can t iron   said Victoria Nkosi  48  a longtime resident of a government built house in Phola   Why is there load shedding when we re surrounded by power plants  The short answer is that the blackouts are the result of years of mismanagement and corruption in the state owned utility  Eskom  They are also evidence of how difficult it is for Mr  Ramaphosa to reform the nation s state enterprises and secure stable electricity for South Africa  sub Saharan Africa s most advanced economy ImageFrieda Madalane  who sells fried bread out of her home in Phola  lost everything in her refrigerator after a recent blackout CreditJoao Silva The New York TimesThe blackouts are contributing to another year of lackluster economic growth in South Africa  a deeply unequal society that desperately needs strong  sustained expansion to create the foundations of a post apartheid economy Every sector of the economy  from the mining giants and car dealers to big retailers and informal entrepreneurs  has been hit badly by the blackouts  Eskom  the state utility that produces about 95 percent of the nation s power  is now regarded as the biggest risk to South Africa s economy  according to the National Treasury and outside financial experts In Phola  Frieda Madalane  who is 54  wakes up just after midnight to start cooking fried dough bread  called vetkoek  Starting before dawn  she sells the bread outside her home to neighbors going to work  making about  20 a day But her profits are now reduced by the amount she spends for kerosene to fuel the lamp she uses during load shedding  And one time  there was load shedding for one full day and I lost everything in my refrigerator   Ms  Madalane said ImagePresident Cyril Ramaphosa  who promised a  new dawn   faces an election just as blackouts are battering the economy CreditKim Ludbrook EPA  via ShutterstockOn May 8  South Africans are scheduled to cast ballots in the sixth general election since the end of apartheid in 1994  The long governing African National Congress is expected to garner the most votes  but its margin of victory remains the biggest uncertainty A strong showing could give Mr  Ramaphosa a mandate to carry out reforms in his party and in government  his allies say  But a poor performance could lead to a continuing standoff between Mr  Ramaphosa and his party rivals  or even fuel an outright challenge  party officials and political analysts say Weeks after becoming party leader in late 2017  Mr  Ramaphosa forced out of power Jacob Zuma  who had more than a year left in his second term as South Africa s president  Mr  Ramaphosa  who had served as Mr  Zuma s deputy for four years  promised to root out corruption  particularly in state owned enterprises Mr  Ramaphosa quickly shook up Eskom s board and eventually appointed a highly respected minister to overhaul Eskom and other state enterprises As the nation s biggest state enterprise  Eskom was the biggest target for corrupt A N C  politicians  their business allies and civil servants during the Zuma years  according to ongoing public inquiries into state corruption ImageThe blackouts have hit every sector of South Africa s economy  the most advanced in sub Saharan Africa CreditSiphiwe Sibeko ReutersEskom was  the main theater where corruption  state capture was taking place   Jabu Mabuza  the chairman of Eskom s board  said during recent testimony at a government corruption inquiry South Africa was plunged back into darkness late last year  as Eskom began imposing load shedding for the first time in three years And the situation has become far more critical than in the Zuma years  So short of energy is Eskom that it has been forced to cut power at the height of summer in the southern hemisphere  and even on weekends when demand is lower because many companies are closed  The crisis peaked in recent weeks as Eskom imposed several consecutive days of  stage 4  load shedding   the highest level   and even talked of the need to create higher stages of cuts A main cause of the recent blackouts  experts say  is two new but underperforming coal fired megaplants  Years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget  the two plants had been expected to relieve stress from South Africa s aging power infrastructure But the plants  which have yet to be completed  are only partially operational because of frequent breakdowns   the result of shoddy construction  experts say  One recent morning  at the Kusile plant   only about 12 miles northwest of Phola   giant construction cranes hovered above three of the six generating units ImageMembers of the main opposition party  Democratic Alliance  protesting against the state owned utility Eskom in Pretoria last week CreditPhill Magakoe Agence France Presse   Getty Images Eskom has gotten itself in a situation where the plants have started to come online  and they just don t work   said Jesse Burton  an expert on electricity policy and coal at the University of Cape Town s Energy Research Center Established in 1923  Eskom provided electricity in the last few years of apartheid to about a third of South African households  a small percentage of them black  Now 90 percent of households have electricity  a result of policies by the A N C   which promised access to power as part of democratization At the same time  Eskom became the source of jobs and contracts for the politically connected  Its bloated work force increased by half between 2003 and 2017 Mr  Ramaphosa recently proposed a partial breakup of Eskom   dividing the company into generation  transmission and distribution businesses under one holding company  The split would make each entity more competitive  he said The breakup  experts said  would also reduce the potential for corruption and ease South Africa s transition away from coal ImageGiant construction cranes hovering above three of the Kusile plant s six generating units CreditJoao Silva The New York TimesA monopoly like Eskom can fuel corruption  said Lauren Hermanus  the founder of an energy consultancy  Adapt  But if you have more players  who are acting in a more transparent way  then you can limit some of that stuff   she said Though still rudimentary  Mr  Ramaphosa s proposal has caused a fierce and immediate backlash from inside the A N C  and the party s traditional allies  including the South African Communist Party and labor  Wary of losing jobs  the biggest union representing Eskom workers  the National Union of Mineworkers  has threatened to shut down the national grid in the days leading up to the election next month Mr  Ramaphosa expressed confidence that the blackouts would not hurt his party at the polls  The challenges Eskom faces emanated from our recent past  and many people are aware that there were a lot of wrong things that were being done in Eskom   he told the local news media But opinion was split in Phola Ms  Madalane  who sells fried bread out of her home  said she moved to Phola in the 1970s  By the time her first child was born in 1986  electricity had arrived in parts of the township The illegal hookups  she said  were putting stress on the national grid Ms  Madalane said she would vote for the A N C  and Mr  Ramaphosa next month  I m angry with Zuma  but Ramaphosa is still new in office   she said   Let s give him a chance  Maybe he ll fix it  Others  though

WARSAW   Growing up in a small city in southern Poland  part of a religious family and conservative community  Maciej Gosniowski was told again and again that something was wrong with him  It would be better if I changed myself   he recalled teachers telling him   It would be better if I behaved more like a boy  It would make my life easier  Mr  Gosniowski was beaten by other students who used homophobic slurs he did not yet understand  He does not want other young people to suffer as he did  so he welcomed the decision by the mayor of Warsaw to introduce a declaration last month aimed at promoting tolerance But the backlash to the declaration has left him shaken Poland s governing party  Law and Justice  has seized on the declaration and the issue of gay rights in its campaigning for European Union elections in May and for national elections this fall Where the party once attacked migrants as a threat to the soul of the country  gay people have become its public enemy No  1 in recent weeks ImageThe palace of Culture and Science  which hosts Warsaw s City Council  The mayor introduced a declaration last month aimed at promoting tolerance for the L G B T  community CreditAnna Liminowicz for The New York TimesIt is part of a growing trend across eastern and central Europe  where nationalist and populist parties are increasingly turning to cultural issues   and attacks on gay people   to rally their faithful From Romania  where the government tried and failed to change the Constitution to ban same sex marriage  to Hungary  where homosexuals are vilified as a threat to traditional families  the letters L G B T  are being scorned as part of a broader struggle against what the nationalists and populists call  European values  Jaroslaw Kaczynski  the leader of Law and Justice and the most powerful politician in Poland  used the party s convention in March to declare that this was a war Poland must win to survive  It comes down to  as we know today  sexualization of children from the earliest childhood   he said   We need to fight this  We need to defend the Polish family  We need to defend it furiously because it s a threat to civilization  not just for Poland but for the entire Europe  for the entire civilization that is based on Christianity  The party s rank and file have rallied to the call  I think that Poland will be a region free from L G B T    said Elzbieta Kruk  who is running on the party s list for a seat in the European Parliament   I hope it will be  Other groups have echoed the attacks  often in more extreme language Fans of one of the

month  the Rev  Henryk Grzadko warned those gathered that Poland was experiencing a  civilizational invasion   It comes down to them waving a rainbow flag and trying to steal our internal values like

the tolerance declaration  said that while he had expected a cynical response from the government  he worried about the sort of propaganda state outlets had produced It was the same kind of bile  he

painted this abysmal picture that we are going to be overrun by hundreds of thousands of migrants that are going to rape our women and introduce diseases into Poland  They are now doing exactly the same thing  But he does not think it will work  In 2015  when Law and Justice came to power  an overwhelming majority of Poles agreed with the idea that more needed to be done to secure Europe s borders from migrants That threat has largely passed  and the issue does not have the resonance it once did  according to a poll released this week by the European Council on Foreign Relations  While migration is important for some voters  it is not the only battleground for votes ahead of the European Parliament elections   the group said in a statement Mr  Trzaskowski  the Warsaw mayor  said he did not believe attacking gay people would prove as effective as the campaign against migrants  The majority of the Polish people will not buy the idea that homosexuals endanger our culture or values

couples  with only 18 percent support Oktawiusz Chrzanowski  36  who played a key role in helping draft the Warsaw declaration  and his partner  Hubert Sobecki  said one of the most insidious parts of the government campaign was an effort to paint homosexuality as a danger to children  The most shocking and disgusting thing is how they can claim people in the L G B T  community are pedophiles   Mr  Sobecki said The Warsaw declaration calls for sex education in schools that follows guidelines set out by the World Health Organization  and for a shelter in the city for people cast out by their family and community ImageMr  Gosniowski  left  preparing costumes for a performance  He decided to come out not long after he was beaten in high school and works as one of only a handful of drag

nonconformity can still come at a cost Young people often ask him about coming out safely  I feel I am needed here   he said   People here are scared to walk hand in hand in the street  While the vitriol being directed at gays is alarming  he said  he has also noticed an outpouring of support that surprised him  The two wings of society seem to be spreading apart   he said   I have found more support than ever  But also people who are more hateful than ever   

SO PAULO  Brazil   A little more than a year ago  a member of Rio de Janeiro s City Council was murdered with four shots to the head and neck  The councilwoman  Marielle Franco  was headed home from an event when a car pulled up and someone opened fire  killing her and her driver  It was obvious from the beginning that this was a premeditated  professional assassination  Ms  Franco was a black  feminist L G B T  activist  a fierce human rights defender who wasn t afraid to take on sensitive issues  the use of state violence in favelas  for instance  or the involvement of police and politicians in Rio s paramilitary groups There was finally a breakthrough in the case  last month  when the state police arrested two suspects  Unsurprisingly enough  they were former military police officers  The alleged shooter  Ronnie Lessa  had retired from the force after being injured in a car bomb attack  according to investigators  he then took a job as a contract killer and gun runner for one of the most powerful militias in Rio de Janeiro  called the Escritrio do Crime  or Crime Bureau  The other suspect  lcio Vieira de Queiroz  who might have acted as a getaway driver  had been expelled from the police force under suspicion of providing security for an illegal gambling house   Both men deny involvement in the murders  ImageInvestigators say Ronnie Lessa  suspected in the murder of Marielle Franco  has ties to Brazil s president CreditLucas Landau ReutersBut who ordered the assassination  That s where things get messy  So messy that last year  the federal police began an inquiry into the local murder investigation  after allegations that it had been systematically obstructed by militia members  public officials and politicians  Last November  Brazil s public security minister at the time said that it s  more than a certainty  that powerful people are involved in the murder  Some say  half jokingly  that it might be easier to pinpoint who is not involved By now the federal task force has searched the residences of a former state representative  a former civil policeman  a former federal agent and an active duty federal police official  Even the current president of Brazil  Jair Bolsonaro  has come under public scrutiny for his ties to both of the suspects in the killing  He and Mr  Lessa were neighbors in a luxury seaside condominium in Rio de Janeiro  and his youngest son once dated Mr  Lessa s daughter  There is also a picture of Mr  Bolsonaro posing alongside Mr  Queiroz   The president has denied knowing the men  But these could be just coincidences  More troubling is the outspoken sympathy of the president and his family for the paramilitaries The infamous  milcias   in their current form  were established in Rio de Janeiro s favelas in the late 1990s and early 2000s  under the pretext of protecting residents from drug traffickers  They are mainly formed of active duty and retired police officers who assume control of the communities and extort money from ordinary citizens and shopkeepers  A 2013 academic report concluded that of the roughly 1 000 favelas in the city  45 percent are controlled by militia organizations and 37 percent by drug gangs During his 27 years as a congressman  Jair Bolsonaro repeatedly supported death squads and militias  In 2003  he said   As long as the state does not have the courage to adopt the death penalty  those death squads  in my opinion  are very welcome   In a 2008 interview  the future president of Brazil declared that the government should support militias and potentially legalize them  since they  offer security and in this way they can maintain order and discipline in their communities  It runs in the family  apparently  Mr  Bolsonaro s eldest son  the senator Flvio Bolsonaro  was recently revealed to have connections to a former military police captain  Adriano Magalhes da Nbrega  the purported head of the Crime Bureau   The ex police officer is now a fugitive from justice   Both Mr  Nbrega s mother and wife were employed for years in Flvio Bolsonaro s office when he was a Rio de Janeiro State lawmaker  In a news release  Senator Bolsonaro claimed that the women were hired by someone else and that he was the victim of a smear campaign  But he also praised Mr  Nbrega twice in Rio s Legislative Assembly for his work as a police officer  awarding him the highest honor granted by the assembly   the Tiradentes Medal   while he was still in jail on a homicide conviction   The murder victim was a favela resident who had just denounced crimes of torture and extortion allegedly committed by his police squad   Incidentally  when Mr  Nbrega was found guilty and sentenced to 19 years in prison  Jair Bolsonaro  too  came to his defense in the Congress  saying he was a  brilliant officer  and demanding a review of the conviction   Mr  Nbrega was eventually acquitted on appeal  In 2015  Flvio Bolsonaro was the only legislator to vote against the establishment of a parliamentary commission to investigate frauds in  autos de resistncia    killings on the part of the police that are reported as having occurred in self defense  He argued that the investigation would put a  knife in the throat  of police officers  who already do not have legal security to carry out their work  In 2008  he spoke of the  happiness  of the people  residing in these communities  supposedly dominated by militiamen   Finally  last year  he was the only legislator to vote against awarding the Tiradentes Medal   that same honor he once gave to a purported militia leader   to Marielle Franco ImageThe police say these rifles were found at an address linked to Mr  Lessa  a former police officer CreditCivil Police  via Associated PressWhich brings us back to her assassination  Bank records have showed a cash deposit of 100 000 reais  about  25 000  into the alleged shooter s account  Who ordered the crime  And why  How widespread is the influence of paramilitary gangs in Brazil s police force and politics Those questions are met with silence while the country remains one of the deadliest places for human rights defenders in the world  Many cases are never solved  Most of them seem to be quickly forgotten  The situation looks poised to get only worse  since our new president loathes the concept of human rights  in a 2016 tweet  he compared them to  manure   and welcomes the actions of death squads   If it were up to me  they would have all the support   he told Congress in 2003  It looks like there s no need to legalize militias in Brazil  after all  Today one might have the impression that paramilitary groups are not merely acting as a parallel state   they are the state The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of

WASHINGTON   President Trump moved to clear out the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security on Monday  a day after  forcing the resignation of its secretary  Kirstjen Nielsen  as he accelerated a purge of the nation s immigration and security leadership The White House announced the departure of Randolph D  Alles  the director of the Secret Service  who had fallen out of favor with the president even before a security breach at his Mar a Lago club that the agency effectively blamed on Mr  Trump s employees Government officials  who asked not to be identified discussing personnel changes before they were announced  said at least two to four more high ranking figures affiliated with Ms  Nielsen were expected to leave soon  too  hollowing out the top echelon of the department managing border security  presidential safety  counterterrorism  natural disasters  customs and other matters The wave of departures of officials originally appointed by Mr  Trump underscored his growing frustration with his own administration s handling of immigration and other security issues  In recent days  Mr  Trump has threatened to close the southwestern border altogether only to back off and give Mexico a one year notice in the face of warnings about deep economic damage from such a move The shake up  coming more than two years into Mr  Trump s term  indicated that he is still searching for a team that will fulfill his desire for an even tougher approach to immigration  It also signaled the enduring influence of Stephen Miller  the president s hard line senior adviser who has complained about recalcitrant homeland security officials Some of the president s allies complained that he was going too far  taking out subordinates who actually share his goals on immigration at the prodding of White House aides hunting for scapegoats for the failure to control the border as he has promised to do  Without names  there s people in the White House that speak about immigration   Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  said in an interview   They haven t accomplished a whole lot  so they need to find some other way to make themselves look important  The latest shuffle came just a day after Mr  Trump pushed out Ms  Nielsen for not doing enough in his view to secure the border and three days after Ronald D  Vitiello  the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  was told to step aside so the administration could go in a  tougher direction   as Mr  Trump put it Officials said they expect to see the departures of L  Francis Cissna  the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  Kathy Nuebel Kovarik  one of his top deputies  and John Mitnick  the department s general counsel and a senior member of Ms  Nielsen s leadership team  All of them were said to be viewed by Mr  Miller as obstacles to implementing the president s policies The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other The White House is also pressing for the resignation of Claire Grady  the acting deputy secretary  who under law would normally fill in for Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Trump has already announced that he will install Kevin K  McAleenan  the Customs and Border Protection commissioner  as Ms  Nielsen s acting replacement  which he cannot do if Ms  Grady remains in place The latest moves appeared to be a housecleaning of officials associated with John F  Kelly  the president s former chief of staff and his first homeland security secretary  who was pushed out at the end of last year after months of tension with Mr  Trump Mr  Alles  a retired Marine major general who served with Mr  Kelly in the military and goes by Tex  was the first person from outside the Secret Service to head the agency in more than a century and some administration officials said he had a hard time fitting in At Mr  Trump s instruction  Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  told Mr  Alles at least 10 days ago to expect a transition after two years in office and to develop an exit plan  according to officials familiar with the discussions Mr  Trump  who talks with members of his own Secret Service detail  had soured on Mr  Alles a while ago  convinced that as an outsider he was not popular among the agents  officials said  The president even made fun of the director s looks  calling him Dumbo because of his ears  But a Secret Service ally of Mr  Alles disputed the notion that he did not fit in  saying that the director was well liked among the work force Mr  Alles was told to develop an exit plan before the arrest of a Chinese woman carrying a malware laced device at Mar a Lago  exposing holes in the security of the private club  The Secret Service was so disturbed that it issued a statement faulting the club s staff for not tracking its guests closely enough Some Secret Service officials said on Monday that they suspected that Mr  Alles s departure was accelerated in part because of the episode The White House made no mention of that in its statement announcing Mr  Alles s departure issued shortly after it was reported by CNN Mr  Alles  has done a great job at the agency over the last two years  and the president is thankful for his over 40 years of service to the country   Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  said in the statement She said he would be replaced in May by James M  Murray  a career Secret Service official who oversees protective operations Mr  Alles was the focus of an early fight between Mr  Trump and Mr  Kelly in the first months of the administration  Mr  Kelly threatened to resign as homeland security secretary if Mr  Alles was not made Secret Service director  according to former administration officials ImageRandolph D  Alles  the director of the Secret Service  received instructions 10 days ago to come up with an exit plan and was expected to leave on his own timeline CreditDavid Goldman Associated PressIn an email message to his work force on Monday  Mr  Alles confirmed that his departure was ordered by the president last month  No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my  firing    he wrote   I assure you that this is not the case  and in fact was told weeks ago by the administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security  The president has directed an orderly transition in leadership for this agency and I intend to abide by that direction   he added   It is my sincere regret that I was not able to address the work force prior to this announcement  Regardless of when the decision was made  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said Mr  Alles should testify before Congress about the Mar a Lago breach  The public and Congress need to know the extent to which adversarial governments   like China   and their agents are attempting to gain access to  or conduct electronic surveillance on  conversations or other information regarding national security at President Trump s properties   he said Not all of Mr  Trump s allies were happy with the moves  There s no doubt that Cissna has proved his competence  in a lot of things he s doing   things that the president is for   Mr  Grassley said  Referring to Mr  Cissna and Ms  Kovarik  both of whom once worked on his staff  Mr  Grassley said   If he gets rid of these two  it s self defeating because I don t know anyone else in the department or at least in immigration  who could do better One administration official said Mr  Cissna angered Mr  Miller by refusing to make changes to asylum policy without congressional approval  Under current law  unauthorized immigrants facing expedited removal may seek asylum before an immigration judge if found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture As for Ms  Nielsen  she expressed no unhappiness about her departure on Monday and thanked Mr  Trump  for the tremendous opportunity  to serve her country and the employees of her department for their efforts to secure the nation The latest departures  along with previous vacancies  will leave the Department of Homeland Security without a permanent secretary  deputy secretary  two under secretaries  Secret Service director  Federal Emergency Management Agency director  ICE director  general counsel  citizenship and immigration services director  inspector general  chief financial officer  chief privacy officer and  once Mr  McAleenan moves  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  The purge of senior leadership at the Department of Homeland Security is unprecedented and a threat to our national security   said Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California Senator Ron Johnson  Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  complained about  congressional dysfunction  in addressing border security  but added   I am concerned with a growing leadership void within the department tasked with addressing some of the most significant problems facing the nation   

UNITED NATIONS   Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday urged the United Nations to revoke the credentials of Venezuela s ambassador to the world body  portraying him as a loyalist to the country s disputed president  Nicols Maduro  and to a government that has allowed crime  violence and starvation to rise In a 20 minute speech to the United Nations Security Council  Mr  Pence called for a formal recognition of Juan Guaid as the rightful leader of Venezuela  which he called  a failed state   and as history teaches  failed states know no boundaries  Mr  Pence turned to the Venezuelan ambassador  Samuel Moncada Acosta  telling him   You shouldn t be here   You should return to Venezuela and tell Nicols Maduro that his time is up   Mr  Pence said   It s time for him to go  The Council meeting addressed the situation in Venezuela  which officials and experts are increasingly describing as a humanitarian crisis that has led about 3 5 million citizens to flee the country Instead of offering temporary asylum to Venezuelans  the Trump administration has called for Mr  Maduro s ouster to relieve a country rattled by skyrocketing inflation  widespread blackouts and a growing public health crisis  The United States  as a replacement  is forcefully supporting Mr  Guaid  the National Assembly politician whom the administration recognizes as the rightful interim president On Wednesday  Mr  Pence also accused China and Russia of meddling in efforts to remove Mr  Maduro  While  Russia and China continue to obstruct at the Security Council   Mr  Pence said   rogue states like Iran and Cuba are doing all they can to prop up the Maduro regime  Global rivalries have hindered the ability of the United Nations to address the crisis  despite intensifying warnings that the situation is deteriorating In February  the United States and Russia introduced dueling resolutions on Venezuela at the Security Council  The American proposal called for free and fair elections  and the Russian plan backed Mr  Maduro s government  Both failed Two weeks ago  President Trump warned Russia to  get out of  Venezuela after two of Moscow s military planes landed in Caracas  the Venezuelan capital  to unload supplies and military personnel  But Mr  Trump has done little else to publicly engage as the crisis continues That role has fallen to Mr  Pence  But on Wednesday  he did not give a firm answer when asked by a reporter where the United States would draw a line on Russia s involvement  He also did not give a timeline when asked if the possibility of American military intervention  an option long played up by administration officials  was drawing closer as conditions in Venezuela worsened Instead  the Trump administration has tried to choke off Mr  Maduro s economic resources  Last week  it announced a round of sanctions targeting oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba  the latest in a string of initiatives meant to curb Caracas s ability to do business  Visas have been revoked in recent weeks for hundreds of Mr  Maduro s associates In briefings held before Mr  Pence arrived to speak  United Nations officials warned of a situation that has only grown more dire as unrest continues and said that offering relief to Venezuelan citizens should not be a political issue Mark Lowcock  an under secretary for humanitarian affairs  told the Security Council that a recent draft overview of the situation by the United Nations indicated that around 1 9 million people require nutritional assistance because of worsening food availability  including 1 3 million children under 5  Additionally  Mr  Lowcock said  tuberculosis  diphtheria  measles  malaria and other preventable diseases have resurfaced in Venezuela Food shortages also remain a main factor in driving people out of the country  Surveys show that 80 percent of Venezuelan households struggle with finding enough food  United Nations officials said  In Venezuela  there is a need to separate political and humanitarian objectives   Mr  Lowcock said   Humanitarian assistance must be delivered on the basis of need alone  The number of people expected to leave Venezuela may surpass five million by the year s end  said Eduardo Stein  a special United Nations envoy for Venezuelan refugees and migrants Citing a worsening public health crisis aggravated by constant blackouts  Kathleen Page  a doctor and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine  urged the Security Council to declare a humanitarian crisis formally and address it in a  neutral  independent and impartial  way On Tuesday  Mr  Maduro said he had met with members of the Red Cross to finalize plans for the arrival of aid to Venezuela  His government and the opposition reached a deal to organize a large scale relief effort late last month  We reiterated our disposition to establish cooperation mechanisms for international aid and assistance   Mr  Maduro wrote Tuesday on Twitter The United States still does not have a permanent representative to the United Nations  a fact that reporters pointed out to Mr  Pence as he fielded questions over whether the Security Council would support his demand to revoke the Venezuelan ambassador s credentials Mr  Pence said he felt that  momentum is on the side of freedom   

WASHINGTON   Furious opposition from both the House Democrats  most ardent liberals and their fiscal hawks forced Democratic leaders on Tuesday to delay voting on a two year budget measure that would increase military and domestic spending  an embarrassing send off as the new majority prepared to leave for a three day retreat The decision to indefinitely postpone the vote underscored the Democrats  lack of unity almost 100 days into their majority and the challenge facing Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team as they try to bridge an ideological gap between upstart progressives flexing their muscles and more moderate members clinging to their Republican leaning seats  This is not an outcome   Ms  Pelosi told reporters on Tuesday   This is a process  Asked if a spending deal was possible despite the party s factions  Ms  Pelosi said   Of course  The bill   championed by Representatives John Yarmuth of Kentucky  the chairman of the House Budget Committee  and Nita M  Lowey of New York  the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee   would set higher military and domestic spending levels than the hard caps fixed in the Budget Control Act of 2011  It had been presented last week as a substitute to a broader budget blueprint that would have outlined policy priorities in health care  taxation  defense and other areas  as well as new spending limits But liberals were angered by the continued increase in military spending and demanded even more money for domestic programs  Budget hawks worried about the unabated rise in spending with no effort to bring down a rising tide of red ink  the bill would increase military and domestic spending limits by more than  350 billion over the next two years Republicans reveled in the disarray  Representative Steve Womack of Arkansas  the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee  called it  another embarrassing failure to govern  Some Democrats involved with the budget process played down the decision to shelve the vote  arguing that the best outcome in divided government would emerge from negotiations with the Republican majority in the Senate and the White House  They pointed to an agreement between Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  President Trump and Ms  Pelosi to allow staff to begin work on a two year spending caps deal in the coming weeks  Congress has previously negotiated deals to bypass the Budget Control Act caps  but a failure to act again before the fiscal year that begins in October would lead to automatic cuts totaling  125 billion  I m hoping this will be the beginning of a bipartisan agreement that will be necessary in order to have an orderly appropriations process not only this year  but next year as well   Mr  McConnell told reporters  The prospect of bicameral talks was first raised in March  and Mr  McConnell called Ms  Pelosi to finalize plans on Tuesday afternoon  according to two aides briefed on the interactions And lawmakers on Tuesday approved a procedural vote that set the top spending levels for negotiating spending bills for the next fiscal year   allowing appropriators to begin working on legislation that would fund the government through 2020  Representative Steny H  Hoyer  Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader  said earlier in the day that he plans to push for spending bills to be completed by the end of June to avoid another shutdown Ultimately  the spending limits put forward by Mr  Yarmuth and Ms  Lowey could not secure the necessary 218 votes because of opposition from the Congressional Progressive Caucus and members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition  In the hallway outside the chamber  representatives from the two groups stood just feet apart as they explained their different reasons for opposing the bill  At some point  we re going to have to pass something   said Mr  Yarmuth  who made the decision not to hold a vote this week   I d love to do it as soon as possible  Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin  one of the leaders of the Progressive Caucus  had told leadership in a private meeting on Tuesday morning that the caucus had enough votes to kill the caps bill  according to two people familiar with the meeting  And members of the Progressive Caucus celebrated the delay in voting  with Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington  a chairwoman of the caucus  calling it  a big victory   It became clear that without real  strong progressive inclusion into the process of a bill  we re not going to be able to get there   Ms  Jayapal said   Hopefully  everyone understands that the best chance of success for a united caucus is for us to be consulted and to be at the table  Anticipating difficult negotiations with the Republican controlled Senate  some liberals argued that the House should pass legislation that spends less on the military and more on domestic programs  understanding that those numbers would have to adjust as talks progress  I don t understand why we want to concede before waging the battle   said Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and a vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus   You don t wave the white flag of surrender before a single shot has fired  Members of the caucus had also raised concerns about what they said was an imbalance between military and domestic spending during meetings this month  according to aides familiar with the conversations but unauthorized to discuss them publicly The bill  which scraped through the Budget Committee  would raise the limits on domestic spending by 5 7 percent  to  631 billion in fiscal 2020 and  646 billion in fiscal 2021  compared to a 2 6 percent increase in military spending  Military limits would still rise  to  664 billion in the next fiscal year and  680 billion in fiscal 2021 Mr  Yarmuth and his allies faced additional pressure from the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition  which balked at the decision to pass on a budget blueprint Blue Dogs warned that the coalition would collectively block planned amendments from liberals that would increase domestic spending in the bill even further to win over the votes of Ms  Jayapal  Mr  Pocan and other liberals  according to a senior Democratic aide  Any budget needed to hew toward fiscal responsibility  particularly at a time when we re sitting at a  22 trillion debt   said Representative Stephanie Murphy  Democrat of Florida and chairwoman of the Blue Dog Coalition   It s one of the key responsibilities of Congress  On Tuesday  the group endorsed a constitutional amendment put forward by one of its freshman members  Representative Ben McAdams  Democrat of Utah  that would bar the federal government from spending more than it receives in a single fiscal year  except in the case of war or recession  The balanced budget amendment has been pushed by Republicans for decades  It s clearer than ever that the only way Congress will be able to produce a balanced budget is if it is required to do so by law   said Representative Lou Correa  Democrat of California and a co chairman of the coalition  in a statement   Washington needs to have a serious  bipartisan discussion about our nation s fiscal state  There will be no more votes until April 29  Democrats are to spend three days at a Virginia retreat meant to help members bond before joining the rest of the House for a two week spring recess  

WASHINGTON   When President Trump met with his embattled homeland security secretary on Sunday to force her out after months of stormy eruptions over immigration policy  the only other person in the room was Mick Mulvaney  who made no effort to head off the final confrontation and instead helped draft the letter of resignation When Mr  Trump decided to get rid of his Secret Service director  officials said  Mr  Mulvaney delivered the message rather than try to talk the president out of it  When Mr  Trump considered whether to ask a court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act despite opposition from his own top legal advisers  Mr  Mulvaney s response  Follow your gut In his first 100 days as the president s acting chief of staff  Mr  Mulvaney has assumed a central role in Mr  Trump s circle but one markedly different than the previous two occupants of his corner office  For the first time since taking office  Mr  Trump has a chief of staff who has made it his job to encourage rather than restrain the president s conservative instincts   to let Trump be Trump  in effect A former congressman from South Carolina and a leader of the Tea Party movement  Mr  Mulvaney is not a product of the Republican establishment like Reince Priebus  the first chief of staff  or the military hierarchy  like John F  Kelly  the second  Instead  he arrived at the White House from the revolutionary wing of the conservative movement  whose goal even before Mr  Trump entered politics was to blow up what it considered a corrupt and liberal Washington  I don t think that he sees the role of the chief of staff to alter the personality of the person he works for   said former Representative Trey Gowdy  a friend and fellow South Carolina Republican who golfed with the president and Mr  Mulvaney last month   They have a good relationship  but the president s the boss  Some outsiders see the cascade of hard line policy ventures  unorthodox appointments and high level purges of recent days as a sign of Mr  Mulvaney s expanding influence  assuming that he is pushing Mr  Trump to the right  But insiders call that a misconception  insisting that Mr  Mulvaney at most is pushing on an open door and otherwise is merely liberating Mr  Trump to pursue the courses he prefers The lesson Mr  Mulvaney took from the unhappy experiences of Mr  Priebus and Mr  Kelly   both of whom were cast out unceremoniously via Twitter or comments to reporters   was that Mr  Trump is not interested in being managed by aides who think they know better  and so he has tried to build a process that he thinks better serves the president To some Republicans who had become resigned to an ungovernable White House  Mr  Mulvaney has been a welcome presence  one who has tamped down some of the tribal rivalries that played out in vicious form through clandestine disclosures to the news media  I think he s become an asset because he s learned how to keep the Trump train running   said Scott Reed  the top political adviser to the United States Chamber of Commerce   A combination of managing the staff  raising the morale and limiting the leaking has made him a successful Trump chief of staff  But to his critics  including some Republicans  Mr  Mulvaney s approach has unleashed the president in dangerous ways  After forcing a five week government shutdown at the start of the year  Mr  Trump in recent days threatened to close the nation s southern border  selected unconventional nominees for the Federal Reserve despite significant vetting issues and began clearing out the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security In a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  lamented the  chaos  in the White House stemming from the president s  whimsical  erratic  behavior  I hope that the president or some of the people around him will realize that his administration is far from a fine tuned machine   he said   It s a slow motion disaster machine that the American people see in action every day  Even some Republicans on Capitol Hill hold Mr  Mulvaney in low regard  particularly senators who view him as a former congressman with little deal making experience and scant inclination to learn  In recent days  some criticized the expanding homeland security purge while others complained that Mr  Mulvaney does not meet with them enough During tense negotiations amid the government shutdown earlier this year  Senator Richard C  Shelby  the Alabama Republican and Appropriations Committee chairman  complained bitterly about Mr  Mulvaney s penchant for undoing weeks of bipartisan work with a quick comment to Mr  Trump in the Oval Office  Mr  Shelby told Senator Patrick J  Leahy of Vermont  the committee s top Democrat  that Mr  Mulvaney was  the most dangerous man  in Washington  according to three people familiar with the exchange Mr  Shelby has not repeated that in public  but when a reporter on Capitol Hill asked him about Mr  Mulvaney last week  the senator tartly interrupted to offer a correction ImageMr  Trump and Mr  Mulvaney at the White House  Mr  Mulvaney has made it his job to encourage rather than restrain the president s conservative instincts CreditDoug Mills The New York Times You mean the acting chief of staff   he said before walking away Mr  Trump has yet to formally remove the  acting  before the title  but after more than three months Mr  Mulvaney shrugs that off  telling others that everyone who works for the president serves at his pleasure and therefore is acting Indeed  Mr  Mulvaney is operating not as a temporary caretaker  but as someone who expects to stay for a while  bringing to the West Wing a clutch of aides from the Office of Management and Budget  where he served as director  He has engaged in team building exercises like retreats at Camp David  most recently last week to discuss efforts to create a replacement for the Affordable Care Act He is generally liked by the staff  which recoiled at Mr  Kelly s military style  Mr  Kelly made clear that he hated the job  muttering out loud when he left on many evenings that he might not return the next day  By contrast  Mr  Mulvaney tells people that he loves the job  an attitude that allies said has improved morale Even some Democrats praised Mr  Mulvaney for reaching out  Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky  chairman of the House Budget Committee  said his relations with Mr  Mulvaney were  excellent  and noted that he was invited to Camp David for a trust building visit  Mick s never going to resolve Trump s erratic behavior   Mr  Yarmuth said   He s never going to be able to do anything about that  But over all  I think he s been a much more effective chief than Kelly has  Still  Mr  Mulvaney has been criticized internally  by colleagues unwilling to be identified  for creating his own fief  And he has been faulted for appealing to Mr  Trump s nativist instincts and desire to cater to his hard core political base Mr  Trump does not share Mr  Mulvaney s special passion for hawkish fiscal policies but signed off on a largely symbolic budget that incorporated some of those priorities  only to overrule his aides when proposed funding cuts to Special Olympics were publicized  The biggest problem I sense with Mulvaney is because of his own politics  he tends to push Trump further to the right than even Trump might want to go   said Leon E  Panetta  who held the job under President Bill Clinton   As chief of staff  your greater responsibility is to present to the president the options for what he should decide  Mr  Mulvaney has told people that he strives to do just that  ensuring that the president hears different points of view  During the deliberations over the Affordable Care Act  allies noted that Mr  Mulvaney made sure that Mr  Trump heard objections lodged by the Justice Department and White House counsel While Mr  Mulvaney has kept the essence of Mr  Kelly s policy development procedure  he consults with Mr  Trump earlier in the process to get his direction  rather than wait until the end  Although he was known as a firebrand in the House who stood up to Republican leaders  he is deferential to Mr  Trump  calling him  boss   while making a point of spending off hours on the golf course with him In the West Wing  Mr  Mulvaney is seen as someone who knows when to fight battles  as opposed to Mr  Kelly  who often found himself at odds with Mr  Trump s adult children and informal advisers  He does not try to manage access to the president as Mr  Kelly did  Rather than fight Mr  Trump s natural desire to meet and talk with a variety of people  Mr  Mulvaney has taken a decentralized approach that he calls chief of staff by committee  empowering different advisers to provide the president their guidance It is a style most associated with Presidents Gerald R  Ford and Jimmy Carter  each of whom resisted having a strong chief of staff at first  preferring what was called a  hub and spoke  model in which many people had access to the Oval Office  Both eventually abandoned the approach  concluding that it did not work  and Mr  Mulvaney eschews the hub and spoke term to avoid associations with those failed experiments People close to the president say Mr  Mulvaney gets too much credit   or blame   for Mr  Trump s rightward turn on policy  Mr  Trump s instinct is to appeal to core supporters who he fears will leave him  and he is the one who wants to demonstrate to them that he is continuing a hard line on immigration David Bossie  president of the conservative group Citizens United and a former deputy campaign manager for Mr  Trump  said the president was adjusting to a changing political environment  The president is responding to that new world order and that s the mind set   Mr  Bossie said   He is under siege by congressional Democrats  and that is how he s operating   under siege  And Mr  Mulvaney is in the trench next to him  

Democrats are hoping that President Trump s federal tax returns will serve as a Rosetta stone to unlock the secrets of his murky finances  Mr  Trump  on the other hand  has spent the past three years refusing to divulge the returns and even dismissing them as boring Now  the fight over whether members of Congress have the right to see the president s tax returns is intensifying  The House tax writing committee has demanded them  and late Wednesday  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department would not comply with the request by the date set by the committee  Earlier in the day  Mr  Trump repeated that he would not disclose his returns  falsely claiming that there is no law that gives Congress the authority to obtain them  Mr  Trump is the first president in four decades to not publicly release his tax returns  The refusal   coupled with his continued ownership of a far flung network of closely held businesses   has fanned suspicions that he has something to hide  So  what might lawmakers find if they obtain Mr  Trump s tax filings For starters  his recent returns could illuminate the sources of his income and any tax avoidance strategies he may have used  but it would not fully decode the family s personal and business finances Leaked pages of the president s old tax returns and other financial documents already have shed light on his finances  They indicate that Mr  Trump most likely avoided paying income taxes for a number of years and that in other periods The New York Times found he participated in fraudulent tax schemes to minimize his tax bill  His federal ethics filings show hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding loans and a business network owned through a web of corporate entities The House Ways and Means Committee last week requested six years of Mr  Trump s personal tax returns  along with the returns filed by one of his trusts and seven subsidiaries he controls  They also asked for records of any audits  The returns would partly reveal the sources of the president s income  and whether his businesses are profitable  They would show how much  if anything  Mr  Trump has been paying in taxes and might show whether he has been aggressive in reducing his tax bills  They will show whether Mr  Trump has personally donated to charity The returns requested by the committee  however  would not fully answer longstanding questions about the identities of Mr  Trump s business partners  the ultimate sources of his income or whether he is entangled with entities that have interests before his administration  Even if Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  who leads the committee  is successful  it does not mean the tax returns will become public  By law  they are supposed to remain solely in the hands of the committee  an unauthorized release would be a felony  Update  House chairman says treasury s reasons to withhold Trump s tax returns  lack merit   How much is Mr  Trump worth Ever since he declared his candidacy  Mr  Trump   a self proclaimed billionaire   has faced questions about whether he is exaggerating his wealth Mr  Trump has never substantiated his assertion that he is a billionaire  though he has repeatedly made the claim to banks and other institutions  The disclosure of his tax returns probably would not settle the debate over Mr  Trump s net worth Tax returns do not provide lists of assets or liabilities  unless they generate income or deductions  Even then  the returns most likely would not provide values of those assets or liabilities Still  Mr  Trump s full tax returns   his personal returns and the ones for all of the components of the Trump Organization   would give a sense of the profitability of his businesses  The returns would also reveal whether his companies have taken a hit since he entered the White House   Mr  Trump has said he has lost vast amounts of money since he became president  Whom is Mr  Trump in business with Mr  Trump for years ran the Trump Organization  a privately held company that manages real estate  golf resorts  brand and licensing deals and other interests  Much about the businesses  finances remains unknown  The federal ethics disclosures Mr  Trump has made about his holdings so far have been limited  For example  there is no requirement that he report the identities of investors who have put money into his businesses  Mr  Trump acquired many properties  in particular golf courses  with cash  but where did that cash come from  Mr  Trump s son Eric once told a journalist that the Trump Organization s golf properties were paid for with Russian money  Eric Trump has denied making that statement  While Mr  Trump s federal filings have reported some outstanding loans  investments and income from each business  they do not include debts where he has a partial interest or older loans that have been paid off  In theory  the existence of those older loans   and the lenders behind them   could be disclosed on his historical tax returns because certain types of interest on debts can be tax deductible In reality  much of that information is unlikely to be contained in the limited number of returns requested by Congress  The panel is seeking the returns for only a small number of Mr  Trump s companies  But he controls hundreds of separate L L C s that contain individual businesses  as varied as a particular building or the rights to license his name overseas  Each one of those businesses may file its own tax return  separate from the ones requested by the committee How exactly does Mr  Trump make his money Mr  Trump owns and operates businesses in the United States and overseas  He earns revenue from golf club memberships  from leasing space in his buildings and from licensing deals to put the  Trump  name on other developers  properties  Mr  Trump s government disclosure reports show ranges of how much revenue his various subsidiaries collect  as provided by Mr  Trump  but they do not indicate the companies  overall profitability For example  his most recent government ethics report states that his Irish golf business reported revenue of  14 million in 2017  However  Irish regulators require that the golf subsidiary make its filings public  Those disclosures show the business actually lost about  2 million that year  Mr  Trump s returns could provide further detail about the profitability of his other businesses  More broadly  his tax returns can be compared with the ethics disclosures to check the accuracy of the filings Mr  Trump s personal tax returns will also itemize his stock  and bond market transactions and people and institutions he is receiving income from  domestic and foreign  This would include income he has received from banks Is Mr  Trump cheating on his taxes If Democrats get Mr  Trump s taxes  they will be looking for any aggressive or illegal maneuvers   such as the fraudulent tactics he has used in the past Sophisticated tax filers use their returns to paint the picture of their finances they want the government to see  It usually takes a lot of digging to find out what is going on behind the numbers For example  as The New York Times reported last year  Mr  Trump and his siblings set up a sham corporation in the early 1990s to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents In that case  The Times had access to far more than just tax returns  It also relied on confidential business filings  public records and information from sources to document the fraud At the time the article was published  a lawyer for the president  Charles J  Harder  said the allegations of fraud and tax evasion were 100 percent false  and highly defamatory What will be more immediately apparent in Mr  Trump s tax returns is what sort of deductions he has used to reduce his tax bill  and how aggressively he has used them In 1995  for example  Mr  Trump paid no income tax  and records show he has not paid income tax in several other years  The president has said he has avoided taxes because of the generous deductions given to real estate owners like himself  One deduction is depreciation  which permits real estate investors to deduct a portion of the cost of their buildings from their taxable income  I have a write off  A lot of it is depreciation  which is a wonderful charge   he said during a presidential debate in 2016   I love depreciation   

Is Israel ready for a changing of the guard The outcome of Tuesday s parliamentary election will determine whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party will continue to lead the country  Mr  Netanyahu  who has been embroiled by corruption allegations  continues to be seen by many Israeli Jews as critical to their country s future security  But he s facing a strong challenge from the newly formed Blue and White party  led by the former military chief Benny Gantz  Israel uses a parliamentary system in which many parties jockey for votes  Even if Mr  Netanyahu s Likud wins fewer seats than Mr  Gantz s party  he may be better positioned to form a governing coalition by working with conservative parties  Read more about Israel s political parties and the election process here  We asked Israeli citizens how they plan to vote and which issues matter most to them  Though we sought feedback from citizens of all backgrounds  and reached out in English and Arabic  our 200 responses were overwhelmingly from Jews  perhaps because many of Israel s nearly two million Arab citizens plan to boycott the election  Many said they had chosen Likud or Blue and White  and listed the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians among their chief concerns  Others said they were more focused on the economy and social issues such as L G B T  rights  saying they would vote for parties like the New Right  the center right party Kulanu or the left wing secular party Meretz  Below are some of their responses  which have been condensed and edited If you re an Israeli citizen  which party will you vote for  Tell us in the comments  Israel Elections  How the Country Chooses a Leader and What s at StakeApril 9  2019Israeli Palestinian Conflict and SecurityPeace with the Palestinians has remained elusive during Mr  Netanyahu s time as prime minister  Violence has surged in the West Bank at times  there were wars with Islamic militants in Gaza in 2012 and 2014  and recent clashes between Israel and Hamas along the Gaza border have been deadly  Palestinians in the West Bank  Gaza and East Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote on Tuesday  Chana Selmon  JerusalemI am voting for the New Right  Naftali Bennett s party  because I am in favor of the annexation of the territories Judea and Samaria and the West Bank so as to apply Israeli law to all who

application of environmental regulations  the burning garbage  pollution and contamination there are horrific  and better relations among different demographic populations  Alec Siegel  Tel AvivGantz takes a more sober  realistic approach to the conflict with the Palestinians  His background as the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff certainly helps  but he seems to grasp the more diplomatic aspects of being a head of state as well He advocates smaller steps that could improve lives on all sides while keeping in mind the ultimate goal of two states  without simply paying lip service to a lofty ideal Seraj Assi  WashingtonI m boycotting the election  As a Palestinian citizen of Israel  I have no reason to be optimistic about my future in the country  If by simply exercising my basic democratic right to vote  I am posing a threat to Israel s political order  as Netanyahu has constantly hinted  then I can only imagine where my struggle for equal rights stands right now  What s more  Arabs will have no say in the new government  regardless of who wins  All major party  Jewish  leaders said they will not invite Arab parties to join a government coalition  That explains why many Arabs are boycotting  with reasons ranging from racism and discrimination to lack of faith in both Arab parties and Israel s democracy  Hanan Cohen  Beit ShemeshI am Jewish  The Arab citizens in

and support Likud  Besides their foreign relations successes  Likud and Netanyahu have led impressive growth in the economy that has benefited my family  along with most families in Israel The allegations against Netanyahu are serious but have been way overblown by the media  Likud has a deep bench of experienced leaders who can certainly hold the reins if Netanyahu is sidelined Jonathan Mosery  ModiinI plan on voting for Benny Gantz Netanyahu has been in power too long  He has done great work and will undoubtedly be remembered as one of Israel s top prime ministers and central to Israel s emergence as an economic powerhouse and regional power  but power corrupts  Whether or not the allegations about Netanyahu are true  he has held the reins too long and become obsessed with holding on as long as possible  rather than putting the country s needs first Stav Cohen  RehovotNetanyahu cares so deeply about Israel  In a time where we feel like the world despises our every move  we need him to remain in office I obviously don t approve of his scandals  but I love him as our prime minister The EconomyIsrael s economy and tech sector have grown steadily under Mr  Netanyahu  and in a poll of likely voters taken a month before the election  almost half said economic issues were most important to them Leora Danzig Leeder  JerusalemI plan on voting  Not Netanyahu   He has had four rounds  and with each passing year it becomes clear that his main interest is lining his pockets I am primarily concerned about the financial and social issues that affect my family  The cost of living is too high  especially in Jerusalem  and one day I would like to be able to afford to buy rather than rent  As a single mother  it is sometimes difficult to imagine thriving financially  rather than just surviving Shimon Zlotnick  ModiinI will be voting for Kulanu because its focus is not only on security  but more important on issues that face Israel every day  such as rising costs and breaking monopolies L G B T  RightsWhile gay rights have garnered wide support in Israel  the ultra Orthodox  who are part of Mr  Netanyahu s governing coalition  have resisted laws protecting same sex couples  Last summer Israelis demonstrated against the rejection of an amendment that would have allowed gay men to father children through surrogates  Eyal Landman  Tel AvivMeretz is wholeheartedly against the continued occupation and fights for human rights and the L G B T  cause  Out of three siblings  two of us are L G B T  and we fear the ultra right wing party s rise to power

serious negotiations it is completely possible to leave some settlements and to evacuate more isolated ones Yael Schottenstein  Givat ZeevI am voting for the United Right party  We need a stronger

conservative Likud party currently leads a right wing and religious coalition Amir Aharoni  JerusalemI hope for a coalition that includes the big secular parties  Likud  Blue and White  Labor  and perhaps Kulanu or even Meretz  and no religious parties If Netanyahu becomes the prime minister and forms a coalition with the secular parties  then this is the best scenario  We can expect some economic and social reforms  such as finally allowing public transportation on Saturday and civil marriages  especially for L G B T  people and for non Jews  Tal Harris  Ra ananaI have reservations

On Wednesday  the Justice Department put Alabama on notice over the state s  flagrant disregard  for the constitutional rights of inmates in its prisons  The department said that conditions in the state s prisons are among the nation s very worst  After carefully reviewing the evidence   department officials wrote in a letter addressed to Gov  Kay Ivey   we conclude that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions at Alabama s prisons violate the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution   which protects against cruel and unusual forms of punishment The findings in an accompanying 56 page report   the result of an investigation that began in 2016   shock the conscience  Violent attacks and grisly deaths discovered long after they ve occurred  Contraband and makeshift weapons that go undetected  Sexual abuse occurring  at all hours of the day and night   Overcrowding so excessive and staffing so inadequate that inmates are virtually unsupervised and  in the words of a former warden   in extreme danger   Grossly inadequate health care  And  according to federal statistics noted in the report  the highest prison homicide rate in the country The Justice Department found that the state failed to protect inmates  from prisoner on prisoner violence and prisoner on prisoner sexual abuse   leading to a  pattern or practice  of constitutional violations throughout the Alabama prison system Such disdain for basic human decency calls for immediate steps  which Alabama officials have said they intend to take by requesting increased funding for more officers and better  more modern prisons But intervention and oversight are needed  In announcing the findings  the Justice Department effectively started the 49 day clock under federal law for Alabama to take corrective actions  or risk a lawsuit in federal court   This case cries out for a consent decree   said Jonathan Smith  the former chief of the Justice Department s civil rights unit that was charged with making sure state and local governments respect the constitutional rights of their citizens William Barr  America s new attorney general  ought to seek court intervention if the state fails to follow the Justice Department s recommendations   which include hiring up to 500 correctional officers  revising security protocols and addressing basic housing deficiencies  such as bathrooms and living areas in disrepair  that rob inmates of their dignity Before the Justice Department s announcement  The Times published an account of the conditions at one of the Alabama facilities under review  the St  Clair Correctional Facility  based on 2 000 photographs obtained by a civil rights group   It is hard to imagine a cache of images less suitable for publication   they are full of nudity  indignity and gore   The Times s Shaila Dewan wrote last week   It is also hard to imagine photographs that cry out more insistently to be seen  Indeed  the story that those images tell   backed up by the disturbing conclusions of the Justice Department report   need to be spread far and wide RelatedMore on Alabama prisonsInside America s Black Box  A Rare Look at the Violence of IncarcerationMarch 30  2019Alabama s Gruesome Prisons  Report Finds Rape and Murder at All HoursApril 3  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

VIEQUES  P R    A newborn s cries rarely echo anymore though the hallways of what passes as a hospital on the ravaged island of Vieques  off the coast of Puerto Rico  We miss it   said Dennisse Bermdez Coln  a nurse Hurricane Maria closed the island s only labor and delivery room  forcing expectant mothers to travel  usually by sea  to the big island eight miles away to have their babies  Just a few emergency births have taken place in an old storm shelter converted into a provisional clinic Nearly 18 months after the storm  the temporary arrangement feels increasingly permanent  The original hospital remains a shuttered wreck of rust and mold  home to the occasional rooster and a band of wild horses whose droppings litter the empty parking lot and ambulance bay  If they keep doing nothing  the hospital will get more deteriorated   Isabel Encarnacin Nazario  65  lamented on a recent morning as she picked up a lab work kit for her ailing 90 year old mother from the makeshift clinic The languishing Vieques hospital is one of many places where rebuilding has stagnated nearly a year and a half after the ruinous September 2017 hurricane  Repairs have yet to begin  slowed by disagreements over the project s scope and cost  though reopening the hospital is supposed to be a top priority Puerto Rico was in financial distress and had crumbling infrastructure before Hurricane Maria  and many residents complain of government malfeasance that exacerbated the storm s impact  echoing criticism from Washington  But Puerto Rican leaders say the delay to the Vieques hospital and thousands of other stalled projects is a reflection of unequal treatment from the White House and Congress  which last week failed to pass disaster relief legislation because of a dispute over how much money to send the island ImageWith the island s only labor and delivery room closed  expectant mothers must travel  usually by sea  to the big island eight miles away to give birth CreditErika P  Rodriguez for The New York TimesThe dispute has interfered with aid reaching other parts of the country  including Midwestern states seeking flood relief and coastal states looking to increase hurricane protection  President Trump again accused Puerto Rican politicians of corruption and incompetence last week  signaling his unwillingness to approve more funds for the bankrupt commonwealth  So many wonderful people  but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter Republican and Democratic lawmakers have endorsed providing Puerto Rico with  600 million to address a more basic need than reconstruction  hunger  After the nearly Category 5 hurricane  Congress authorized  1 27 billion for Puerto Rico s food stamp program  which for a year increased recipients  monthly benefits to match those on the mainland  The bump expired last month  I haven t eaten in two days   Mara Concepcin  52  said last week in the parking lot of a local food stamp office in the municipality of Bayamn  outside San Juan  the capital  A few minutes later  she burst into tears Ms  Concepcin  who said she is epileptic and suffering from cancer  had walked about two hours from her home only to learn that her appointment had been canceled  She hoped to request more money  after her benefit was cut more than half  to  108 a month  It s not enough   she said About 85 percent of food on the island is imported  elevating prices for consumers  Some 1 3 million of 3 2 million Puerto Ricans   about 43 percent of the population   qualify for food stamps  The island has been in an economic recession for 12 years  It s not much  but it s something   William Miranda  59  a janitor who lost his job after the hurricane  said at the food stamp office   We buy as much as possible on special at the supermarket   added his wife  Carmen Lugo  62 Image I haven t eaten in two days   Mara Concepcin  52  said CreditErika P  Rodriguez for The New York TimesHouse Democrats have pushed for funding beyond the food stamp program  including  849 million for the Environmental Protection Agency to fix damaged water systems  about  150 million in housing grants for Puerto Ricans to repair their homes  and a provision requiring the Federal Emergency Management Agency to pay the full cost of permanent work on public buildings and other infrastructure  as it did after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy Without the FEMA provision  Puerto Rico could have to pick up 10 percent of the rebuilding costs   billions of dollars the commonwealth government  whose finances have been controlled by a federal oversight board since 2016  said it does not have That is why Gov  Ricardo A  Rossell  other Puerto Rican officials and their allies on Capitol Hill have cast the disaster relief package as critical for the island s long term rebuilding  The legislation would not provide direct funding for projects like the Vieques hospital  but it would help ensure that the Puerto Rican government s budget troubles don t hold the project up  This affects everything   Mr  Rossell  a Democrat  said in an interview last week   It hinders the recovery  It hinders our objective of having an energy grid that is sustainable  that s reliable and that s modern  It hinders our capability of fixing our water systems  Also awaiting funding  police stations  public schools and roads  The town of Villalba needs to replace its emergency operations center and an assisted living facility for seniors  both destroyed by the hurricane  Mayor Luis Javier Hernndez said   The town has leased other buildings to house the facilities in the meantime   Residents of nearby Barranquitas  in Puerto Rico s mountainous central region  have had to take 40 minute detours along country roads because two major bridges were washed out  It s been dangerous  and there have been several accidents   Mayor Francisco Lpez of Barranquitas said   It s really concerning  because the hurricane was a year and a half ago   and we re two months from the start of a new hurricane season  In the San Juan neighborhood of Ocean Park  where some streets were flooded with smelly water for two weeks after Hurricane Maria  Jess Herbn  the owner of a local bakery  jokes that he has become an expert on water pumps from all the time he has devoted to learning about how they failed during the storm ImageMobile units form a makeshift clinic on Vieques  where patients can receive dialysis and dental care CreditErika P  Rodriguez for The New York Times This could have turned into a source of infection   Mr  Herbn said   Of course we re worried it could happen again  Temporary pumps are now backing up the old ones while the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources awaits FEMA funds for permanent upgrades  a department spokeswoman said So far  FEMA and other agencies have disbursed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the federal Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion has been allocated but not yet distributed  the budget office estimates the island could receive  91 billion over the next 20 years  It is the biggest amount appropriated to the island  that s true  but it is the biggest disaster to hit our island   said Representative Jenniffer Gonzlez Coln  a Republican and Puerto Rico s nonvoting member of Congress   People get frustrated that all the money has been there   you can smell it  you can touch it   but you can t grab it  The Trump administration has questioned Puerto Rico s ability to spend the money wisely ever since the commonwealth awarded a  300 million contract to Whitefish Energy  a Montana company with only two employees  Puerto Rico later created a recovery agency and agreed to additional oversight  though some residents remain skeptical that the money will be well spent  Donald Trump is partly right   scoundrel that he is   because in Puerto Rico we live off the government   said Ms  Encarnacin  the Vieques resident Most of the aid Puerto Rico has received has gone toward emergency work  including debris removal and power restoration  a huge undertaking that took nearly a year  The New York Times found last year that much of FEMA s money for emergency home repairs went to contractors charging steep markups ImageEdwin Alvarado Cordero suffered a heart attack on the ferry to the big island  where he was traveling for dialysis  He had open heart surgery and survived CreditErika P  Rodriguez for The New York TimesFor Mr  Rossell  the funding fight is a question of fairness  For every long term rebuilding project underway in Puerto Rico at this point after Hurricane Maria  there were 28 projects underway in Texas for damage from Hurricane Harvey  and 32 projects in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina  the governor said   Puerto Rico is getting much fewer and much lower resources than any comparable jurisdiction in the United States  A University of Michigan analysis published in the journal BMJ Global Health in January found it took twice as long   four months   for Hurricane Maria survivors in Puerto Rico to receive a comparable amount of individual aid  about  1 billion  as Hurricane Harvey survivors in Texas and Hurricane Irma survivors in Florida  though Maria was stronger and more devastating  Maria killed an estimated 2 975 people in Puerto Rico In addition to the slow disbursement of aid  a report last month from the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development lacked a robust plan to monitor disaster relief grants  including  20 billion approved for Puerto Rico In Vieques  with the hospital out of commission  dialysis patients had to travel to the big island three times a week to get treatment for more than a year after the storm  Several patients died  Finally  in November  a mobile dialysis unit in a shiny trailer arrived at the temporary clinic  allowing local treatments to resume  It wasn t easy   said Edwin Alvarado Cordero  a 58 year old diabetic  Standing across the street from the pharmacy in Isabel Segunda  the bigger of the island s two towns  Mr  Alvarado recounted his thrice weekly trips from Vieques to Humacao  which began at 4 a m  and ended at 5 30 p m Last year  on the ferry to the big island  Mr  Alvarado suffered a heart attack  He had open heart surgery and survived  Though he can now receive dialysis in Vieques  he still travels to San Juan periodically to see his cardiologist  Specialists visit Vieques infrequently  It s far  but it s better there   Mr  Alvarado said   What s left of the hospital here is grass and horses  They abandoned it   

WEST PALM BEACH  Fla    The Chinese woman who was arrested after gaining entry to President Trump s private club while carrying four cellphones and other electronic equipment had stored even more electronics in her hotel room  including a device used to detect hidden cameras  a federal prosecutor said Monday The woman  Yujing Zhang  32  was arrested March 30 after telling Secret Service agents that she had come to use the pool at Mar a Lago and showing two Chinese passports  After the authorities determined that the event she said she had come to attend did not exist  she was arrested and charged with lying to a federal officer and accessing a restricted area Ms  Zhang had entered the property with four cellphones  a hard drive and a thumb drive infected with malware  according to federal court records  Upon searching her hotel room  investigators found another cellphone and a radio frequency device that detects hidden cameras  Assistant United States Attorney Rolando Garcia said She also had nine U S B  drives and five SIM cards in her room at the Colony Hotel  along with several debit cards and about  8 000 in cash  including about  700 in Chinese currency  Mr  Garcia said during a bond hearing at the U S  District Court in West Palm Beach Mr  Garcia told U S  Magistrate Judge William Matthewman that Ms  Zhang is a  serious flight risk  because she  lies to everyone that she encounters  She told authorities at the club that she had carried multiple phones to the resort because she was afraid to leave them in her hotel room  Mr  Garcia said  She told the court in an appearance last week that she had only about  5 000 in the bank  Someone who is afraid of her property being stolen at the hotel does not leave so much cash and credit cards in a hotel room   Mr  Garcia said Ms  Zhang came to the United States on March 28 from Shanghai on a B 1 visa that has been revoked  meaning that if the court does release her from jail pending trial  she would be transferred to immigration custody  Mr  Garcia said  She has really no ties to the Southern District of Florida  or the United States of America  for that matter   he said Ms  Zhang s assistant federal public defender  Robert Adler  said in the court hearing that Ms  Zhang did not attempt to hide the four cellphones when she entered the club  We have heard the government has no reason to believe Ms  Zhang was a spy   Mr  Adler said The Secret Service agent who questioned Ms  Zhang after her arrest  Samuel Ivanovich  said during testimony that she was not carrying any lock picking or eavesdropping gear  His four and a half hour interrogation of Ms  Zhang was recorded by video  Mr  Ivanovich said  but it lacked sound because he didn t realize that the agency s office in Palm Beach didn t have that capability Mr  Ivanovich testified that the computer analyst who reviewed Ms  Zhang s devices said that the thumb drive she was carrying had immediately begun installing malware  He stated that he had to immediately stop the analysis and shut off his computer to halt the corruption   Mr  Ivanovich said At her initial court appearance last week  Ms  Zhang told a judge that she was an investor and a consultant for a company called Shanghai Zhirong Asset Management  according to a recording of the court hearing obtained by CNN  and had a home in China worth  1 3 million and a BMW  No one at the company could be reached to confirm her employment When she was questioned by the authorities  Ms  Zhang told them she had been invited to an event at Mar a Lago by a friend named Charles whom she knew from an instant messaging app  The information she gave appears to match a man named Charles Lee  who runs a group called the United Nations Chinese Friendship Association Mr  Lee appears to have been promoting a charity event at Mar a Lago  advertising it as a business event for Chinese investors  The real event  a  safari night  to benefit a local youth group  had been canceled weeks earlier  Mr  Lee did not return repeated messages seeking comment Mr  Adler said his client had wired  20 000 to what he believes is Mr  Lee s organization in order to visit Florida and have access to Mr  Trump s family  He provided the court with a receipt  printed in Chinese  and said he plans to subpoena Mr  Lee to support his client s story  What did she do that was wrong   Mr  Adler said   What she did was the equivalent of saying   My name is Smith  I d like to use the pool   The judge postponed a decision on whether to release Ms  Zhang on bond until next Monday  Prosecutors said a more detailed indictment would be filed before then  

For a two hour stretch in a packed Times Square hotel ballroom on Friday morning  the full spectrum of the Democratic Party s stances on racism and racial justice was on display Kamala Harris  the California senator who is seeking to become the first black woman to be elected president  electrified the crowd by declaring that when   not if   she s elected president she would sign a bill to study reparations for black Americans  This is an inflection moment in the history of our country   Ms  Harris said   This is a moment of time where we must restore the significance of truth and justice in this country  John Hickenlooper  a former governor of Colorado  and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  said they would also support such a bill  Mr  Hickenlooper s backing showed how even the most moderate members of the Democratic Party have now adopted the explicit language of racial justice activists  and how the issue of reparations continues to roil the 2020 Democratic primary in ways that few could predict  Slavery is the nagging shame of America   Mr  Hickenlooper said   We must own our past and acknowledge the ongoing consequences of enslaving an entire race of people  ImageRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  Democrat of New York  received a rousing welcome at the National Action Network conference on Friday CreditGabriella Angotti Jones for The New York TimesSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also addressed a group that included civil rights activists and black religious leaders  We must take on the disparity within the disparity  the racial disparities which exist in this country  which are growing wider and wider   Mr  Sanders said The candidates appeared at the annual conference of the National Action Network  the advocacy group founded by the Rev  Al Sharpton  which has become an essential event for Democrats seeking higher office  For the candidates  it was a prime opportunity to speak directly to an influential segment of the black voting bloc that will be a force in next year s presidential primaries  particularly in early voting states such as South Carolina In addition to Ms  Harris  Mr  Hickenlooper  Mr  Sanders and Ms  Warren  the early slate of the conference included speeches from Sherrod Brown  the Ohio senator who declined to run for president  and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  the freshman House member from New York who instantly made an impact on Capitol Hill  We can t sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behind   said Ms  Warren  who used her speech to back another progressive policy idea  the elimination of the Senate filibuster Ms  Warren has sought to boost a campaign that has struggled with fund raising by proposing an expansive policy agenda  On Friday she tried to position her ambitious filibuster position as essential  because Republicans would block most progressive legislation aimed at closing the racial wealth gap Image We can t sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behind   Senator Elizabeth Warren said CreditGabriella Angotti Jones for The New York Times We can t sit around for 100 years while climate change destroys our planet  while corruption pervades every nook and cranny of Washington  and while too much of a child s fate in life still rests on the color of their skin   Ms  Warren said   Enough with that  Ms  Harris  who enjoyed an assumed kinship with the audience because of her identity and historic candidacy  said she would double the size of the Justice Department s Civil Rights Division and focus on white nationalist domestic terrorism  The most liberal candidates  including Mr  Sanders and Ms  Warren  focused their speeches on structural injustices  and how a progressive president could use the power of the federal government to improve historically distressed communities The roster of candidates was a who s who of prominent Democrats  and similarly powerful figures were scheduled to speak later in the day  Presidential candidates from the Senate  including Cory Booker of New Jersey  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York  participated in an afternoon forum with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  Earlier in the week  Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Julin Castro and Beto O Rourke both of Texas also spoke to the largely black audience  Let s call it like it is    Mr  Booker said   Right now in America  we ve come to the distraught present that there are more black men under criminal supervision in our country than all the slaves of 1850  But it was Ms  Ocasio Cortez  the newly elected representative who has become a leader of the party s progressive faction and a favorite target of conservatives  who received a hero s welcome before her remarks  She framed the fight against racism as more than a byproduct of modern political polarization  but a struggle baked into the American story that must be prioritized  She invoked the anniversary on Thursday of the assassination of the Rev  Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr   and the crowd roared in approval  I find so much of this present moment to be a picking up  a revival  of where King left off   Ms  Ocasio Cortez said  before being played off to James Brown   Bigotry  sexism  and xenophobia are the easiest ways to distract from substantive discussions of classism   

The federal government wants to issue more visas for foreign workers to take temporary jobs in housekeeping  landscaping and other fields   even as President Trump seeks to seal off the border with Mexico  where most of those workers come from The Departments of Homeland Security and Labor said they planned to issue up to 30 000 additional H 2B visas through Sept  30  the end of the federal fiscal year  Congress has generally capped the number of visas  which businesses compete for  at 66 000  divided evenly between summer and winter seasons Only workers who had previously secured the visas would be eligible for the proposed additional ones The visas provide legal status for immigrants in temporary nonfarm jobs with landscaping companies  restaurants  hotels and amusement parks  among other industries Last fiscal year  about 75 percent of these visas were issued to workers from Mexico  according to State Department data  Visas were also issued to  among others  Jamaicans  Guatemalans and South Africans Business groups regularly push lawmakers to raise or eliminate the cap on the number of visas issued  a demand that has increased as unemployment has dropped and domestic workers have become more scarce The government s move to expand the H 2B program appeared inconsistent with the Trump administration s repeated message about a crisis on the southwestern border of the United States  On Saturday  Mr  Trump told a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition that  our country s full   What can we do  We can t handle any more   he said   Our country s full  You can t come in  I m sorry  Alex Nowrasteh  a senior immigration analyst with the Cato Institute  a libertarian think tank  said there were  a lot of contradictions  within the government s proposals  On one hand  we need more people because the economy is booming   he said   Then on the other hand  to say   The country is full  go back    it s impossible to reconcile those  The H 2B visa program  which started in the mid 20th century  has been a feature of a persistent debate over using foreign workers for seasonal labor Unions and immigration opponents argue that hiring H 2B workers suppresses wages and deprives Americans of jobs  Advocacy groups say foreign workers are often exploited  and employers say the cap encourages businesses to hire undocumented workers Andrea Palermo  a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security  did not directly answer questions about what was behind the plan for additional H 2B visas  She also did not address questions about the apparent contradiction in the administration s positions  Congress   not D H S    should be responsible for determining whether the annual numerical limitations for H 2B workers set by Congress need to be modified  and by how much  and for setting parameters to ensure that enough workers are available to meet employers  temporary needs throughout the year   she said The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday Mr  Nowrasteh said he favored the H 2B program   I think the economic benefits from the H 2B visa are very large  the benefits to the workers are huge   he said Because businesses are required to show that no American workers want the jobs  the cap  makes no sense   he said  If they try to hire Americans  and Americans don t want to do that job  then there should be no cap   he said Mr  Nowrasteh said he believed that H 2B visas for Mexican workers have helped drive down illegal immigration  He said expanding the program or eliminating the cap could also help reduce the number of undocumented immigrants from Central American countries Last month a bipartisan group of senators  led by Susan M  Collins and Angus S  King of Maine  asked the Department of Homeland Security to increase the number of visas as a way to support small businesses in a tight labor market  especially those preparing for the summer season  In the short run  many areas of our country simply lack the working age population needed to meet the demand for seasonal jobs   the senators wrote in a letter signed by 11 lawmakers   In some industries  particularly tourism  we fear that the demand for workers so far outstrips the available supply that businesses could be forced to curtail operations  putting at risk the jobs of American workers who fill year round positions at these establishments  But Mark Krikorian  the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies  which supports curbs on immigration  was critical of the program and said it enabled  businesses to avoid hiring people they d rather not hire   A nation with a third of a billion spanning an entire continent  with 50 million working age people not in the labor force  doesn t need to be importing labor   he said Mr  Krikorian said the proposed expansion of the program was not  backtracking or flip flopping  by the administration  The president has always been a big fan of these guest worker visas   said Mr  Krikorian  who noted that Mr  Trump s properties  such as Mar a Lago  use this visa program to hire workers  

WASHINGTON   Senator Bernie Sanders stepped to the lectern on Wednesday  red faced and rumpled as ever  with a placard screaming  Medicare for All   and likened his quest for a government run universal health plan to earlier movements for women s rights  civil rights  workers  rights and gay rights  What we are involved in is not just health care legislation   he declared  flanked by admiring doctors in lab coats  Democratic senators and one of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York   We are involved in a great struggle  Medicare for All is not passing this Congress  Its cost is still unknown  the mechanisms to pay for it still the subject of debate  But behind Mr  Sanders s choreographed theatrics were the unmistakable politics of 2020 and his campaign for president  a campaign that never really ended with the election of Donald J  Trump After the 2016 election  Democrats made efforts to pull Mr  Sanders  a political independent from Vermont  into the fold with a newly minted leadership post  But that has only bolstered his platform to seek the presidency   and gave him more power to disrupt the party s status quo VideoSenator Bernie Sanders is embarking on a second run for president  This time the field will be bigger  more diverse and filled with candidates who have adopted his progressive populist mantle CreditCreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times I ran for president  I got 13 million votes  going over 1 700 delegates to the Democratic convention  and got more young people s votes than Clinton and Trump combined   Mr  Sanders boasted in an interview in his Washington office   And I thought that those 13 million people deserved a voice in Democratic leadership  The Medicare for All Act unveiling   its fifth iteration   comes as Mr  Sanders s  18 million fund raising haul has made him an instant front runner in a very crowded field  But in many ways he is still the  same old Bernie   as many of his colleagues like to say   a gruff and sometimes grating presence in a chamber that prides itself on civility  He still knows how to rankle He ran as a Democrat for president in 2016  then shunned the entreaties of Democratic leaders and sought re election last year as an independent  His push for Medicare for All runs counter to the wishes of top Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer  the minority leader  and Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who are trying to de emphasize it At the same time  Mr  Sanders   who has long cast himself as an outsider   has joined party leadership  which gives him a voice in plotting strategy  His post as  chair of outreach    a job that did not exist until he and Mr  Schumer created it after the 2016 presidential election   has also given him license and a small budget to travel the country doing what he likes best  rallying the progressive left to resist President Trump Image I ran for president  I got 13 million votes  going over 1 700 delegates to the Democratic convention  and got more young people s votes than Clinton and Trump combined   Mr  Sanders boasted in an interview in his Washington office CreditErin Schaff The New York Times Bernie Sanders  now a millionaire  pledges to release tax returns by Monday  More than a half dozen members of Congress are running for president  but few have used their seats as adroitly as Mr  Sanders to burnish a brand  He announced his candidacy in 2015 on a patch of grass  known as the Swamp  outside the Capitol   an unusual locale given that senators are not supposed to mix official business with politics Not long after the 2016 campaign  when some moderate Democrats worried he would help foster primary challenges against them  he brought his chief strategist  Jeff Weaver  to meet behind closed doors with his colleagues to tutor them on how to appeal to his millennial base He went on CNN to debate tax policy with Senator Ted Cruz  Republican of Texas  He held dozens of rallies in 2017 to whip up opposition to Mr  Trump s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act  I think he feeds off these crowds  there s no question about it   said Larry Cohen  chairman of Our Revolution  the organization that spun out of Mr  Sanders s 2016 campaign  Mr  Cohen added that Mr  Schumer realized there was  a huge benefit  to bringing on Mr  Sanders   You don t just bring him back after that kind of relative success and just treat him as the junior senator from Vermont  How  Medicare for All  Would Affect YouBernie Sanders s proposal has big implications for consumers and the health care industry Mr  Sanders also staked out policy crusades to address concerns that arose during his 2016 campaign  Criticized for lacking foreign policy experience  he teamed with two Republicans   Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky   to pass a resolution calling for an end to American military involvement in Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen  He also embraced a criminal justice overhaul after being accused of not being sensitive enough to issues of racial injustice He shrewdly hired the Democratic operative Tyson Brody  who compiled opposition research on him for Hillary Clinton s campaign in 2016  Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and a co chairman of Mr  Sanders s 2020 campaign  calls Mr  Sanders  the perfect insider outsider  who  unlike Mr  Trump  at least knows how Washington works The last time he embarked on a run for the White House  in April 2015  Mr  Sanders  was viewed by his colleagues as a kind of oddball figure   a self identified democratic socialist on a Don Quixote  tilting at windmills quest  I think people should be a little bit careful underestimating me   he said then Now the senator has a different problem  So many Democrats sound so much like Bernie Sanders that some are asking why America needs Bernie Sanders  His Medicare for All bill is a case in point  Its co sponsors include at least four Senate Democrats who are running against him  Ms  Gillibrand  Cory Booker of New Jersey  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California ImageMr  Sanders this month at a campaign rally in Davenport  Iowa  Democratic efforts to pull Mr  Sanders into the fold with a newly minted leadership post have helped bolster his presidential bid CreditJordan Gale for The New York TimesBut in planting a political stake in the ground with Medicare for All  Mr  Sanders is effectively challenging his Democratic rivals to follow suit  which could come back to haunt whomever is chosen as the party s nominee  said David Krone  a former chief of staff to Harry Reid  the former Senate Democratic leader  I m very concerned that his campaign is creating a litmus test for other candidates and that s a dangerous path   Mr  Krone said The Medicare for All Act would provide health insurance to all Americans under a single plan run by the government and financed by taxpayers  private insurers could remain in business but could only provide benefits  such as elective surgery  not covered by the government  The 2019 version includes coverage for long term care  perhaps increasing its appeal but also its cost The rollout   complete with Sanders esque finger jabs and talk of  doctahs  and  dollahs    was live streamed from a packed room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building  After Mr  Sanders poked Mr  Trump  the president s press secretary  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  no relation   poked back  denouncing  self proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders  for  proposing a total government takeover of health care  Would  Medicare for All  Save Billions or Cost Billions We asked a handful of economists and think tanks to find out The plan s main drawback   and one that alarms many moderate Democrats and Democratic leadership   is the cost  as high as  32 trillion over 10 years  according to two different studies  But the Sanders camp cites various other studies  including one by the RAND Corporation  to back up its assertion that Medicare for All would save middle class families money by decreasing their premiums and out of pocket costs As to why America needs Bernie Sanders  Mr  Sanders s answer is simple  He was there first  Find out how many folks in the 1980s were going up to Canada to learn about Medicare for All   he said  adding   In 1999  I took a busload of Vermonters across the Canadian border to purchase low cost prescription drugs in Canada  O K   I was the first member of Congress to do that  So are other people talking about the greed of the pharmaceutical industry  Yes  Check out who was there first  He also took a subtle swipe at another of his competitors  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  Of her idea for a trillion dollar infrastructure plan  he said   Well  we were talking about that how many years ago  2015  Ms  Klobuchar then swiped back   While a big infrastructure plan has been kicked around for years  I can get it done   she wrote in an email message Mr  Sanders has always been a scowling presence in the Senate  He plows through the Capitol corridors  always too busy to talk  stingy with his smiles    If you worked here  you wouldn t smile either   he said  His official website offers a hint of where the job falls on his priority list  Until Wednesday  after this article pointed it out  it had not been updated to reflect his re election in 2018 and still said he was  serving his second term after winning re election in 2012  He is thinner these days  having dropped 10 pounds on no particular diet   or at least none that he cares to share    By not eating   he said  when asked how he did it   And though his  national support has given Bernie more credibility   in the words of Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the No  2 Democrat  his colleagues say not much has changed  He s Bernie   said Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia  who ran for vice president alongside Mrs  Clinton after she defeated Mr  Sanders for the 2016 Democratic nomination   Whether that s running or just being Bernie  he kind of does what he does   

WASHINGTON   The Justice Department has begun putting a key aspect of last year s sweeping bipartisan criminal justice overhaul into effect  after delays prompted in part by the partial government shutdown and turnover at the top of the department Attorney General William P  Barr said on Monday that the department had chosen the Hudson Institute  a conservative research group  to host an independent review committee to help law enforcement officials create tools to reduce recidivism and programs for prisoners to earn credits toward early release Critics noted that the attorney general was supposed to designate a committee host within 30 days of the passage of the law  the First Step Act  in late December But putting the law into practice quickly became complicated  The government partly shut down one day after Congress passed the bill and sent it to President Trump to sign into law  and many of the Justice Department employees who would have worked to fulfill it went on furlough  The shutdown  the longest in history  lasted through the end of January That has given law enforcement officials just over two months to start carrying out a complicated piece of legislation  a senior Justice Department official said in defending their pace The legislation swept in the most substantial changes in a generation to sentencing laws that expanded the federal inmate population and created a criminal justice system that many conservatives and liberals viewed as both costly and unfair  The law expands job training and other efforts aimed at reducing recidivism rates  expands early release programs and modifies sentencing laws  Understandably  there have been some gray areas that have needed to be interpreted  but over all  the implementation has been slow   said Brett Tolman  a former United States attorney in Utah and an advocate for criminal justice reform   It s surprising because when the law was passed  it was very clear that the proponents of the legislation did not intend it to be delayed  The criminal justice overhaul was also passed during intense tumult at the top of the Justice Department  which oversees the Bureau of Prisons and would be responsible for carrying out much of the new legislation  In the weeks before the bill was passed  Mr  Trump forced Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign and replaced him on an interim basis with Matthew G  Whitaker  Mr  Sessions s chief of staff Democrats criticized the appointment  pointing to Mr  Whitaker s lack of experience and questions about possible conflicts of interest  as well as whether Mr  Trump was installing a loyalist to oversee the end of the Russia investigation  By the time Mr  Trump signed the criminal justice legislation in late December  Mr  Trump had nominated Mr  Barr  leaving Mr  Whitaker with little influence to spearhead a new initiative Mr  Sessions  who has long held a tough on crime approach  opposed the criminal justice overhaul  and while he was attorney general and Mr  Whitaker his top aide  the Justice Department was seen as hostile to much of the bill  according to three people who worked on it but were not authorized to discuss confidential negotiations Mr  Sessions spent much of his career as a federal prosecutor and senator from Alabama pushing for harsher sentencing guidelines  and many of the sheriffs and the police who were his biggest supporters disliked the legislation  Mr  Sessions  who ordered prosecutors to pursue tough charges in criminal cases as one of his first major acts as attorney general  was seen as a roadblock to getting a deal done in Congress The legislation changed sentencing laws  prompting 800 sentencing reductions already  according to the Justice Department  Of that group  nearly 650 inmates have been released from prison Another 22 inmates have received sentencing reductions under a compassionate release program that is part of the law  Last month  a federal judge in Houston ordered the Bureau of Prisons to give Richard Evans  74  who has cancer  compassionate release under the law  Mr  Evans was 22 months into a five year sentence for health care fraud Mr  Trump has touted the criminal justice overhaul as one of his major achievements  and he hosted a celebration this month at the White House to honor the legislation  

MELBOURNE  Australia   When vegan activists halted morning traffic on Monday at one of Australia s busiest intersections  Prime Minister Scott Morrison described their actions as  un Australian  The traffic disruption in Melbourne was part of a  Day of Action  protesting the consumption of animal products  during which activists also chained themselves to machinery at an abattoir and blockaded a gas chamber at a pig farm All the activists wanted  they said  was for the public to watch  Dominion    a two hour documentary narrated by the American actor Joaquin Phoenix and released last year that claims to expose the routine and inhumane practices of animal agriculture in Australia  We believe people have the right to see what s happening so that they can make decisions   said Chris Delforce  the film s writer and director and the head of an animal liberation group called Aussie Farms  which led the protests   They are funding cruelty   he said of Australians who buy animal products Mr  Delforce said that YouTube views of the film had  skyrocketed  since the protests on Monday  in which 40 people were arrested But the group s actions have also exposed a rift in Australian society between animal rights activists and farmers  who inject more than 60 billion Australian dollars  or  43 billion  into the country s economy per year  Farmers say their right to privacy and their ability to run their businesses have been undermined by the activists  who have posted a map online of farmers  addresses and contact details  trespassed on private property and even stolen animals  We saw it as an attack on Australian farming   said Tony Mahar  chief executive of the National Farmers  Federation  Mr  Mahar described the activists as  malicious  and  militant  extremists who had bullied law abiding citizens and used footage selectively in the film to further their aims The Australian government has sided with the farmers  promising to support any who want to bring a lawsuit over the protest actions In the United States  similar actions by animal rights activists have resulted in  ag gag laws  criminalizing covert investigations of farms  which activists say keep cruel practices concealed from the public  Experts say the Australian government is showing signs of moving in the same direction The protests around Australia have also raised questions about vigilante action and its consequences  One goat farm says it was forced to close by sustained bullying    Our staff and customers have been subjected to nearly four months of constant harassment  vile statements and threats from the abusive vegan activists   the Gippy Goat Cafe said in a Facebook post on Sunday   The courts have proven to be ineffectual  the enforcement agencies declined to prosecute to the full extent  so  to the thieves  trespassers and activists  you have won   Farmers and government officials say they are concerned about violence In February  activists circulated footage of a dairy farmer in the state of Western Australia firing his shotgun into the air while they were in a car filming his property  although the gun is pointed away from the car and the farmer has said he did not know they were there  Brendan Farrell  a cattle farmer who runs a group that donates hay to farmers affected by drought  said he worried that if the trespassing continued  someone might get killed   They re going to go on the wrong person s property somewhere in this country where someone has had a gutful   he said   The writing is on the wall   Mr  Delforce said he and other activists were willing to endure the risks to expose what he says is an opaque and inhumane system that he believes would sicken Australian consumers   Most Australians are opposed to animal cruelty   he said  In recent years  the vegan movement has also gained traction in Australia because of increased awareness of animal agriculture s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions  which cause  climate change  Approximately 11 percent of Australian adults eat a mostly or completely vegetarian diet  a proportion that has slowly but steadily risen  according to a 2016 study   A growing concern about animal welfare issues  as well as over environmental impacts  has led many people to change their diets to include fewer to no animal products   said Gyorgy Scrinis  a senior lecturer in food politics and policy at the University of Melbourne   This is no longer a fringe movement   he said Nonetheless  Australia continues to rank among the top meat eating countries in the world  and it is also a major exporter of animal products to countries like China  said Mr  Mahar of the National Farmers  Federation   Developing countries are wanting protein   he said  adding that  while there s a market and a strong market for animal production  then that s what the farmers will grow  While some ridiculed the protesters on Twitter  describing their actions as ineffective and pushing them further toward carnivorism  others said their minds had been opened  Today s vegan protest totally worked on me   Meshel Laurie  an Australian radio and television presenter  wrote on Facebook  Ms  Laurie said she had been  shamed  by the activists who had worked hard to get Australians to consider the issue   I was stuck in traffic in my car  late for work   she wrote   and all I could think was   They re right  I have got to stop eating meat   Want more Australia coverage and discussion  Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter  start your day with your local Morning Briefing

It was a paroxysm that inscribed new chapters in the annals of genocide and turned a spotlight on the failure of international peacekeepers to come anywhere close to living up to their name Twenty five years ago  on April 7  1994  the dominant Hutus of Rwanda turned with well planned violence on the Tutsi minority whom they held to be traitors  One hundred days later  when the killing finally stopped  the death toll stood at as many as one million  mostly Tutsis but also including some moderate Hutus who had opposed the bloodletting  For more stories about the experiences and costs of war  sign up for the weekly At War newsletter  The scale of the fatalities was shocking  but more was to come as the torrent of killings washed into the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo  igniting years of strife in Africa s Great Lakes region  And  along this bloodstained way  sexual violence became woven into the horrors of war  Women suffered untold rapes and gang rapes  accelerating the spread of AIDS  The offspring of these assaults were stigmatized as  children of the killers  ImageA Hutu man whose face was mutilated by the Hutu Interahamwe militia  who suspected him of

the same year in which Nelson Mandela was installed as South Africa s first black president   the very emblem of a continent s hope and triumph over adversity   Africa was also in the public eye for cataclysmic anarchy and violence But Africa had no monopoly on blame The United States  scarred by the killing and humiliation of its soldiers in Somalia during the Battle of Mogadishu a few months earlier  had no appetite to intervene  President Bill Clinton  who was in office as the killings unfolded half a world away  said years later during a visit to Rwanda   I don t think we could have ended the violence  but I think we could have cut it down  And I regret it  France  a significant player in French speaking Africa  has long faced charges that it supported the Hutu leadership before and even during the massacres  President Paul Kagame of Rwanda has called French soldiers  actors  in the genocide   a charge denied by the former French prime minister  douard Balladur  as  a self interested lie   But on Friday  President Emmanuel Macron of France ordered a two year government study of France s role in the Rwandan genocide ImagePaul Kagame  left  the leader of the Tutsi led

commander  the Canadian Maj  Gen  Romo Dallaire  to raid a Hutu arms cache that had been set aside for use in the atrocities  At the time  Kofi Annan  who later became the secretary general of the United Nations  was in charge of peacekeeping operations  Years later he said of the killing   All of us must bitterly regret that we did not do more to prevent it  History suggests  however  that Rwanda s lessons were an insufficient deterrent  Just a year after the Rwandan genocide  events far away in Europe   in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica   offered another alarming example of the toxic combination of genocidal urges and United Nations caution  8 000 Bosnian Muslims were murdered despite the presence of Dutch peacekeepers And  for its part  an African panel found many culprits for

inspecting the wreckage of a plane crash that killed the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi in April 1994 CreditCorinne Dufka ReutersThe ostensible trigger for the genocide came on April 6  1994  when an airplane carrying the country s Hutu president  Juvenal Habyarimana  and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighboring Burundi was shot down as it approached Kigali  Rwanda s capital  It has never been clearly established who brought the plane down or whether the genocide had been planned well in advance and needed only a spark to ignite its lethal tinder But within hours  the killing had started  Elite government forces  supported by a dreaded Hutu militia  the Interahamwe  which translates roughly as  those who work together   rounded up and executed Tutsi military and political leaders  Roadblocks were thrown up to filter out Rwandans whose official ID tagged them as Tutsis   a distinction introduced in the 1930s by the Belgian colonial authorities  Like their imperial German predecessors  Belgian officials had favored a Tutsi elite until the Hutu majority rose up in 1959 In rural areas  where Hutus and Tutsis had intermingled and sometimes intermarried  pervasive government propaganda in radio broadcasts and newspaper articles urged Hutus to take any weapon they could find   machetes  clubs   to kill or maim their neighbors  Foreigners working in the country were evacuated  but not their Rwandan staff  People were massacred in churches and homes  fields and roadside ditches  stadiums and checkpoints ImageA refugee camp in Tanzania in 1994  near the border

skulls of victims stacked in rows In 1994  the genocide also ruptured a cease fire in a civil war that had been raging since 1990 between government forces and insurgents from the Rwanda Patriotic Front  led by the Tutsi Mr  Kagame  who was to become Rwanda s president  The Patriotic Front launched a broad attack to take the capital  Kigali  in early July  The killing in Rwanda itself came to a halt  but not the ethnic recriminations  With the land ruined  crops untended and the population diminished by the killing of Tutsis and the subsequent flight of Hutu refugees into Congo  Rwanda entered a new  gradually prospering but ambiguous era  The following years raised questions about post genocide justice and the price Rwandans paid for well being and stability under Mr  Kagame ImageA

 including Mr  Clinton and Bill Gates  His cities boasted clean streets and low crime  His economy grew rapidly  Admirers compared him to Lee Kuan Yew  the Singaporean leader who fused authoritarian rule with prosperity And  as Mr  Kagame s regime grew ever more entrenched and ever more intolerant of dissent  he often got a pass   Western states that did nothing to prevent the massacres have treated Rwanda with kid gloves ever since  in part out of a frequently acknowledged sense of guilt   the author and journalist Michela Wrong wrote in The Guardian Mr  Kagame was limited to two terms in office  but like his regional peers in Uganda  Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo   and rulers much farther afield   he chafed at the restriction  A referendum in 2015 changed the Constitution  enabling him to remain in office until 2034  In elections in 2017 he won with a staggering 98 8 percent of the vote   Of his two major opponents  Diane Rwigara was disqualified  later to be jailed  and Victoire Ingabire was already in prison  ImageA Rwandan confronting an inmate in a session for detainees who were accused of crimes committed during the genocide CreditMarco Longari

found murdered in a luxury hotel in Johannesburg  although the government in Kigali has denied suggestions that it was behind the killing In 2014  as Rwanda marked the 20th anniversary of the genocide  an editorial in The New York Times hailed the country as  an island of order and relative prosperity in a poor and politically volatile region  But  listing a tally of restrictions on civil and political rights  including detentions and torture  disappearances and killings  the article concluded   Addressing the poisonous legacies of Rwanda s genocide is the only way to avert future tragedy

WASHINGTON   Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  resigned on Sunday after meeting with President Trump  ending a tumultuous tenure in charge of the border security agency that had made her the target of the president s criticism  I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside   Ms  Nielsen said in a resignation letter   I hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse  Ms  Nielsen had requested the meeting to plan  a way forward  at the border  in part thinking she could have a reasoned conversation with Mr  Trump about the role  according to three people familiar with the meeting  She came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president Mr  Trump in recent weeks had asked Ms  Nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers  which Ms  Nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate  While the 30 minute meeting was cordial  Mr  Trump was determined to ask for her resignation  After the meeting  she submitted it ImageListen to  The Daily   The Brief  Controversial Tenure of Kirstjen NielsenAs homeland security secretary  she enacted and publicly defended the family separation policy  In President Trump s eyes  she didn t go far enough transcriptBack to The Dailybars0 00 26 23 26 23transcriptListen to  The Daily   The Brief  Controversial Tenure of Kirstjen NielsenHosted by Michael Barbaro  produced by Rachel Quester  Jessica Cheung and Eric Krupke  and edited by Paige CowettAs homeland security secretary  she enacted and publicly defended the family separation policy  In President Trump s eyes  she didn t go far enough michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  The secretary of homeland security was forced out of her job  even after carrying out and defending President Trump s most restrictive immigration policies  Why that wasn t enough  It s Tuesday  April 9  Caitlin  describe what happened over the weekend caitlin dickersonSo on Sunday  Kirstjen Nielsen  who s the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security   she s the nation s highest ranking immigration officer   she goes to the White House for an unscheduled meeting with President Trump michael barbaroCaitlin Dickerson covers immigration for The Times caitlin dickersonAnd he  in recent weeks  has been very riled up publicly over an increasing number of people crossing the border  especially families who seek asylum who have legal protections that mean they have to be allowed into the country  So the secretary arrives at her meeting with a list of ideas for how to address this problem  and she thinks she and the president are going to come up with a way forward  But instead  a few hours later  the president sends a tweet announcing that she will be leaving her job archived recording 1Breaking news here on CNN  From the White House  the secretary of homeland security  Kirstjen Nielsen  has resigned archived recording 2President Trump made the announcement via Twitter archived recording 3In a tweet  the president said  quote   Secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position  and I would like to thank her for her service  archived recording 4So it appears that the president is swinging the revolving door yet again  trying to install new people in his administration to carry out his bidding michael barbaroThat sounds like a meeting that went very poorly for the secretary caitlin dickersonClearly  they were not able to come up with a solution that both could agree on michael barbaroAnd by tweeting her resignation  I think what we re politely suggesting is that he fired her caitlin dickersonFired her  Yes  exactly michael barbaroSo what is the history between President Trump and Secretary Nielsen caitlin dickersonSo Secretary Nielsen takes her job at the end of 2017  She s replacing her former boss  John Kelly  who went to be President Trump s chief of staff  And she takes on this role as basically the person who has to approve any new policy that s going to be introduced along the border  And it s at this period of time when  I think  the President is settling into his role  He s fired up about really coming up with some hard evidence that he can point to ahead of the midterm elections  for example  and say  look  I m keeping my campaign promises  and I m lowering immigration really dramatically  So right away  she s faced with aggressive ideas for how to prevent people from coming to the United States  and the first one is family separation michael barbaroAnd what do we know about how Nielsen responds to that very controversial policy when it is first introduced to her caitlin dickersonShe slow walks it  We reported in December of 2017 that a family separation policy had reached her desk for that final signature  and it took her four months to approve it  during which time she and President Trump clashed quite a bit  She had questions about the legality of it  She had questions about the practicality and how the public was going to respond  And she had just a lot of reservations about moving forward  But ultimately  she agreed  and the policy was introduced in a formal way in April archived recording 1Quit separating the kids  They re separating the children  Mr  President  don t you have kids  Don t you have kids  Mr  President archived recording 2I don t believe in this  This is not America  This is not our country  This is not what we should be doing archived recording  kirstjen nielsen This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border archived recordingShame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay at the other side of the border  fearing death  and allow the secretary to come here and lie archived recording  kirstjen nielsen Calling me a liar are fighting words  I m not a liar  We ve never had a policy for family separation  And let s be clear   if an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States  they would go to jail  and they would be separated from their family  This is not a controversial idea caitlin dickersonInternally  she s  if not resisting  she s certainly questioning and slowing down a lot of these policies  And then  externally  to the public  she s having to defend them and really look like the face of them  and that ends up being something that she does actually over and over again in her job michael barbaroAnd remind us what ends up happening to the family separation policy caitlin dickersonSo President Trump stopped the practice himself by signing an executive order archived recording  donald trump I consider it to be a very important executive order  It s about keeping families together caitlin dickersonBut it didn t matter  because a few days later  a federal judge intervened  deemed the practice unconstitutional  and he didn t stop there  He said that  archived recordingFamilies who have been separated as a result of the Trump administration s zero tolerance policy be reunited within 30 days  The order says kids under 5 must be back with their parents within 14 days from now caitlin dickersonSo sort of a resounding disavowal of this policy michael barbaroBy the legal system caitlin dickersonExactly  And so even though she d pushed back against it  Secretary Nielsen ends up taking the blame michael barbaroSo what s another example something that she expresses internal qualms about but then goes out and defends publicly caitlin dickersonSo one of the next policies to be introduced was an idea to limit asylum pretty significantly so that people could only apply if they showed up at a legal port of entry   whereas beforehand  people could and did very often show up anywhere along the border  present themselves to a border agency  ask for protection  and they were ushered into this legal process  The idea was to say  you can t do that anymore  You have to show up at a specific office  which is  of course  a pretty tall order for somebody who s coming from Central America with maybe a cell phone  maybe not  not a whole lot of resources  They don t always know exactly where these offices exist archived recording  kirstjen nielsen You do not need to break the law of this country by entering illegally to claim asylum  If you are seeking asylum  go to a port of entry caitlin dickersonBut as Nielsen pointed out to the president  it was very hard to justify  because immigration law explicitly says that you can request asylum regardless of where you enter michael barbaroSo again  Nielsen is saying inside the White House  hey  this might not be legal  I have reservations about it  But it nevertheless gets implemented  And as you ve said  she s the decider  So she signs off on it caitlin dickersonExactly  And it s important to point out that when Nielsen pushed back against President Trump  it wasn t a reflection of her being a liberal on immigration or having a more sympathetic view toward asylum seekers  She just happened to be the face of an entire agency full of people who work in immigration enforcement but who still made clear to her that there were going to be legal and logistical roadblocks to putting these ideas into place michael barbaroAnd what happens to that port of entry policy that would limit the number of locations that people can apply for asylum caitlin dickersonVery quickly after  it s blocked by federal courts  and it remains that way archived recordingA district court ruled that the ban conflicts with immigration law caitlin dickersonSo this was the executive branch trying to very clearly contradict laws that were approved by the legislative branch archived recordingAnd now the Supreme Court has refused to step in to unblock the ban michael barbaroSo her legal reservations are well founded  In other words  her advice to the president is correct  even if it s ignored caitlin dickersonThat s right  Her analysis is sound  because each time she is pushed back  she s been right  And these ideas have been blocked michael barbaroDo any of these policies that we re describing   family separation  limiting the locations at which people can seek asylum   do any of them succeed in curbing the flow of migrants  even for the very short period of time that they re in place before they are legally challenged caitlin dickersonThey don t archived recordingNew numbers show a 400 percent   4 0 0  that is   400 percent increase over just last year caitlin dickersonLast October  we saw a record number of families seek asylum in the United States  This is after family separation is introduced  And every month since then  the numbers have gotten even higher archived recordingC B P  officials say Border Patrol agents are on pace for apprehensions and encounters with more than 100 000 migrants in March michael barbaroSo not only are these policies being blocked in court  for the very short bit of time that they were ever in place  they re not doing their job of limiting the flow of migrants caitlin dickersonThey re not  The numbers keep going up  And some people would argue that maybe the policies weren t left in place for long enough to show any concrete outcome  and we can t know that for sure  But what we do know is that these policies that Nielsen was pushing back on  saying they re not going to work  didn t work  And the numbers have continued to rise michael barbaroAnd so what does that do to the president s relationship to Nielsen  She s in a sense being vindicated  but the problem she s there to solve is only getting worse caitlin dickersonShe s simultaneously sort of being vindicated if you look at it from a legal standpoint  but from a relationship standpoint  she s the face  in President Trump s eyes  of these failures archived recording 1Kirstjen Nielsen appears to be on shaky ground  That s according to a New York Times report  Nielsen told colleagues that she was close to resigning Wednesday after being berated by the president in front of the entire cabinet archived recording 2Nothing sets him off more than immigration  and I m told that meeting on Wednesday in the cabinet room was very heated  was incredibly heated  She spoke back to him about it  tried to defend herself caitlin dickersonSo it s in this context of the policies that are being introduced being blocked in the courts  the number of people crossing the border rising  and Trump s relationship with Secretary Nielsen falling apart that he comes up with his most aggressive idea yet archived recordingAnother day  another threat from President Trump  and today  he is threatening to shut down the southern border caitlin dickersonWhere he wants to completely seal the border  100 percent  Not let anybody come into the U S archived recording  donald trump And if they don t stop them  we re closing the border  We ll close it  and we ll keep it closed for a long time  I m not playing games michael barbaroAnd how exactly would that work caitlin dickersonWell  we shouldn t assume that the president had any particular policy in his mind when he tweeted that he wanted to seal the border  We can assume  though  that he wasn t talking about  for example  cargo moving back and forth or people with actual visas and permission to come into the United States  but really that he s talking about shutting down asylum and shutting down the ability of people who don t previously have permission to come into the United States  And the policy that we know has come closest to achieving that goal  one that s been kicking around in Washington for some months now  would be to get rid of asylum as we know it  It would no longer allow anyone to apply for asylum in the United States  And instead  people who needed that status or wanted that status would have to stay in their home country  similar to the way that Syrian refugees apply to come to the United States   apply from home  wait many months  go through lots of vetting and background checks  and then only if they re approved  they would be allowed to come here michael barbaroAnd I guess  what could be a more extreme version of limiting asylum than literally telling people  you cannot come to this country and apply for asylum caitlin dickersonI don t think there is a more extreme version  because I think this idea means eliminating asylum  It goes away michael barbaroAnd as best we understand it  what was Secretary Nielsen s response to this idea caitlin dickersonFrom what we know  it s been very similar to the way she reacted to family separation  to that idea to significantly limit asylum to the ports of entry  which is that this is going to be challenged by the courts immediately  It s going to be a huge lift to get a policy like this introduced  to work out the logistics  and all of it will be for naught  because it ll be enjoined by the courts  And it s that oppositional and resistant stance that she s in when she walks into the White House for her meeting with the president  It s unclear who threw up their hands first or second  or whether they both did it  but what we know is that the president did not leave her with an option  that he  at least  decided this isn t going to work  You re out  And she was by the end of that night  And so what that means is the homeland security secretary who oversaw some of the most controversial and aggressive immigration policies this country has ever seen   even she wasn t aggressive enough for President Trump  And so now she s gone  and he s looking for a replacement who will go even further michael barbaroWe ll be right back  So Caitlin  who is the president turning to to replace Nielsen as he looks for somebody to go further than she was willing to go caitlin dickersonHe s turning to Kevin McAleenan  who s currently the head of United States Customs and Border Protection  That s the agency that oversees both the customs officers who you meet at the airport when you ve gone on vacation abroad and then the Border Patrol  Those are the police  the boots on the ground along the border  And McAleenan is known as sort of a policy wonk  a really smart and reasonable guy who s willing to work with Democrats  and somebody who served under President Obama as well  He s got more than 10 years of experience at the agency  People know him as this reasonable guy  But when you dig a little bit deeper  McAleenan was inspired to get into homeland security work right after 9 11  And at C B P   especially most recently when he was overseeing this agency  it really became known as the sort of policy engine with him at the center of it coming up with ways to turn President Trump s ideas into actual policies that could be carried out  If D H S  is this agency run out of Washington that s overseeing all of this work  it was McAleenan s staff members that were actually physically taking children away from their parents  that were physically turning asylum seekers away at the border or telling them to go elsewhere or to wait in line  So now he s moving into this role where he s got even more power  but I think we can expect that he ll continue to do what he was doing before  which was take President Trump s ideas that are sort of extreme and that aren t necessarily encumbered by the immigration laws  norms  history  and he ll try to translate them into something that s practical and that can be introduced on the ground michael barbaroSo even though he might seem moderate at first glance  he s actually someone who the president trusts to put these more restrictive  maybe even extreme policies into practice  And he s been involved in doing that already  Now he s being elevated to do it at an even higher level caitlin dickersonExactly michael barbaroAnd I guess that all makes sense  If Nielsen is seen as too reluctant to put these policies into practice  then the president would turn to somebody who is willing to do that caitlin dickersonThat s right  who is willing to try  But remember that McAleenan is going to run up against the exact same legal framework and logistical challenges that anybody else in that role is going to michael barbaroRight  So if these policies are going to run into legal trouble in the courts  regardless of who is leading the agency  what does it matter  in the end  if the leader of the Department of Homeland Security is gung ho about the President s policies or is reluctantly saying yes  as Nielsen was caitlin dickersonI think you can look at that question a couple of different ways  On one hand  you re right that it s not going to make a huge difference who s sitting in the office at the head of the Homeland Security Department  because no matter what they introduce  if it violates the immigration law  they re going to wind up in court  But another way of looking at it is family separation only existed as an official sort of policy for what  45 days under zero tolerance  Not a very long period of time before it had to end  But still  I don t think that very many people are going to argue that family separation was a small thing or something that didn t affect very many people  I mean  I think it had a huge impact  So I do think that if you have a hawk running the Homeland Security Department  even when they re sort of encumbered by the existing legal framework  they can make some pretty big changes  even if  ultimately  those changes wind up in court  I think that Kevin McAleenan has two things going for him in President Trump s eyes  The first  like we said  is that he knows the policies and he knows the situation on the ground like the back of his hand  And the second thing is that he s shown a willingness to follow President Trump s lead  and so he may be the person who s best positioned to come up with the most legal ways to achieve President Trump s goals  And even if the policies that he comes up with don t remain in place in the long term  they might at least exist long enough to give President Trump something to point to and show his supporters when they ask  where are you on these campaign promises  Where are you on this idea of  if not sealing the border  significantly decreasing the number of immigrants coming to the United States michael barbaroSo even if these policies are ultimately blocked by the courts  it feels like it s important to this president to have someone at the Department of Homeland Security who is willing to try them  and that may be enough caitlin dickersonI think in President Trump s heart of hearts  right  he would hope that he would find not only somebody who is willing to try but somebody who is going to succeed  He wants aggressive policies to be instituted in the long term  But I think it s better in his mind than nothing to have somebody who s willing to try  And as we know  politically  it s better than nothing  because then the president can point to these policies that he tried to introduce  if only it wasn t for the courts who had blocked him  or if only it wasn t for Congress who blocked him michael barbaroRight  My intention was there  Somebody else is at fault for it not working caitlin dickersonExactly  He has at least an attempt to meet these campaign promises to point to when voters ask  why haven t you made a significant change  So I think that having a more aggressive leader in place who s more willing to introduce these policies  when they get stuck in the courts  it allows Trump to blame the courts rather than his own administration for getting in his way  He can say  look  I tried  but these judges are blocking me  whereas it wasn t just the judges blocking him with Secretary Nielsen  It was her  too michael barbaroIf Congress is not going to change the law  and I think the assumption is that they are not going to do that anytime soon when it comes to basic immigration law  is the president right to suggest that the current system is broken  and the only way to fix it is to test these new ideas  even if they push the boundaries of the law caitlin dickersonI would say yes to the first part of your question  Most people agree that the system is broken  But when it comes to fixing the problem  what are you trying to fix  In the president s mind  the problem is the vast number of people coming here to seek asylum  His idea of a fix would decrease that number  But other people see the problem as not that people are coming here to seek asylum at all but the ways that we re dealing with them  We don t have space to place people physically in custody when they enter  We don t have judges to hear their cases for years and years  So if you see that as the problem  then  michael barbaroHe s not really addressing those caitlin dickersonHe s not addressing those problems  and I think that s because a lot of people who agree with the president are concerned that if we come up with better systems for processing asylum seekers   we make it more organized and efficient and  in some cases  comfortable   that all that will do is encourage more and more people to come  And again  if the numbers themselves are what you see as the problem  then making the system better only makes it worse michael barbaroCaitlin  what does all of this tell us about where President Trump plans to go on immigration caitlin dickersonI think it shows that President Trump is going to continue full steam ahead to achieve his immigration goals and that if there are people  even informed career officials  who want to stand in the way of that  they re going to be pushed out  because he s very committed to the goal of limiting the number of people who come to the border  regardless of the many legal challenges he s already faced  those that are sure to come  the public reaction  all these other things notwithstanding  We re not seeing any signs of slowing down  I think this week is actually an indicator of a ramping up of these goals michael barbaroIn other words  the gloves are coming off  even though  in a lot of people s minds  they thought the gloves were already off caitlin dickersonThat s right  It s like another set of gloves are coming off michael barbaroCaitlin  thank you very much caitlin dickersonThank you michael barbaroOn Monday  The Times reported that President Trump plans to push out more officials from the Department of Homeland Security  including the department s general counsel and the director of U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  as he seeks to carry out his harder line approach to immigration  A few hours later  in the latest legal setback to that approach  a federal judge blocked a Trump administration policy that required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico rather than in the U S  while their cases made their way through U S  immigration court  The judge found that the policy violated federal law  Here s what else you need to know today archived recording  mike pompeo Today  the United States is continuing to build its maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime  I am announcing our intent to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  including its Quds Force  as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act michael barbaroOn Monday  the Trump administration said that it was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization  the first time that the U S  has classified part of any country s government as such a threat archived recording  mike pompeo We re doing it because the Iranian regime s use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government michael barbaroThe move was debated at the highest levels of the administration  with top officials at the Defense Department and the C I A  opposing the designation  arguing it could justify Iranian attacks against the U S  and its allies  But the president s national security adviser  John Bolton  and his secretary of state  Mike Pompeo  advocated for the decision  arguing the designation would further isolate Iran by discouraging businesses from working with its military archived recording  mike pompeo This historic step will deprive the world s leading state sponsor of

expressed anger at a rise in migrants at the southwestern border  withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a  tougher  direction Mr  Trump

secretary through Wednesday  in order  to assist with an orderly transition   The abruptness was unusual because the Department of Homeland Security currently does not have a deputy secretary  who would normally take the reins The president said in a tweet that Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  would take over as the acting replacement for Ms  Nielsen  who became the sixth secretary to lead the agency in late 2017  But by law  the under secretary for management  Claire Grady  who is currently serving as acting deputy secretary  is next in line to be acting secretary  The White House will have to fire her to make Mr  McAleenan acting secretary  people familiar with the transition said  Ms  Grady has told colleagues that she has no intention of resigning to make way for Mr  McAleenan  Read about Kevin McAleenan  the new acting homeland security secretary  Among the possible replacements for Ms  Nielsen in the long term is Ken Cuccinelli  the

said Ms  Nielsen had been pressured by Mr  Trump to be more aggressive in stemming the influx of migrant crossings at the border  people familiar with their discussions in recent months said Her entire time in the job was spent batting back suspicion from the president  even as he told people he liked how she performed on television and enjoyed dealing with her personally  He initially was

home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country  including doing things that were clearly illegal  such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum  She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws  court settlements and international obligations Those responses only infuriated Mr  Trump further  The president s fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as Ms  Nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained In a cabinet meeting surrounded by her peers  Mr  Trump castigated her repeatedly  leading her to draft a resignation letter and to tell colleagues that there was no reason for her to lead the department any longer  By the end of the week  she had reconsidered and remained in her position  becoming an increasingly fierce supporter of his policies  including the family separations Mr  Trump and Stephen Miller  the president s top immigration adviser  have privately but regularly complained about Ms  Nielsen  Lou Dobbs  a Fox News host who is one of the president s favorite sounding boards  has also encouraged Mr  Trump s negative views of her handling of the migrant crisis Ms  Nielsen lost a powerful protector when Mr  Kelly  her mentor  left his job as White House chief of staff at the beginning of the year  Mr  Kelly was the Trump administration s first homeland security secretary and lobbied for Ms  Nielsen to replace him Multiple White House officials said she had grown deeply paranoid in recent months  after numerous stories about her job being on the line  She also had supported the Immigration and Customs Enforcement nominee Mr  Trump withdrew  Ronald D  Vitiello  and her support for him was described as problematic for her with the president  Mr  Trump felt Mr  Vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president threatened again to do in a tweet on Sunday night The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other In early 2019  as the number of migrant families from Central American countries surged  the president s fury at Ms  Nielsen did  too  He repeatedly demanded that she cut off foreign aid to Central American countries even though the funding was the responsibility of the State Department  She repeatedly deflected his demands One day after Ms  Nielsen traveled to Honduras to sign a regional compact with officials from Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  Mr  Trump cut State Department funding for the countries  And in recent days  the president made public moves to undercut her authority  leaking news that he might nominate an  immigration czar  to assume oversight of the issue at the heart of Ms  Nielsen s department Still  Ms  Nielsen embraced the president s  crisis  language as apprehensions of migrants at the border shot up to thousands per day  On Friday  Mr  Trump traveled with Ms  Nielsen and Mr  McAleenan to Calexico  Calif   to highlight the issue While the number of border crossings is not as high as in the early 2000s  the demographic of migrants has shifted largely from individual Mexicans looking for jobs   who could easily be deported   to Central American families  overwhelming detention facilities and prompting mass releases of migrants into cities along the border Ms  Nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100 000 migrants in March But despite the trip and several stories about how much better her relationship with Mr  Trump was  Ms  Nielsen never learned how to manage him  people familiar with their discussions said  He often felt lectured to by Ms  Nielsen  the people familiar with the discussions said ImageMs  Nielsen lost a powerful protector when John F  Kelly  her mentor and the Trump

not an admirer of Ms  Nielsen  several administration officials said  That came to a head recently as Mr  Kushner had inserted himself into immigration discussions While Mr  Trump often blamed Ms  Nielsen for the surge in migrant crossings  she will be remembered for leading the department during the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy along the southwestern border  which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families An intense backlash ensued  and the Department of Homeland Security was unprepared to deal with separating nearly 3 000 children from their parents  Hampered by misstep after misstep  Kirstjen Nielsen s tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start   said Representative Bennie Thompson  a Mississippi Democrat and the chairman of the House s committee on Homeland Security   It is clearer now than ever that the Trump administration s border security and immigration policies   that she enacted and helped craft   have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border  Mr  Trump eventually moved to halt the family separations  though the government struggled in some cases to reunite those it had already separated By naming Mr  McAleenan acting secretary  Mr  Trump is installing another veteran of previous administrations  not a loyal foot soldier of Mr  Trump s campaign Married to a Salvadoran immigrant  Mr  McAleenan is a lawyer who wrote an honors thesis at Amherst College on marriage equality and applied at the F B I  after the Sept  11 attacks Described by colleagues as a savvy political operator  Mr  McAleenan worked cooperatively with Obama administration officials but later embraced Mr  Trump s agenda  which included unshackling Border Patrol agents from restrictions that the previous administration had imposed Mr  McAleenan was also one of three Department of Homeland Security officials who had urged Ms  Nielsen to sign the memo authorizing the routine separation of migrant families at the border The department  which has a budget of more than  40 billion and more than 240 000 employees  is an amalgam of 22 government agencies that was created after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  It is responsible for everything from protecting the nation from cyberattacks to responding to natural disasters At 46  Ms  Nielsen was the youngest person to lead the sprawling department  and an unlikely choice for the job In the months immediately after the Sept  11 attacks  she helped set up the Transportation Security Administration  now an agency within the department  She also worked as a special assistant to President George W  Bush on natural disaster response while serving on the White House Homeland Security Council When Mr  Trump moved Mr  Kelly to the White House in July 2017  Ms  Nielsen moved with him  As the principal deputy chief of staff  she enforced Mr  Kelly s attempts to regulate access to Mr  Trump in the Oval Office  including the president s schedule   irritating White House staff members  who complained she was uncompromising Mr  Kelly later backed Ms  Nielsen to succeed him at the Homeland Security Department  though she was criticized as too inexperienced for the job by Democrats and anti immigration groups  Mr  Trump  however  said she was  ready on Day 1   There will be no on the job training for Kirstjen   Mr  Trump said in October 2017  announcing her nomination for the post But by the following spring  Ms  Nielsen was telling associates she was miserable in the job  

PARIS   The United States has revoked the visa of the International Criminal Court s chief prosecutor because of her attempts to investigate allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan  including any that may have been committed by American forces The visa revocation   confirmed on Friday by the office of the chief prosecutor  Fatou Bensouda  and the State Department in Washington   was assailed by rights advocates as unprecedented interference by the United States into the workings of the court  established nearly two decades ago to prosecute war crimes  genocide and crimes against humanity Ms  Bensouda  a Gambian lawyer for the court  which is based in The Hague  formally requested an investigation more than a year ago into war crimes in Afghanistan  The inquiry would mostly focus on large scale crimes against civilians attributed to the Taliban and Afghan government forces But it would also examine alleged C I A  and American military abuse in detention centers in Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004  and at sites in Poland  Lithuania and Romania  putting the court directly at odds with the United States An I C C  panel of judges has yet to authorize whether the prosecutor can open the criminal investigation The revocation of Ms  Bensouda s visa came less than a month after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo vowed to revoke visas for those connected with court investigations involving American citizens The United States is not a member state of the I C C  and does not recognize the court s authority to prosecute Americans In the past  though  the United States has cooperated with the court on other investigations  and Washington played a central role in establishing international criminal law at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders and in the creation of modern tribunals  The U S A  government should actively invite the prosecutor to come and meet  not ban her from traveling   Amnesty International s Center for International Justice said on Twitter   Cooperation with the I C C  is in the U S A  s interests   to share relevant information and show there is nothing to hide  Mr  Pompeo  in a March news briefing in Washington  said investigators  should not assume that you will still have or will get a visa  or that you will be permitted to enter the United States  if they are part of a I C C  investigation  He also said the United States was prepared to take further action  These visa restrictions will not be the end of our efforts   Mr  Pompeo said at the time   We are prepared to take additional steps  including economic sanctions if the I C C  does not change its course  At the time of Mr  Pompeo s announcement  Human Rights Watch called the announcement of visa bans an effort to  bully the court and deter scrutiny of U S  conduct  Mr  Pompeo s remarks also drew condemnation from I C C  member states  with a group of 22 foreign ministers expressing their concerns over the move last month The decision to revoke Ms  Bensouda s visa is not expected to affect her access to the United Nations headquarters in New York  which is protected by an agreement between the United States and the global body She periodically travels to the United Nations to brief the Security Council on investigations into crimes in Libya and the Darfur region of Sudan  which were referred to the court by the council It will also not affect her ability to carry out her duties at the I C C  or to move forward with a potential investigation  Ms  Bensouda has said Asked on Friday about the visa decision by the Americans  a United Nations spokesman  Stphane Dujarric  reiterated its diplomatic agreement with the United States  We very much trust the United States government will continue to comply with its obligations under the agreement   Mr  Dujarric said   Our assumption is that the prosecutor  when she needs to come to the United Nations  will be afforded a visa for work done at the United Nations  Ms  Bensouda is the only known court official targeted by Washington so far  but the issue raises the question of whether  if the Afghanistan investigation moves ahead  other officials would be barred from the United States Last week  the president of the court  Judge Chile Eboe Osuji  was able to deliver a speech in Washington without any issues  But the United States has made it clear that it would not cooperate in any potential Afghanistan investigation The United States is not the first country to have barred senior court officials  A former I C C  prosecutor and staff members were effectively denied entry to Sudan by its ruler  Omar Hassan al Bashir  indicted on charges of genocide and other crimes  and Ms  Bensouda and her team were denied entry to Burundi to investigate charges against its president In recent years the I C C  has disappointed some of its backers  who have observed its slow pace  inefficiencies and internal squabbles   and how many member governments only offer it halfhearted support  and fail to carry out court ordered arrest warrants  Some of those supporters saw the Trump administration s action as another blow to the body  albeit a double edged one  This move hurts the U S  s reputation far more than it hinders the I C C  prosecutor   said Stephen Rapp  a former American ambassador for war crimes issues who also served as an international prosecutor  In the past we have always been on the side of prosecutorial and judicial independence  and against authoritarian regimes that demand that justice bend to political power   he said  By revoking the visa  he said   we act like we have something to hide and in the process put ourselves on the same side as the world s thugs and dictators   

WASHINGTON   In recent months  Kirstjen Nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  had become a regular presence eating dinner at the Trump International Hotel  She had been heckled and booed when dining out after becoming the face of some of President Trump s most hard line immigration policies  like family separations  and her affinity for the hotel  a gathering place for the president s supporters  seemed like a sign that she felt safer on the inside But her status inside the White House  where she was subject to dressing downs from Mr  Trump during cabinet meetings and constant criticism by the president  was not much more secure So when Ms  Nielsen went to the White House on Sunday night to meet with the president to discuss some grievances  she was also prepared to avoid a messy end by letting Mr  Trump  who is known for not personally firing people  off the hook  After Mr  Trump made it clear that he was looking for a change  Ms  Nielsen told him she would resign  ridding him of a cabinet secretary who had long disappointed him Ms  Nielsen s departure  announced Sunday night  was abrupt but hardly unforeseen  the latest in a long and growing conga line of senior officials who have left the administration unceremoniously because of their own frustrations with the president  or because of the president s obvious disappointment in them  Usually  it is both Mr  Trump has ripped into Ms  Nielsen  holding her personally responsible for the uptick in crossings at the southwestern border  And Ms  Nielsen wanted to tell Mr  Trump that she was upset not to have been notified beforehand about his sudden withdrawal of Ron Vitiello  the nominee to serve as Immigration and Customs Enforcement director  and that she was frustrated at being pulled from security meetings in Europe last week and ordered to appear by the president s side on a trip to the border  according to someone close to Ms  Nielsen The end for Ms  Nielsen was something that has become familiar in the Trump administration  a high ranking official like Jeff Sessions  the former attorney general  or Rex Tillerson  the former secretary of state  leaving with a reputation in need of rehabilitation  Normally  people just resign   said Ronald A  Klain  who served as chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr   The president sends word through an intermediary that he s unhappy  and you resign  The president says something nice about them and then they leave  But here  quitting isn t good enough  Some exits have been more humiliating than others  Since the departure of Mr  Tillerson  Mr  Trump has referred to him as  dumb as a rock  and  lazy as hell   After calling the departure of his defense secretary  Jim Mattis  a  retirement  and praising his service  Mr  Trump turned on him once he understood that the resignation was an affront to him   What s he done for me   Mr  Trump said of Mr  Mattis   How had he done in Afghanistan  Not too good  After years of haranguing Mr  Sessions in public and in private  Mr  Trump sent John F  Kelly  his former chief of staff  to demand his resignation in November  and he has not let up on him since he left office  In a speech in front of the Conservative Political Action Conference last month  Mr  Trump mimicked Mr  Sessions s southern accent while discussing his decision to recuse himself from the special counsel s investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 campaign ImageRex Tillerson  left  the former secretary of state  and Jeff Sessions  the former attorney general  were both forced out of their positions in the Trump administration CreditStephen Crowley The New York TimesMr  Kelly later suffered his own ignoble end  After he and Mr  Trump ironed out a departure plan at the end of last year  Mr  Kelly planned to make his own announcement at a senior staff dinner at the White House  But the president chose to break the news first  telling reporters that Mr  Kelly would be departing at the end of December Although all involved tried to put the best face on the Sunday meeting between Mr  Trump and Ms  Nielsen   someone familiar with it said the president had even asked her if she would want to return in another position   the two competed afterward for how to spin its contents Within minutes of the meeting s end  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter that Ms  Nielsen was  leaving her position   making it sound as if she was the latest cabinet secretary he had ousted online  Ms  Nielsen then posted her resignation letter on Twitter  notably leaving out any mention or praise for Mr  Trump Mr  Trump has yet to criticize her publicly since  But Ms  Nielsen has already absorbed more than her share of criticism for her role in implementing the president s policies Immigration and civil rights groups have been pressuring Fortune 500 companies to blacklist former Trump officials like Ms  Nielsen  who have promoted his immigration policies  writing that they  should not be allowed to seek refuge in your boardrooms or corner offices   Many other former administration officials have not experienced the post White House career bump that has become part of the payoff for putting in grueling hours on government salaries With a few exceptions  like the smooth send off for Nikki R  Haley  the former ambassador to the United Nations  and a glowing farewell to Linda McMahon  the former administrator of the Small Business Administration  Mr  Trump s top aides often find themselves damaged by their former boss in real time  or on delay Even those who have managed to stay in Mr  Trump s favor  like Mike Pompeo  the secretary of state  have a sense of gallows humor about what might ultimately befall them  I ll be there until he tweets me out of the office   Mr  Pompeo recently joked at an event in his home state of Kansas  when asked about his future in politics For her part  Ms  Nielsen appears to be intent on trying to minimize the damage to her reputation  with surrogates out defending her record  The so called immigration hard liners have flailed about since the beginning of the administration  giving bad advice to the president and misdirecting resources toward the wrong solutions to the wrong problems   said Thad Bingel  who was a senior homeland security official in the Bush administration and served as an aide to Ms  Nielsen during her Senate confirmation  They apparently don t want anyone like a Secretary Nielsen or Secretary Kelly  who deals in reality  to tell them or the president any of this   

WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Friday that he withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a  tougher  direction  a surprise decision before the president s trip to the southwestern border Ronald D  Vitiello  who was nominated last summer by Mr  Trump to run ICE  the agency that arrests  detains and deports people who are in the United States illegally  has been serving as the agency s acting director since last June  He had planned to accompany the president on his trip to California  but was left behind  Ron s a good man  but we re going in a tougher direction   Mr  Trump said to reporters as he left the White House en route to Calexico  Calif Mr  Vitiello s nomination had been awaiting approval by a second Senate committee and confirmation by the full chamber  In an email to ICE employees on Friday afternoon  he signaled that he planned to remain at the immigration agency  No replacement has yet been named  While I will not become the permanent director of ICE  I look forward to working alongside you in serving the American public with integrity  courage and excellence   Mr  Vitiello said in the email  which was read to The New York Times by an ICE employee on the condition of anonymity One person familiar with the president s thinking said that Mr  Trump believed that Mr  Vitiello did not favor closing the border  as the president had proposed before backing off that threat this week Another person said that Stephen Miller  the president s chief policy adviser and a supporter of curtailing legal and illegal immigration  did not support Mr  Vitiello s nomination  The two people familiar with the president s thinking both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the internal White House decisions The president s abrupt decision came at a time when his administration considers the United States border with Mexico to be in crisis because of the flow of people trying to get into the country  making it a priority to have a confirmed appointee leading the agency to carry out the administration s policies  But some senators  including Republicans  had concerns that Mr  Vitiello was not the right person for this job Mr  Trump  who has continued to push for stronger deportation rules  had also expressed concern about whether a career civil servant  like Mr  Vitiello  would be up to the task  ICE has been led by acting directors since January 2017 Mr  Vitiello had recently been more outspoken about overflowing immigration facilities and strapped resources at the border  But that did little to assuage the National ICE Council  a union representing agency employees  which in February told the Senate it opposed Mr  Vitiello s nomination over what was described as his controversial posts on social media and his treatment of some ICE agents The request to withdraw Mr  Vitiello s nomination surprised officials on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  Even some Department of Homeland Security officials questioned whether it was sent in error  

WASHINGTON   They huddle together on the House floor  conferring over what to do on a tough vote  They exchange group texts to consult on legislation and plan for the  increasingly rare  after work drink  often with Bitmojis that capture their mood that day  They are frequently spotted walking together on Capitol Hill  huddled in what seems like an endless inside joke Among the 67 new Democrats in Congress  10 served in the military or intelligence agencies  which has shaped a tight and quite visible bond  All defeated Republicans in arduous races last year  many in the 31 districts carried by President Trump in the 2016 presidential election Their backgrounds in the military  where nonpartisanship is key  have also made them among the most moderate members of a caucus in which there is increasing pressure to slide firmly to the left on various policy issues  I don t know how I would be here without them   said Representative Chrissy Houlahan  Democrat of Pennsylvania and a former Air Force officer   Each of us has broken with the party for different reasons   she said  adding   It s nice to have a smaller group to talk to about what this all means  Often  they are among a handful of Democrats to vote with Republicans on politically charged  gotcha  measures that the majority had routinely rejected out of hand  in one crucial case helping pass a gun bill targeting undocumented immigrants Knowing that they were critical to delivering the House back to their party  the veterans seem unbowed  for now  to pressures from some Democrats to adhere to party lines  Many of them did not back Nancy Pelosi for House speaker  and she has repeatedly begged Democrats not to vote with Republicans on what she views as essentially nuisance measures  The speaker s office is inordinately powerful  and we have to work really hard to make this body egalitarian   said Representative Max Rose  Democrat of New York  who was a platoon leader in Afghanistan   The freshmen want to reduce seniority power  and the vets are leading that effort  Most had never run for office before  but said they were inspired by a sense of chaos in government and an erosion of faith in public institutions  While their transitions have been at times tense   the military notion of mission over ego as well as a preference for punctual meetings and clear lines of authority do not always translate well on Capitol Hill   these lawmakers are a cornerstone of the Democratic Party s strategy to maintain the House in 2020 ImageAmong the 67 new Democrats in Congress  10 served in the military or intelligence agencies CreditSarah Silbiger The New York Times There s no question those veterans and service members were central to our work to build a Democratic majority   said Cole Leiter  a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee   and their relentless focus on service has better prepared this Democratic caucus to work for their constituents  These members spent quite a bit of time getting to know one another during the campaign  largely through the Serve America PAC started by Representative Seth Moulton  Democrat of Massachusetts  who was among the first troops in Baghdad in 2003  When I ran in 2014 against a nine term incumbent  there was no member of Congress who would even speak with me   Mr  Moulton said   So I wanted to create that team for the amazing candidates who were running this time  What was important was building these relationships  They could call or text me at all hours of the night if they needed advice or something  We set up a Slack channel so that we could communicate more as a group  Once in Washington  the group immediately gravitated toward one another on bills and other legislative matters   It s the trust factor   said Elissa Slotkin  Democrat of Michigan and a former C I A  analyst who served three tours in Iraq   If Max Rose or Elaine Luria comes to me and says   I m doing this bill  Do you want to do it   they aren t going to twist the issue and play it for their own advantages   she said  referring to freshman veterans   We made the choice to focus on Congress and made Congress like a mission  During the government shutdown  Ms  Slotkin and Ms  Houlahan wrote a measure to protect federal workers in subsequent impasses  Representative Mikie Sherrill  Democrat of New Jersey and a former Navy helicopter pilot  seized on news coverage about problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs serving women and quickly got several veterans to sign on to a letter demanding the department secretary  Robert L  Wilkie  fix the system  The group has helped revive discussions about asserting the role of Congress in war authorization Veterans are also prone to seeking one another out across the aisle  Mr  Moulton  who served in the Marines  and Representative Brian Mast  a veteran and Republican from Florida  worked to bring together both parties on a conservation bill that pleased environmentalists and commercial fishermen alike They can often be seen sliding across the aisle to sit with Republican veterans on the House floor  like Representatives Jim Baird of Indiana and Will Hurd of Texas   We have a bias toward action because we all served in the trenches in an organization that is apolitical   Mr  Hurd said   We knew each other s ethos  The women  who have called themselves  the badass women   exchange group text messages and make special efforts to get together for dinner and talk during the week  Representative Abigail Spanberger  Democrat of Virginia and a former C I A  operations officer  had recently finished a tough town hall style meeting   among the more taxing  if vital  undertakings of lawmakers   and turned to the group for a lift   She was having a down moment   Ms  Slotkin said   So there was a text chain  and we all told her   You re awesome    and other messages of buoyancy  she said Ms  Spanberger said they also tried to keep a light tone on their group texts  endlessly razzing   about Ms  Sherrill s eternal obsession with the Gateway tunnel project in her home state  Mr  Rose s incandescent speeches on the floor  the way their hair looked in a photograph accompanying this article  They share funny travel anecdotes from the road and videos of their children singing   We had all come from places with really stressful environments   Ms  Spanberger said   so as stressful as the campaigns were  we had a perspective  In the difficult transition to Washington  they are often one another s lifeboat   It s just implicit that you have each other s back   said Representative Jason Crow  Democrat of Colorado who served as an Army captain   That s rare in this town   

BRUSSELS   With less than 48 hours before Britain s scheduled departure  the European Union extended the exit deadline early Thursday until the end of October  avoiding a devastating cliff edge divorce but settling none of the issues that have plunged British politics into chaos  dysfunction and recrimination On another difficult night for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain  European leaders scrapped her proposal for a postponement until June 30  concluding that such a short deadline was unrealistic for the departure known as Brexit  They agreed  however  to review the arrangement at the end of June to prevent British disruption to the bloc while the nation remains in Europe s departure lounge Although the intense pressure of recent weeks may abate for now  the path ahead still resembles a minefield  dotted with explosive issues like a possible attempt to topple Mrs  May  a general election or a second Brexit referendum   or some combination of the three  Most immediately  Mrs  May is likely to face calls to step down  and potential successors are already trying to raise money and advertise their credentials At a news conference  Donald Tusk  the president of the European Council  said that the two sides had agreed to what he called  a flexible extension  until Oct  31  adding that this provided an  additional six months for the U K  to find the best possible solution   In essence  the bloc agreed to kick the Brexit can down the road for another six months Mr  Tusk said that the Oct  31 date was  a bit shorter than I expected   but said that the extension should be enough to complete Brexit if London showed  good will   He told the British   Please do not waste this time  ImageFrom left  European Council President Donald Tusk  Prime Minister Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg  Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at the start of a special summit meeting on Brexit at the European Council in Brussels on Wednesday CreditOlivier Hoslet EPA  via ShutterstockBut he did not rule out another extension  The June review  he said  was not for negotiation  but only to inform member states about the state of play in Britain European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker dismissed worries that Britain would interfere in the work of the bloc  saying that Britain s being  a difficult partner  was  nothing new  Mrs  May said she knew that there was  huge frustration  at home that she had needed to request the extension  She appealed to lawmakers to support a Brexit agreement  adding that  the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear  But she can expect fierce criticism later on Thursday from her own lawmakers  many of whom opposed delaying Brexit to June  let alone October  Reminded of statements that she would not contemplate remaining in the bloc beyond June  Mrs  May said that the agreement allowed Britain to leave by then if Parliament approved a deal The extension means that Britain will almost certainly have to hold elections for the European Parliament on May 23  something Mrs  May once argued would be absurd  almost three years after Britons voted for withdrawal  That prospect seems certain to anger hard line Brexit supporters ImageEuropean leaders stressed that Britain s Parliament would still have to pass the withdrawal agreement before there could be any discussions about the future relationship  even if the country left without an agreement first CreditDan Kitwood Getty ImagesPresident Emmanuel Macron of France called the October date  the best compromise  to maintain European unity  It s now  up to Britons to be clear with themselves and their people   he said  about whether they want to participate in the European Parliament elections next month even though they would have to abandon the legislature a few months later This was not the first time Mrs  May had requested a postponement  Originally  she had promised Britons that she would strike a deal by March 29  only to acknowledge last month that the goal was impossible  Having missed that deadline  Mrs  May was a supplicant to the 27 other leaders of the bloc  who made their latest decision after she had left the room Having lost control of the process in Brussels  Mrs  May will return to a pitched battle with pro Brexit Conservative lawmakers  including a significant number who now want her out and seem willing to risk an economically damaging departure without an agreement Some have been arguing that Britain should use an extension to sabotage European Union business from the inside  While Mrs  May has promised not to do so  her position is so shaky that thoughts are turning to how a successor might behave  particularly a pro Brexit hard liner like Boris Johnson  the former foreign secretary At the same time  if Britain s Parliament should finally pass the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the bloc  then Brexit would take place on the first of the next month ImageThe president of the European Council  Donald Tusk  center left  and the president of the European Commission  Jean Claude Juncker  have suggested a lengthy extension to the Brexit deadline CreditEmmanuel Dunand Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesEuropean nations had been divided between those who wanted a shorter extension  to keep up pressure on Britain to resolve Brexit  and those who wanted to give it the time and space to reach a sensible conclusion On Wednesday it was Mr  Macron who took the toughest line  arguing that Britain needed to propose a credible plan to resolve the crisis On his insistence  plans to give Britain as much as another year were scrapped in favor of a shorter delay  He had argued that a long extension risked disrupting the bloc s more important work and that Britain s political confusion could prove contagious But there was never any question of slamming the door instantly on Britain and triggering a disruptive  no deal  Brexit that would have occurred Friday night in the absence of an extension  And Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany stressed the need for Britain to have time to manage an orderly process  which would allow for a good relationship between the two sides after the divorce The October deadline was therefore a compromise  chosen in part because it would keep Britain outside the new European Commission  which will be formed in the fall ImageTrucks queued last month on the main road into the Port of Dover  southern England  because of a work slowdown by French customs officers  The bottleneck illustrated the possible effect of a no deal Brexit on traffic across the English Channel CreditGareth Fuller Press Association  via Associated PressSo far  the British Parliament has shown little indication that it will ever approve the withdrawal deal that Mrs  May negotiated with the European Union  That is a legally binding treaty that would resolve technical issues  like the government s outstanding financial commitments to the bloc  and keep Britain inside its economic structures until at least December 2020 After that point  Mrs  May wants to detach Britain from Europe s customs union and single market  and to take control of immigration from the Continent That formula has been rejected three times in Parliament and  despite attempts to broker an accord with the opposition Labour Party  prospects for its passage still look low More talks between the parties were scheduled for Thursday  but Labour has complained that Mrs  May has shown no sign of budging from her basic goal of taking Britain out of a customs union with the bloc Were she to accept staying in a customs union  which is Labour s bedrock position  that would preclude Britain from forging trade deals on its own  defeating  in the minds of pro Brexit lawmakers  the entire purpose of Brexit  Such a step would risk cabinet resignations and enrage the party faithful In the coming weeks there may be more votes in Parliament to gauge opinion on various approaches to Brexit  but the possibility of assembling a sustainable majority for any one blueprint still seems remote Conservative Brexit supporters are hoping they can replace Mrs  May with a hard liner who could reopen the withdrawal agreement painfully negotiated over months with the European Union But European officials emphasize that the withdrawal agreement  including a provision known as the Irish backstop  designed to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland  will not change  If Britain wants a managed Brexit  it must pass the withdrawal agreement first  they say  Only then can the European Union begin negotiations on a future relationship

In the opulent halls of the Emirates Palace hotel  a seat of power in Abu Dhabi where 114 domes decorate the vast rooftop  a delegation of about a dozen Chinese diplomats lobbied foreign ministers of the Muslim world last month China has been fighting criticism that it has detained as many as one million members of Muslim ethnic minorities in indoctrination camps in its western Xinjiang region  But at the two day conclave in early March  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation   a group of 57 nations that has been a vocal defender of the Rohingyas and Palestinians   handed Beijing a significant victory In a resolution on protecting the rights of Muslim minorities around the world  the group praised China for  providing care to its Muslim citizens  Its vast system of detention without trial has drawn condemnation from the State Department and Congress  but no sanctions  and only scattered criticism in Europe and at the United Nations  That is still more of a response than in the Muslim world  where nations   including Pakistan  Indonesia and other recipients of big Chinese loans   have overlooked China s abuses against ethnic Uighurs  Kazakhs and others And as Muslim countries fall in line  the West is under less pressure to take action The major deterrent to antagonizing Beijing is its blunt economic power In Washington  President Trump s trade talks hang in the balance  China is building ports  railways and roads in countries rich and poor across Asia  Europe and Africa in its global trillion dollar infrastructure push  the Belt and Road Initiative ImageA satellite image taken over Hotan  Xinjiang  in August showed an indoctrination camp  center  that had expanded CreditPlanet Labs Inc Some of the recipients are moderate Muslim countries  like Turkey  Pakistan  Indonesia and Malaysia  which human rights advocates had hoped would counter conservative Arab states  lack of concern for Muslim minorities Even New Zealand s Prime Minister  Jacinda Ardern  who forcefully condemned violence against Muslims after mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last month  focused on promoting trade with China during a visit to Beijing last week She raised the treatment of the Uighurs with China s top leaders only in private  and told reporters afterward   You can t do much more than that  Confident at Home and AbroadWhen the West imposed sanctions on China for the massacre of pro democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square on June 4  1989  policymakers gave little thought to retaliation  It was still a weak country then  without the economic leverage it now wields China is the European Union s biggest trading partner  and several newer members are grateful recipients of China s new infrastructure  No one wants to do this alone   said Mikko Huotari  deputy director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin   There s a general fear of deterioration of relations with China  In defending the detention camps to counterparts  Chinese diplomats have mounted some novel arguments  They have told American officials  for example  that Beijing is applying in Xinjiang best practices it gleaned from studying the United States ImageOne of the internment camps in Xinjiang that local officials have portrayed as vocational training centers CreditThomas Peter ReutersThe Chinese argue that the facilities in Xinjiang are no different from the American military prisons in Guantnamo Bay  Cuba  where foreign terrorism suspects have been held without trial The Americans have replied that the detainees in Guantnamo eventually had access to lawyers  fair trial and visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross  none of which have been available in Xinjiang  two American officials involved in the conversations said The government insists that the camps are vocational training centers that curb extremism  But witnesses and experts describe them as the heart of an immense campaign to transform Xinjiang s 11 million Uighurs and other minority Muslims into loyal servants of the Communist Party The campaign challenges traditional definitions of crimes against humanity  which complicates the world s response  said Adrian Zenz  a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany  What we are witnessing in Xinjiang is different  not quantitatively but qualitatively  a massive  concerted campaign of coerced sociocultural re engineering   he said   It is not so much a crime against physical bodies as it is against souls  There is also little dissent in China  The state s censored news outlets run propaganda videos that make the camps seem like quiet oases of work  with Uighur inmates sitting in rows at work tables Many Chinese support the government s policies in Xinjiang because of concerns about Uighur separatism  including violent attacks ImageA protest to denounce China s treatment of ethnic Uighurs in front of the Chinese consulate in Istanbul last year CreditOzan Kose Agence France Presse   Getty Images Most Chinese are very supportive of the iron fist policy   said Zhu Feng  a professor of international relations in Nanjing   The Chinese fear of deep Islamization and Islamic extremism is increasing  Beijing at first denied the camps  existence  But it has since switched tactics  playing on fears of Islamic extremism Last month  Chinese officials even wrote letters to their counterparts urging them to avoid an event held by the United States mission in Geneva to discuss Xinjiang  suggesting that participation could hurt ties with Beijing How China Won the Support of Islamic LeadersBefore the Abu Dhabi gathering in March  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation held a December session on human rights There  member countries expressed concern about China s mass internment of Muslims  a campaign that they described as  disturbing  and said needed monitoring Around the world  rights activists cheered  It was a rare bright spot for Uighur advocates Fatimah Abdulghafur  39  a Uighur doctoral candidate at the University of Wisconsin Madison  said that for the first time she had felt hopeful that her brother and father  whom she has been unable to contact for two years  would be released from the camps  Maybe hope is coming our way  maybe we can raise some global awareness among Muslims   she recalled thinking after the December event ImageUighur men praying in a mosque in Hotan in 2015 CreditGreg Baker Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBut China responded with a diplomatic campaign targeting the Muslim world In January  China escorted eight officials from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on a 10 day tour of Xinjiang that included visits to select facilities  said a human rights advocate who was briefed on the visit There were differences among the officials about what they saw at the camps  Still  they decided to close ranks because they did not want to upset China at the foreign ministers  gathering  the advocate said In the run up to the Abu Dhabi meeting  China cemented its ties with two Arab friends   Saudi Arabia and Kuwait   who have a history of remaining silent on the plight of non Arab Muslims It also made an example of a country that dared to criticize the camps In February  the spokesman for Turkey s foreign ministry  Hami Aksoy  called the  systematic assimilation  of the Uighurs a  great shame for humanity  and urged China to close the camps Beijing ignored the request and retaliated by closing a Chinese consulate in Turkey  The Chinese ambassador  Deng Li  warned that  criticizing your friend publicly everywhere  could hurt economic relations Turkey is the current chair of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  but when the country s delegate was given the floor in Abu Dhabi  he refrained from raising the issue of Xinjiang  the advocate who was briefed on discussions said The resolution passed by consensus  Uighurs like Ms  Abdulghafur were devastated  We don t feel that global brotherhood love from them   she said   They sell their soul  they sell their faith  for money  They know that millions of people are suffering   

President Trump has adopted a blunt new message in recent days for migrants seeking refuge in the United States   Our country is full  To the degree the president is addressing something broader than the recent strains on the asylum seeking process  the line suggests the nation can t accommodate higher immigration levels because it is already bursting at the seams  But it runs counter to the consensus among demographers and economists They see ample evidence of a country that is not remotely  full    but one where an aging population and declining birthrates among the native born population are creating underpopulated cities and towns  vacant housing and troubled public finances Local officials in many of those places view a shrinking population and work force as an existential problem with few obvious solutions  I believe our biggest threat is our declining labor force   said Gov  Phil Scott of Vermont  a Republican  in his annual budget address this year   It s the root of every problem we face  This makes it incredibly difficult for businesses to recruit new employees and expand  harder for communities to grow and leaves fewer of us to cover the cost of state government   Or if you look at a city like Detroit   many of the city s problems would become less difficult if its population would start growing   said Edward Glaeser  a Harvard economist   All sorts of things like the hangover pension liability become much more solvable if you re actually looking at new people coming in  ImageA road less traveled in Rutland  Vt   last spring  Vermont s governor has described the state s shrinking labor force as  at the root of every problem we face   CreditCaleb Kenna for The New York TimesThis consensus is visible in official government projections  The Congressional Budget Office foresees the American labor force rising by only 0 5 percent a year over the coming decade  about one third as fast as from 1950 to 2007  That is a crucial reason that economic growth is forecast to remain well below its late 20th century levels And that  in turn  is reflected in the national fiscal outlook  There are now 2 8 workers for every recipient of Social Security benefits  a rate on track to fall to 2 2 by 2035  according to the program s trustees  Many state pension plans face even greater demography induced strains In smaller cities and rural areas  demographic decline is a fundamental fact of life  A recent study by the Economic Innovation Group found that 80 percent of American counties  with a combined population of 149 million  saw a decline in their number of prime working age adults from 2007 to 2017 Population growth in the United States has now hit its lowest level since 1937  partly because of a record low fertility rate   the number of children born per woman  The United States increasingly has population growth rates similar to slow growing Japan and Western Europe  with immigration partly offsetting that shift  The Trump administration has portrayed the surge of asylum seekers at the southern border as a crisis  and applied aggressive tactics to deport undocumented immigrants already in the United States  But it has also announced plans to issue up to 30 000 additional H 2B visas for temporary workers  That immigrants keep showing up here is a testament to our freedom and the economic opportunity here   said Matthew Kahn  an economist at the University of Southern California  If immigrants weren t trying to come   if they believed the United States to be full   that would be a problem  Mr  Kahn said A particular fear  said John Lettieri  president of the Economic Innovation Group  is that declining population  falling home prices and weak public finances will create a vicious cycle that the places losing population could find hard to escape He proposes a program of  heartland visas   in which skilled immigrants could obtain work visas to the United States on the condition they live in one of the counties facing demographic decline   with troubled counties themselves deciding whether to participate Although some of the areas with declining demographics are hostile to immigration  others  cities as varied as Baltimore  Indianapolis and Fargo  N D   have embraced the strategy of encouraging it  One of the key solutions is to welcome immigrants into these communities   said Brooks Rainwater  director of the National League of Cities  Center for City Solutions Many parts of the country that are growing in population and that are more economically dynamic have depended on the arrival of immigrants for that success Sun Belt metros like Dallas and Phoenix have been built on the logic of rapid expansion   of quickly built homes  of poached employers  of new highways paved to ever newer subdivisions  Their economic development strategy is growth  Their chief input is people   the more  the better  Growth cities need immigrants to continue their growth   said Joel Kotkin  executive director of the Houston based Center for Opportunity Urbanism  which promotes policies to help cities grow   The older historically declining cities need immigrants to reinvigorate their economies  And the expensive cities need them because  frankly  white people  African Americans and middle class people are leaving for more affordable areas  As many industrial cities have lost population since the mid 20th century  Americans have built whole new metropolises on land that was virtually empty then  The Las Vegas metropolitan area  with more than two million people today  had barely 50 000 in 1950  Still  only about 3 percent of the country s land is urbanized America s metropolitan areas remain among the least dense in the world  said Sonia Hirt  a professor of landscape architecture and planning at the University of Georgia  Nationwide  the United States has less than one third of the population density of the European Union  and a quarter of the density of China  Factually speaking  the country is not actually full   that s impossible   Ms  Hirt said   The real question is  if you continue on the current path of immigration  does this bring more benefits than it brings costs  Economists  too  argue that countries  or even cities  can t really fill up  Rather  communities choose not to make the political choices necessary to accommodate more people  At the local level  that means neighbors may be unwilling to allow taller buildings or to invest in more schools or improved infrastructure  At the national level  it means that politicians may be unwilling to take up immigration reform  or to address workers who fear unemployment  The president s comments echo such local fights   We re full  has often been a motto for people to keep out poorer renters  minority households or apartment buildings  among both conservatives and liberals  The claim can be a way of disguising exclusion as practicality  It s not that we re unwelcoming  it s just that we re full When it comes to the economy  at least  the country looks more like one that is too empty than too full  RelatedTrump Signals Even Fiercer Immigration Agenda  With a Possible Return of Family

This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting  WASHINGTON   Seven years ago  when a former C I A  prisoner  Majid Khan  pleaded guilty at Guantnamo to being a courier for Al Qaeda  his lawyers were warned that any mention of the word  torture  would lead a court security officer to trigger a mute button so the public  listening on a 40 second delay  would not hear it This week the question of his treatment was front and center  this time in a pre sentencing hearing  Mr  Khan s lawyers asked a military judge on Monday to order prosecutors to produce evidence and witnesses about the secret prison network where the intelligence agency kept Mr  Khan incommunicado from March 2003 to September 2006  The material we seek  that is uniquely in the possession of the government  concerns Mr  Khan s torture   one of his lawyers  Katya Jestin  told the judge   The C I A  torture program in this case  your honor  appears to be the third rail  No security officer hit the mute button  A red light on the judge s bench used to signal a security breach never lit up Seventeen and a half years after the Sept  11  2001  terror attacks  and a decade after President Barack Obama ordered the C I A  to dismantle any remnants of its global prison network  the military commission system is still wrestling with how to handle evidence of what the United States did to the Qaeda suspects it held at C I A  black sites  While the topic of torture can now be discussed in open court  there is still a dispute about how evidence of it can be gathered and used in the proceedings at Guantnamo Bay  Cuba By law  prosecutors cannot use evidence gained through torture   or any other involuntary statements   at the war court  where eight of Guantnamo s 40 prisoners are accused of being complicit in terrorist attacks  Prosecutors have made clear that nothing the defendants said at the black sites will be used as evidence But defense lawyers have continued to press for details of what happened to their clients and to be able to use the information either to fight the charges or to win more lenient sentencing  And they have been aided by changing circumstances  not least the government s declassification of some details of how the prisoners were interrogated by the C I A The issue has been most intensely debated in Guantnamo s two death penalty cases  the 9 11 terror attacks that killed 2 976 people and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 in which 17 American sailors died Defense lawyers in those cases have sought for years to get access to eyewitnesses and graphic details from the C I A  sites  The lawyers want to use descriptions of torture to ask the judge to exclude some of the defendants  own statements after they left the black sites  The defense lawyers also have said they would cite torture to seek dismissal of the charges on grounds of outrageous government conduct  an extraordinary legal defense that is used in civilian courts but is seldom granted If the men are convicted  the lawyers want the details of how the defendants were treated to argue that the United States has lost the moral authority to execute men it has tortured ImageThe lawyers for Majid Khan  a prisoner at Guantnamo  say he was tortured in a C I A  black site CreditCenter for Constitutional RightsThe fight over access to evidence and witnesses from the black sites is one of the factors that has slowed progress in the cases  In the process  it has illustrated how fundamental legal issues about the rights of Guantnamo defendants remain unresolved   and how the passage of time is altering how some of them are handled The conflict is not limited to the death penalty cases  as Mr  Khan s proceedings show The topic of his torture was strictly taboo on Feb  29  2012  when he made his first court appearance since disappearing from his native Pakistan in 2003 at age 23  At that first hearing  Mr  Khan  who lived in suburban Baltimore for seven years and graduated from high school there in 1999  admitted to volunteering to work for Al Qaeda after Sept  11 and plotting with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  the accused architect of the attacks But in the intervening years  the Obama administration declassified details of what Mr  Khan said the C I A  did to him  By his account  he was beaten  hung naked from a wooden beam for three days with no food  kept for months in darkness  and submerged  shackled and hooded  into a tub of ice and water Additional details of his treatment were revealed in the partly declassified introduction to a Senate study of the George W  Bush administration s black site program  In his second year of C I A  detention  according to a cable cited in the study  the agency  infused  a pure of pasta  sauce  nuts  raisins and hummus up Mr  Khan s rectum  because he went on a hunger strike The C I A  calls this  rectal feeding   Defense lawyers call it rape Mr  Khan s lawyers now want to call witnesses and gather evidence to show his sentencing jury what happened to him The litigation over black site evidence has gone on for years  to the dismay of some family members who lost loved ones to Al Qaeda terrorists  particularly families of those killed on Sept  11  2001  when hijackers crashed four passenger planes into the World Trade Center  the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field  What our family members endured during the attacks on the airplanes and in the building was beyond torture   said Terry Strada  whose husband Thomas was killed in the World Trade Center She has campaigned for more transparency about what happened on Sept  11  But she sees the focus in the Guantnamo hearings on what happened to the defendants in the black sites as  stalling and stonewalling the process  In Mr  Khan s case  he has pleaded guilty to delivering  50 000 of Qaeda money to a Southeast Asian affiliate that was used to finance the bombing of a Marriott hotel in Jakarta  Indonesia  in 2003 that killed 11 people  He also admitted to agreeing to assassinate Pervez Musharraf  then the president of Pakistan  a plot that was never pulled off Under a plea agreement  he became what his military attorney  Lt  Cmdr  Jared Hernandez of the Navy  called  Guantnamo s sole high value cooperator  and can be sentenced to 25 years of confinement  He is being credited with time served since his plea deal  meaning he could get out in 2037 His lawyers say testimony about his years in C I A  custody could strengthen a post sentencing clemency petition  They also may ask the judge to grant him credit for those years in the C I A  prisons as pretrial punishment and reduce his sentence ImageAmerican troops standing guard outside Camp Delta at Guantnamo Bay Detention Center  By law  prosecutors cannot use involuntary statements at the war court  where eight of Guantnamo s 40 prisoners are accused of being complicit in terrorist attacks CreditRamon Espinosa Associated PressIn the military tribunal system  prosecutors are the gatekeepers of classified trial evidence  They have forbidden defense team members from independently contacting or investigating most former black site workers  The C I A  is shielding their identities as well as the nations that hosted the black sites  invoking national security  though most if not all the nations have already been identified publicly  The C I A  is not on trial   Jeffrey Groharing  a case prosecutor  told the judge at a hearing at Guantnamo on Nov  15  That same day  in a bid to persuade the judge that the prosecution had met its responsibility to provide information to the defense  Mr  Groharing stood at the war court and read aloud from documents the defense lawyers can use from a C I A  inspector general s investigation One described how  during an interrogation  Mr  Mohammed refused an interrogator s order to drink water  According to the document read by Mr  Groharing  Mr  Mohammed  was taken back to the bathing room  placed on a plastic sheet and a medical officer rehydrated Mohammed rectally  Mohammed clearly hated the procedure  When he was returned to the interrogation room  he then complied and drank water  In another document Mr  Groharing read  an unnamed senior interrogator described an unidentified black site as  good for interrogations  because it was  the closest thing he has seen to a dungeon  facilitating the displacement of detainee explanations  Spectators heard the audio on a 40 second delay from the gallery at the back of court  separated by triple pane glass   It s hard to imagine a more rich and vivid description than those statements   Mr  Groharing said Defense lawyers called the written accounts sanitized versions of the eyewitness testimony they sought Mr  Mohammed s lawyer  David Nevin  said the term rectal rehydration  is a polite way of saying rape with the insertion of a foreign object into the rectum  But how is it done  I d like to know  how is it done  One small detail can change a juror s mind about whether to vote for capital punishment  Mr  Nevin has said Eugene R  Fidell  who teaches military law at Yale Law School  said a showdown over black site evidence was foreseeable  The defense lawyers have to have the tools with which to perform their duty  especially in capital cases  No question   Mr  Fidell said   Somebody should have thought about that before they started torturing these people  He added   This was an accident waiting to happen  The only thing that surprises me is this is 2019 and the problem remains unresolved   

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William P  Barr said on Wednesday that he would scrutinize the F B I  s investigation of the Trump campaign s ties to Russia  including whether  spying  conducted by American intelligence agencies on the campaign s associates had been properly carried out  I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal   Mr  Barr said during testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee  adding that he wanted to look into both  the genesis and the conduct  of the F B I  inquiry  He cast his interest as a matter of protecting civil liberties from potential abuse by the government  I think spying did occur   Mr  Barr said   The question is whether it was adequately predicated  And I m not suggesting that it wasn t adequately predicated  But I need to explore that  The remarks by the new attorney general   particularly his embrace of the term spying  which is frequently invoked by critics of the Russia investigation   are certain to please President Trump and his allies  who have accused American law enforcement officials of targeting his campaign out of political malice Mr  Barr s pledge  made as he prepares to make public in coming days a redacted version of the special counsel s report on the Russia inquiry  was a sign that after nearly three years of investigating the president s campaign and Russia  the Justice Department s focus may begin to shift in a direction that Mr  Trump has demanded In addition to Mr  Barr s review of the F B I  investigation  the Justice Department s inspector general  a specially tasked United States attorney and Republicans in Congress are all studying key actions taken during the course of the inquiry  Those actions include how officials opened the Trump Russia investigation  called Crossfire Hurricane  and obtained a secret warrant to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser Mr  Trump s thirst for a reckoning among his inquisitors appears to have only grown in recent weeks  Minutes before Mr  Barr took the witness stand on Wednesday  the president called the investigation an  attempted coup  and claimed  again  that he had been  totally exonerated  by the report  despite the fact that Robert S  Mueller III  the special counsel who took over the F B I  s Russia investigation in 2017  explicitly said he could not clear the president of trying to obstruct justice  It was an illegal investigation   Mr  Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Texas  In some of his harshest criticism of the investigation to date  Mr  Trump said   Everything about it was crooked   every single thing about it  There were dirty cops  These were bad people   This was an attempted takedown of a president   he added   And we beat them  We beat them  Mr  Mueller delivered his nearly 400 pages of findings to Mr  Barr late last month  Much of Wednesday s hearing  and an earlier session with House lawmakers on Tuesday  was focused on that report  on continuing redactions of delicate information before it becomes public  and on Mr  Barr s characterization of what Mr  Mueller found Mr  Barr  who said that he hoped to make a redacted version of Mr  Mueller s report public next week  used more measured tones in describing the review he intended to oversee than Mr  Trump did  The attorney general also signaled that he would wait to hear from others already at work  including the inspector general who could deliver a report in May or June  before replicating their review ImageRobert S  Mueller III  the special counsel who took over the F B I  s Russia investigation in 2017  delivered his nearly 400 pages of findings to Mr  Barr late last month CreditCliff Owen Associated PressHe said he was not starting an investigation into the F B I  or any other law enforcement agency  per se  but he did allude to several of the bureau s former leaders who oversaw the opening of the Russia inquiry  To the extent there were any issues at the F B I   I do not view it as a problem that is endemic to the F B I    Mr  Barr said   I think there was probably failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon  Mr  Barr did not present evidence to back up his statement  and he declined to share details about which investigative actions concerned him The F B I  obtained a secret surveillance warrant to spy on one former Trump aide  Carter Page  after he left the campaign  Republicans in Congress have questioned the legality of that warrant because it used unverified Democrat funded opposition research compiled into a dossier by Christopher Steele  a former British intelligence officer  But a judge approved it  and it was not clear whether any laws were broken Both Dana Boente  now the F B I  general counsel  and Rod J  Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general  signed the FISA renewal application on Mr  Page The bureau sought the wiretap on Mr  Page because of his previous contacts with a Russian intelligence officer in 2013 and material in the dossier  Among claims that Mr  Steele compiled from sources was that during a visit to Moscow in July 2016  Mr  Page secretly met a Russian official promising compromising information about Hillary Clinton   an accusation that Mr  Page has denied The F B I  also used a confidential informant to collect information on Trump campaign associates  which prompted more accusations of spying by the president Mr  Trump or people close to him have leveled charges that have not borne out  including that President Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower in Manhattan Defenders of the F B I  have objected to the notion that it spied on the Trump campaign  The F B I  and Justice Department  they say  waited to seek a court order permitting it to wiretap Mr  Page until after he left the campaign and was on the verge of returning to Russia Still  the wiretap order enabled F B I  agents to obtain and read older emails in Mr  Page s account  including when he was working with the campaign  The inspector general  Michael E  Horowitz  has asked those involved in that effort why they did not use a so called filter team to review the messages and screen out any sensitive but irrelevant information before adding them to the Russia investigation case file  However  there appeared to be no rule requiring such a step  according to a person familiar with the inquiry The inspector general has also asked about the handling of F B I  informants  including Mr  Steele and Stefan A  Halper  an American academic who teaches in Britain ImagePresident Trump spoke Wednesday before leaving for Texas  He called the Russia investigation  illegal  and said that  everything about it was crooked  CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesAfter the F B I  opened the Russia investigation in late July 2016  agents asked Mr  Halper to gather information on Mr  Page and George Papadopoulos  another former Trump campaign adviser Mr  Halper had also spoken to Mr  Page at a symposium that month  which has raised suspicions by critics of the F B I  that the investigation started earlier than the bureau has said  But that earlier encounter was a coincidence  according to a former federal law enforcement official Mr  Barr appeared to be responding generally to those episodes  many of which have been the subject of news reports  I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused   he said   I think that is one of the principal roles of the attorney general  Democrats involved in Congress s investigations of Russia s election interference quickly chastised Mr  Barr for using the term spying in a way that they believe feeds a right wing conspiracy of F B I  wrongdoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said it appeared he was  going off the rails  to protect Mr  Trump Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee  accused Mr  Barr of giving  a wink and a nod  to a  long debunked  spying  conspiracy  And at one point  Senator Jack Reed  Democrat of Rhode Island  pressed Mr  Barr on whether he had  specific evidence of anything improper in the counterintelligence investigation   Mr  Barr said he did not  I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now   he said   I do have questions about it  But when Senator Brian Schatz  Democrat of Hawaii  asked Mr  Barr if he had intended to use the term spying   a term the senator said might  cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out    Mr  Barr rephrased his statement  I m not sure of all of the connotations of that word that you re referring to   the attorney general said  then he added   I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance  Mr  Barr  who began his career at the C I A   did not intend to imply that spying was inherently wrong  according to a person who has discussed the matter with him but was not authorized to share their conversation  Mr  Barr sees no technical difference between that term and surveillance  He indicated that at issue was not the act of surveilling but whether officials followed proper procedures when they decided to gather intelligence on Trump s associates in 2016 Senator Jeanne Shaheen  Democrat of New Hampshire  elicited a response from Mr  Barr that invoked another era  When she asked why Mr  Barr was going to review the origins of the Russia investigation  he answered that  the generation I grew up in  which is the Vietnam War period  you know  people were all concerned about spying on antiwar people and so forth by the government

LONDON   British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk on Friday asking to delay Brexit until June 30 The text of May s letter is below  Dear Donald In the European Council Decision of 22 March  taken in agreement with the United Kingdom  the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed that if the House of Commons had approved the Withdrawal Agreement by 29 March 2019  the period provided for by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union would be extended until 22 May 2019 to provide for ratification  The House of Commons declined to approve the Withdrawal Agreement and take up that option  Therefore unless we agree a further extension at the European Council you have convened for 10 April  the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal at 2300 BST on 12 April 2019  The Government s policy has always been and remains to leave the European Union in an orderly way  and without undue delay  The House of Commons has not thus far approved the deal that would enable this  nor   despite considerable efforts by both Members of Parliament and by the Government   has it yet found a majority in favor of any other proposal The House has  however  continued to express its opposition to leaving the European Union without a deal  The Government agrees that leaving with a deal is the best outcome This impasse cannot be allowed to continue  In the UK it is creating uncertainty and doing damage to faith in politics  while the European Union has a legitimate desire to move on to decisions about its own future  That is why the Government has decided to take further action to seek a consensus across the House of Commons on the right way forward  I therefore met the Leader of the Opposition earlier this week to discuss whether we might be able to agree a proposal that can be put before the House of Commons which allows the United Kingdom to leave the European Union with a deal  We agreed follow up discussions that are now taking place  I have also extended an open invitation to Members of Parliament more broadly to work with me to achieve a consensus that respects the result of the 2016 referendum  I am clear that all of these discussions need to be based on acceptance of the Withdrawal Agreement without reopening it  as the United Kingdom agreed with the European Council at our last meeting  and should focus on the framework for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union  If a consensus is going to be found  compromise will be needed on all sides  in the national interest  If the talks do not lead to a single unified approach soon  the Government would instead look to establish a consensus on a small number of clear options on the future relationship that could be put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue  The Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House  if the Opposition will commit to doing the same  These steps demonstrate that the Government is determined to bring this process to a resolution quickly  The Government acknowledges  however  that after approval to the Withdrawal Agreement is achieved  the process of enacting those commitments in domestic law and therefore ratifying the Agreement in the United Kingdom will take time  Therefore having reluctantly sought an extension to the Article 50 period last month  the Government must now do so again  It remains the Government s view that  despite this request to extend the Article 50 period  it is in the interests of neither the United Kingdom as a departing Member State  nor the European Union as a whole  that the United Kingdom holds elections to the European Parliament  However  the United Kingdom accepts the European Council s view that if the United Kingdom were still a Member State of the European Union on 23 May 2019  it would be under a legal obligation to hold the elections  The Government is therefore undertaking the lawful and responsible preparations for this contingency  including by making the Order that sets the date of the poll  The process I have laid out in paragraphs 4 and 5 is designed to bring the House Of Commons to rapid approval Of the Withdrawal Agreement and a shared vision for the future relationship  and to allow the Government to introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and so ratify the Agreement  An important part of that process will be the Government agreeing with the Opposition a program for the Bill  The Government s objective is to ensure that this program means the Bill can complete its passage such that the Agreement can be brought into force and the United Kingdom withdraw from the European Union in time to cancel the European Parliament elections  I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50 3  of the Treaty on European Union  including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty  The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019  If the parties are able to ratify before this date  the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early  The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections  but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible  It is frustrating that we have not yet brought this process to a successful and orderly conclusion  The United Kingdom Government remains strongly committed to doing so  and will continue to act as a constructive and responsible Member State of the European Union in accordance with the duty of sincere cooperation throughout this unique period  I would be grateful for the opportunity to update our colleagues on the position at our meeting on Wednesday     Reporting by Elizabeth Piper and Alistair Smout  Editing by Guy Faulconbridge  

From Day 1 in the Oval Office  President Trump has shown a unique obsession with the financial markets  tweeting that high stock prices proved he was making America great again  But a new chapter opened in October  when the markets dropped sharply  and Mr  Trump began making critical presidential decisions with an eye to pushing stock prices back up As soon as the markets turned downward  Mr  Trump softened his hard line on Chinese trade practices  trying to quiet market fears that his tariff threats against Beijing would start a global trade war  Then he started attacking the United States Federal Reserve  saying its interest rate policies were undermining stock prices  and followed with rants about firing the chairman of the Fed  Jerome Powell  And last week  Axios quoted a source who had spoken to Mr  Trump as saying that the president had delayed his threat to close the Mexico border out of concern over how the markets would react For Mr  Trump to base serious decisions about trade  monetary policy and immigration on market mood swings ensures that the zany uncertainty of his tenure will continue to reach new heights Mr  Trump s sudden moderation on China was particularly striking because  in an otherwise mercurial career  he had remained consistent on trade  Going back to the 1980s  Mr  Trump has been accusing Asian competitors in particular of using unfair trade deals to steal America s lunch Moreover  Mr  Trump has been drawing broad support for his hard line on trade with China  even among his critics in Congress and in Europe  Many of them agreed that China was using state power to dominate the global information technology industry  exclude American companies from its domestic market and steal intellectual property  They were openly rooting for Mr  Trump to win on this issue  and to cut a tough deal Yet when the markets fell on fear of a United States China trade war  Mr  Trump began to retreat  After taking office  his tweets on China attacked it for militarism  currency manipulation and unfair trade practices right up until the markets dropped in October  Mr  Trump s first conciliatory tweet came on Nov  1  describing a pleasant chat about trade with President Xi Jinping  and he has been talking up their  incredible relationship  and progress in trade talks since By last month  amid reports that Trump advisers were calculating how big of a  stock market pop  they could expect from a trade deal  Washington insiders from both parties were worrying aloud that the president might accept any deal China would sign Mr  Trump  meanwhile  was executing a similar about face on the Fed  As a candidate  he had attacked the central bank for keeping rates so low and inflating  a big fat ugly bubble  in the markets  Once he took office  Mr  Trump stopped tweeting attacks on the Fed  until November  when he began to blame the central bank for dampening market spirits with high interest rates  In recent weeks  Mr  Trump has not only fulminated about replacing Mr  Powell  he has also started considering market friendly loyalists for seats on the Fed board of governors Mr  Trump s most recent market driven U turn appears to have come on immigration  another subject near and dear to him  So far  the stock markets have not reacted negatively to his aggressive efforts to secure funding for a border wall  including the government shutdown and the declaration of a national emergency  Nonetheless  when Mr  Trump backed off on his threat to close the southern border  the Axios source explained the president s decision this way   It s the markets  Closing the border  the markets would plummet  No president has shown this kind of deference  Jimmy Carter  Ronald Reagan and both Bushes mentioned the stock markets rarely and cautiously  Bill Clinton counseled against responding to their gyrations  In early 2009  Barack Obama suggested it was a good time to buy battered American stocks and was proved right when the markets hit bottom a week later  But Mr  Obama was criticized for acting as  stock picker in chief  and did not talk about stock prices again as president Mr  Trump is not only reading the markets as a daily measure of his success  he is also shaping policy to keep prices high  And recent market rises have rewarded him for it  After Mr  Trump turned conciliatory on China  the Fed announced it was suspending further rate increases  and stocks began climbing back toward record highs So who s in charge  Mr  Trump or the markets  One critical test is the United States China trade talks  which are set to wrap up soon in a meeting between Mr  Trump and Mr  Xi  A tough agreement would help confirm that markets aren t completely dictating policy Even then  Mr  Trump s willingness to bend policy to please the markets is now clear   and it s risky  In recent years the stock markets have grown larger than the economy  and they are now big enough to take the economy down with them when they deflate  Policymakers are wary of poking this beast  but feeding it will only make the markets larger and more demanding Ruchir Sharma  a contributing opinion writer  is chief

It may take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the southern United States border  the government said in court documents filed on Friday A federal judge had asked for a plan to identify these children and their families after a report from government inspectors in January revealed that the Trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents than was previously believed These families were separated before the administration unveiled its  zero tolerance  immigration policy in the spring of 2018  when nearly all adults entering the country illegally were prosecuted and any children accompanying them were put into shelters or foster care To identify these families  the government said it would apply a statistical analysis to about 47 000 children who were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and subsequently discharged  according to the court filing  From there  the government said it would manually review the case records of the children who appeared to have the highest probability of being part of the separated families Officials estimated that the process would take at least one year and potentially two  In explaining the reason for such an arduous process  the government said United States Customs and Border Protection did not collect specific data on migrant family separations before April 2018 Lawyers representing the Office of Refugee Resettlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday In a court filing for the government  Jonathan White  a commander with the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps  wrote that identifying this group of children presented new challenges because they were already discharged from the Office of Refugee Resettlement  meaning the government  lacks access  to them The statistical analysis was required because manually reviewing the cases of nearly 50 000 children would  overwhelm  the office s resources  he wrote The government s proposed plan arose from a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California  In June  Judge Dana M  Sabraw ordered the reunification of children and parents who had been separated under the Trump administration policy  President Trump rescinded the policy that same month ImageRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee  Democrat of Texas  speaking on Capitol Hill in February about the Trump administration s separation policy involving migrant families CreditJose Luis Magana Associated PressAbout 2 800 children have been reunified with their families or situated according to their parents  wishes  said Lee Gelernt  who challenged the policy in court on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union The January report  by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services  revealed that a group of separated families was unaccounted for because the government lacked an effective tracking system  In March  Judge Sabraw ruled that those families should be included in the litigation Mr  Gelernt said this identification process should take months  not years   If the government believed finding these children was a priority  they could do it quicker than two years   Mr  Gelernt said The families the government may now be tasked with locating are those who entered the United States on or after July 1  2017  the earliest known date that families were separated  were detained by immigration officials  and have a child who was detained and then released to a sponsor  such as a relative  before the judge s reunification order on June 26  2018 When the government previously identified children for reunification  it included only the children who were detained at the time of the reunification order Judge Sabraw wrote in his March 8 order that because all of these families had been subjected to the same policies and had been separated under  questionable circumstances   they should have the same opportunity for relief  Although identifying the families may be burdensome  as the government argued   it clearly can be done   the judge wrote According to the government s proposed plan  officials would update the A C L U  about the families  information after completing the analysis and reviewing the children s cases  The organization would then use that information to help reunify parents and children Mr  Gelernt said a two year wait to reunite families would be devastating  The longer these children remained separated from their families  he said  the more psychological trauma they would endure  He said the A C L U  planned to argue against the proposed plan in court The family separations were a central part of the Trump administration s effort to deter migrant families from trying to enter the United States through its southern border with Mexico Data released last month suggested that the administration s immigration measures   including the separation policy and attempts to beef up border security and limit who qualified for asylum   failed to deter tens of thousands of migrants traveling to the United States  most of whom were escaping violence and poverty in Central America  

On Sunday evening  news broke that Kirstjen Nielsen was leaving her job as head of the Department of Homeland Security  The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted that according to people close to Nielsen  one reason she hung on as long as she did was because  she was aware how awful life would will be for her on the outside   given her role in defending Donald Trump s policies Let s make it so Nielsen did not create Trump s monstrous policy of separating migrant families  but she should be known forever as the person who carried it out  She put babies in cages  traumatized children for life  and then appears to have lied to Congress about what she had done  She did this evil work with either blithe incompetence or malicious sloppiness  failing to create a system to properly track kids who were ripped from their families  On Friday  the Trump administration said it could take up to two years to identify thousands of separated migrant children  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt   Now Trump is gearing up to do it again  According to NBC News  for months the president has  urged his administration to reinstate large scale separation of migrant families crossing the border   Nielsen reportedly resisted  citing court rulings and Trump s own 2018 executive order ending his administration s family separation policy  Trump s choice for acting homeland security secretary  Kevin McAleenan  apparently is more open to the idea Should this happen  Congress and some judges will try to intervene  But Trump is growing ever more lawless and autocratic   There is a near systematic purge happening at the nation s second largest national security agency   a senior administration official told CNN on Monday  speaking of D H S  The president is filling positions with acting officials  circumventing Senate confirmation  Some senior members of the administration  like Wilbur Ross  the commerce secretary  are flatly refusing to cooperate with congressional oversight  CNN reported that Trump told border agents to ignore judges when taking steps to keep migrants out  We should not assume that government institutions will restrain the president before he visits anguish and terror on thousands more of the world s most vulnerable children What happens to Nielsen now can serve as an example to other people in the administration as they decide whether to just follow orders  By this  I don t mean that people should scream at Nielsen in restaurants  Rather  those horrified by family separation should do whatever they can to deny Nielsen the sort of cushy corporate landing or prestigious academic appointment once customary for ex administration officials  The fact that she evidently didn t go as far as an erratic and out of control Trump wanted is immaterial  she should be a pariah for going as far as she did Coincidentally  the day before Nielsen resigned  a coalition of progressive groups signed on to a petition asking corporate America to blacklist senior people in the Trump administration  including Nielsen  who took part in crafting  enacting or defending family separation   Allowing her to seek refuge in a corporate corner office or a boardroom  university  speaking agency or elsewhere poses a significant reputational risk for those involved   said Karl Frisch  a spokesman for Restore Public Trust  the group organizing the campaign How much of a risk will depend on decent Trump hating Americans  The Resistance has been flagging recently  even if abhorrence of Trump s degenerate administration has not  Many people  having worked frantically to deliver the House to Democrats in the midterms  are exhausted  The crackup of the Women s March  and the resulting tensions between some black and Jewish activists  has been deeply dispiriting  The beginning of the Democratic presidential primary has reanimated old intra left animosities  And relentless outrage is hard to sustain  no matter how justified But with the possible return of family separation  the Resistance needs to regroup  and demanding a boycott of Trump officials tainted by baby snatching is a good place to begin  Such a boycott would take advantage of one of the central asymmetries in American life  Rural voters  who tend to be conservative  have disproportionate political power  it s why Trump  who lost the popular vote  is president in the first place  But cosmopolitan progressives have disproportionate economic and cultural power  which is why we have the faintly absurd phenomenon of woke capitalism  That power should be deployed to force the sort of accountability Nielsen reportedly fears  and to serve as a warning to others that the Trump stink never washes off On Monday   Henry Farrell  a professor at George Washington University  wrote that he will boycott any university or think tank that employs Nielsen  and refuse to be on panels with anyone from such an institution  He invited others to join him  It s a small start  but a start  Nielsen should not be permitted to launder her reputation through a fellowship at Harvard  like Corey Lewandowski or Sean Spicer did  She should not get to follow H R  McMaster to Stanford There are plenty of places that will hire a disgraced child torturer   private prisons  which often hold undocumented immigrants  are a big business  And Henry Kissinger s storied social life shows that America s elite is far from inhospitable to ghouls  But as the country hurtles into a dangerous new phase of unbound Trumpism  those who want to say no need to muster whatever leverage they can  including public shame and economic sanctions  Either the leaders of corporate America and academia want to be associated with terrorizing toddlers  or not More from Opinion on Kirstjen Nielsen s departure Opinion   Jamelle Bouie  Who Is Left to Say No to Trump April 8  2019Opinion  U S  Policies Toward

KABUL  Afghanistan   In a sign that a logjam in Afghanistan over entering peace talks with the Taliban could be easing  the Afghan government announced Sunday that it had named a council of senior political leaders who will appoint negotiators  create their mandate for talks and oversee their work The formation of the council   led by President Ashraf Ghani and composed of both current and former senior government officials and leaders of political parties and opposition groups   comes after months of bitter disagreements over the next steps for peace talks with the Taliban So far  negotiations have occurred only between the insurgents and American diplomats  without the Afghan government  an impasse that American officials have struggled to break The two sides are near an agreement on the withdrawal of American troops and on a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil not be used by terrorist groups to attack the United States and its allies  as Al Qaeda did in September 2001  But the United States has insisted that nothing can be finalized until the Taliban and the Afghans figure out the country s political future The Taliban have refused to meet directly with representatives of the Afghan government  calling it a puppet of the United States  The Afghan government has insisted on nothing less than direct negotiations  criticizing any move by political groups to engage with the Taliban as giving the insurgents unwarranted legitimacy Mr  Ghani  in opening the first meeting of the new council  expressed happiness on Sunday and thanked political leaders for creating a unified front under the government s umbrella  With complete unity for the sake of a better future for our country  we will make decisions about the aims of this process and the makeup of the negotiating team   Mr  Ghani said The progress was welcomed by Zalmay Khalilzad  the American Special envoy leading the peace efforts  Mr  Khalilzad spent much of the past week in Kabul trying to urge the Afghan government to introduce an inclusive negotiating team  Ambassador Khalilzad was pleased to see the Afghans with whom he met  inside and outside government  coming together to put peace first   the United States Embassy in Kabul  said in a statement announcing his departure   Ambassador Khalilzad underscored the imperative of reducing violence across Afghanistan in the coming weeks and explored ways to build broader regional support for the current effort to realize the Afghan people s yearning for peace  ImageQatari officials  center  with delegations from the United States and the Taliban in Doha in February CreditMinistry of Foreign Affairs of QatarAfter the new council met  officials expressed their willingness to be flexible to build trust and pave the way for direct negotiations Mohammed Umer Daudzai  a member of the council  said an informal meeting with the Taliban in Qatar  seen as an icebreaker  would go ahead  That meeting  set for mid April and expected to be attended by more than a hundred Afghans from various parts of society  is intended as a trust building measure  It was decided in today s meeting that we will participate in the meeting in Qatar as a joint delegation   Mr  Daudzai said   A big delegation will go to Qatar to exchange views with the other side  which are the Taliban  but they will not negotiate  Negotiation is the next step  Easing Mr  Ghani s concerns is the fact that since he leads the council overseeing the talks  his officials will be on the negotiating team when direct talks with the Taliban do begin  Government representatives are also likely to attend the large Qatar meeting The Taliban  in a statement soon after Mr  Daudzai s comments  made clear that they were still sensitive about talking to the Afghan government  They said that if any officials were part of the delegation in Qatar  they would be attending in a personal capacity  No one will be participating as representatives of the Kabul administration   Zabihullah Mujahid  the Taliban spokesman  said in the statement Although political parties and lawmakers welcomed the progress  many cautioned that it was still fragile  and said Mr  Ghani s office still had many differences with the parties on major issues  including the size and makeup of the negotiating team A leaked initial list of the team published by local news media also raised concerns about just how seriously the Afghan government and political elite were taking the participation of women  Only two women were on a proposed list of 22 negotiators  Today s meeting in the palace could be a good start for building of national consensus on peace   at least now there is a start for decisions on how to go ahead with peace talks   said Mohammad Natiqi  a leader of the Wahdat e Islami Party   But there are still big differences between political parties and the presidential palace  Mohammad Nazeer Ahmadzai  a member of Parliament  said the council created a platform to bridge rifts that benefit the Taliban  He pointed to a meeting in Moscow in February where the Afghan political elite went in large numbers to meet with the insurgents despite strong disagreement from the government  If the meeting in Qatar ends up similar to the meeting in Moscow  it will damage the people s trust in the peace process  and it will show the government weaker and more marginalized   he said  

BEIRUT   Opposition activists and Syrian state media are reporting at least 13 people have been killed in fighting between government forces and insurgents in the northwestern part of Syria An uptick in violence has increasingly tested a Russia Turkey sponsored truce in place since September that has averted a government offensive on insurgent held Idlib and surrounding areas  The area is home to 3 million people The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and first responders known as White Helmets say government shelling killed at least eight people Sunday in Saraqeb and Nairab towns in eastern Idlib A local hospital director  Maher Younis  told the state run Ikhbariya TV that insurgents killed at least five people when they fired missiles at the government held town of Massyaf in the adjacent Hama province  

BRASILIA   The government of Brazil s right wing President Jair Bolsonaro has rejected an appeal by a United Nations expert not to revise Brazilian history by denying a military coup occurred in 1964 In a letter to the U N  human rights commission in Geneva made public on Thursday  the government said it  repudiates the baseless allegations  of the U N  expert who criticized Bolsonaro s decision to commemorate the 1964 military uprising as an attempt to condone rights violations  President Bolsonaro has reiterated his understanding that the 1964 movement was necessary to stave off the growing threat of a communist takeover of Brazil and to ensure the preservation of national institutions in the context of the Cold War   the letter said  According to Bolsonaro  the overthrow of an elected leftist government was not a coup d etat  but a legitimate movement backed by the country s Congress and judiciary  as well as the majority of Brazilians  the letter said Brazil s armed forces on Sunday paid tribute to the 1964 coup that lead to a two decade military dictatorship at the behest of Bolsonaro  who reversed an eight year ban on celebrations  The move stirred debate and underscored Bolsonaro s support for a military government that executed hundreds  tortured thousands  shuttered Congress and left most Brazilians with dark memories of the period Two days earlier in Geneva  Fabian Salvioli  the U N  expert who wrote the letter and a human rights lawyer and professor  called on the Bolsonaro government to reconsider the commemoration   Attempts to revise history and justify or condone gross human rights violations of the past must be clearly rejected by all authorities and society as a whole   Salvioli said Bolsonaro  a former Army captain  has long praised the 1964 85 military government and often said its biggest mistake was not killing enough leftists Pushing the U N  appeal aside  his government is moving ahead with rewriting history  Education Minister Ricardo Velez said in an interview published on Wednesday that school history books will be edited to give a  broader  view of what happened in 1964  He told Valor Economico newspaper that there was no coup and the military regime that followed was not a dictatorship   Reporting by Anthony Boadle  

LONDON   Britain proposed sweeping new government powers to regulate the internet to combat the spread of violent and extremist content  false information and harmful material aimed at children  The proposal  announced on Monday  would be one of the world s most aggressive actions to rein in the most corrosive online content The recommendations  backed by Prime Minister Theresa May  take direct aim at Facebook  Google and other large internet platforms that policymakers believe have made growth and profits a priority over curbing harmful material  The government called for naming an internet regulator with the power to issue fines  block access to websites if necessary and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content spread on their platforms  The internet can be brilliant at connecting people across the world  but for too long these companies have not done enough to protect users  especially children and young people  from harmful content   Ms  May said in a statement   That is not good enough  and it is time to do things differently  By introducing the proposal even as a deadline nears for Britain to exit the European Union  Ms  May signaled that enacting the new internet regulations was a high priority of her government Around the world  governments are having a broader debate about reining in the internet and whether their actions will restrict free expression  Frustrated by what they see as a lack of progress to protect users  governments are passing or considering new laws to define what classifies as acceptable online communication  Advocates for human rights and free speech warn that the policies will lead to censorship and be exploited by more repressive governments After the massacre of 50 people at two   mosques in New Zealand in March  calls have increased globally for internet regulation  The authorities say the gunman distributed a racist manifesto online before using Facebook to live stream the shooting  In response  Australia passed a law last week that threatens fines for social media companies and jail for their executives if they fail to rapidly remove  abhorrent violent material  from their platforms  New Zealand is also considering new restrictions In Singapore  draft legislation was introduced last week that supporters said would restrict the spread of false and misleading information  But opponents have warned it could be used to go after critics of the government  India has also proposed broad new powers to regulate internet content  The European Union is debating a new terrorism content measure that some have warned is overly broad and will harm free expression  And Germany last year began prohibiting hate speech  Digital rights groups have criticized the law as leading to the unnecessary blocking of legitimate content In response to the political backlash  internet companies have toughened their policies and hired tens of thousands of human moderators to screen for problematic material  But with billions of pieces of content being shared each day on services like Facebook  Instagram and YouTube  deciphering what is harmful isn t always an easy task  and governments have criticized the companies for not being aggressive enough ImageBy introducing a proposal to regulate the internet even as a deadline nears for Britain to exit the European Union  Prime Minister Theresa May signaled that the issue was a high priority of her government CreditDowning Street  via Associated PressIn recent weeks  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has said new regulations are needed  particularly to more clearly define what is acceptable content so companies aren t the main judges And Facebook took a similar stance in response to the British proposal   New regulations are needed so that we have a standardized approach across platforms and private companies aren t making so many important decisions alone   Facebook said in a statement   These are complex issues to get right and we look forward to working with the government and Parliament to ensure new regulations are effective  Claire Lilley  a public policy manager for Google  said the company has invested in new technology and hired experts to address the problems raised by the government  and will work with policymakers to  to ensure a free  open and safer internet that works for everyone  Twitter said in a statement that it would  engage in the discussion between industry and the U K  government  as well as work to strike an appropriate balance between keeping users safe and preserving the internet s open  free nature  British officials are calling for the creation of a mandatory  duty of care  standard intended  to make companies take responsibility for the safety of their users and to tackle harm caused by content or activity on their services  The government listed a number of topics that companies could be required to address or risk fines and other penalties  The list includes material thought to be supporting terrorism  inciting violence  encouraging suicide  disinformation  cyberbullying and inappropriate material accessible to children  The rules would apply to social media platforms  discussion forums  messaging services and search engines The proposal is a first step in a longer legislative process  The recommendations will be debated over the coming months before any new laws and regulations are put in place Actions in Britain and elsewhere signal a new era for the internet  Western democracies have largely avoided regulating online communication  But as evidence mounts that online actions are having harmful real life consequences by contributing to violence  compromising elections and spreading hateful ideologies  governments are becoming more willing to intervene In the United States  where free speech is more of a core value than other nations  there s been less momentum to regulate internet content  But in Washington this week  the House Judiciary Committee will question executives from Facebook and Google on the spread of white nationalism on social media  The era of self regulation for online companies is over   Jeremy Wright  Britain s digital secretary  said in a statement   Voluntary actions from industry to tackle online harms have not been applied consistently or gone far enough   Technology   he added   can be an incredible force for good and we want the sector to be part of the solution in protecting their users  However  those that fail to do this will face tough action   

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  He has traveled to three early presidential primary states  held  5 000 a plate events for donors and hired a small dollar fund raising consultant He spoke at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  a pro Israel lobbying group  and is now on another trip to raise money in Boston  after which he will meet with Democratic activists in Las Vegas These are the concrete steps of a man preparing to run for president But thus far  that man  Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City  would prefer that his words speak louder than his actions  When asked if he plans to run for president  he gives the same answers  He is  not ruling anything out   and will consult with his family before making a decision  one that he says will come  sooner than later  Bank on sooner Mr  de Blasio has had two City Hall aides working on his tentative campaign on their own time  one of them  Mike Casca  is a veteran of Senator Bernie Sanders s 2016 presidential campaign  and worked in the senator s office The other mayoral aide helping Mr  de Blasio with his 2020 exploration is Jon Paul Lupo  last month  Mr  Lupo brought aboard Trilogy Interactive  a Washington  D C  based company that does digital fund raising and marketing for political campaigns and others  to assist the mayor s national political action committee  Fairness PAC Mr  de Blasio created Fairness PAC to fund national Democratic candidates  and to pay for his and his wife s political travel outside of New York  The fund raised just over  600 000 last year and has spent almost as much Stacey Bashara  a partner in Trilogy  said that the company s first task would be to reinvigorate and build out the PAC s email list  She said she has not spoken with the mayor  or discussed his potential 2020 run  The work we ve been hired to do is for Fairness PAC   Ms  Bashara said   There s been no conversation beyond that  His potential candidacy has not caused much enthusiasm  even in New York  A poll released this week from Quinnipiac University found that 76 percent of New York City voters believe the mayor should not run for president  Another 47 percent of voters surveyed said they think a de Blasio presidential run would be bad for the city  including 43 percent of Democrats ImageLast month  the mayor spoke to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington  D C CreditMark Wilson Getty ImagesNone of that seems to be deterring Mr  de Blasio  I m glad I could unify the people of New York City   the mayor said at a news conference on Thursday when asked about the Quinnipiac poll That was in keeping with his generally dismissive response to polls that point to his unpopularity   I have spent a lot of time in dead last in many a poll in many a race   the mayor told The New York Times after a January appearance in Iowa   It s not where you start  It s where you end  He repeated that message as recently as this week  when Mr  de Blasio appeared at the National Action Network s annual convention  a popular destination for presidential aspirants  Time and time again  people will tell you what you can t do   the mayor said   But don t let anyone tell you what you can t do  Don t let anyone talk you out of your own power  For all his public disregard of polls  Mr  de Blasio is no doubt aware that his chances of qualifying for the first of the Democratic presidential debates  which will take place in June  may hinge on how he does with poll respondents  Candidates can qualify either by meeting fund raising goals or by gaining at least 1 percent support in three polls of Democratic voters  by any of several organizations approved by the Democratic National Committee By that measure  Mr  de Blasio is two thirds of the way there  He met the 1 percent threshold in a poll released on March 11 by Monmouth University and another released on March 24 by Fox News  I feel like he s going to run   said Rebecca Katz  a former adviser to Mr  de Blasio and his family who is not currently attached to his exploratory bid   I think he wants to be talked about in a serious way  A  5 000 per plate fund raising breakfast on March 6 underscored the mayor s intentions  It was hosted by a real estate developer  Aby Rosen  whose company  RFR Holding  recently bought the Chrysler Building  This will be a private opportunity for a candid conversation with the mayor  who will share his insights and take your questions on the future of the New York City economy and the political trajectory of the Democratic Party  both nationally and locally   said the emailed invitation  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times It said that the mayor had  a lot of value to add on how to navigate successfully this fraught political moment  ImageMr  de Blasio seemed to enjoy the chance to sign autographs and talk with guests after the Asian   Latino Coalition in Des Moines in February CreditScott Morgan for The New York TimesA similar breakfast event took place Friday at the offices of Suffolk Construction in Boston  The company has been looking to expand its operations in New York  Later Friday  the mayor traveled to meet Democrats in Nevada  Read more about the fund raiser hosted by a company looking to expand its footprint in New York City  For what it s worth  Mr  de Blasio does seem to be enjoying himself on the prospective campaign trail  in contrast to his often dour demeanor when parrying with reporters in New York In Des Moines  Mr  de Blasio  a devoted Red Sox fan  signed a Yankees batting helmet for a young fan  He stayed so long speaking with people after a speech at the Asian   Latino Coalition PAC that his staff members had to pull him away so he would not miss his flight back to New York City On the trips to South Carolina and New Hampshire  the mayor was accompanied by his wife  Chirlane McCray  in New Hampshire  the couple visited the home where Ms  McCray s mother was raised  and she led a round table discussion about opioid abuse and mental illness  I ve never seen a political race that the mayor has been involved in   going back to the school board   where Chirlane wasn t a part of the decision making process  the strategy and the tactics   said Peter Ragone  a former top aide and now an informal adviser to Mr  de Blasio Mr  Ragone said he did not know whether Mr  de Blasio would run for president   But if you look at his record and who s in the Democratic primary  why shouldn t he consider it   Mr  Ragone said At the National Action Network  the civil rights group founded by the Rev  Al Sharpton  the mayor seemed extraordinarily animated  and talked about the  painful intersection of structural racism and income inequality   More Democratic candidates for president have been addressing issues of racial inequality  My mission when I became the mayor of the largest city in the nation was to show that the status quo was unacceptable   the mayor said   And isn t that a truth in our nation right now  Mr  Sharpton  a political ally of the mayor  said that Mr  de Blasio told him that he was exploring a run for president because he was being encouraged to do so The mayor did not say who was encouraging him  Mr  Sharpton said  In a crowded field he has some unique things  He s progressive and has management skills  The question is   Does he distinguish himself    Mr  Sharpton said   He s been underestimated before in the mayor s race  so I would not count him out   

WASHINGTON   The House passed legislation on Wednesday that would guarantee broadband internet users equal access to online content  in a crucial step toward bringing back so called net neutrality regulations overturned at the start of the Trump administration In a 232 to 190 vote  divided along party lines  the Democratic majority made good on a promise that became a rallying cry in many progressive circles during the 2018 election  It is also expected to be held up as an issue by Democrats in 2020 But the legislation  the Save the Internet Act  faces long odds in the Republican led Senate  The Senate leader  Mitch McConnell  said this week that the legislation would be  dead on arrival   Earlier this week  the Office of Management and Budget advised the White House to veto the law if it reached the president s desk  The office said in a letter that since the law had been overturned  the broadband industry had thrived  a good sign of how deregulation helped the economy The legislation would prohibit blocking and throttling web traffic and would categorize broadband as a service open to heavy regulation  Supporters say the regulation would prevent companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of content like videos  Opponents say it would strap broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast with heavy handed restrictions  and could lead to price controls  We need a law that puts a cop on the beat who will enforce the laws  because we can t just rely on internet providers to say this will be a free and open internet   Representative Frank Pallone  Democrat of New Jersey  said in an interview   No one believes them  ImageAjit Pai  chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  rolled back net neutrality rules in 2017 CreditJacquelyn Martin Associated PressThe Federal Communications Commission rolled back the country s net neutrality rules in November 2017  Shortly after  internet companies and public interest groups sued to overturn the action  which was led by Ajit Pai  the agency s chairman In addition  more than two dozen states have raced to create their own net neutrality laws  The Justice Department and telecommunications companies have  in turn  sued to block the state efforts Net neutrality  a regulatory idea hatched by academics  has been a decade long battle pitting Silicon Valley and consumer groups against the telecommunications sector  Companies like Google  Mozilla and Facebook have argued that without rules  telecommunications companies can become gatekeepers of online content by choosing the quality of the delivery of web services in a way that could hurt rivals and consumers  The Obama administration sided with their argument  with the F C C  approving new regulations in 2015 Now  the companies are pushing for a law on the issue  A group of 120 start ups  including Stripe  Medium  and GitHub  wrote a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders in support of the bill  Net neutrality is fundamental to guaranteeing that every American has unencumbered access to the internet   the companies wrote   This access is also essential to a competitive  free market for the technology economy to thrive as well as entrepreneurship in this country  The biggest disagreement between Republicans and Democrats is whether broadband should be considered a utility like phone service  Republicans say that doing so could lead to the possible regulation of broadband rates  Democrats say the categorization is an important update that recognizes the importance of broadband to the economy  culture and education  Some in Congress are trying to give the government more control again  applying utility style regulations that would threaten the internet as we know it  We should reject these efforts   Senator Roger Wicker  Republican of Mississippi  said on the Senate floor last week

TOKYO   Japan appears to have dodged a thanks to resilient business spending but tanking factory and export sectors and a lack of policy options leave it particularly vulnerable if a projected recovery in the global economy fails to materialise If domestic growth crumbles  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could postpone yet again a scheduled sales tax hike in October or offer a modest increase in fiscal spending  some analysts say The Bank of Japan  too  may be forced to ramp up monetary support  though many analysts say the central bank is left with few effective tools to prop up growth While the chances of such actions are small  they cannot be ruled out given Japan s exposure to economic swings in big export destinations like China  analysts say  Chances are fifty fifty that Abe may delay the sales tax hike again   said Takeshi Minami  chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute  who see a 70 percent chance Japan may slide into recession  If the sales tax is delayed  the BOJ would come under pressure for further easing  More extreme steps like using government spending as a primary policy tool to boost employment and spur inflation   an idea dubbed  Modern Monetary Theory   MMT  backed by some U S  academics and politicians   are off the table for now  government officials say  There is no sense that someone is going to latch onto this and push for a huge increase in fiscal spending   a government official with direct knowledge on economic policy making said  when asked by Reuters about MMT  However  the government s position is that fiscal and monetary policy need to work together   the official said  adding that the priority for government officials is to deal with any downside shocks with additional fiscal spending Factory output and exports slumped in January due to a bruising U S  China trade war  forcing the government to cut its economic assessment in March for the first time in three years But the government held off from declaring Japan in a recession  Central bank policymakers also saw relief in the BOJ s  tankan  survey last week that showed companies were maintaining their robust capital expenditure plans Still  government and central bank policymakers worry that the global slowdown  if it persists  may eventually prompt firms to delay investment  say sources familiar with their thinking  External headwinds aren t hurting capital expenditure yet  so Japan can still expect a second half rebound in growth   said one of the sources   But uncertainty is high   the source said  adding that much will depend on how quickly global growth   notably China s economy   will pick up Abe has said he will go ahead with a twice delayed increase in the sales tax rate to 10 percent from 8 percent in October unless a shock to the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 hits the global economy The government has already earmarked roughly 2 trillion yen   17 95 billion  in spending to mitigate the pain  raising the threshold to postpone the tax hike again  But some analysts say another delay could not be ruled out as Abe faces an upper house election in the summer The BOJ could be asked upon to ramp up stimulus  though it is running out of ammunition and facing criticism that prolonged easing is inflicting too much pain on financial institutions With the cost of its stimulus rising  the BOJ may be left to rely on words rather than action to bolster the business mood and prevent unwelcome yen rises that hurt exports  some analysts say  The BOJ is running out of options     It has to sound dovish to prevent the yen from rising   said Hiroaki Muto  senior economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center  The first step would be using forward guidance to show the direction is toward easing and normalisation is very much in the distance    1   111 4400 yen   Additional reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto and Kaori Kaneko  Editing by Sam Holmes

Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  Last night  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen found herself on the receiving end of what has become a common occurrence in the Trump era  pushed out of office unceremoniously  with her departure announced in a tweet Unlike some of the

circumstances  like a bad thing  In the Trump administration  though  some have seen it as the only way out while saving your reputation  Take Ms  Nielsen  for example  Though her legacy is likely linked with the president s policies on separating migrant families at the border  her dismissal allows her to argue that she objected internally   and lost the fight   over some of the president s

HARARE   Zimbabwe is to start paying compensation this year to thousands of white farmers who lost land under former president Robert Mugabe s land reform nearly two decades ago  the government said  as it seeks to bring closure to a highly divisive issue Two decades ago Mugabe s government carried out at times violent evictions of 4 500 white farmers and redistributed the land to around 300 000 black families  arguing it was redressing imbalances from the colonial era But land reform still divides public opinion as opponents see it as a partisan process that left the country struggling to feed itself  President Emmerson Mnangagwa s government sees the paying of compensation to white farmers as key to mend ties with the West  and set aside  17 5 million in this year s budget to that end  The initial payments will target those in financial distress  while full compensation will be paid later  The registration process and list of farmers should be completed by the end of April 2019  after which the interim advance payments will be paid directly to former farm owners   Zimbabwe s ministries of finance and agriculture said in a joint statement on Monday They said the process to identify and register farmers for compensation was being undertaken the Commercial Farmers Union  CFU  and a committee representing the farmers A committee comprising government officials and former farm owners is currently valuing improvements made on the farms  That process should end next month and will determine the full amount due to the farmers The government  which maintains it will only pay compensation for infrastructure and improvements on farms and not for the land  is talking to international financial institutions on options to raise the full amount to pay farmers Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980  while many blacks were landless   Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe  Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration plans to aggressively push for tougher screening of asylum seekers that will make it vastly more difficult for migrants fleeing persecution in their home countries to win protection in the United States  a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday The official said that President Trump ordered a shake up of his top immigration officials in recent days because they were moving too slowly  or even actively obstructing  the president s desire to confront the surge of migrants at the southwestern border  The asylum changes are among many policies the president wants to put into effect with a new team in place  the official said Mr  Trump denied on Tuesday that one of those changes would be to restart his policy of separating migrant families at the border  though he said that the act of taking children from their parents   which drew global condemnation before he abandoned it last summer   was effective  Now I ll tell you something  once you don t have it  that s why you see many more people coming   Mr  Trump said   They are coming like it s a picnic  because   Let s go to Disneyland   The administration official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity even as Mr  Trump was making his remarks  said a modified version of family separation  in which parents are given a choice of whether to be separated or to accept indefinite detention alongside their children  continues to be under consideration But the so called binary choice proposal is  not ripe for White House consideration  right now  he insisted  because the government does not currently have the detention space to hold families if the policy were put in place The asylum changes being envisioned could drastically alter the role that the United States plays as a refuge for people fleeing poverty  violence and war  American and international laws require it to allow migrants to request asylum once they come to the country But the official said that an initial assessment of the basis for a request for asylum   known as a  credible fear  screening   too often accepts the claim that the migrant was persecuted  The official also said that many more asylum seekers should be rejected during that first step Out of 97 728 completed interviews with migrants in the fiscal year that ended on Sept  30  2018  the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services confirmed a credible fear of persecution 74 677 times  according to an agency official Changes in the screening process could drastically lower those findings by requiring more proof from asylum seekers that they would be persecuted in their home countries  Screeners could also try to verify migrant claims by using State Department assessments of the threats that exist in those countries Immigrant rights advocates have feared for months that the administration would try to change the standards by which asylum seekers are judged in an effort to prevent more of them from coming into the United States The administration official blamed the delay in that effort on  deep state  bureaucrats at the Department of Homeland Security and even the president s own political appointees in the department  whom the official described as lacking the management skills to push Mr  Trump s agenda The official declined to name specific administration officials who have failed  But he made thinly veiled references to two top officials at the Department of Homeland Security  John Mitnick  the department s general counsel  and L  Francis Cissna  the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services He said there was  clearly a track record  in which the president s policies have not been advanced In his remarks on Tuesday  Mr  Trump falsely said that President Barack Obama had embraced the same policy of routinely separating migrant children from their parents at the border  President Obama had child separation   Mr  Trump said during brief remarks in the Oval Office  where he was meeting with President Abdel Fattah el Sisi of Egypt   I m the one that stopped it  Under Mr  Obama and President George W  Bush  immigration officials sometimes separated families when they had reason to question parentage or when there was evidence of child abuse  The Trump administration instituted a policy in which all families who crossed the border illegally were separated in order to allow the parents to be prosecuted under the administration s  zero tolerance  policy  More than 2 700 children were separated from their parents at the border before Mr  Trump ended the policy in June 2018  Fact check  Family separation at the border The president s comments come after he shook up the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security  forcing the resignation of the secretary  Kirstjen Nielsen  and top immigration officials in a move that signaled a pending shift in immigration policies Also on Tuesday  the acting deputy secretary of homeland security  Claire Grady  who was next in line by law to become the acting secretary  submitted her resignation  according to a Twitter post by Ms  Nielsen  Ms  Grady s resignation paves the way for Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  to take the role Customs and Border Protection officials this week underscored Mr  Trump s concern about illegal immigration by announcing that more than 103 000 migrants crossed the southwestern border in March without authorization  an increase from the more than 76 000 migrants who crossed in February  Just last month  we saw record numbers of family units and unaccompanied juvenile apprehensions in February  and unfortunately  March apprehension numbers are again record setting and cause dire concerns for us   said Brian Hastings  the chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Most of the migrants   92 000 of the 103 000   were apprehended by Border Patrol agents  meaning they crossed in between the ports of entry More than 53 000 of those migrants were members of a family  Mr  Hastings said  and most of those families were from Honduras  Guatemala or El Salvador In the first half of fiscal year 2019  Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 385 000 migrants on the border  more than double those apprehended during the same time last year Mr  Hastings said the Border Patrol can generally maintain 4 500 people in its custody  But it recently counted 13 000 migrants in its facilities  and he said the overflow has led to the release of families into cities along the border  Backups have resulted in individuals spending additional time in Border Patrol custody in increasingly crowded conditions   Mr  Hastings said On Tuesday  White House officials announced that the president would appeal a judge s ruling that blocked the administration s  Migrant Protection Protocols   which require some asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while they wait for their court cases Mr  Trump has recently commended Mexico for doing more to stem migration to the border  but the officials said they have not seen any effect on the number of people crossing it   The numbers aren t declining  in fact  we re still seeing 3 000 apprehensions per day   Mr  Hastings said Officials also revealed that among the tens of thousands of family members approaching the border each month  just 3 100 people who said they were traveling with relatives were found to have a fraudulent claim  Those people either said they had a child when the individual was over 18 or the group s members were not really related

Want climate news in your inbox  Sign up here for Climate Fwd   our email newsletter WASHINGTON   As the Trump administration prepares to drastically weaken Obama era rules restricting vehicle pollution  nervous automakers are devising a strategy to handle their worst case scenario  a divided American auto market  with some states following President Trump s weakened rules while others stick with the tougher ones The effort is increasingly urgent because the Trump administration has now settled on the key details of its rollback plan  according to two people familiar with the matter  The new rules would all but eliminate the Obama era restrictions  essentially freezing standards at about 37 miles per gallon  compared to 54 5 miles per gallon required by the current rules  The policy makes it a near certainty that California and 13 other states  collectively representing roughly one third of the United States auto market  will keep enforcing the stricter rules  splitting the national auto market in two Although Mr  Trump has billed his rollback as a boon to the auto industry  automakers say the split market outcome would be a logistical and financial nightmare for them  Their current strategy centers on selling completely different kinds of cars in different parts of the country   chiefly hybrids or electric vehicles in states like California  and less efficient SUVs  which American car buyers love  in other states But automakers recognize it would be easy for some buyers to simply cross state lines to buy what they want  We could see a scenario where there are limited choices for consumers in the high fuel economy states  or a stampede at the border to buy cars in the states that follow the federal standards   said Gloria Bergquist  a vice president at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  In that case  Ms  Bergquist said  states with stricter standards might have to create new rules against buying cars from other states   Because this is all such new territory  no one s quite sure how this is going to work   she said   We re trying to figure it out  But it s going to be a headache  Automakers have told White House officials that they dread this split market outcome  but it appears increasingly likely because California and the 13 other states that follow its strict state pollution rules have said they plan to sue the White House in order to keep the current standards in place The industry had initially asked Mr  Trump to loosen the auto pollution rules  which were among Mr  Obama s signature policies aimed at fighting climate change  However  the companies also asked that Mr  Trump strike a deal with California and the other states to maintain a single national standard  But the White House has stopped negotiating with California The administration has settled on the key details of its rollback  according to two people familiar with the terms  The plan  which is being jointly written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department  would require automakers to raise the fuel economy of their fleets by about 1 percent annually between 2021 and 2026  according to these people  That would be a sharp reduction from the 5 percent annual increase now required In addition  the Trump plan would also give automakers credits for using cleaner technologies  like more modern refrigerants in air conditioners  something that most already do  The Trump plan would also revoke the legal right of California and other states to set their own  stronger standards  setting up the legal clash between the federal government and the states The plan is expected to be published in the next few months  at which point it formally goes into effect  The president has made it clear he wants automakers to publicly support the rollback when it is announced   Every administration wants the industry to stand with them in the Rose Garden   Ms  Bergquist said   But regulatory certainty is really important for automakers  If the nation s auto market does get split in two  the challenge for automakers will come specifically in figuring out how to sell a radically different mix of cars in different states  For example  in states like California  automakers would have to demonstrate that the average mileage of all the cars they sell is much higher  about 54 miles per gallon by 2025  than in states like Utah  where the new Trump standard of about 38 miles per gallon would be in effect  But because Americans have shown a growing preference for SUVs over thriftier vehicles like electrics  manufacturers might have to significantly cut prices on electric vehicles in the high mileage states  a potentially money losing proposition for them  while raising the prices of gas guzzlers  Meanwhile  auto lots in low mileage states might hold a completely different mix of cars at different prices  If car buyers simply cross state lines to buy gas guzzlers and bring them into the cleaner standard states  it could create more regulatory headaches for the companies  which could also be subject to fines from high mileage states if they fail to comply Representatives of Ford and General Motors  who spoke on condition of anonymity because the administration s final plans have not been made public  said their companies felt torn between backing the Trump plan  which could hurt their bottom line  or opposing it and siding with California  which could bring retaliation from Mr  Trump In particular  automakers fear that the administration would retaliate against them by imposing trade sanctions like tariffs on auto imports  That could raise the cost of American vehicles  many of which are manufactured overseas A recent a draft report from the Commerce Department concluded that auto imports threaten national security  according to one person who viewed it  A final version of that report has been sent to the White House  and while it has not been made public  the conclusion that auto imports are a national security threat would pave the way for Mr  Trump to impose tariffs on auto imports  They will have to choose between Trump and California   said Margo T  Oge  a former senior E P A  official who works on auto pollution policy issues  If you go with Trump  it solves the short term temper tantrum and the threat of trade wars on the horizon   she said   But that is also taking a big legal risk  Because in the long term  California could win the legal fight to keep its state standards  Trump is right now  but California is forever  Mr  Trump has frequently turned to tariffs on foreign products as a wide ranging source of leverage to try to exact concessions from both foreign governments and multinational companies A senior White House official  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record  said the White House still hoped to have the auto industry s backing and was unaware of plans to use trade sanctions as leverage or punishment   The auto industry is important to the White House   the official said   The agencies are still working through the rule making process and no final decisions have been made  In interviews  California officials who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record  noted that California already has in place border laws requiring vehicles brought into the state to meet certain pollution standards  California is prepared to strike at any blow dealt our way and regardless of what comes next  we have laws in place to

the plan  they are months from completing the accompanying legal and technical documents required to justify such a major rule change  according to three people familiar with the plan  Those people noted that the process of creating the documents was stalled by the 35 day government shutdown earlier this year ImageAndrew R  Wheeler  administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency CreditSarah Silbiger The New York TimesThose document delays mean the final plan is unlikely to be made public until at least late spring or early summer  these people said  The release date is significant because it would prompt the expected legal battle  which is likely to end up before the Supreme Court  But if the plan isn t released until this summer  it means the legal challenges aren t likely to reach the Supreme Court during Mr  Trump s first term in office The risk is that  should a Democrat defeat Mr  Trump in his re election bid  the new administration could simply decline to defend the plan in court  The longer they wait on this  the easier it will be for the next administration to undo it   said Jody Freeman  a professor of environmental law at Harvard University who

settling in Las Vegas Now  25 years later  Mr  Pupo is following roughly the same path  Incredible   said Mr  Pupo  40  marveling at how his family s history was repeating itself I spoke with Mr  Pupo and his wife  Yaima Garca  37  this week in an evangelical church that had been converted into a temporary migrant shelter  The building  a cinder block warehouse that previously served as a hardware store  was tucked in a scrappy  semi industrial neighborhood of this border city in northern Mexico The couple s journey had come to an abrupt halt here a month ago when their quest for sanctuary in the United States ran up against the cold realities of the border  They are now among many thousands who are waiting in Ciudad Jurez and other border cities for their chance to apply for asylum in the United States It s a quirk of current migratory patterns that Mr  Pupo and Ms  Garca also find themselves among many other Cuban asylum seekers in Ciudad Jurez  By the estimates of government officials  as many as 70 percent of the more than 3 000 migrants waiting here to apply for asylum across the border in El Paso  are Cuban In other border cities  those waiting to cross are mostly Central Americans  The Cuban always tries to be in a group   Ms  Garca explained   I see it as a form of protection How Ciudad Jurez came to be the preferred crossing point for Cubans remains a mystery  But migrants say that it has the reputation for being safer for migrants and less crowded with asylum seekers than other popular crossing points  Word traveled through the Cuban migrant grapevine   in WhatsApp messaging groups  by phone and on social media While Cubans have been a common sight for years on the migrant trail through Mexico  their numbers rising and falling in response to events back home and shifts in American policy  the flow appeared to pick up in recent months Officials here in Ciudad Jurez said they began registering a sharp increase in the number of Cuban asylum seekers in late fall The Cubans  by and large  say they are fleeing political repression in the Caribbean nation  Cubans seeking sanctuary used to get special treatment in the United States  Under a policy known as  wet foot  dry foot   Cubans who made it to American soil were allowed to stay and eventually apply for permanent residency  But the Obama administration halted those privileges in January 2017  and since then Cuban asylum seekers have been like everyone else In Ciudad Jurez  they have run up against a Trump administration system that limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at ports of entry  This practice has given rise to informal waiting lists in border towns So  the Cubans and others are biding their time   in migrant shelters  in budget hotels and in cheap  rented rooms   and suppressing the impulse to hire a smuggler and cross illegally ImageErnesto Velasquez Lopez  from Cuba  cried tears of joy in Ciudad Jurez after receiving notice that his asylum case will be heard by the United States CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesMr  Pupo and Ms  Garca left Cuba on Feb  6  flew to Panama and traveled overland to Mexico  arriving in Ciudad Jurez on March 1 and finding their way to Solus Christus Church The shelter is overseen by Lilia and Rodolfo Barraza  who opened its doors to migrants on Feb  26 after local officials appealed for help in absorbing the flow of asylum seekers into the city Mr  Barraza  65  a pastor  said that initially he had been inclined to say no  but he remembered a biblical passage that described the moral obligation to do good  And when I thought of that biblical verse  I said   Bring them    Mr  Barraza recalled   And the next day they were here  The couple has hosted as many as 74 migrants at one time  jammed into a space suitable for far less  there are currently 38  all but one of them Cubans   The exception is a Venezuelan woman  Ms  Barraza  61  said that before they had opened their doors  she had never met a Cuban   But now I think they re beautiful   she said   We love them  They are our brothers and sisters  The symbolic focus of the space is a white board on which is written the waiting list number of the last migrant allowed to cross the border and present themselves to the American authorities  A migrant s number in line has become almost as important as any other piece of data in their life When a migrant s number is called and they successfully cross  it s a bittersweet moment for those who remain behind  They lose a traveling partner but move one step closer to their own appointment  It could be a week  two weeks  a month   Ms  Garca mused on a recent afternoon at the shelter The number on the board was 6995  Her number is 7533  Mr  Pupo s is 7534 For now  Mr  Pupo added   this is our refuge  Kirk is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border  Each week they ll be sharing a

week   When I walked in there  it ripped your guts out   he said   It made you cry  CreditAl Drago for The New York TimesMCALLEN  Tex    The Border Patrol s largest detention center has swelled in recent weeks amid an influx of migrant families from Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador  The processing center in the border city of McAllen has frequently exceeded its capacity  leading to mass releases of migrants that have overwhelmed nonprofit shelters The building  known informally as Ursula because of its Ursula Avenue address  has been criticized by immigrant advocates for holding migrants in large pens made of chain link fencing   Manny Fernandez  the New York Times Houston bureau chief  spoke to Senator Jon Tester  a Montana Democrat who spent more than an hour touring the Ursula facility last week The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation Q  What was it like A  I was there on Sunday  March 24   I m not going to talk to you like most Democrats will talk to you  I m going to tell you that  when I walked in there  it ripped your guts out  It made you cry  It did all those things that people say it did to you  because you had children and you had mothers  I looked at them as kids the same age as my grandkids  On the other side of the equation  there were a lot of people in a fairly small area  and the ventilation had to be pretty darn good because it didn t stink How many migrants were there at the time Twenty two hundred  And their capacity is 1 500 Did it feel overcrowded or just crowded Gosh  you re asking the wrong guy  because this is the first time I ve been in that processing center  It felt crowded Can you describe it It s a metal building that s insulated  Each one of the holding areas had a bathroom and a sink  They re held by sex  of course  And then the families were held in different steel cages  basically  Everybody had a blanket that wanted one  Mylar blankets  Most of them were laying down on mats  Some of them were standing up  Some of them were sitting on benches What were Border Patrol officials saying about all this They said they were processing them through as quick as they could  They said the manpower they were using here was manpower that they d rather have on the border  but nonetheless they had to process these folks  Look  I mean  I don t like prisons  I don t like holding people up  But the bottom line is that I don t have any better idea than the way they were doing it  and I asked them if they did and they didn t either  although they were tasked with trying to find a better way to do it  They were providing food and water and baby formula  and were treating these folks as good as they could treat them  in the conditions that were there  I m simply just not critical of Border Protection in this situation because I don t know what the solution is Some Democrats were calling the mass releases a manufactured attempt to fuel the crisis at the border narrative  Do you agree I don t think I can agree with it  Look  I m not a conspiracy theorist  I think I have to go with what I saw  and what I saw literally was a bunch of families in this facility and I think it is what it is right now  The direction I would take it is  what are the push factors in these countries that are pushing these families to our southern border Was Border Patrol cooperative during the tour They were absolutely cooperative  I ve been on these trips before  and I know for a fact they show you want they want you to see  But they were very cooperative Were the conditions horrible  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder  I guess  I don t think they were horrible  but by the same token it was gut wrenching to see mothers and children sitting there in cages It sounds like it was packed but people still had some room I don t know how many square feet each person needs to determine whether it was overflowed or packed or beyond the pale  I just know as I looked there  there was some space and people could mill around  although it was very crowded  It would drive me crazy  My nearest neighbor is a mile away  It would drive me nuts The president on the borderImageMexico supplies many of the avocados eaten in the United States CreditJustin Sullivan Getty ImagesPresident Trump visited a portion of the border wall in California on Friday  a day after backing off a threat to close the border with Mexico The president  floated the idea of closing the border last week   defending it repeatedly here and here   even as economic experts warned doing so could damage the economy  The agricultural and manufacturing industries would have been especially hard hit by a closing  including a potential avocado shortage  Instead  on Thursday  Mr  Trump said he would give Mexico a  one year warning  before closing the border  If the drugs don t stop or aren t largely stopped  we re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products  in particular cars   the whole ballgame is cars   he said   And if that doesn t stop the drugs  we close the border  Read earlier installments of Crossing the Border here  Sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox

NEW DELHI   The Indian government may have to make a series of major changes at the top of the nation s civil service if Prime Minister Narendra Modi is re elected to a second term in May  according to multiple sources in the administration At least eight senior bureaucrats in the prime minister s office have either sought a transfer to other departments or plan to take premature retirement  three government officials said  The officials  from the prime minister s office  the home  interior  ministry and the foreign ministry  declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject Two of them said they too are keen to be transferred to state capitals or to other jobs  They said officials in several ministries were trying to move  but did not have a number There are about 25 senior civil servants working in the prime minister s office  which under Modi has become the single most powerful department in government The three officials said the reasons for wanting out are almost all the same  Many top bureaucrats complained about two aspects of the Modi administration   their inability to influence government policy as it is largely controlled and set by the prime minister and a small group of ministers and advisers  and the demanding work schedule they face  The sense of partnership is missing  Modi and his ministers do not have an organic relationship with the bureaucrats   said the civil servant in the home ministry  Sanjay Mayukh  a spokesman for Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   declined to comment on the grounds that governance issues were managed directly by ministers A spokesman in the prime minister s office did not return phone calls seeking comment To be sure  some other major governments around the world often face a series of departures and changes  especially when a first term morphs into a second term  Also  just because an official talks about quitting doesn t mean they will  But in India  officials in the prime minister s office are hand picked for loyalty and tend to stay if the administration is re elected  Modi s BJP led alliance is tipped to win a slim majority in the April May general election  pollsters say  Senior bureaucrats said Modi s top down approach  and his orders to work on public holidays  to demand they submit details of their assets  and to clean their own workplaces at the start of a five year cleanliness campaign in 2014  has widened the gap between the civil servants and the nation s leader Amit Shah  a close aide of Modi and the head of the BJP  in a closed door meeting attended by two ministers in February said bureaucrats continued to suffer from  communist romanticism   a reference to the alleged influence of the left leaning Congress opposition party on the bureaucrats  The ministers  who spoke to Reuters  declined to be identified DISCONNECT WITH RULING PARTYFor some of the 5 000 or so mandarins who run the Indian government  its state owned entities  as well as administration at state government level  Modi s style of leadership has been a jolt  Many of these top officials have received a Western style education at India s elite universities or schools overseas and are uncomfortable with the ruling party s right wing Hindu nationalism and Modi s rough hewn approach to governance While getting into the Indian Administrative Service  IAS   is incredibly hard   only 1 out of about 4 500 who took the civil service exam got selected in 2018   traditionally once someone got in they had a job for life with few risks of ever getting fired  An IAS job   one of the most sought after in India   bestows huge power as well as cheap housing  a car with a driver and other perks  leave for government paid foreign study  and often the chance for plum positions in business or government consultative work after retirement  There is also a handsome pension But such conditions can also breed complacency and a lack of  can do  behavior  according to Indian politicians and civil servants  They say there are plenty of Sir Humphreys in New Delhi  referring to a character in the British TV comedy series  Yes Minister  about how top officials in Whitehall stall government policies they don t agree with  In particular  there is deep resentment in the top echelons of the Indian civil service over the interference in government by the Rashtriya Swayemsevak Sangh  RSS   the Hindu right wing umbrella group of which the BJP is a part  these officials said  RSS functionaries have had a major role in successfully lobbying for big changes at the Reserve Bank of India  for example  leading to last December s resignation of its governor and his replacement with an official who is considered more loyal to Modi  officials said  TECHNOCRATS  NOT GENERALISTSRSS figures also criticize Modi for not having enough professionally trained experts in place to implement some of his more controversial policies  The country needs a professional administration for economic development and can t depend on generalists   said Ashwani Mahajan  co convenor of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch  SJM   the economic wing of the RSS that has campaigned against some bureaucrats  Last year  Modi proposed bringing in at least ten professionals from the private sector into the civil service at the joint secretary level  but the plan has still to be implemented  and is facing strong resistance from civil servants  Joint Secretaries are two rungs below full Secretaries  the top civil servant in a ministry A senior finance ministry official said major policy decisions including demonetization  Modi s decision to wipe out high denomination bank notes without warning in 2016 and to hastily launch a goods and services tax that hit millions of small businesses and jobs  were examples of political decisions that didn t get enough airing among officials before being implemented  Both are thought to have hurt jobs growth  economists say  There is a wider concern in the civil service about India being ruled by a Hindu nationalist party that some see destroying the country s previous tolerant and secular nature But the hours are as much of a concern to some  I am looking out for other opportunities and have even requested for a transfer because it is almost impossible to work for 12 13 hours every day  even during weekends   said a senior official working with Modi since 2014   Reporting by Manoj Kumar  Rupam Jain   Editing by Martin Howell and Raju Gopalakrishnan  

CARACAS   Venezuela removed eight tonnes of gold from the central bank s vaults last week  and the cash strapped socialist state is expected to sell the bullion abroad as it seeks to raise hard currency in the face of U S  sanctions  a lawmaker and one government source said  With sanctions imposed by Washington choking off revenues from exports by state oil company PDVSA  President Nicolas Maduro s increasingly isolated administration has turned to sales of Venezuela s substantial gold reserves as one of the only sources of foreign currency The government source said the Central Bank s reserves had fallen by 30 tonnes since the start of the year before U S  President Donald Trump tightened sanctions  leaving the bank with around 100 tonnes in its vaults  worth more than  4 billion At that rate of decline  the central bank s reserves would nearly disappear by the end of the year  leaving Maduro s government struggling to pay for imports of basic goods Neither Venezuela s central bank nor its information ministry responded to requests for comment  Trump s administration has declared Venezuela part of a  troika of tyranny  in Latin America  including left leaning governments in Cuba and Nicaragua  It is seeking to cut off cash flow to Maduro s government  foster dissent in the armed forces and oust him from power in the OPEC nation The United States and 50 other Western nations have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela s legitimate president  Guaido invoked the Constitution in January to assume an interim presidency  saying Maduro s May 2018 re election vote was a sham  Maduro has branded Guaido a U S  puppet and accused him of collaborating with Washington to sabotage the economy Opposition lawmakers have blasted companies buying Venezuelan gold or holding it as collateral for loans  saying they are giving Maduro a financial lifeline during an economic and humanitarian crisis Aside from the reserves held by the Central Bank in Caracas  Guaido is attempting to freeze bank accounts and gold owned by Venezuela abroad  This includes 31 tonnes in the Bank of England worth an estimated  1 3 billion BLACKOUTS AND WATER SHORTAGESVenezuela s economy is in a sixth year of recession  suffering hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods like food and medicine  Maduro eased restrictions on foreign exchange this year  but the economy remains desperately short of hard currency needed to import goods Last week s operation took place while only high level officials were present at the central bank s offices  given that most rank and file employees stayed home due to blackouts and water shortages that have plagued Venezuela in the past month  the government source said   They moved gold out while the central bank was in contingency mode   opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado said  adding that the bars would be sold abroad  though he did not know the destination A similar quantity of gold was removed from the central bank s vaults in February  Washington in January asked foreign gold buyers to stop doing business with the Venezuelan government  This prompted Venezuela to cancel a planned sale of 29 tonnes of gold to the United Arab Emirates But in February and March the central bank continued to authorize the movement of gold  the government source said  adding that it was aiming to sell small quantities  Earlier this year  Abu Dhabi investment firm Noor Capital said it bought 3 tonnes of gold from Venezuela on Jan  21  but would not buy more until the situation in the country stabilized And in March  Ugandan authorities said they were investigating the country s biggest gold refinery over imports of an estimated 7 4 tonnes of gold   valued at around  300 million   after state run media reported it could have originated from Venezuela   Reporting by Mayela Armas  Writing by Luc Cohen  Editing by Daniel Flynn and David Gregorio  

SAN DIEGO   The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year  a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47 000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1  2017 and June 25  2018   the day before U S  District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families  The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation   for example  children under 5 The administration would provide information on separated families on a rolling basis to the American Civil Liberties Union  which sued to reunite families and criticized the proposed timeline on Saturday  We strongly oppose a plan that could take up to two years to locate these families   said Lee Gelernt  the ACLU s lead attorney   The government needs to make this a priority  Sabraw ordered last year that more than 2 700 children in government care on June 26  2018 be reunited with their families  which has largely been accomplished  Then  in January  the U S  Health and Human Services Department s internal watchdog reported that thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017  The department s inspector general said the precise number was unknown The judge ruled last month that he could hold the government accountable for families that were separated before his June order and asked the government submit a proposal for the next steps  A hearing is scheduled April 16 Sheer volume makes the job different than identifying children who were in custody at the time of the judge s June order  Jonathan White  a commander of the U S  Public Health Service and Health and Human Services  point person on family reunification  said in an affidavit White  whose work has drawn strong praise from the judge  would lead the effort to identify additional families on behalf of Health and Health and Human Services with counterparts at Customs and Border Protection and U S  Immigration and Customs and Enforcement  Dr  Barry Graubard  a statistics expert at the National Cancer Institute  developed a system to flag for early attention those most likely to have been separated The vast majority of separated children are released to relatives  but many are not parents  Of children released in the 2017 fiscal year  49 percent went to parents  41 percent to close relatives such as an aunt  uncle  grandparent or adult sibling and 10 percent to distant relatives  family friends and others The government s proposed model to flag still separated children puts a higher priority on the roughly half who were not released to a parent  Other signs of likely separation include children under 5  younger children traveling without a sibling and those who were detained in the Border Patrol s El Paso  Texas  sector  where the administration ran a trial program that involved separating nearly 300 family members from July to November 2017 Saturday marks the anniversary of the administration s  zero tolerance  policy to criminally prosecute every adult who enters the country illegally from Mexico  The administration retreated in June amid an international uproar by generally exempting adults who come with their children  The policy now applies only to single adults

HAVANA   Hundreds of Cubans marched peacefully through Havana calling for an end to animal cruelty on Sunday in what organizers believe was the first independent march authorized by the one party state Accompanied by their pets  the activists carried placards calling for an animal protection law and chanted  down with animal abuse  as they walked through the central district of Vedado to the surprise of curious onlookers That the Communist government authorized ordinary citizens to stage the march could point to an expanding tolerance for Cubans to express their views and even make demands  albeit still within limits  analysts and participants said Authorities still crack down on opposition attempts to hold demonstrations and detain dissidents who they say are subversives in the pay of the United States  however It was ironic that the first authorized independent march would be in support of animal and not human rights  but it could be a pilot test for greater freedoms  some march participants said   This could be the new Cuba   said organizer Beatriz Batista  a 21 year old communications student who received a permit for the march from the municipal authority of her Havana borough Others were more skeptical  This enables the government to say  look how permissive we are   But is it really   said dissident artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara  who was briefly detained last week over a piece he plans to show on the sidelines of the upcoming Havana Biennial Previous marches have been largely restricted to those organized by the government to celebrate Cuba s 1959 leftist revolution or criticize its Cold War foe  the United States  religious processions  and an annual march by gay rights activists under the umbrella of a government organization While physical public spaces in Cuba remain tightly controlled  a recent expansion of internet access in what was long one of the western hemisphere s least connected countries has allowed citizens to mobilize more in the virtual realm  Sunday s event was publicized on social media and independent online media  Social media has really brought about miracles   Batista said The government appears to have become more tolerant of and even responsive to online activity since Miguel Diaz Canel last April replaced Raul Castro as president last April In December  the government postponed the full implementation of a decree clamping down on the arts after an online campaign protesting the law  and rowed back on regulations governing the private sector after entrepreneurs and experts complained Some participants said they hoped in Sunday s march signaled that people would now be able to take to the streets as well as the web  Let s hope this opens the door for more people to be able to hold such initiatives   said Cuban artist Abu Tamayo   Reporting by Sarah Marsh  Editing by Sonya Hepinstall

WASHINGTON   After President Trump told reporters last week that he would like to nominate Herman Cain to fill a spot on the Federal Reserve board  Mr  Cain posted a video to his Facebook page confirming the news  He quickly referred to the sexual harassment allegations that had torpedoed his 2012 presidential campaign  and were already complicating his possible Fed appointment  You better believe that the people who hate me  who do not like conservative Republicans  are digging up all the stuff that s been in storage from eight years ago   said Mr  Cain  a former restaurant executive who now contributes to a conservative news site and runs a  Super PAC  that supports Mr  Trump  So be it  Let them go back and dig up eight year old stuff   he continued   I will be able to explain it this time  where they wouldn t let me explain it last time  They were too busy believing the accusers  I m not mad  y all  I m just not going to let the accusers run my life  determine my career  Prospective nominees for top government jobs  like the Fed  typically lie low while they wait for Senate confirmation  That has not been the case for Mr  Cain or Stephen Moore  the economic adviser to Mr  Trump whom the president also plans to nominate for a Fed seat Since being floated for the job  both men have kept talking  And talking While they undergo White House vetting ahead of what Mr  Trump promises will be formal nominations  both Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain have offered near daily commentary   largely to conservative audiences   on politics  monetary policy and a wide range of social issues  At several times  they have sought to cast what promises to be a bruising confirmation fight as a war on Mr  Trump s supporters and conservative principles Fed watchers say the media blitzes are unusual  if not unprecedented  and are probably intended to impress Mr  Trump  But they could also alienate the senators who must confirm them On Tuesday  Republican senators indicated they were having serious misgivings about Mr  Cain s nomination  During their weekly lunch  several Republicans raised the issue of the nominations  questioning the wisdom of floating Mr  Cain and Mr  Moore without consulting the Senate first and before both could be vetted  according to a person who was in the room Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  told lawmakers during the lunch that if they had concerns about specific names being floated  they should let the White House know ImageStephen Moore  a former Trump campaign adviser and conservative economist  has offered nearly daily commentary on politics  monetary policy and social issues since his name was floated for a Fed post CreditTom Williams CQ Roll Call Before the president starts floating names for D H S     the Department of Homeland Security    or the Federal Reserve  we need to have a conversation about who is actually confirmable up here   said Senator John Cornyn  Republican of Texas  after emerging from the weekly lunch   We need to make sure these are people who can get confirmed before they are floated  That way we spare everybody the embarrassment  Senator John Thune of South Dakota  the second ranking Republican  who is responsible for gathering votes  told colleagues on Tuesday that getting Mr  Cain confirmed would be virtually impossible  and that the White House should reconsider  according to a person familiar with his comments Asked about Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain on Tuesday  Mr  McConnell said only that the Senate would  look at  anyone the president nominated  We ve got to look at whoever the president sends up   he said   It s his choice to decide  and once he makes the nomination we ll take a look at it  Tim Duy  a University of Oregon economist who has criticized both potential nominations  said the running commentary from both men was not likely to help their chances  There s never been a reality show Fed nominee  and that s what we ve got now   he said  Traditionally   once you ve been nominated  or you re about to be nominated  you go radio silent   and you go radio silent for a reason  You don t want to say things that jeopardize your chance of moving forward  Just hours after Mr  Trump said he wanted to nominate Mr  Moore to the Fed  the potential nominee appeared on Bloomberg TV  where he talked about his views on monetary policy and the Fed s approach  Mr  Moore wrote a Washington Examiner op ed this week arguing that the Fed should cut interest rates  while also blaming low rates for the 2008 financial crisis  Mr  Moore has also appeared at a film screening  debated a more liberal economist on technology policy  spoken to conservative groups and been a frequent guest on conservative talk shows in the weeks since his name was floated  He often presses his case that the economy is experiencing deflation  as measured in commodity prices  though Labor Department data show overall prices are continuing to increase  Show me anywhere where prices are rising and I guarantee you talk to farmers  you talk to the people in the oil patch  they don t see any inflation   Mr  Moore said Monday on the radio program hosted by the Fox News personality Sean Hannity   They see their prices falling  During the program  Mr  Hannity mused that  it s almost like the Fed was helping President Obama politically and then it almost seems like  Trump s president  what do we care if it impacts the economy   That s the feeling I got  Am I wrong  ImageSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  advised his fellow Republicans that if they had concerns about specific names being floated  they should tell the White House CreditSarah Silbiger The New York Times Look   Mr  Moore replied   there may be some truth to that  In an interview on Tuesday  Mr  Moore nodded to his long career as a writer and commentator on economic issues  and suggested his public comments were helping him make the case for his preferred monetary policy while allowing him to work out how it might be carried out  I m already on record in terms of what I m for   Mr  Moore said   I feel like I m not revealing anything that I haven t been   I m the first one to admit   he added   I have a lot to learn about how this all works   what tools the Fed has available to them  On Friday  Mr  Cain told viewers of  The Herman Cain Show   which is posted daily online  that he was undergoing an F B I  background check that spanned  50 years  of his career in business  He said the White House had asked for records from the last three years of speeches he had given   I said   I can t count them  I don t remember them all   Those musings were sandwiched between technology tips for Mr  Cain s viewers    50 percent of what you see on social media is garbage    drawn from a talk he had recently given to a group of Burger King franchisees  and  later  Mr  Cain s complaints that the news media refers to Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  Democrat of New York  as A O C  Why don t they call me H C  in the press   Mr  Cain asked   I would like that  Nobody has that  I want to have my initials in the media also  Ms  Ocasio Cortez is a frequent topic in Mr  Cain s videos and on his Facebook page  where he posts links to stories from his news outlet  Western Journal  He often adds captions like  What s a little criminality among Democrats  In one post last week  referring to a story about the Nation of Islam leader  Louis Farrakhan  Mr  Cain appeared to criticize the Twitter ban of the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones   So  why are things like Alex Jones and telling people to code unacceptable to Twitter   Mr  Cain wrote   but this scumbag bigot is still given a platform  Antonia Ferrier  a Republican consultant and former aide to Mr  McConnell  said the public statements fit a pattern from Mr  Trump s administration  particularly since Mr  Trump has not yet nominated either man  This White House doesn t follow the traditional norms of a nominations process   nor do its nominees   she said   So it really shouldn t be a surprise that these two gentlemen are focusing on the media and the audience of one in the Oval Office

LONDON   British lawmakers endorsed Prime Minister Theresa May s request to the European Union to delay Brexit until June 30 at a vote in parliament on Tuesday  adding weight to the pitch she will make to EU leaders in Brussels  The majority of May s Conservative Party voted alongside the opposition Labour Party to back the prime minister s approach by 420 votes to 110  The main rebellion came from pro Brexit Conservatives who want Brexit to happen sooner   We should all be very clear what this extension would be for   it is all about making sure we leave the EU in a timely and orderly way and that means leaving with a deal   government Solicitor General Robert Buckland said ahead of the vote The debate came as May traveled to Berlin and Paris to drum up support for her request for more time to try and find a new plan for Britain s EU exit that can command the support of her political opponents at home  The vote itself was the culmination of an unprecedented power grab in parliament by lawmakers who this week passed a law against the government s wishes  seeking guarantees that May would not let Britain leave the EU without a deal on April 12  But because May has already requested a delay  and with no alternative dates chosen to be voted on by lawmakers on Tuesday  the vote was not a major flashpoint in the country s long running political crisis over how to deliver Brexit Nevertheless  the process of passing a law to trigger Tuesday s debate has further undermined May s political authority  proving parliament is able and willing to circumvent the government if they disagree with her choices on Brexit Labour Party junior Brexit spokesman Matthew Pennycook said his party supported May s extension plan  but warned the extra time must be used to try and find a compromise with Labour and not to pass her own thrice rejected deal at a fourth attempt   The public will not forgive the government if an extension is sought and agreed under the pretence of efforts to secure cross party compromise   he said   Additional reporting by Elizabeth Piper  Kate Holton and Alistair Smout  editing by Stephen Addison  

ROME   Italy will probably raise its 2020 budget deficit goal to around 2 1 percent of gross domestic product when it publishes new targets this week  three government sources told Reuters  and the figure could be hiked again after the summer Italy  whose public debt is proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece s  is struggling to hold its finances in check while keeping costly promises made by the populist ruling coalition The new forecasts will be presented in the annual Economic and Financial Document  DEF  due to be issued by Wednesday  which sets the framework for the 2020 budget The current 2020 deficit target  set in December  is 1 8 percent of GDP  down from 2 04 percent this year  but a recent economic downturn means both years will have to be revised up Next year s GDP growth will be trimmed to just below 1 percent from the current forecast of 1 1 percent  two of the sources said  They asked not to be named because they are not authorised to talk about the DEF The numbers in the DEF will not be finalised before the end of ongoing talks between the ruling coalition of the anti establishment 5 Star Movement and the right wing League The government will update its targets again in September  when it will have to find a way to avoid some 23 billion euros   25 81 billion  of hikes in sales tax scheduled to take effect in 2020  but which the ruling parties have promised to scrap Claudio Borghi  the League s economics spokesman  suggested last month the government might cancel the sales tax hikes simply by increasing public borrowing  which would raise the deficit above the EU s 3 percent of GDP ceiling This is sure to be resisted by Economy Minister Giovanni Tria  an academic who is not a member of either ruling party Promised tax cuts  championed in particular by the League  add to Tria s difficulties in keeping a lid on the deficit The government will gradually lower income tax and simplify the system by reducing the number of tax bands from five to two  and cut the company tax rate to 20 percent  according to a draft National Reform Programme seen by Reuters  which will be published alongside the DEF This year s GDP growth forecast will be probably be cut to 0 3 percent or 0 4 percent from 1 0 percent  and the deficit will be raised to around 2 3 percent  Reuters reported on April 3  citing government sources The DEF will attempt to set the public debt on a declining path from last year s record of 132 1 percent of GDP  Tria said last week  though the economic slowdown makes the task harder  On Tuesday statistics bureau ISTAT will issue revised debt figures for 2018 and 2017  which are expected to show an even higher debt to GDP ratio   Writing by Gavin Jones  Editing by Catherine Evans

BUCHAREST   The European Commission  with the approval of euro zone governments  will set priorities for the yet to be created euro zone budget  EU finance ministers agreed on Friday  in an effort to balance national and EU powers over the new pool of money The discussion is the latest  small step in the euro zone s long standing drive for deeper economic integration that is to make the 19 countries sharing one currency more resilient to economic crises in the future The 28 countries that now form the European Union already have a shared EU budget  that is set every seven years and equal to 1 percent of the bloc s gross national income But euro zone countries also want to have a separate euro zone budget  which would serve as a fiscal tool to intervene in the euro zone economy alongside the single monetary policy of the European Central Bank Detailed work on the construction of such a euro zone budget has been under way from the start of the year and is to finish in June by when the ministers will also have decided on the budget s size and sources of financing At the meeting on Friday  ministers discussed the governance of the budget    a complex issue because euro zone governments want to retain control over how the money would be spent  They agreed in December to provide  criteria and strategic guidance   But they have also agreed that it must be part of the broader and bigger long term EU budget and that they would determine its size  in the context of  the EU budget  There is broad support for making appropriate links between the budgetary instrument and     the euro area recommendations   the chairman of euro zone finance ministers Mario Centeno told a news conference referring to recommendations for the euro zone economy issued annually by the Commission But to balance the Commission s power  the recommendations have to be approved by euro zone finance ministers  The final text of the recommendations has sometimes changed in the past  when governments disagreed with Commission views  The euro area recommendations would set the direction and identify the areas of reform and investment that should be followed   one euro zone official close to the talks said  This would then be trickled down to national recommendations  and the budget would support initiatives  reforms and projects linked to these recommendations   he said  The euro area recommendations would need to beefed up  They would be much more pointed and operational  Because there would be money at the end of that line   the official said Centeno said the strategic guidance role for the euro zone governments would have to be codified but there was still no consensus on how to do it best   Some prefer an Inter Governmental Agreement  others prefer to develop legal arrangements within the EU law  We will come back to this issue next month   he said   Reporting by Jan Strupczewski  Editing by Alison Williams  

PARIS   France s opposition Socialist Party on Tuesday said it had enough support in parliament to start the process of forcing a national referendum on the government s plan to privatise airport operator ADP  a Socialist lawmaker said The next threshold that must be met for a referendum on the possible privatisation of ADP is for a nationwide petition to garner 4 5 million signatories The sale of all or part of the state s 50 6 percent stake in ADP is part of the government s strategy to cut the budget deficit and finance a long promised 10 billion euro  8 62 billion pounds  innovation fund In March  the National Assembly  where Macron s En Marche party holds a strong majority  approved draft legislation for the possible privatisation of ADP  lottery operator Francaise des Jeux and for a reduction in France s stake in utility Engie The bill was then rejected by the opposition led Senate and returns back to the lower house this week  where it will likely be definitively approved on Thursday While the government would welcome the financial windfall that would be generated by the sale of its ADP stake  the move is politically delicate  Many opposition lawmakers and voters disapprove of handing control of the strategic asset to the private sector Socialist member of parliament Boris Vallaud said that 197 lawmakers from both the right and left had given support to launching procedures for a referendum on the issue  Only 185 signatures were needed   Reporting by Elizabeth Pineau  Writing by Richard Lough  Editing by Leigh Thomas  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration announced on Friday its latest round of economic sanctions against the government of President Nicols Maduro of Venezuela  this time aimed at oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba  a country that the administration has accused of propping up Mr  Maduro s authoritarian government In a speech to the Venezuelan exile community in Houston  Vice President Mike Pence announced that the United States is levying sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Petrleos de Venezuela  S A   Venezuela s state run oil company  as well as on two international companies that transport Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba  Venezuela s oil belongs to the Venezuelan people   said Mr  Pence  who is expected to address the United Nations Security Council next week on the situation in Venezuela The goal of the sanctions  senior administration officials said  was to force a  recalibration  of the relationship between Venezuela and Cuba  which  alongside China and Russia  has been defending the Maduro government But in the short run  they are meant to end the arrangement by which the Maduro government provides oil to Cuba in exchange for intelligence and counterintelligence services while the Venezuelan people lack food  medicine and clean water  Venezuela has been shipping 20 000 to 50 000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba  according to experts in the oil industry and administration officials Russ Dallen  the managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets  who specializes in the Venezuelan oil industry  said the most likely outcome of the sanctions would be to create an atmosphere in which shipping companies would be even more wary of doing business with either Cuba or Venezuela  for fear of triggering sanctions He said they were also meant to  name and shame  companies that have transported Venezuelan oil to Cuba so that Mr  Maduro can help an ideological ally rather than use profits from the oil to feed a starving population  It makes Cuba and Venezuela even more radioactive   he said Mr  Dallen  who tracks oil shipments leaving Venezuela  said that some of the ships had begun turning off their transponders when in Venezuelan ports  something regulations prohibit but is a technique used in countries like Iran to conceal their presence in the country  One ship  Mr  Dallen said  had recently left its transponder off until it reached Europe The sanctions come as Venezuela has faced a month of blackouts that have resulted in an estimated loss of a week s oil production President Trump has thrown his support behind Juan Guaid  the Venezuelan opposition leader  who in January declared himself the country s interim president and who has demanded Mr  Maduro s departure  Venezuela s economy and population have slipped further into crisis   with blackouts  as well as food and water shortages   while Mr  Maduro and Mr  Guaid appear to be trying to wait each other out A senior administration official said on Friday that the latest round of sanctions would  tighten the noose of the financial strangulation of Maduro and his cronies   Those sanctions come weeks after the Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on a Russia based bank that it accused of helping Mr  Maduro s government sidestep American financial penalties But it has been more than two months since the Trump administration began imposing sanctions in Venezuela in hopes of pushing Mr  Maduro s government out of power  But to people living in Caracas  the capital  it is not clear that his grip on power is loosening  despite the American effort to target governors  generals and the state run oil company and to cancel visas for Mr  Maduro s friends and family members The American official said that there would be more actions by the United States in the coming weeks and that a military response continued to be a  very serious option   The official hinted that a red line for American intervention would be any threat to arrest Mr  Guaid

by State Senator Kevin de Len  an unsung hero of the green movement  mandated that power companies steadily increase carbon free electricity on their grid until it reaches 100 percent by 2045  As David Roberts wrote for Vox  de Len kept  the bill simple and direct enough to command broad support    Somehow  everyone saw themselves in S B  100  Labor and business  nukes and renewables  markets and mandates  cats and dogs   somehow the bill hit the sweet spot  It contained enough substance to matter  but not so many bells and whistles that everyone found something to hate  The law sets a steadily rising standard for California power generation companies  50 percent renewables by 2026  60 percent renewables by 2030 and 100 percent carbon free   so as to include energy sources that aren

play  plus whatever new clean power gets invented  And the steadily rising California standard guarantees they ll all have a growing market to sell into A Green Real Deal would be a nationwide effort to inspire and enable Democrats and sensible Republicans to come up with state and local versions of S B  100 and thereby stimulate America s earth race   not space race   to get to national net zero emissions by 2045  or earlier It could garner a lot of G O P  support in wind states  businesses could make money off it  and it would put Trump totally on the defensive As Moniz and Karsner wrote in

BERLIN   German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will urge financial leaders next week to strive for a minimum level of corporate taxation globally and increase debt transparency in developing countries  a senior German government official said on Friday The talks in Washington will be dominated by political risks such as trade disputes and Britain s departure from the European Union  said the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity Scholz  who is likely to face calls to increase fiscal stimulus to counter the effect of a slowing economy  will tell allies that Germany s large current account surplus will shrink gradually due to vibrant domestic demand  rising real wages and increased state spending  the official added  This won t happen rapidly  this will happen step by step   the official said Germany expects its current account surplus  by far the largest in the world  to shrink to the equivalent of 6 8 percent of its economic output next year from 7 3 percent this year Finance ministers and central bank governors of the world s 20 biggest economies are due to meet in Washington next week with the state of the global economy and political risks to growth at the top of the agenda In a preview of the April 12 14 IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings  International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Tuesday that global growth has lost momentum amid rising trade tensions and tighter financial conditions Scholz sees a minimum level of corporate taxation globally as an important step to prevent digital companies such as Google  Facebook and Amazon from booking profits in low tax countries rather than where their customers are located The government official said that the talks in Washington should bring progress on this front and that Scholz hoped for an agreement among the members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  by mid 2020 Scholz is also expected to urge China and other countries to share more information about their lending in other countries to increase debt transparency China has become one of the largest lenders in emerging markets  but it is not a member of the Paris Club of government creditors   Reporting by Michael Nienaber  editing by Thomas Seythal and Alexander Ratz  

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main challenger Benny Gantz both claimed victory in Israel s election on Tuesday  Israeli TV exit polls produced differing results about who will emerge as the leader of the largest single party  and the polls have been wrong in the past So both sides still have all to play for  However  there are indications that Netanyahu has a clearer path to forming a coalition government with other right wing  far right and religious parties Here s a quick guide to what happens next HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE THE RESULTS TO COME IN  Final results are expected by Friday  but partial results are published by the Knesset as the vote counting proceeds  so a clearer picture will begin to emerge before the final tally  HOW ARE RESULTS CALCULATED AND WHY DOES IT TAKE TIME Israel has a parliamentary system  which means voters choose from party lists of candidates to serve in the 120 seat Knesset  No party has won a majority since Israel s first election  in 1949  In the 2019 election  about 6 million Israelis are eligible to vote  To enter parliament  a party must pass a threshold of at least 3 25 percent of the national vote  equivalent to 4 Knesset seats With 40 parties running  of which at least 12 have a real chance of passing the threshold  the calculations take time  WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE PUBLISHED  Israel s president will consult with the leaders of every party that won seats about their preference for prime minister  and will then choose the legislator who he believes has the best chance of putting together a coalition The nominee  who does not necessarily have to be the head of the largest party  has up to 42 days to form a government  If he or she fails  the president asks another politician to try  The leading candidates usually have a good idea whether they have majority support before they meet with the president  but things can often change in the process of deal making  WHAT SORT OF COALITION COULD BE FORMED Netanyahu will likely seek a coalition similar to his current government  with ultranationalist and Jewish Orthodox parties  Gantz  who heads the centrist Blue and White Party  will likely have the support of the left wing parties  But early exit polls predict that even with that he would fall short of a governing majority  HOW LONG UNTIL A GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE Past coalition negotiations have often dragged on  Whoever is asked to form the next government will have to accommodate numerous parties  unless Netanyahu and Gantz choose to join forces and form a unity government  WHAT OTHER FACTORS ARE THERE Netanyahu s corruption cases  The prime minister is facing possible indictment in three graft cases  and may learn later this year if he will be formally charged  That could weaken his hand in negotiations with potential coalition partners who may condition their support  should he be indicted  on Netanyahu meeting their demands for cabinet posts and policy concessions The attorney general is expected to hand down his decision by the end of 2019  If Netanyahu is charged  his political allies will have to decide whether to continue supporting him  There is no guarantee that they will Netanyahu denies wrongdoing in all three cases and has the opportunity to convince the attorney general not to charge him in a pre trial hearing  which is expected in July Another factor to watch is that U S  President Donald Trump is expected to release his long awaited Middle East peace plan some time after the election  So far he has been a close ally of Netanyahu  but if he asks Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians  especially anything involving ceding land  some of Netanyahu s far right allies will be furious  Gantz has vowed to pursue peace but has stopped short of endorsing Palestinian statehood   Reporting by Maayan Lubell  Editing by Stephen Farrell and Sonya Hepinstall

President Trump  reversing an agreement negotiated by the Obama administration  abruptly ended a deal between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that had eased the path for players to compete in the United States without defecting from their country The Trump administration said that the deal constituted a violation of trade laws because the Cuban federation was part of the government in Havana   a departure from the previous administration s stance In a letter to M L B  s outside counsel  which was obtained by The New York Times  Nikole Thomas  the acting assistant director for licensing at the Office of Foreign Assets Control  outlined the U S  government s opposition to the deal  which stipulated that the Cuban federation would receive 25 percent of a player s signing bonus for a minor league player and between 15 and 25 percent for a major league player The letter said that the O F A C  had  determined that M L B  s payments to the Cuban Baseball Federation are not authorized  because  a payment to the Cuban Baseball Federation is a payment to the Cuban government  News of the administration s rejection of M L B  s plan was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and ESPN Cuban sports entities  including its baseball federation and Olympic committee  have argued they are independent of the central government  but the Trump administration rejected that assessment  The U S  does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society   said Garrett Marquis  a spokesman for the National Security Council   The administration looks forward to working with M L B  to identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents  and not as property of the Cuban state  In a statement  M L B  said   We stand by the goal of the agreement  which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba  One M L B  official  who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter  said the league had requested a face to face meeting with U S  government agencies but were not granted one  M L B  was prepared to base its argument on the fact that the Obama administration had given it a license in 2016 to do business with the Cuban baseball federation  and that a Trump era national security presidential memorandum published on June 16  2017 promised the agreement would be grandfathered in  The memorandum stated that any new regulations  will not affect existing contracts and licenses  Several U S  business entities  including travel and telecommunications companies  do business in Cuba  But M L B  officials worried that  as a high profile organization  its deal would be challenged by hard liners in the government John Bolton  the national security adviser  seemed to foreshadow the move on Sunday when he tweeted   Cuba wants to use baseball players as economic pawns   selling their rights to Major League Baseball  America s national pastime should not enable the Cuban regime s support for Maduro in Venezuela  Cuba has produced some of the best players currently in the major leagues  including Aroldis Chapman of the Yankees  Yoenis Cespedes of the Mets and Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox  They and most other Cuban players in M L B  left their country illegally  in some cases smuggled out by disreputable agents and human traffickers on speedboats and rafts over dangerous waters  It s bad in the sense that they can t come anymore in the formal  legal way that was planned   Chapman said on Monday For some players  the dangers continued after they arrived because they were at the mercy of the smugglers  To this date  I am still harassed   Abreu  who has played for the Chicago White Sox since 2014  said in a statement issued at the time the deal was announced in December M L B  and its players union sought to eliminate that dangerous process by creating a posting system similar to the one used with players from Japan and South Korea  Under the plan  a major league team seeking to sign a Cuban player would pay a posting fee to the Cuban federation  which would in turn allow the player to leave the country and return home at will  Just days ago  the Cuban federation released the names of 34 players it said were eligible to sign with M L B  The objective of the agreement  which is the product of years of negotiations with the F C B   is to end the dangerous trafficking of Cuban baseball players who desire to play professional baseball in the United States   M L B  s lawyers said in their petition to the Treasury Department in January M L B  and the Cuban baseball federation commenced talks after the United States and Cuba began a thaw in relations under the Obama administration in 2014  Soon after that  baseball s commissioner s office secured a license from the Treasury Department to legally begin negotiations with the Cubans After announcing its agreement in December  M L B  quietly sought to convince administration officials   who immediately criticized the plan publicly   that it fit within the guidelines for an exemption to the trade laws  At the same time  M L B  officials were also resigned to the political opposition to the deal and the possibility of returning to the old method of signing Cuban players  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration on Monday scrapped a historic agreement between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that would have allowed Cuban players to sign with U S  teams without needing to defect The existing deal will not be allowed to go forward because it was based on an erroneous ruling by the former Obama administration that the Cuban Baseball Federation was not part of Cuba s Communist government  a senior U S  official said The move essentially overturns an agreement reached between MLB and the Cuban federation in December after three years of negotiation under which Cuban players would have had a safe  legal path to playing professionally in the United States  In the past  some Cuban stars have undertaken risky escapes  including being smuggled off the island in speedboats The U S  decision was the latest step by President Donald Trump to roll back the rapprochement with Havana  America s old Cold War foe  that was spearheaded by his predecessor  Barack Obama  Trump has especially stepped up pressure on Cuba recently over its support for Venezuela s socialist president  Nicolas Maduro  The agreement with  MLB seeks to stop the trafficking of human beings  encourage cooperation and raise the level of baseball   the Cuban Baseball Federation said on Twitter   Any contrary idea is false news  Attacks with political motivation against the agreement achieved harm the athletes  their families and the fans  The senior Trump administration official suggested that the agreement would have subjected the players to  human trafficking  by the Cuban government  making them  pawns of the Cuba dictatorship  Carlos Tabares  a member of Cuba s 2004 Olympic gold medal winning squad who until last year played for a Havana team  said the Trump administration was seeking  to destroy us  even through baseball   The MLB deal  he said  would have allowed Cuban players  to enter legally rather than falling into the hands of traffickers and having to risk their lives  The U S  official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the administration would be willing to work with MLB to seek an arrangement consistent with U S  law  We are unsure of the next steps   an MLB source said The announcement came just days after the Cuban federation released its first list of 34 players authorized to sign contracts directly with major league teams  A PAYMENT TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT The U S  Treasury Department on Monday reversed the Obama era ruling that Cuba s league was not part of the Cuban government  which had laid the groundwork for the baseball deal The Trump administration considers the Cuban Baseball Federation to be part of the island s National Sports Institute  which  according to the U S  official  is a government entity that U S  law says makes such business dealings illegal  A payment to the Cuban Baseball Federation is a payment to the Cuban government   Treasury said in a letter to MLB Cuba maintains  however  that its baseball federation is not part of the state  It says the federation falls under the Cuban Olympic Committee  which in turn reports to the International Olympic Committee  not the Cuban government MLB teams would have paid the federation a release fee for each Cuban player signed  providing a windfall for Cuban baseball  which has suffered from dwindling budgets and the defection of its best players In the past  many Cuban players seeking riches in the big leagues have made dangerous journeys via human traffickers to defect  Others abandoned the Cuban national team while playing abroad Cuban MLB players who had defected include Yasiel Puig of the Cincinnati Reds  Yoenis Cespedes of the New York Mets and Jose Dariel Abreu of the Chicago White Sox   all of whom have signed multi year  multimillion dollar contracts Puig defected from Cuba on a speedboat at age 21 and soon found himself entangled with Mexico s notorious Zetas crime organization  which threatened to chop off his arm if it failed to receive the promised  250 000 fee for his passage When Puig finally reached U S  shores in 2012  he was rewarded with a seven year   42 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers Under the deal agreed by MLB and the Cuban federation in December  MLB teams were going to pay the federation a fee ranging from 15 percent to 25 percent of the value of player contracts That money  which was not to be deducted from the player s salary but be paid on top of it  would have been used to help Cuba further develop its baseball program Cuban players older than age 25 and with six years of service in the Cuban league would have been free to sign with MLB teams  Younger players would have needed Cuban baseball s permission to leave   Reporting by Matt Spetalnick  additional reporting by Dan Trotta in New York and Sarah Marsh in Havana  Editing by Bill Berkrot and Tom Brown  

OTTAWA   The world s major social media companies are not doing enough to help Canada combat potential foreign meddling in this October s elections and the government might have to regulate them  the cabinet minister in charge of ensuring a fair vote said on Monday Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould spoke shortly after one of Canada s two spy agencies said it was very likely foreign actors will try to interfere in the election Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said last week she was  very concerned  about possible Russian meddling and that there  have probably already been efforts by malign foreign actors to disrupt our democracy  Gould said Facebook Inc  Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc s Google should help safeguard the election by promoting transparency  authenticity and integrity on their platforms  But she added that she had been disappointed by the slowness of talks with the companies The safeguards should include more efforts to counter malicious cyber activity  such as the spread of disinformation  Gould said  The platforms feel this is something they should be doing on their own and I don t have the confidence that they re disclosing everything with us   she told a news conference Asked whether the firms should be regulated to limit the threat posed by disinformation and a possible foreign cyber campaign to sway the election  Gould replied   It s something we are looking at very closely   She noted Britain had proposed a social media regulator on Monday A few hours after Gould spoke  Facebook announced it had banned a number of individuals and groups it said had engaged in organized hate  including Aryan Strikeforce and Wolves of Odin  Gould said she welcomed the move Google said it had  every intention of continuing our close work with government to protect Canada s democratic institutions and election activities   Twitter declined to comment  Last month Google said it would ban political advertising on its platform before the election Facebook has said it would require advertisers to confirm their identities before running election related material Gould told the news conference there was much more the social media firms could do  Until they think they are going to be forced to make those changes  I don t think they will willingly do it and I think that s disappointing   she said Earlier on Monday  the Communications Security Establishment  CSE   the agency responsible for foreign signals intelligence and protecting government electronic information and communication networks  issued a report on the potential hazards around October s election  The report did not refer to any specific threat from Russia U S  intelligence officials and the governments of some European Union countries have accused Russia of interfering in their elections in recent years  allegations denied by Moscow   It is very likely that Canadian voters will encounter foreign cyber interference ahead of  and during  the 2019 general election   said the CSE  which noted democratic governments around the world were experiencing more cyber attacks The chances of an adversary actually overturning the results of a Canadian election are almost nonexistent  given that voters use paper ballots   Reporting by David Ljunggren  Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe  Tom Brown and Dan Grebler  

WASHINGTON   President Trump s purge of the nation s top homeland security officials is a sign that he is preparing to unleash an even fiercer assault on immigration  including a possible return of his controversial decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents  current and former administration officials said Monday Mr  Trump shook up the ranks of his top immigration officials after spending months demanding that they take tougher action to stop the surge in migrant families at the border and seething about what he considers their overly legalistic refusals to do what he has said was necessary That anger was underscored on Monday when a judge blocked Mr  Trump s efforts to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases proceed   a practice that immigration advocates called inhumane and illegal  Judge Richard Seeborg of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that existing law did not give Mr  Trump the power to enforce the policy  known as  migrant protection protocols  The immediate targets of the president s growing fury about the situation at the border were the officials who he saw as insufficiently steely minded  Kirstjen Nielsen  who resigned  Sunday as the secretary of homeland security  and Ron Vitiello  whose nomination to permanently lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement was pulled after Mr  Trump remarked that  we want to go in a tougher direction  But the longer term effect of the eruption of Oval Office frustration is likely to be a burst of hard line policies that stand out even in an administration that has pursued an unprecedented series of executive actions and rules changes aimed at reducing legal and illegal immigration into the United States In addition to urging Mr  Trump to revisit the idea of family separation  several of the president s closest immigration confidants have been pushing him to consider even harsher measures Those include further limits on who can seek asylum  stronger action to close ports of entry along the Mexican border  an executive order to end birthright citizenship  more aggressive construction of a border wall  and a more robust embrace of active duty troops to secure the border against illegal immigration In an administration that is famous for chaos and last minute decision making  it is unclear on which of those policies the president might choose to move forward  But by removing Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Vitiello and perhaps others  Mr  Trump is getting rid of voices who sometimes cautioned him against taking actions they believed to be illegal or unwise  There was a perception that Secretary Nielsen was not as committed to the sort of full throated approach that others in the administration  including the White House  were seeking   said Seth Grossman  who served as deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2015 He said Ms  Nielsen s exit and Mr  Vitiello s step back  signals there is an intention to pursue more aggressive policies  Three senior administration officials with knowledge of the president s conversations over the past several months confirmed that Mr  Trump has repeatedly told aides that he wants to restart the family separation policy  One of the officials said the president had made it clear to aides that he liked Ms  Nielsen personally  but was critical of her job performance  All three officials spoke about the internal discussions on the condition of anonymity Stephen Miller  the architect of Mr  Trump s immigration agenda and one of the president s closest advisers in the White House  has been an advocate for a modified version of the family separation policy known as  binary choice  Others  including Kris Kobach  the former Kansas secretary of state and an informal immigration adviser  and Stephen K  Bannon  the president s former chief strategist  have also been urging tougher actions Under a binary choice policy  which is highly controversial  migrant parents would be given a choice of whether to voluntarily allow their children to be separated from them  or to waive their child s humanitarian protections so the family can be detained together  indefinitely  in jail like conditions  Immigration advocates have said the idea is inhumane and would be found illegal by courts The Turnover at the Top of the Trump AdministrationSince President Trump s inauguration  White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations  one after the other Ms  Nielsen was the head of the department during the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy last year that led to the separation of thousands of families  More than 2 700 children were separated from their parents at the border under that policy to prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally  even those with families seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds Mr  Trump eventually relented on the family separations  and a federal judge in California halted them in June  But in January  the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services reported that thousands more families might have been separated than previously reported While Mr  Trump has been hampered by the law in his efforts to impose some new enforcement policies  there are certain things he can do without congressional approval Those include shutting down ports of entries along the southwestern border and slowing down the process for both illegal and legal immigration Last month  he closed American field offices abroad that had helped facilitate immigration applications  Mr  Trump has also limited the number of people who can request asylum each day through a process known as  metering   and he has threatened to shut down traffic lanes and tariff trucks at the ports of entry Jonathan Meyer  a former deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security  said the Trump administration will continue to pursue hard line immigration policies because they are important to the president s political supporters  who helped fuel Mr  Trump s success in the 2016 presidential campaign  It appears that at times it s less important in this administration  whether they lose or win in court  than to just say they ve been able to have done it and have it as a talking point   Mr  Meyer said   And have an opportunity to criticize the courts if they lose  Mr  Meyer said installing a new secretary at the department will further embolden Mr  Trump  He s willing to move forward and do things even when he knows he s going to be sued for it and when the legality is in question   Mr  Meyer said   If that s the position you take and if you have people willing to implement that strategy  there s a lot of things you can do  But eventually you re going to be hit with a temporary restraining order  Mr  Grossman said Mr  Trump s personnel moves were indeed a signal that the administration would embrace aggressive policies  But he added that Mr  Trump has threatened to enact such policies before  only to back off The president could also be stymied by further court rulings blocking his efforts to crack down on immigrants On Monday in California  the judge said in his ruling that in addition to violating immigration laws  the protocols did not include  sufficient safeguards  to comply with the Department of Homeland Security s obligation against returning migrants to places where their  life or freedom would be threatened  Immigration advocates hailed the decision  calling it the latest victory in the legal battles with the Trump administration that began when the president imposed a travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries just days after taking office in 2017  Try as it may  the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States   said Judy Rabinovitz  the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants  Rights Project  who argued the case The Trump administration had negotiated the protocols with the Mexican government because of the president s longstanding anger with so called catch and release policies in which asylum seekers are temporarily released into the United States while they wait for their court hearings The policy of forcing some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico was an effort to stop that from happening  But the court ruling means that the president will have to abandon it  at least for the time being

LONDON   Talks on a compromise Brexit plan between Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and the opposition Labour leader  Jeremy Corbyn  hit a snag on Friday  just as Mrs  May sought a nearly two month delay in the deadline for leaving the European Union Labour leaders said Mrs  May had so far refused to budge from her original plan  but the government said it was still prepared to propose changes The developments illustrated the challenges confronting the leaders in reaching an agreement for Britain s withdrawal  with both Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn facing difficulties within their parties if they compromise News of the deadlock came on the same day Mrs  May asked for a second extension of the deadline for departure  to June 30  The original March 29 deadline had been extended once  to April 12   one week away Commenting on the negotiations so far between Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn  Keir Starmer  Labour s lead lawmaker on Brexit  said the government was so far not allowing  any changes to the actual wording of the political declaration   the part of Mrs  May s deal that outlines Britain s future relationship with Europe and that would be the centerpiece of any compromise He said talks would continue only if the government changed its position  So far  the government isn t proposing any changes to the deal   Mr  Starmer told reporters on Friday   We want the talks to continue and we ve written in those terms to the government  but we do need change if we re going to compromise  What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union A minister in Mrs  May s government  Rory Stewart  said the government was prepared to compromise on the political declaration  saying the negotiations with Labour had run into problems but were not dead  In truth  the positions of the two parties are very  very close and where there s good will it should be possible to get this done and get it done relatively quickly   Mr  Stewart said in an interview on BBC Radio 4 In a statement  Downing Street said   We have made serious proposals in talks this week  and are prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides  No further talks were scheduled  a Labour official said  but the party was willing to reopen negotiations if the government s position changed After seeing her Brexit deal rejected three times by Parliament  Mrs  May earlier this week sought to break months of deadlock by meeting with Mr  Corbyn Mrs  May s plan was to eventually take Britain out of Europe s main economic structures but give it control over immigration from continental Europe Mr  Corbyn has been reluctant to be pinned down on a single alternate plan  but Labour s policy is to keep Britain more closely tied to European regulations and leave the door open to a second public vote on Brexit ImagePro Brexit protesters outside the Parliament in London CreditHenry Nicholls ReutersOne of the compromise plans that has been most popular in Parliament is Britain s agreeing to remain in the European customs union  meaning it would not charge tariffs on European products But Mrs  May would risk a rebellion of hard line  pro Brexit lawmakers in her Conservative Party if she accepts a compromise that keeps Britain tied closely to Europe Meanwhile  a compromise would force Mr  Corbyn to face the wrath of pro European lawmakers in Labour  who want nothing less than another public vote that could reverse Brexit altogether Mrs  May already seemed to be contemplating difficulties in talks when she wrote on Friday morning to Donald Tusk  the president of the European Council  asking to again delay Britain s departure from the bloc She said in the letter that if talks with Mr  Corbyn did not produce a compromise  she would hold a series of votes in Parliament on alternative paths  in the hopes that lawmakers would settle on one Parliament has already tested support among lawmakers for various plans  only for none to win a majority  But the government is expected to try to use a somewhat different voting process  were it to try again  This impasse cannot be allowed to continue   Mrs  May wrote   In the U K  it is creating uncertainty and doing damage to faith in politics  while the European Union has a legitimate desire to move on to decisions about its own future  ImageDonald Tusk  center left  president of the European Council  and Jean Claude Juncker  center right  president of the European Commission  in Brussels last month CreditJohn Thys Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMrs  May also conceded in the letter that Britain was preparing to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May Analysts said Brussels would probably reject her proposed date of June 30 for a Brexit postponement   and some countries said they had yet to see a sufficient reason to support any extension Britain was originally scheduled to leave the bloc on March 29  but European leaders granted a short extension to give Parliament more time to approve a withdrawal deal Mr  Tusk was pushing European leaders to offer Mrs  May a one year extension for Brexit while leaving the door open to an earlier withdrawal if Britain ratifies a deal  according to a senior European Union official familiar with his thinking  The official spoke on condition of anonymity  in keeping with standard practice That plan  described as a  flextension   would eliminate the need for European leaders to repeatedly consider British requests for a delay  And in allowing Britain to leave sooner if an agreement is reached  Mr  Tusk appears to be trying to make it clear that Brussels is not trying to trap Britain in the bloc Mr  Tusk s plan would still need the backing of European Union member states  and there were some signs of resistance from France  which typically takes the hardest line in these matters  as well as Austria and the Netherlands  The French president has made very clear that if we want to grant an extension  What for   the French finance minister  Bruno Le Maire  said before a meeting of European finance ministers in Bucharest  Romania  on Friday  He added   It is up to the British government to give an answer to that key question  ImageIn a Twitter post  Jacob Rees Mogg  center  recommended that  if  stuck  in the European Parliament over the next year  Britain should be  as difficult as possible  CreditFacundo Arrizabalaga EPA  via ShutterstockThe cross party talks had been cited by some as reason enough for the bloc to offer an extension  Further difficulties in the talks throw that into question  and any new extension may depend on what Parliament manages to accomplish next week The Netherlands has generally been more sympathetic to Britain  but Mark Rutte  the Dutch prime minister  expressed exasperation with the British negotiating approach   I keep being amazed at how the fifth economy of the world handles its interests   he said In asking for an extension until June 30  Mrs  May was bowing to pressure from within her Conservative Party not to be seen as forcing the country into a longer delay But she was also laying the ground for a more protracted extension by agreeing that Britain was prepared to participate in European elections in May  That was seen in Brussels as a condition for another Brexit postponement Those moves have not gone over well with hard line Brexit supporters  That rancor was reflected in a Twitter post on Wednesday by the lawmaker Jacob Rees Mogg  who recommended that  if  stuck  in the European Parliament over the next year that Britain be  as difficult as possible  The Labour Party received a glimmer of good news in a by election in South Wales  retaining a traditional Labour seat in an area that had backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum But amid low turnout  the margin was relatively slim  with the winner  Ruth Jones  receiving 39 5 percent of the vote  compared with 31 percent for the Conservatives and 9 percent for the rejuvenated far right U K  Independence Party  

LONDON   Britain s opposition Labour Party  which is holding talks with Prime Minister Theresa May in an effort to find a way out of the Brexit impasse  urged her on Friday to offer a real change to her EU withdrawal deal  We are disappointed that the government has not offered real change or compromise   a party spokesperson said in a statement   We urge the prime minister to come forward with genuine changes to her deal in an effort to find an alternative that can win support in parliament and bring the country together   the party added Labour Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer later added in a Tweet   so far  the government is not countenancing any actual changes in to the wording of the political declaration   On Wednesday  after the first round of talks  both Labour and the government said they had been constructive although Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said May had not moved far enough The talks continued on Thursday and Friday May proposed them after her EU withdrawal deal was rejected three times by lawmakers  She is looking to find a solution that Labour can support before a European Council summit on April 10 Sterling fell to a day s low against the U S  dollar immediately after Labour s comments on Friday  falling below  1 30 to  1 2988  down half a percent on the day    Reporting by Stephen Addison  editing by Andrew Heavens  

PARIS   Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Paris and other French cities on Saturday for a 21st straight weekend of anti government  yellow vest  protests  but turnout was sharply lower than last week and the marches were largely peaceful The quieter nature of the demonstrations should be a relief to President Emmanuel Macron  who this week wrapped up two months of nationwide town hall meetings as part of his  grand debate  initiative Prime Minister Edouard Philippe is due on Monday to outline the initial findings that emerged from hours of discussions with local mayors and officials  high school students  workers  intellectuals as well as 1 9 million online contributions Macron  who launched the debate in a bid to calm the protests and determine which policies people want the government to focus on  is due to announce proposals based on the results later this month By early evening on Saturday  there were 43 arrests in Paris and also a few clashes with police in Rouen on the margins of otherwise peaceful demonstrations Protesters carrying French flags and holding signs calling for referendums tabled by citizens also marched largely without violence in Bordeaux and Lille The protests  named after the high visibility safety jackets worn by demonstrators  began in November as an expression of public anger against fuel tax increases The movement soon morphed into a broader backlash against Macron s government  despite a swift reversal of the tax increases and other hurried measures worth more than 10 billion euros to boost purchasing power for less affluent voters Turnout on Saturday was down sharply with 22 300 demonstrators nationwide  according to government estimates  compared with 33 700 a week earlier  In mid November nearly 300 000 people had demonstrated across France In Paris  two rallies had been authorized  including one from Place de la Republique in the east to La Defense business district in the west  Turnout was 3 500 compared with 4 000 last week As in recent weeks  authorities banned protests in potential trouble spots  including the French capital s Champs Elysees  fearing a repetition of the vandalism seen three weeks earlier   Editing by Helen Popper and Alexandra Hudson  

HAVANA   Cuban Communist Party leader Raul Castro said on Wednesday Cuba would never abandon its leftist ally Venezuela despite U S   blackmail   even as the Trump administration threatened more sanctions over its support In a speech to the national assembly  meeting to enact the new constitution  Castro said Cuba had been upping defence preparedness in recent months in view of increased U S  hostility The island nation had also been adopting economic measures to contend with the Trump administration s tightening of the decades old U S  trade embargo  Castro told legislators  We will never abandon our duty of acting in solidarity with Venezuela   Castro said   We reject strongly all types of blackmail  U S  Vice President Mike Pence told the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday the United States would announce additional action to hold Cuba accountable for its support of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro The administration of U S  President Donald Trump has accused Cuban security and intelligence officials of propping up Maduro s government  Cuba denies those claims  Cuba is being blamed for all evils  using lies and the worst kind of Hitlerian propaganda   Castro said   We have told the U S  administration Cuba is not afraid and will continue building the future of the nation without outside interference  The enactment of the new constitution allows Cuba s government to launch a modest revamp of its centrally planned single party system with dozens of laws expected on everything from the justice system to political structures Many observers are hopeful the government will open Cuba s still inefficient state run economy further to free enterprise with a law recognising private businesses  not just self employment  although they do not expect that to be among the first pieces of legislation it tackles That could give a boost to an economy which has had to contend with declining aid from Venezuela and a resulting cash crunch over the past three years  prompting the government to introduce austerity measures Shortages of basic goods have increased recently  including flour  eggs and chicken  with the state even reducing the size and circulation of its newspapers due to a lack of newsprint The situation could worsen further in coming months in view of the tightening U S  trade embargo  Castro warned  That did not mean a return to the kind of deep crisis Cuba experienced following the 1991 collapse of its former benefactor the Soviet Union  however  as its economy had diversified since then  he said SLEW OF NEW LAWSCubans overwhelmingly ratified the new constitution in a February referendum after a year of debate  updating its 1976 Soviet era Magna Carta While it retains socialism as  irrevocable   it codifies changes in Cuban society since 1991  like the opening of the economy to free enterprise  and includes a political restructuring among other changes Analysts say the constitution gives some leeway as to how reformist the around 50 laws needed to bring the legal system in line with it should be  The formation of a more open and democratic country depends on this process and not on the constitution   said Cuban lawyer and legal columnist for independent media Eloy Viera Caive The constitution stipulates that the national assembly must approve a new electoral law to reflect the restructuring of government within six months Within the following three months  it must elect a president  widely expected to remain Miguel Diaz Canel  who succeeded Castro last April  That president must then appoint provincial governors and a prime minister   a new post separating the role of head of state from head of government The Magna Carta stipulates that within 18 months  new laws reflecting constitutional changes to the judicial system such as the presumption of innocence in criminal cases and habeas corpus should also be introduced The process of a popular consultation and referendum on a new family code  that will address the controversial issue of gay marriage  should also be kicked off within two years   Reporting by Sarah Marsh  Additional Reporting by Marc Frank and Nelson Acosta  Editing by Phil Berlowitz and James Dalgleish  

The Turkish government unveiled a plan on Wednesday to help the country s banks survive an epidemic of bad loans  but it dashed hopes for more sweeping measures to address an economic downturn that has become a threat to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s hold on power Under the proposal  which the government described as a comprehensive plan for the economy  state owned banks will receive  5 billion in aid  about a third of the total amount of bad loans  according to official figures But economists said the blueprint  which was presented by Berat Albayrak  the minister of treasury and finance  who is also Mr  Erdogan s son in law  seemed designed mostly to protect Mr  Erdogan s allies in the construction and energy sectors  The plan offered only bromides in response to a deepening recession  double digit unemployment and prices rising at a 20 percent clip The teetering economy helped cost the president s party its control of Ankara in local elections last month  and delivered a victory to opposition parties in Istanbul  although Mr  Erdogan is challenging the results Despite the setbacks  Mr  Erdogan apparently remains unwilling to forsake the debt fueled growth that lifted the country from poverty but has become increasingly unsustainable  Facing a possible rematch in Istanbul  he is probably also wary of forcing voters to swallow the bitter medicine of cutbacks and austerity needed to cure Turkey s dependence on credit  Those who were expecting a framework to solve the issues in the economy after the elections should be dismayed   said Ugur Gurses  a former banker who is now an economics columnist   All that is planned is to keep the credit flowing from state owned banks  The economy has been central to the expansion of Mr  Erdogan s authority during the last two decades  but as growth has wavered  so has his support  Foreign credit has dried up as lenders lost confidence in his management of the economy  causing widespread bankruptcies among businesses unable to refinance debt that they must often repay in increasingly expensive dollars ImageBerat Albayrak  the minister of treasury and finance and Mr  Erdogan s son in law  Economists say his latest plan seemed designed to protect Mr  Erdogan s allies CreditOzan Kose Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesBut Mr  Erdogan has refused to heed cries from the business community for more extensive changes in policy  and has ignored the advice of mainstream economists  Instead  he has behaved as if he could make the economy bend to his will  and blamed economic problems on foreign conspiracies The plan presented Wednesday by Mr  Albayrak failed to address the problem that most bothers the Turkish business community  government agencies and courts that are increasingly tilted in favor of Mr  Erdogan s loyalists  and opaque decision making  It s not clear how administration is run  and who does what   said Atilla Yesilada  Turkey analyst at GlobalSource Partners  a research firm   Who makes policy is not clear at all  That s what I hear time after time  During a 40 minute presentation in Istanbul before an audience of journalists  who were not given a chance to ask questions  Mr  Albayrak said that the government would increase taxes on the rich  cut taxes for corporations  encourage people to save and take measures to stabilize the country s pension system by making it compulsory for all Turks He also said the government would create a  National Unity in Agriculture Project  to combat runaway food price inflation  But there were few details on how that and the other measures would work At least this latest economic plan landed with less of a thud than the last one  That program  presented by Mr  Albayrak in August  was regarded as so unconvincing by foreign investors that they dumped the lira and provoked a currency crisis  For a brief period  it took almost 7 lira to buy  1  a low  On Wednesday the exchange rate was 5 7 lira for  1  little changed from Tuesday The timing of the economic plan created a political quandary for Mr  Erdogan and his party  There was intense pressure for the government to regain international credibility by presenting a serious program But tough economic polices might further alienate voters and hurt Mr  Erdogan s chances of retaining power in Istanbul by forcing a repeat election  For financial stability  more determined measures were expected   said Bahadir Ozgur  an economic analyst and columnist for the online newspaper Gazete Duvar   In this program  there is nothing curbing budget spending and disciplining public finance

BEIRUT  Lebanon   Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on Wednesday to be on his way to a fifth term as prime minister of Israel  solidifying the sense across the Arab world that the dream of a Palestinian state is more remote than ever   as is the chance that the United States will help create it Throughout his campaign  Mr  Netanyahu appealed to right wing voters by making promises to them about issues long expected to be negotiated with Israel s Arab neighbors And through his close relationship with the Trump administration  he pushed for the United States to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Days before the election  he suggested he would annex at least some of the West Bank if he won The strategy helped ensure his grip on power  It closes all doors for any possible peace settlement and any chance for the Palestinians to have a state of their own   said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla  a political scientist from the United Arab Emirates  While that would cause frustration among the Arabs  there was little they could do about it  he said  The Arabs are at their weakest  The Palestinians are divided like never before  Israel is stronger than ever and Trump backs it  so Israel can do whatever it wants   he said For decades  support for the creation of a Palestinian state was a rare issue met with consensus across the Arab world  Israeli leaders faced limits on the kinds of unilateral actions they could take for fear of causing pushback from the Arabs or from the United States and other Western countries But that dynamic has faded as the peace process stalled for years and as the Palestinians remain divided among themselves  with different factions in charge of the West Bank and Gaza The Arab Spring uprisings and their violent aftermath left many Arab leaders more focused on staying in power than on standing up for the Palestinians  And Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have quietly warmed up to Israel  seeing it as a valuable partner in confronting their common enemy   Iran Arab investment in the peace process dwindled even further with the election of President Trump  whose administration has built warm relations with Mr  Netanyahu while isolating the Palestinians  Leaders of allied Arab states did not want to jeopardize their own relations with the new administration by pushing the Palestinian cause The shrinking horizon for a Palestinian state  is concerning  but are the Arab regimes concerned   asked Michael Young  a senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut  Lebanon   The Saudi and Emirati minds are on Iran  and they are not going to undermine their relationship with the United States and with Israel over these issues  ImageLaborers at a construction site in Beitar Illit  an Israeli settlement in the West Bank  Days before the election  Mr  Netanyahu suggested he would annex at least some of the West Bank if he won CreditRonen Zvulun ReutersSyria  which has long opposed Israel s existence  has been so badly weakened by years of civil war that it could muster no more than formulaic condemnations when Mr  Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  Israel seized the territory from Syria in the 1967 war Iraq  too  has been ground down by years of battle to oust the Islamic State from a chunk of its territory Dealing with the issue is more complicated for United States allies that made peace with Israel  hoping their agreements would pave the way for a broader agreement with the Palestinians In Egypt  President Abdel Fattah el Sisi rarely speaks of the Palestinians and has embraced Mr  Trump as a rare American leader who does not criticize his human rights record Jordan  a close Arab ally of the United States  perhaps has the most to lose from Israel s rightward lurch  It shares a long border with Israel  has a large Palestinian population and remains invested in resolving the core issues of the conflict  such as the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian refugees  Now  with the new American approach  none of these positions will be respected   said Oraib al Rantawi  the director of the Al Quds Center for Political Studies   Jordan is not happy to see Netanyahu elected again as prime minister of Israel  and we fear that we are not headed toward more conflict between Israel and the Palestinians but between Israel and Jordan  But there was little Jordan could do other than reject proposed settlements that are not to its liking or that impose specific roles on Jordan  like absorbing Palestinian refugees Mr  Netanyahu s win could play into the hands of Arab militants  such as those in Hezbollah and Hamas who call for Israel s destruction  because it bolsters their argument that negotiating with Israel is a waste of time  Netanyahu will likely form a new  right wing Zionist government  and we are before a new stage of unprecedented cooperation between America and Israel represented in Netanyahu and Trump   Hezbollah s leader  Hassan Nasrallah  said in a speech on Wednesday It remains to be seen whether Mr  Netanyahu will make good on his election promises  Significant Israeli moves in the West Bank could result in new violence with the Palestinians  and many Arabs would automatically support their Arab brethren And cozying up to Israel too much could harm the standing of Arab leaders before their own people  The Palestinian situation has been written off so many times but it remains a big issue for many Arab citizens   said Mr  Young of the Carnegie center   We shouldn t underestimate how this could be a problem for some of these regimes in terms of their legitimacy

DUBAI   Saudi Aramco is set to raise  12 billion with its first international bond issue after receiving more than  100 billion in orders  a record breaking vote of market confidence for the oil giant which has faced investor concerns about government influence over the company State owned Aramco s bond issue  split into maturities ranging from three to 30 years  is seen as a gauge of potential investor interest in the Saudi company s eventual initial public offering Before the bond deal was marketed on Monday  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said initial indications of interest for the paper were over  30 billion Having swelled to over  100 billion during the sale process  demand appeared to be the largest ever for emerging markets bonds  fund managers said  surpassing orderbook value of more than  52 billion for Qatar s  12 billion deal last year   67 billion for Saudi Arabia s inaugural issue in 2016 and  69 billion orders for Argentina s  16 5 billion trade that year Such strong interest was also the latest sign that international investors are pouring money back into Saudi Arabia  as the kingdom tries to move on from the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi after his killing at the hands of Saudi agents in October strained ties with Western allies  Purely on figures  it is a fantastic credit   said Damien Buchet  CIO of the EM Total Return Strategy  Finisterre Capital But he added   The thing is  they are part of Saudi Arabia  they are a government arm  For equity investors this is always going to be an issue  more so than for bond investors  The Aramco issue has attracted interest from a wide range of investors  as the oil producer s vast profits would put its debt rating   if unconstrained by its sovereign links   in the same league as independent oil majors like Exxon Mobil and Shell Aramco has insisted on its independence while meeting investors ahead of the bond issue last week  saying the Saudi government remained committed to Aramco s governance framework to safeguard its independence even when oil prices dropped But for some investors Riyadh s control over the oil giant is an issue as its state ownership means decisions will ultimately be for the benefit of the government rather than investors  Aramco is more transparent  has stronger credit metrics and is on an improving ESG  environmental  social and governance  trajectory whereas the government is more complex   said Mohieddine Kronfol  chief investment officer of Global Sukuk and MENA Fixed Income at Franklin Templeton Investments  The link between the two however is understandably very strong   he said NO PREMIUMPreviously reluctant to do so  Aramco last week opened for the first time its books to investor scrutiny  showing it is by far the most profitable company in the world Having made core earnings of  224 billion last year and with  86 billion in free cash flow at the end of 2018  Aramco does not need to borrow Initial indications of over  30 billion in investor demand prompted Aramco to market the notes with almost no premium to Saudi government debt   They are clearly trying to price it  the bond  off existing AA corporates in this world  so people are looking at curves like Shell  Total  Exxon but also technology giants like Apple   said Buchet After  tightening  the price guidance  Aramco on Tuesday ended up selling a  1 billion three year tranche offering investors 55 basis points  bps  over U S  Treasuries  a  2 billion five year tranche at 75 bps over the benchmark  a  3 billion 10 year tranche at 105 bps   3 billion in 20 year notes at 140 bps and  3 billion in 30 year bonds at 155 bps  a document issued by one of the banks leading the deal showed  Managers said the pricing meant the bonds will yield less than Saudi Arabia  which owns it  This is rare  as state owned entities generally offer higher returns than their governments  I think it s madness that s it s going inside the sovereign by a decent margin  Despite the fundamentals of Aramco  it s ultimately sovereign risk   said Richard Briggs  emerging markets strategist at London based CreditSights The issue follows on the heels of Aramco s planned  69 1 billion acquisition of a 70 percent stake in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp  SABIC  from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund  a deal that many see as a transfer of government funds aimed at boosting the Saudi Crown Prince s economic agenda  This bond is being issued for two reasons  to establish Aramco s status as an independent corporate identity and to enable the transfer of wealth out of the company   said Marcus Chenevix  analyst  MENA and global political research at TS Lombard Aramco  however  said the bond issue was not linked to the SABIC acquisition  which will be paid in tranches through internal cash flow and  potentially  other resources Many see the deal as a relationship building exercise with international investors ahead of its planned initial public offering  scheduled for last year and then postponed to 2021 The debt offering initially included a three year floating rate bond  which was later dropped  according to the document The new bonds were trading up before they were officially sold in the so called grey market  where investors trade them on a when issued basis   Strong demand in a world looking for extra yield  a new name  and lots of cash   said Andrew Brenner  managing director at National Alliance Capital Markets Aramco has hired Lazard as financial adviser for the bond deal  JPMorgan  Morgan Stanley  HSBC  Citi  Goldman Sachs and National Commercial Bank have been chosen to arrange the bond issue   Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker in London  David Gaffen and Jennifer Ablan in New York  Editing

JERUSALEM   Ultra Orthodox Jewish parties did well in Israel s national election and will likely bring hefty demands for more government payouts to coalition talks  making it harder for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to rein in a growing budget deficit Two religious parties  often political kingmakers in the past  were projected to win a combined 16 of 120 seats in parliament  three more than they have now  Their support is essential for Netanyahu should he opt to form a right wing coalition  rather than seek a broader unity government with centrist rivals Ultra Orthodox Jews  known as Haredim  make up about 10 percent of Israel s population and  with their typically large families  that percentage is expected to swell They receive state benefits  stipends and military exemptions that allow many to devote time to religious studies rather than joining the workforce Just around half of Haredi men are employed  an issue long identified by economists as a drag on Israeli growth  At the same time  more than 70 percent of Haredi women work but their salaries are well below the average of non Haredi women The two parties  United Torah Judaism  UTJ  and Shas  pledge to try to keep or even build on the status quo  disregarding warnings from Israel s central bank and groups like the International Monetary Fund of a future crisis without change  Having stronger power would mean that they would have stronger leverage for obtaining higher stipends for  seminary  students   said Eitan Regev  an economist at the Israel Democracy Institute CUTS PUT MORE HAREDI IN WORKHe noted that when stipends were cut in a short lived government without Haredi parties after the 2013 election  more men joined the workforce  Allowances were raised again two years later in a new government  halting the rise in numbers of employed Haredi  Regev said UTJ co head Moshe Gafni said Netanyahu had called him since polls closed late on Tuesday to discuss a partnership Israel s budget deficit is rising  forecast to reach nearly 4 percent of gross domestic product this year   well above the 2 9 percent target  Although ratings agencies Fitch and S P said Israel was not at risk of a downgrade in the near term  austerity measures seem unavoidable The Bank of Israel has called for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases to keep the budget from spiraling out of control  After the new government is in place  discussions on the 2020 and possibly a dual 2020 2021 budget will begin  It will be very difficult to consolidate the budget   said Leader Capital Markets chief economist Jonathan Katz  noting much depended on how much pressure Netanyahu will be able to withstand   The big question is   Will it be a macro story of billions of shekels  or hundreds of millions   In the longer term  the parties could delay the integration of a chunk of the population into the workforce  something the Bank of Israel has singled out as a top economic priority A recent study by the central bank found that economic growth would slow if the issue is not addressed  Comprehensive and persistent policy in these areas will contribute to increasing the standard of living for all population segments and to reducing inequality in the economy   it said in its 2018 review   Editing by Mark Heinrich  

MEXICO CITY   United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Tuesday the deadly toll of Mexico s rampant gangland violence was reminiscent of the era in her native Chile when thousands died or disappeared during a military dictatorship Bachelet  a former Chilean president  concluded a five day visit to Mexico where she met with victims of violence as well as government officials and pushed for a full accounting of past abuses She told reporters at a news conference that stories of anguish she heard from the families of victims reminded her of the darkest days of the police state that Augusto Pinochet oversaw in Chile during the 1970s and 1980s  It was like returning to a part of my own history   she said During the military dictatorship in Chile from 1973 to 1990  about 3 000 people were killed or disappeared and 28 000 others were victims of torture  including Bachelet and her father  an air force general In Mexico  homicides rose by one third last year  according to government data  breaking a record for the second consecutive year as more than 33 000 murder cases were opened In her prepared remarks  Bachelet cited other  terrifying figures   including 26 000 bodies that Mexican officials have not been able to identify and 850 mass graves dug up  It was moving for me to meet with the families   she added   They have the same cries  the same calls for truth and justice  Since late 2006  vicious internecine strife among drug cartels and their clashes with the state have been blamed for more than 200 000 deaths in Mexico The government has succeeded in taking down cartel bosses  but that has often led to fragmentation of the gangs and more killings Bachelet said the violence in Mexico had unique characteristics and that the country suffered from weak rule of law  The truth is you have laws for everything   she said  her voice rising   There isn t a lack of laws  but rather a need to implement them  Asked about crisis racked Venezuela  Bachelet said her office continued to monitor the violation of human rights and humanitarian needs in the South American country Last month  Bachelet issued a blistering report on excessive use of force by Venezuelan security forces and pro government militias  including extra judicial executions She said a visit to Venezuela was possible  relatively soon   but emphasized she wanted to guard her office s neutrality   Reporting by David Alire Garcia  Editing by Peter Cooney  

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  facing criticism that the Trump administration has sought to sweep away the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi s brutal killing  announced on Monday that 16 Saudis  including one of the closest aides to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  were being barred from entry to the United States The list included the close aide  Saud al Qahtani  who officially served as the royal court s media czar  but appeared to have overseen the operation to seize Mr  Khashoggi  It was one of a dozen or so operations by what American intelligence officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group  set up by Mr  al Qahtani to silence or eliminate dissent about Prince Mohammed s rapid rise to become the de facto Saudi leader But conspicuously missing from the list is Prince Mohammed himself  despite the conclusion by American intelligence agencies that he was ultimately responsible for sending the team to Istanbul to kill Mr  Khashoggi  and for other actions by the Rapid Intervention Group  More than a year before Mr  Khashoggi s death  American intelligence officials intercepted a communication from the crown prince saying that if Mr  Khashoggi  a Washington Post journalist who lived in Virginia  did not voluntarily return to the kingdom and cease publishing his criticism  the state should go after him  with a bullet  Based on the findings of the C I A   which he led until last year  Mr  Pompeo would have been free to add the crown prince to the list  though that would have been an unusual move to take against a leader of a close ally  But Mr  Pompeo has at times also sounded passive about the investigation  saying he was giving the Saudis time to complete their own inquiry By moving to name the Saudis and barring them and their immediate families from traveling to the United States  the Trump administration appears to be trying to tamp down an unusual uprising in Congress that has involved members of both parties But it is far from clear that the relatively minor penalty  against Saudis who would be unlikely to enter the United States under current conditions  will be viewed as sufficient  Mr  Pompeo and President Trump are likely to still face the accusation that they are deliberately ignoring the C I A  s intelligence findings in an effort to put the killing behind them  Mr  Trump once called the report about the crown prince s involvement a  feeling  by the C I A   and has insisted that the evidence is not conclusive VideoAn autopsy expert  A lookalike  A black van  Our video investigation follows the movements of the 15 man Saudi hit team that killed and dismembered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi It is unclear whether their effort to move on from the killing will work  Congress has already moved to stop all American support for Saudi military action in Yemen  and there are questions about continued military transfers  And Mr  Trump s administration has been negotiating for two years now on a deal to sell civilian nuclear power designs and equipment to Saudi Arabia  an action that would require congressional approval and raises concerns about whether the Saudi government might use the technology to seek a nuclear weapon  The crown prince has been explicit that if Iran got a weapon  Saudi Arabia would as well The administration regards Saudi Arabia as its key partner in confronting Iran The announcement appeared timed to generate little news and less embarrassment for the Saudi crown prince  Mr  Pompeo s list was published Monday evening  on a day in which upheavals at the Department of Homeland Security and Mr  Pompeo s decision to name the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a foreign terrorist organization dominated headlines  Mr  Pompeo had appeared at the State Department press room and took questions on the Iranian designation earlier Monday  making no mention of the approaching announcement on Saudi Arabia One American diplomat involved in Saudi affairs who was not authorized to speak on the subject said the decision to act had taken considerable time The Saudis have never publicly talked about the whereabouts of Mr  al Qahtani  who was the crown prince s chief enforcer and one of the architects of the effort to consolidate his power  In private  Saudis say he is under house arrest  But there is no indication whether he is being criminally prosecuted  and some reports indicated that he continued to hold power until the investigation became too hot  and someone near the crown prince had to take the fall The list of barred Saudis also included several members of the team sent to Istanbul  where Mr  Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi Consulate in an encounter that the Saudis insist was intended to forcibly bring him back to Riyadh  the Saudi capital  It includes the leader of that team  Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb  an intelligence officer who knew Mr  Khashoggi from their days working together at the Saudi Embassy in London  He often traveled with the crown prince abroad Mr  Mutreb and another Saudi listed by the State Department  Thaar Ghaleb al Harbi  a member of the royal guard and a favorite of the crown prince s for his role in fighting off an attack on one of Prince Mohammed s palaces  are standing trial  Saudi officials have told The New York Times Also listed was Salah Tubaigy  whom The Washington Post recently identified as a  medical specialist  for the Saudi Interior Ministry who is said to have administered a powerful sedative to Mr  Khashoggi during a struggle inside the consulate  He died shortly thereafter  perhaps because of the sedative  or his asthma  or because of strangulation His body was cut up and has never been recovered Much of the evidence against the men named in the State Department s list came from Turkey  which had surveillance videos outside the consulate and had apparently bugged the consulate itself  resulting in an audio recording of the killing

LONDON   Britain proposed new online safety laws on Monday that would slap penalties on social media companies and technology firms if they fail to protect their users from harmful content Easy access to damaging material particularly among young people has caused growing concern worldwide and came into the spotlight in Britain after the death of 14 year old schoolgirl Molly Russell  which her parents said came after she had viewed online material on depression and suicide Governments across the world are wrestling over how to better control content on social media platforms  often blamed for encouraging abuse  the spread of online pornography  and for influencing or manipulating voters Global worries were recently stoked by the live streaming of the mass shooting at a mosque in New Zealand on one of Facebook s platforms  after which Australia said it would fine social media and web hosting companies and imprison executives if violent content is not removed  expeditiously   In a policy paper widely trailed in British media  the government said it would look into possibly using fines  blocking access to websites  and imposing liability on senior tech company management for failing to limit the distribution of harmful content  It would also set up a regulator to police the rules  TechUK  an industry trade group  said the paper was a significant step forward  but one which needed to be firmed up during its 12 week consultation  It said some aspects of the government s approach were too vague  It is vital that the new framework is effective  proportionate and predictable   techUK said in a statement  adding not all concerns could be addressed through regulation Facebook said it was looking forward to working with the government to ensure new regulations were effective  repeating its founder Mark Zuckerberg s line that regulations were needed to have a standard approach across platforms COMPLEX ISSUES Rebecca Stimson  Facebook s head of UK public policy  said any new rules should strike a balance between protecting society and supporting innovation and free speech  These are complex issues to get right and we look forward to working with the government and parliament to ensure new regulations are effective   Stimson said in a statement  Prime Minister Theresa May said that while the Internet could be brilliant at connecting people  it had not done enough to protect users  especially children and young people  That is not good enough  and it is time to do things differently   May said in a statement   We have listened to campaigners and parents  and are putting a legal duty of care on internet companies to keep people safe   The duty of care would make companies take more responsibility for the safety of users and tackle harm caused by content or activity on their services  The regulator  funded by industry in the medium term  will set clear safety standards A committee of lawmakers has also demanded more is done to make political advertising and campaigning on social media more transparent  It is vital that our electoral law is brought up to date as soon as possible  so that social media users know who is contacting them with political messages and why   said Conservative Damian Collins  who chairs the parliamentary committee for digital  culture  media and sport  Should there be an early election  then emergency legislation should be introduced to achieve this    Reporting by Elizabeth Piper and Paul Sandle  Editing by David Holmes  

TOKYO   Japan s telcos were formally allocated 5G spectrum by regulators on Wednesday  a major milestone ahead of the launch of high speed wireless services next spring  The three big carriers   NTT Docomo  KDDI and SoftBank Corp   along with new entrant Rakuten Inc  received spectrum from the telecoms ministry  The technology  which can provide data speeds at least 20 times faster than 4G  is seen as essential for emerging technologies from self driving cars and smart cities to augmented reality and artificial intelligence Japan is lagging other countries such as South Korea and the United States that have already begun rolling out 5G services  One of the conditions from the telecoms ministry was to  take sufficient cybersecurity measures including responding to supply chain risk   The condition effectively prevents the telecom providers from using network equipment from China s Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp  and follows a de facto ban implemented last year on Japanese government purchases from the manufacturers Huawei and ZTE are under intense scrutiny from Washington over their ties to the Chinese government  driven by concerns they could be used by Beijing for spying The four Japanese telcos will cumulatively spend just under 1 7 trillion yen   15 29 billion  over five years building their networks  That is seen as a conservative estimate likely to rise over time  The financial burden on the telcos comes as they face government pressure to lower carrier fees  with the start of 4G services by Rakuten in October expected to increase price competition    Reporting by Sam Nussey and Yoshiyasu Shida  Editing by Sherry Jacob Phillips

LONDON   A British man whose girlfriend died after they were both poisoned by a nerve agent thought to have been discarded by Russian intelligence officers in England went looking for answers at the Russian Embassy in London this weekend  asking   Why did your country kill my girlfriend  The startling meeting   which at times seemed more like a friendly tour of the embassy in South Kensington  an affluent area in West London  than an inquisition of a representative of the government potentially responsible for the death of his girlfriend  Dawn Sturgess  in July   left more questions than answers The meeting between the man  Charlie Rowley  and Russia s ambassador to Britain  Alexander V  Yakovenko  on Saturday was partly arranged by The Sunday Mirror  a British tabloid Mr  Rowley met with Russia s envoy nine months after he and Ms  Sturgess were poisoned by a nerve agent that the authorities say was originally used to target a former Russian spy  Sergei V  Skripal  in March 2018  But Mr  Skripal s daughter  Yulia  and a police officer were also sickened The poisoning was at the center of a diplomatic split between Britain and Russia  leading both countries to engage in tit for tat expulsions of each others  diplomats  Mr  Rowley also lost some of his eyesight  suffered strokes and contracted meningitis after the attack But on Sunday  the BBC showed images of Mr  Rowley shaking the hands of the smiling ambassador as Mr  Rowley s brother Matthew sat in a wheelchair in the room  The envoy also is seen showing the Britons around the embassy  I went along to ask them  Why did your country kill my girlfriend      Mr  Rowley said in an interview with The Sunday Mirror   But I didn t really get any answers   Mr  Rowley added   I just got Russian propaganda  ImageA police officer standing guard on the street in Salisbury  England  last July where Dawn Sturgess lived before she was exposed to the nerve agent Novichok CreditJack Taylor Getty ImagesMr  Yakovenko denied that Russia had been behind the poisonings  He then asked his visitors to pass his  best regards to the parents  of Ms  Sturgess  I know how it was hard for them   he said  according to video footage published by The Sunday Mirror  and in an apparent appeal for cooperation  added   But we should be together  definitely  Neither The Sunday Mirror nor the Russian Embassy responded to requests for comment on Sunday  Mr  Rowley could not immediately be reached Russia has always denied any role in poisoning Mr  Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury  England  with the military grade nerve agent  Novichok  But the British authorities say it had been the work of at least two Russian intelligence officers  Anatoly V  Chepiga and Aleksandr Y  Mishkin  who were caught on CCTV entering the country and traveling to Salisbury In an interview with the state run Russian network RT  both claimed they were sports nutritionists who had visited Salisbury as tourists because of its remarkable cathedral But the British authorities say they believe that the Russians had carelessly discarded the remaining poison  which was found by Mr  Rowley while he was rummaging through a dumpster Ms  Sturgess  44  fell ill in Amesbury  a town in southern England  after Mr  Rowley  45  gave her a small glass bottle he had found in a box in the trash  He thought the oily substance inside the bottle was perfume  She sprayed it on her wrist  and rubbed her hands together  he later told the authorities A week later she was dead  and he was in a coma It was only when he regained consciousness in a hospital that the police told him that the substance was Novichok  he said in an interview with the British television channel ITV in July ImageDawn Sturgess  who died after being poisoned by the nerve agent CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe authorities said at the time that Mr  Rowley and Ms  Sturgess had most likely been accidentally exposed to the poison In March  Ewan Hope  the son of Ms  Sturgess  asked President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia to allow British investigators to question the men presumed responsible  telling Mr  Putin   I am appealing to you as a human being   Allow our officers to question these men about my mother s murder   he urged Mr  Putin on the anniversary of the nerve agent attack on Mr  Skripal  according to excerpts from a letter published in The Mirror In denying its role in the poisonings  Russia has also satirized the episode  In December  RT sent around chocolate replicas of Salisbury Cathedral as holiday gifts But on Saturday  the Russian ambassador handed Mr  Rowley a 51 page dossier titled  Salisbury  Unanswered Questions   in which Britain is accused of  inaccuracies and inconsistencies   and of  failing to provide information   according to The Sunday Mirror Mr  Yakovenko later told reporters that the meeting had been  quite a friendly event   He added of Mr  Rowley   It was an ordinary conversation between friends  He just wanted to know the truth  The envoy also told Mr  Rowley that the British police had never asked to interview the two suspects  But Mr  Rowley did not appear to be convinced by much of what he heard  He hasn t changed my view that Russia  is responsible  he said Mr  Rowley told The Mirror   He said Russia only have small amounts of Novichok because they use it as an antidote and don t produce it any more   He said the only countries that produce it now are the Czech Republic and America   he added  I said   Well  my girlfriend did die  it s only because I washed it off that I m still here     Mr  Rowley said   He didn t know what to say to that   

KAMPALA  Uganda   Protests in Sudan reached a new stage over the weekend  with tens of thousands of people demonstrating in front of army headquarters in Khartoum to demand the departure of President Omar Hassan al Bashir  who has wielded authoritarian power for three decades In what may signal a significant development  some soldiers appeared to be throwing their support behind the uprising  They protected protesters from other security forces intent on dispersing them  three demonstrators recounted Sunday afternoon On at least one occasion  gunfire erupted as uniformed men fought over whether to crack down on the protesters or protect them  two eyewitnesses said in phone interviews Sunday evening The protests began in December amid food shortages and rising prices  and quickly became a mass movement across Sudan  united by the demand that Mr  al Bashir step down  Over the weekend  they gained momentum as vast numbers of protesters gathered in front of army headquarters Mr  al Bashir s residence in Khartoum  the capital  is in the same military compound as the army headquarters  Protest organizers estimated that hundreds of thousands of people had gathered  eclipsing earlier demonstrations On Sunday  the region was bracing for Mr  al Bashir s response The president met with his security council  according to the state news agency  SUNA  which said the council had taken steps to maintain peace and security  The government  it said  is eager to hold talks with all groups to achieve national consensus The latest protests in Sudan come less than a week after the ailing president of Algeria  Abdelaziz Bouteflika  agreed to resign amid mass demonstrations that were largely peaceful While Mr  al Bashir s hold on power is seen as much stronger than Mr  Bouteflika s  his position seemed to weaken somewhat over the weekend as the protests gathered strength  The government seemed unsure of how to respond Protesters and activists were torn between elation and anxiety amid talk of a coming crackdown  This was a great blow to the government   said Ibrahim Taha Ayoub  who in the mid 1980s was Sudan s foreign minister  referring to the weekend s demonstration Mr  Ayoub  who has repeatedly attended protests in recent months  said he expected that certain security forces were waiting for an opportunity   or the government s permission   to attack the crowds in front of army headquarters ImagePresident Omar Hassan al Bashir speaking last week to Parliament  Protesters are demanding that he step down CreditMohamed Nureldin Abdallah ReutersOne worrisome sign over the weekend was the increased presence in Khartoum of the janjaweed  notorious militias that were blamed for atrocities in the conflict in Darfur  The Sudanese government has reconstituted them as the Rapid Support Forces  The janjaweed is entering the city   said one doctor in his mid 20s who attended the protests Saturday and Sunday and did not want to be identified in greater detail because of safety concerns He said that at checkpoints set up over the weekend  the janjaweed were searching people and vehicles for water and food in a show of force and in an effort to prevent supplies from reaching the protesters Mr  al Bashir rose to power in a military coup in 1989 and for much of the time since  he and Sudan have been regarded as pariahs in the West For a time in the 1990s  Sudan hosted Osama bin Laden  And Mr  al Bashir is the only current leader of a nation to be wanted by the International Criminal Court  The court has indicted him on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide  accusing him of playing  an essential role  in atrocities in Darfur  a region in western Sudan In recent years  Mr  al Bashir has sought to improve his standing in the West  and in 2017 the United States agreed to lift sanctions against Sudan  citing several promising changes  Among other things  Sudan agreed not to engage in arms deals with North Korea  and to reduce its interference in South Sudan  which after a long civil war became independent in 2011 But that relief has not solved the economic problems in Sudan  There is nothing in Sudan   one activist  Hafiz Mohamed  said Sunday in a phone interview from Addis Ababa  Ethiopia Automated teller machines do not dispense cash  and retirees cannot withdraw their money from banks  Lines at bakeries can be hours long   and often  there is nothing to buy  If you do have money   Mr  Mohamed said   there is not enough flour for bakers to make bread  It was the price of bread that helped spur the initial protest in the city of Atbara on Dec  19  Demonstrations quickly spread across Sudan despite often harsh efforts to suppress them Over the next three months  government forces killed 60 protesters  according to a report by Physicians for Human Rights  a group based in New York  The group said the police and the country s powerful internal security agency  the National Intelligence and Security Service   have entered and conducted attacks on at least seven medical facilities  In a February television broadcast  Mr  al Bashir announced a state of emergency  dissolving the federal government and installing military generals in place of state governors ImageIn December  after protests broke out in Atbara over bread prices  the headquarters of the governing party there was set on fire CreditSudanese Activist  via Associated PressThe protests continued  but for a time Mr  al Bashir seemed to have had some success in slowing their momentum  Protesters were driven off with tear gas  bullets and shotgun blasts Yet on Saturday  marchers were able to approach the army headquarters  meeting far less resistance than expected  As the protest continued into Sunday  thousands more people streamed in  swelling its numbers There was some violence and reports of about five deaths   mainly in Khartoum and mainly from gunfire   related to the protests Still  activists said that the protesters had been met with less violence than some had anticipated  and that the general mood among the protesters was joyous  And some protesters found that once they were near army headquarters  some soldiers shielded them  The military guys are protecting us from other government bodies   a participant who gave only his first name  Elsamawal  said by phone on Sunday Elsamawal  32  who works in sales  said he watched as an argument unfolded between uniformed soldiers and officers from the National Intelligence and Security Service  Some of the national security people were trying to stop people from reaching this area  but I saw the soldiers tell them not to touch the protesters  that they are going peacefully  and to let them go   he said As Elsamawal spoke  protesters could be heard in the background chanting   Just fall  that s all    a slogan aimed at Mr  al Bashir Two other protesters  including the doctor in his mid 20s  said they had seen gunfire erupt as soldiers confronted National Intelligence and Security Service forces intent on dispersing the protesters But it was unclear how high up the military ranks existed support   or at least sympathy   for the protesters  Of course the army s commanders are supporting the president   but the rank and file  the middle ranks  we are banking on them   Mr  Ayoub  the former foreign minister  said in a phone interview The Sudanese minister for information  Hassan Ismail  the government s main spokesman   commended the way the regular forces dealt with demonstrators who gathered in front of the army general command

TEHRAN  Iran   Iran s top leader has warned visiting Iraqi prime minister about a lengthy presence of U S  forces in Iran s neighboring Arab country The website of the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday quotes him as telling Adel Abdul Mahdi that Iraq s government should take measures to remove American forces quickly  He says the longer the U S  forces are there  the more difficult it will be to remove them Some 5 200 troops are stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement with the Iraqi government to advise  assist and support the country s troops in the fight against the Islamic State Tehran sees the U S  military presence at its doorstep in Iraq as a threat   one that could also undermine Iran s influence over Baghdad  

 Reuters    A U S  judge on Monday halted the Trump administration s policy of sending some asylum seekers back across the southern border to wait out their cases in Mexico  stopping a program the government planned to expand to stem a recent flood of migrants The ruling is slated to take effect on Friday  according to the order by U S  District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco  The preliminary injunction will apply nationwide In a late night tweet  U S  President Donald Trump said   A 9th Circuit Judge just ruled that Mexico is too dangerous for migrants  So unfair to the U S  OUT OF CONTROL  The program was launched in January and was one of many policies aimed at slowing rising numbers of immigrants arriving at the border  many of them families from Central America  that swelled last month to the highest in a decade Because of limits on how long children are legally allowed to be held in detention  many of the families are released to await U S  immigration court hearings  a process that can take years because of ballooning backlogs  The Trump administration said last week it planned to expand the program of sending some migrants to wait out their U S  court dates in Mexican border cities under a policy known as Migrant Protection Protocols  or MPP The government argued MPP was needed because so many asylum seekers spend years living in the United States and never appear for their court hearings before their claim is denied and an immigration judge orders them to be deported  Seeborg said the Immigration and Nationalization Act  however  does not authorize the government to return asylum seekers to Mexico the way the government has applied it  He also said the policy lacks safeguards to protect refugees from threats to their life or freedom Justice Department data show that while the percentage of immigration court cases completed  in absentia    when the foreign citizen fails to show   has risen in recent years  the majority of immigrants show up for their hearings  A U S  Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment on Monday s ruling  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment The Mexican foreign ministry considers the ruling  an internal decision  of the United States  a spokesman said Seeborg said the government shall permit the 11 plaintiffs in the case to enter the United States beginning on Sunday  He said the government still retained the right to detain the asylum seekers pending the outcome of their case The ruling can be appealed  and the government could seek a stay of the injunction until the appeals process runs its course  LAWYERS  MIGRANTS GRATIFIEDStill  lawyers for migrants were gratified by the decision  This is a great ruling   said Judy Rabinovitz  a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union  which was one of the groups that brought the case   This is what they were planning on implementing on a large scale  That would have been a complete game changer in the way our asylum system works   she said Rabinovitz said the groups that brought the lawsuit needed to discuss what could be done for the hundreds of refugees who are awaiting their cases in Mexico  She said as their cases are heard  they will be returned to the United States  but that could take months The plaintiffs include legal service organizations and migrants who fled Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador to escape what they said was extreme violence  rape and death threats Gabriela Orellana  26  an asylum seeker from El Salvador who was scheduled to have her first hearing on Tuesday  was delighted by news of the judge s ruling  I m crying from happiness   she told Reuters  She is not one of the plaintiffs in the case Orellana said she fled El Salvador with her 8 year old daughter and 6 year old son after she was shot by a gang member  She has been in Tijuana since January and has waited nearly two months for her first interview with U S  immigration authorities Others in Tijuana were more cautious  Will I be allowed to go or do I have to stay   asked Veronica Galdames  who said she fled San Salvador in 2018 after gang members stole her food cart and  pointing a gun at her  told her she had 24 hours to get out of the city  I feel real happiness  but also uncertainty  because I don t know if this applies to me   Galdames said MPP was based on a decades old law that says migrants who enter from a contiguous country can be returned there to wait out their deportation case  although the provision had never been used in the way the administration has applied it Civil rights groups sued  arguing the policy violated U S  and international law by returning refugees to dangerous border towns where they would be unable to get legal counsel or notices of hearings

KAMPALA  Uganda   A quarter century after Rwanda s brutal genocide  President Paul Kagame remains a constant figure atop the country s politics  feted by those who say it needs his visionary leadership and loathed by others who see a firm authoritarian with a malicious streak Kagame is so little questioned that he speaks openly about the apparent assassinations of opponents  That fear factor keeps him in power  critics say  even as he embraces a global reputation as the man who helped bring an end to the mass killings of some 800 000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus  and who has brought stability to the East African nation In a speech last month  Kagame spoke dismissively of the crime that launched his reputation as a hard liner  The 1998 killing of exiled opposition leader Seth Sendashonga  a fierce Kagame critic  who was gunned down in the streets of the Kenyan capital  Nairobi Referring to the assassination  widely believed to have been carried out by a Rwandan hit squad at Kagame s orders  Kagame said he had little to say   But I am also not apologetic about it   he added It was vintage Kagame  who has been Rwanda s de facto leader since his rebel group seized power by force  ending the 100 day genocide that began on April 7  1994  He has been president since 2000  and could rule until 2034 following changes to the constitution Now 61  Kagame shows no signs of giving up power A darling of the development community  Kagame is lauded by some as a driver of economic growth that has lifted many Rwandans from poverty  bringing improved health care and education  He has also pushed for more women in political office  and 64  of the lawmakers in Rwanda s parliament are women  the highest percentage of any country in the world But for many others he is the architect of an authoritarian regime that has stamped out virtually all opposition in Rwanda as opponents are jailed  flee  disappear  or are killed under mysterious circumstances  There is absolutely no room for dissent within Rwanda   said British writer Michela Wrong  who is researching a book on the country   You agree  you accept Kagame s supreme power  or you leave  Rights groups decry what they describe as rampant violations that include the arbitrary detentions of street children and other poor people as part of an unofficial government program to hide  undesirable  citizens from view  according to Human Rights Watch  Street vendors  many of them women  have been among the main targets  it said Civic groups  journalists  rights watchdogs and political opponents  cannot operate independently or criticize government policy   Human Rights Watch said in its most recent assessment of conditions in Rwanda Amnesty International cited a  climate of fear  before Kagame was re elected to a third term in 2017  a vote that the president described as  a formality  after the most serious challenger was prevented from running and later jailed Even government programs ostensibly aimed at forging national unity are criticized by opponents as tools to more tightly control society The U S  State Department  which describes Rwanda as  a constitutional republic dominated by a strong presidency   also cites the problem of impunity among civilian authorities and the security forces Still  Rwanda s government remains a major recipient of U S  and other foreign aid despite persistent allegations of abuses   a fact that has been sharply criticized by Kagame s opponents  Some analysts have long noted that Western remorse over failure to stop the genocide allows Rwanda a measure of goodwill from benefactors who would act tougher with a similarly repressive regime Olivier Nduhungirehe  Rwanda s deputy minister of foreign affairs  told The Associated Press that those complaining about human rights  should keep quiet   as Rwanda marks 25 years since the genocide  We can t say that everything is perfect  of course   he said  of concerns voiced by some exiles  who say they are afraid to return home   But reconciliation is a reality for the past 25 years  Some critics who have fallen out with the president  including senior ruling party members once seen as Kagame allies  have fled into exile  where safety isn t always guaranteed British police have warned two prominent Rwandan dissidents of the threats to their lives posed by Rwanda s government  Similar warnings have been issued to dissidents elsewhere in Europe In South Africa  an inquest continues into the death of former Rwandan spy chief and Kagame critic Patrick Karegeya  who was found strangled in a Johannesburg hotel in 2014  Kagame has denied his government had anything to do with the killing but warned that those who betray their country will  pay the price  Jean Marie Micombero  a former army major who broke with the Kagame government and who has lived in exile in Belgium since 2011  said that 25 years after Rwanda s genocide  the country has yet to truly heal from its violent past  Under Kagame s leadership Hutus and Tutsis are forced to live together   said Micombero  a Tutsi  He called for new leadership that would  work in the areas of truth and justice in the context of a broken society      There cannot be reconciliation without truth and justice  One group in exile that is leading the opposition against Kagame includes former members of Rwanda s ruling party Outlawed in Rwanda as a terrorist group and accused of running rebel cells in eastern Congo  the Rwanda National Congress denies the allegations and says it is working toward  a united  democratic  and prosperous nation inhabited by free citizens  The group s Johannesburg based leader  former Rwandan army chief Gen  Kayumba Nyamwasa  has been the target of multiple assassination attempts that he blames on Kagame Rwanda s government dismisses charges it runs hit squads abroad  Nduhungirehe  the deputy foreign affairs minister  accused the Rwanda National Congress of  walking hand in hand with those who committed genocide   something the group strongly denies But  says Wrong  the British author and journalist   The level of invective Kagame dedicates to the Rwanda National Congress  the amount of energy he has expended trying to get Uganda and South Africa to expel or extradite or close down these players  suggests he sees them as a real threat   These individuals were

BOGOT  Colombia   I was a member of the opposition coalition that participated in the talks with Nicols Maduro s government between 2017 and 2018  For more than a year we tried to work out a deal that would put an end to the chaos deepening in Venezuela  But no solution is viable as long as the country remains tethered to Cuba  The communications minister and government representative in the talks  Jorge Rodrguez  reiterated Venezuela s desire that it receive the same treatment as Cuba  This declaration laid bare the pretension of the regime  a dictatorship that is accepted and ultimately gets its way  like the one Ral Castro inherited from his brother and passed on to Miguel Daz Canel But Cuba is more than an inspiration and a role model for the Chavismo government  The island nation has hijacked Venezuela and is effectively holding it hostage  Important government decisions are being made in Havana  not in Caracas  The Castro regime s tentacles extend to several Venezuelan governmental institutions  including the armed forces and the offices of immigration and health services In a speech at the United Nations in October  the secretary general of the Organization of American States  Luis Almagro  said that at least 22 000 Cubans have infiltrated Venezuela s government and its institutions  They have done so  he explained  holding important positions in government agencies and in the national security and intelligence services In the past few years Mr  Maduro s regime has moved to consolidate power and dismantle democratic institutions  In the 2015 parliamentary elections  opposition parties won a majority of the seats in the National Assembly  but Mr  Maduro stripped it of its powers  The next year  the regime illegally postponed regional elections and suspended the process of calling for a presidential referendum  In 2017  we took to the streets to protest the illegitimate sentences imposed by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice against the National Assembly  and we chose to not participate in the rigged regional elections  Civilian demonstrations against Maduro s dictatorship that year left at least 120 people dead  thousands wounded and hundreds imprisoned  According to Foro Penal  a prominent Venezuelan human rights organization  911 political prisoners are being held in Venezuela  In the past year  seven attempts by the military to re establish the Constitution and our sovereignty  today partially controlled by Cuban leadership  have been aborted  More than 100 military officers have been imprisoned In the mediated talks with the Maduro regime  conducted in the Dominican Republic  we sought to agree on conditions for presidential elections with democratic guarantees  but the regime refused an electoral process that reflected the will of the Venezuelan people  We declined to sign the agreement  and the talks dissolved on January 2018  For years the opposition has tried to negotiate with the regime to find a democratic solution to this mess  Instead  Mr  Maduro pushed on with a sham presidential election on May 20  2018  which was not recognized by Venezuelans and many of the world s democracies  Mr  Maduro s approach echoes the Cuban model  where a single party rules and elections aren t competitive The inextricable relationship between the Castro dictatorship and the Chavista regime began 25 years ago  when Hugo Chvez visited Havana just after being released from prison  When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and set in motion the collapse of the Soviet Union  Fidel Castro s Cuba lost its great economic benefactor  Mr  Chvez s rise to power in Venezuela a decade later allowed Mr  Castro to find a replacement  The relationship between the two countries was cemented between 2004 and 2014  when Venezuela experienced an oil windfall The relationship has proved lucrative for the Cuban government  Between 40 000 and 50 000 barrels of Venezuelan oil are sent to Cuba daily  despite the fact that Venezuelan oil production has declined more than 60 percent in recent years  Venezuela s economic subsidy reached its peak at about 12 percent of Cuba s gross domestic product  During the boom years  around 90 000 barrels of crude oil daily  representing  9 billion annually  were sent to Cuba  Some estimate that over approximately 15 years  Venezuela has subsidized  35 billion in oil to Cuba  The country was brought further into debt when Mr  Maduro bought  440 million in foreign crude and sent it to Cuba between 2017 and 2018  The problem  therefore  is not a potential invasion of Venezuela by a foreign power  for over a decade  Cuba has been a parasite  stripping us of our resources But unlike Cuba  we are not an island  We have land borders  and our tragedy has spread throughout the region  adding pressure to neighboring countries  To stabilize the region and restore democracy  we must cut off the authoritarian germ rooted in Cuba and Venezuela  Democracy cannot be restored until the two regimes are decoupled Mr  Maduro has shown that he will not leave power of his own volition  Those of us who oppose his rule are not armed  nor do we seek to oust his regime violently  We have offered amnesty but it has been rejected  However  we will never accept the normalization of this de facto dictatorship  As long as Mr  Maduro remains in power there will be more deaths  prisoners  persecution and compatriots forced to migrate  The international community has exhausted its diplomatic arsenal because there is no precedent in Latin America for a situation similar to that of Venezuela s  When it comes  Mr  Maduro s exit will be equivalent to the fall of the Berlin Wall for the region It is a mistake to ask those seeking democracy in Venezuela to distance themselves from their United States and Latin American allies at this juncture  They represent the only opportunity to counterbalance a regime with unlimited power and no institutional oversight  that is armed and willing to exercise violence  Democratic countries must direct pressure toward Havana as well to bring about change in Venezuela The call of the National Assembly and the country s acting president  Juan Guaid  for Venezuela to stop sending oil to Cuba is a first step  Companies trading with Venezuelan oil must comply if they want to avoid secondary sanctions derived from those already imposed against our state owned oil and gas company  P D V S A   by the United States  For its part  the Lima Group must ensure that previously agreed upon investigations into corruption and human rights violations are carried out  which could involve citizens of its countries  as well as Venezuelans and Cubans Finally  the international left wing must understand that Venezuelans are not victims of a single dictatorship  but of two  Mr  Maduro s and Cuba s  They must withdraw their solidarity and support for Nicols Maduro Julio Borges was president of the National Assembly of Venezuela and is Juan Guaid s ambassador to the Lima Group  This article was translated from the Spanish by Erin Goodman The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the

LJUBLJANA   A proposal by Slovenia s government that would make the national central bank liable for any damages arising from court cases related to the 2013 rescue of the country s banks would breach European Union rules  the European Central Bank has said In a March 27 opinion that has now been published  the ECB said   A requirement that Bank of Slovenia must pay compensation for damages     would not be in line with the monetary financing prohibition  that prevents central banks funding governments  In 2013  more than 3 billion euros  2 59 billion pounds  was poured into Slovenia s mostly state owned banks to prevent them from collapsing under a mountain of bad loans The process  which was led by the Bank of Slovenia in coordination with the government  the European Commission and the ECB  saw 600 million euros of subordinated bonds and bank shares held by around 100 000 investors scrapped Many of those bondholders and shareholders are now suing the banks and the central bank to get their money back  although no rulings have yet been finalised  The finance ministry proposed a law in February under which the central bank would pay any damages related to the rescue  That followed a 2016 ruling by the Constitutional Court that parliament should give greater legal protection to holders of the scrapped bonds and shares The central bank says the proposed change would break EU and Slovenian law  and Governor Bostjan Vasle urged Prime Minister Marjan Sarec on Monday to find another solution  The finance ministry was not immediately available for comment on Monday but told Reuters last month it will take into account reactions to the proposed law before presenting a final draft  This version of the story has been refiled with new headline   Reporting By Marja Novak  Editing by Catherine Evans  

CAIRO   Libya has been plunged into chaos again  with forces loyal to a polarizing military commander marching on the capital and trading fire with militias aligned with a weak U N  backed government The battle for Tripoli could ignite civil war on the scale of the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi  That conflict left behind a patchwork of local  tribal and Islamist militias governing various fiefdoms  often through extortion and brute force  It also transformed Libya into a haven for extremists and a major conduit for migrants making perilous journeys to Europe Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter  who has spent the last few years battling Islamic militants in eastern Libya  presents himself as a strong hand that can unify the country and rid it of extremists  But his opponents view him as another would be strongman in the mold of Gadhafi HOW DID LIBYA GET HERE Inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings sweeping the region  Libyans rose up in February 2011 against Gadhafi  who responded with a fierce military crackdown  As the uprising quickly escalated into a civil war  Gadhafi massed tanks outside the eastern city of Benghazi and threatened to massacre the protesters street by street NATO responded with a bombing campaign against Gadhafi s forces  and eventually provided close air support to a loose alliance of rebel militias  helping them to drive him from power  The rebels captured Gadhafi in his home city of Sirte in October 2011 and killed him  later releasing video footage of him being beaten and humiliated Libya held free elections the following year  but the government was powerless to control the vast array of militias  and the democratic transition stalled  Fighting erupted in Tripoli in the summer of 2014  leaving the international airport largely destroyed and resulting in separate governments in the capital and in eastern Libya  each backed by various armed groups In 2015  the U N  backed the formation of a transitional government in Tripoli  in the west  under the leadership of technocrat Fayez Sarraj  A separate government  based in the east and allied with Hifter  has rejected its authority    WHO IS HIFTER Hifter helped Gadhafi seize power in a 1969 coup against the monarchy and rose through the ranks of the military  eventually commanding Libyan forces in the 1973 Arab Israeli war  But his reputation was left in tatters by Libya s disastrous defeat in the war with Chad in the 1980s  in which he was among thousands captured As the war wound down  he defected and joined the armed opposition to Gadhafi  orchestrating a number of failed coup attempts  He eventually relocated to the Washington  D C  area  where he lived in exile for 20 years  leading to widespread speculation that he worked with the CIA He returned to Libya in 2011 and commanded forces during the uprising against Gadhafi  But he soured on the revolution during the chaos following the dictator s death  and soon organized a campaign against the various Islamic militant groups that took root in eastern Libya In recent years he has fought a series of battles there  leaving a swath of destruction but eventually retaking most of eastern Libya and its vital oil facilities  Over the last few months he has quietly expanded his influence across the south  winning over local tribes and factions He has cast his opponents as Islamic extremists and modeled himself on President Abdel Fattah el Sissi in neighboring Egypt  who led the military overthrow of an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013 and has since presided over an unprecedented crackdown on dissent Hifter is supported by Egypt  as well as the United Arab Emirates  Russia and France  His supporters see him as the best hope of stabilizing the troubled country and combatting extremists    WHO IS HE FIGHTING Hifter is expected to face stiff resistance from powerful militias from the western cities of Misrata and Zawiya  two areas that saw heavy fighting during the 2011 uprising  The Zawiya militias captured 100 of Hifter s forces on Friday  the day after he launched his offensive  The battle hardened Misratans led the fight against an Islamic State group affiliate in 2016  eventually driving it from its last stronghold in Sirte with U S  air support The Tripoli factions present themselves as heirs to the 2011 revolution  but they are widely blamed for derailing the political transition through kidnappings   including of a transitional prime minister   extortion and violence They have received support from Turkey and Qatar as part of the regional rivalry between those two countries and Egypt and the United Arab Emirates  European countries have provided aid to local armed groups to stem the flow of migrants  battle extremists and protect oil supplies The U N  backed government has sought support from the militias as it has struggled to gain a foothold in the capital  while the militias have clashed with each other  most recently in September The U N  Security Council has meanwhile called on Hifter to halt his advance and for all sides to de escalate the situation  U N  envoy Ghassan Salame says he still hopes to convene a national conference later this month to plan for elections

President Trump  Don t  Maduro has been a catastrophe for Venezuelans  and Trump is right to join Canada and more than 50 other countries in recognizing the head of the National Assembly  Juan Guaid  as the legitimate leader of Venezuela The problem is that Trump s saber rattling backfires  helping Maduro by playing into a narrative of Yankee imperialism  and his politicization of humanitarian aid makes it less likely that starving people will actually be fed Here s a three part strategy that some other countries are already moving toward  Nudge Mexico  which has refused to back Guaid  to play

KHARTOUM   Thousands of Sudanese protesters clashed with security forces outside President Omar al Bashir s residence in central Khartoum on Saturday in what appeared to be the biggest demonstration in months of protests against his 30 year rule  witnesses said Across the River Nile in Khartoum s twin city of Omdurman  which also saw protests into the evening  one civilian died from injuries sustained during  rioting  and other civilians and police officers were wounded  state news agency SUNA said  citing police reports  The victim was a laboratory doctor  according to a statement from an opposition doctors  committee  Medical staff have played a prominent role in the protests  in which dozens of people have been killed over the past three and a half months  Security forces fired tear gas at protesters in Omdurman and at stone throwing demonstrators near Bashir s residence  who had responded to a call by activists trying to increase pressure on Bashir to step down They waved Sudanese flags and chanted slogans demanding  freedom  peace and justice  as they gathered outside the gates of the compound  guarded by soldiers  that also houses the defence ministry  army command and security headquarters By the evening  the clashes subsided as security forces pulled back  allowing the thousands still gathered to remain outside the compound  Witnesses said young demonstrators sang nationalist songs and danced for joy  Some said they would stay until Bashir stepped down Information Minister Hassan Ismail  who also serves as the government spokesman  praised security forces for the way they handled the protests and said the government remained committed to dialogue to resolve the crisis  The approach followed by government apparatus was met with satisfaction from citizens   Ismail said in a statement   Sudanese blood is the most precious thing we need to preserve  Bashir has refused to step down  saying his opponents need to seek power through the ballot box  Today  we won and we are confident that the regime will fall   said Mohamed Saleh  a 63 year old university professor who estimated the crowd to be at more than 100 000 people An independent estimate for the number of protesters was not immediately available  But witnesses said the protest appeared to be larger than previous ones  There are crowds as far as the eye can see   one witness told Reuters ANNIVERSARYSudanese activists  apparently emboldened by the success of similar but much larger protests in Algeria that forced ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down  called Saturday s demonstrations to mark the anniversary of the 1985 coup that forced then President Jaafar Nimeiri to step down following mass protests against his rule The demonstrators said they wanted to deliver a message to the country s armed forces to side with them in trying to push Bashir out of power  Sudanese activists say the armed forces had in the past backed popular protests against autocratic rulers  including their move against Nimeiri 34 years ago Nimeiri s downfall paved the way for national elections and a civilian government that Bashir ousted in an Islamist backed military coup in 1989  Bashir was since elected president in elections his critics say were neither fair nor free The wave of protests that began on Dec  19 were triggered by price rises and cash shortages but have become the most sustained challenge to his long rule In February  Bashir declared a state of emergency in the country of 40 million  and sacked his government and state governors  Bashir is wanted by international prosecutors for alleged war crimes while trying to put down an armed uprising in the country s western Darfur region since 2003  Sudan denies war crimes were committed   Reporting by Reuters staff  Writing by Sami Aboudi  Editing by Helen Popper  Alexandra Hudson and Daniel Wallis  

Over the last decade  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has repeatedly quashed rivals on the left and the right  defying the odds   and the polls   to hold onto power  He has increasingly relied on right wing partners to do so Yet in nationwide elections Tuesday  he faces an unexpectedly strong challenger  Benny Gantz  a former army chief who has tirelessly reminded voters that Mr  Netanyahu may soon face corruption charges   a planned indictment that would make him the first sitting prime minister in Israel to face criminal prosecution Mr  Netanyahu s future   and his legacy   are not the only things at stake in the election  A potential reshuffling of Israel s chaotic political landscape could have far reaching consequences  Here s a guide to our coverage of the players  issues and possible ramifications of the election The headliners  Mr  Netanyahu  69  has framed himself as Israel s Indispensable Man  the tough ex soldier who has aggressively defended Israel s interests  raising the country s prominence on the world stage  His relentless self promotion and potent politics of division   pitting right against left  Jew against Arab  religious against secular   have helped him dodge past allegations of corruption and build his current coalition  consisting of his Likud party and pro settlement and ultra Orthodox factions ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel visiting the market in Jerusalem while campaigning on Monday CreditDan Balilty for The New York Times  Mr  Gantz  59  is a three star general who fought two wars in Gaza  giving him credentials to challenge Mr  Netanyahu s  Mr  Security  persona  In campaign ads  Mr  Gantz both boasted about  terrorists killed  over his military career and suggested he could be a peacemaker  He teamed up with two other former army chiefs and another centrist  Yair Lapid  to try to court voters in the middle of the ideological spectrum Kingmakers and a political brawl  Under Israel s chaotic and confusing parliamentary system  a panoply of small parties could tip the balance of power  The unlikeliest kingmaker is an iconoclastic politician  Moshe Feiglin  last seen pushing a far right agenda of annexing the entire West Bank  He is now calling for the legalization of marijuana and has put out proposals aimed at reducing the cost of living  a flat tax  privatization of hospitals  an end to import tariffs  and land reform to lower housing costs   The Arab vote is also a wild card   especially as  on the eve of the election  Mr  Netanyahu pledged to begin annexing parts of the West Bank  a potentially fatal blow to the prospects for a peace agreement with Palestinians  A strong turnout among Palestinian citizens of Israel  who make up 20 percent of the population  could raise the number of votes needed to make it into Parliament  jeopardizing smaller parties on the right and the left  Yet Arab voters have seemed even less enthusiastic about voting than Jews  and a boycott the vote campaign has gained strength in the past month   Whoever wins in the electoral contest will have to cobble together a coalition in Parliament  where no party has ever won a 61 seat majority outright  Here s our guide to the factions and system   In the turbulent run up to the vote  parties collapsed  former allies turned on one another and younger Likud leaders prepared for life after Bibi  Election ads reflected the ugly  anything goes tenor of the race  and neither of the front runners said much about policy ImageCampaign posters showing leaders of the Blue and White party in Tel Aviv on Tuesday CreditDan Balilty for The New York Times  A series of unforced errors by Mr  Gantz gave Mr  Netanyahu opportunities to call his fitness for office into question  as did a report on Israeli television that Mr  Gantz s cellphone had been hacked by Iranian intelligence  Mr  Netanyahu also played up President Trump s recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli territory  and his relationship with Mr  Trump   Mr  Gantz  meanwhile  hammered on the allegations of corruption around the prime minister  An Israeli watchdog group found a network of hundreds of social media accounts  many of them fake  were being used to smear Mr  Netanyahu s opponents  Both men seized on Menachem Begin  the former prime minister and militant Zionist  as a campaign prop   27 years after his death The indictment  In February  Israel s attorney general announced his intention to indict Mr  Netanyahu on charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  Mr  Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing  and is entitled to a hearing before an indictment is formally issued   Read more here about the cases against him  the culmination of a two year investigation into his dealings with wealthy businessmen  including a Hollywood movie producer and Israeli newspaper publishers   Mr  Netanyahu is also facing a new scandal  He is accused of secretly approving the sale of advanced submarines to Egypt without the approval of top military officials  and is accused of self dealing  through an undisclosed and enormously profitable financial stake in a company that supplied the German builder of both the Egyptian subs and several new Israeli warships  

Congress has landed on one of those rare ideas that commands support from both Democrats and Republicans  Unfortunately  it s a bad one On Tuesday  the House approved legislation misleadingly titled the Taxpayer First Act that includes a provision prohibiting the Internal Revenue Service from developing a free online system that most American households could use to file their taxes  The Senate is considering a similar piece of bipartisan legislation This makes no sense  Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes  Instead of barring the I R S  from making April a little less miserable  why isn t Congress requiring the I R S  to create a free tax filing website Better yet  the United States could emulate the roughly three dozen countries  including Chile  Japan and Britain  where most taxpayers do not need to fill out tax returns  In some of those countries  the accuracy of tax withholding is sufficient to obviate the annual filing process  In others  the government sends out completed forms to most taxpayers  In Estonia  filing taxes can be done in less than three minutes The federal government collects enough information about most American households to mail out a completed tax form that people would simply need to verify  sign and return  President Ronald Reagan proposed a version of just such a system  In 1998  Congress passed a law instructing the I R S  to develop such a system by 2008  President Barack Obama endorsed the concept during the 2008 presidential campaign  It still hasn t happened The explanation is sad but not surprising  The most vocal opponent of simplicity is Intuit  the maker of TurboTax  which has spent millions of dollars lobbying against efforts to reduce demand for its services  The company draws support from conservatives worried that making it easier to file taxes would make it easier to raise taxes Since the early 2000s  the government has required Intuit and its competitors to offer free tax filing software to the 70 percent of taxpayers with the lowest incomes  The legislation requires the I R S  to continue the Free File program rather than developing its own  Senator Ron Wyden  the Oregon Democrat who is co sponsoring the Senate version of the bill  said on Wednesday that the I R S  would retain the authority to end the Free File program  But a number of independent experts  including the National Consumer Law Center  said the bill removed that exit ramp But only about 3 percent of taxpayers use the programs Intuit and its allies  including proponents of the legislation  say that it s cheaper and better for the government to let private companies run the system  But companies have little incentive to advertise the availability of free filing or to make the system easy to use  Indeed  they have every reason to steer people away from the free products  That is how they make money As a result  the government is saving taxpayer money at the expense of those taxpayers There is evidence that automatic payment systems can make it easier to raise prices  A 2009 study found agencies raised toll rates after the adoption of E ZPass  perhaps because drivers were less likely to object if they were unaware of the increases  But an automatic filing system also might help taxpayers to save money  For example  almost a quarter of eligible households don t claim the earned income tax credit Members of Congress pay lip service to ideas like filing taxes on a postcard  but they continue to perpetuate the current system of mass April immiseration by preventing the most obvious and effective way to simplify tax collection Americans with complicated finances are stuck with the misery of the current tax system  That s no reason to force most Americans to join them Would You Let the I R S  Prepare Your Taxes April 15  2015Industries Turn Freedom of Information Requests on Their CriticsNov  5  2018The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

JERUSALEM   When will the  deal of the century   as President Trump has called his forthcoming plan for Israeli Palestinian peace  finally be unveiled Certainly not before April 9  when Israel holds its next election  But how soon after   In less than 20 years   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo noncommittally told a congressional committee recently In any case  American peace plans are nothing new  Does anyone recall  for instance  the Rogers Plans  named after Secretary of State William P  Rogers  who served under President Richard Nixon 50 years ago  When the second of his plans was discussed in the Knesset in 1970  one Israeli legislator confidently projected that  it won t be long   a year  a year and a half  two at most   before the thing called  the held territories  is no more  and the Israel Defense Force pulls back into Israel s borders  Needless to say  that  thing  is far from being  no more   While the Rogers Plans have since all but disappeared from memory  erased by a string of plans put forward by successive American presidents  reality in the occupied Palestinian territories didn t simply halt  Israel s occupation has deepened and evolved  Gaza has become the world s largest open air prison  bombed into submission every few years  East Jerusalem was formally annexed by Israel  the West Bank has become an archipelago of Palestinian Bantustans  surrounded by settlements  walls and checkpoints  subject to a mix of state and settler violence  Yet Israel s real feat has not only been achieving all of this but doing so with impunity  triggering minimal consequences from the rest of the world  all the while somehow holding on to its valuable public relations label as a  vibrant democracy  The history of these past 50 years is what we should recognize as the real deal  the one that is already in effect  the deal of the half century  In this deal  as long as Israel advances its occupation enterprise while applying a measure of brutality just below the level that would prompt international outrage  it is allowed to carry on  while still enjoying various international perks justified by grand  but obviously hollow  commitments to   as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently put it   the  shared values of liberty and democracy  ImageElectoral campaign posters bearing the portraits of Israel s prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  left

CreditJack Guez Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesWhich brings us to April 9  when Israelis will cast their votes for a Parliament that rules both Israeli citizens and millions of Palestinian subjects denied that same right  Israeli settlers in the West Bank don t even need to drive to a polling station inside Israel to vote on their Palestinian neighbors  fate  Even settlers in the heart of Hebron can vote right there  with 285 registered voters  out of a total population of about 1 000 settlers   surrounded by some 200 000 Palestinian nonvoters  Or as Israel calls it   democracy

since the occupation began  and perhaps the one in which Palestinian lives are least discussed   except when tallying up their deaths and celebrating their destruction  Earlier this year  Gen  Benny Gantz  now leader of the new  centrist  party that poses the strongest challenge to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  published a video highlighting how many Palestinian  terrorists  were killed in Gaza in the summer of 2014  when Mr  Gantz was the Army s chief of staff   According to research carried out by the Israeli nonprofit B Tselem  most of those killed by the Israeli army that summer were civilians  among them more than 500 children   For his part  Mr  Netanyahu has promised that if he remains in office the occupation will continue   I will not divide Jerusalem  I will not evacuate any community and I will make sure we control the territory west of Jordan   he said in an interview over the weekend Instead of the rights and freedom of Palestinians  the campaign season has focused on Mr  Netanyahu s likely indictment on corruption charges  But does it really matter to the Palestinian family whose son will be killed with impunity or whose home will be bulldozed if the prime minister responsible for these policies is corrupt or squeaky clean At some point after April 9  we may finally get to see what  deal  the Trump administration has in mind  In fact  one cannot help wondering if it isn t already taking shape before our very eyes  Last May  the Trump administration moved the United States  embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  a few months later  it cut off aid to Palestinians and the United Nations agency serving Palestinian refugees  most recently  it extended recognition of Israel s sovereignty in the Golan Heights  a move celebrated by one Israeli official as a sign of things to come with regards to the future of the West Bank It s hard to see how the  deal of the century  will be anything other than an extension of the deal of the half century  David M  Friedman  the Trump administration s ambassador to Israel  more or less admitted this in an interview with The Washington Examiner  when he said that the administration would  like to see Palestinian autonomy improve significantly  as long as it doesn t come at the risk of Israeli security   But Palestinians deserve full freedom  not an American marketed improved autonomy  which suggests nothing more than prolonging Israel s occupation  That means a future based on neither justice nor on international law  but on more control  oppression and state violence Unless the international community takes the deal of the half century off the table  making Israel finally choose between further oppression of Palestinians and facing real consequences  the occupation will continue  The Trump administration  clearly  isn t up to this task  But the United Nations  including the Security Council  key member states of the European Union   Israel s largest trading partner   and international public opinion all have ample leverage  And Americans who sincerely believe in human rights and democracy  not just as empty slogans or bargaining chips but as genuine demands  need not wait until 2020 to flex their political power Together with the systemic overtaking of lands and the imposition of restrictions on freedom of movement  the denial of political rights was one of the cornerstones of apartheid South Africa  That country  too  considered itself a democracy Many Israelis will consider April 9 a celebration of democracy  It s not  This Election Day should be nothing more than a painful reminder of a deeply undemocratic reality  one that the Trump administration seems pleased to perpetuate   and which the rest of the international community will continue to allow until it finally stops looking the other way  We  the nearly 14 million human beings living on this land  need a future that is worth fighting for  one based on the common humanity of

GENEVA   The United Nations torture investigator called on Ecuador on Friday not to expel Wikileaks founder Julian Assange from its London embassy  voicing concern that he could be extradited to the United States and possibly face mistreatment A British friend said Assange was  prepared  for expulsion from the building he has lived in for nearly seven years  after Ecuador s President Lenin Moreno said he had  repeatedly violated  the terms of his asylum Moreno told radio stations on Tuesday that Assange did not have the right to  hack private accounts or phones  and could not intervene in the politics of other countries  especially those with friendly relations with Ecuador Moreno made the comments after private photographs of him and his family were circulated on social media  Although Moreno stopped short of explicitly blaming Assange for the leak  the government said it believed the photos were shared by WikiLeaks Nils Melzer  U N  special rapporteur on torture  voiced concern that Assange s health was in  serious decline  and that  if he were expelled  he was likely to be arrested by British authorities and extradited to the United States  Such a response could expose him to a real risk of serious violations of his human rights  including his freedom of expression  his right to a fair trial and the prohibition of cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment   he said   I therefore urge the Government of Ecuador to abstain from    ceasing or suspending his political asylum until such time as the full protection of his human rights can be guaranteed   Vaughan Smith  who hosted Assange at his country mansion for a year during his failed legal battle against extradition  said after visiting the Australian inside the embassy that the situation was  very tense    Julian doesn t know for sure but he s pretty convinced that at any moment he could be thrown out and he s prepared for it   Smith told reporters  INVESTIGATIONSAssange took refuge in Ecuador s London embassy in 2012 to avoid being extradited to Sweden  where authorities wanted to question him as part of a sexual assault investigation That investigation was later dropped  but Assange fears he could be extradited to face charges in the United States  where federal prosecutors are investigating WikiLeaks  In a separate statement also issued in Geneva on Friday  the U N  special rapporteur on the right to privacy  Joe Cannataci  said that he planned to meet Assange on April 25  after receiving assurances from the Government of Ecuador that it will facilitate his visit to the country s embassy in London  Cannataci said the meeting would help determine  if there exists a prima facie case of violation of privacy that warrants further investigation  He was requesting further information from the Ecuadorean government on a complaint lodged by Moreno that his privacy had been violated by publication of illegally obtained personal data   Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay  additional reporting by Helena Williams in London  Editing by Andrew Heavens and John Stonestreet  

SHANGHAI TOKYO   Not for the first time  China s markets are marching to their own beat Just as investors come to terms with a bleak outlook for global growth and earnings  with weak German industrial and trade data just the latest portents of gloom  China s economy may be bottoming out  helped by Beijing s early moves to prop up a stuttering economy At the same time  Chinese regulators  drive to open up financial markets to foreign involvement is making the country more accessible  and a potentially rich target for foreign investors looking to diversify  The more you see stabilisation of the Chinese growth story   and I think you ll see that coming through in the middle of the year   the more comfortable you ll be with looking at the debt and equity side of things in China   said Kerry Craig  Global Market Strategist at J P  Morgan Asset Management in Melbourne To be fair  global markets are having a good year  Index provider MSCI s broadest gauge of global shares is up more than 13 percent since January  erasing last year s losses even against the backdrop of the U S  China trade war and Brexit But dovish shifts by the U S  Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have in recent weeks sparked market jitters  pushing down bond yields and jolting equity indexes China s markets have been comparatively unfazed  The blue chip CSI300 index has risen more than a third so far this year  making it the world s best performing major index Yields on benchmark 10 year Chinese government bonds have also jumped in recent days alongside rallying shares as investors  appetite for the safest investments has ebbed Faced with a slowing economy due in part to a multi year campaign to reduce risky leverage and to headwinds from the trade war  Beijing began easing policy selectively last year  channelling more money into the real economy to boost growth Tax cuts  infrastructure spending and pledges to boost lending and lower borrowing costs have helped revive stagnant credit growth  brightening the outlook for corporate earnings  With easing policies starting to have an impact on credit creation  credit growth should continue to pick up this year   Chen Long  China economist at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing  said in a note  It s clear that China s economy slowed further in the first quarter of 2019  but there s an increasingly strong consensus that growth will bottom out and improve later in the year  Chinese shares have also been bolstered by rising foreign interest Net flows into China s stock market through the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect programmes topped 125 billion yuan   14 3 billion  in the first quarter of 2019  nearly triple the same period a year earlier  data from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd showed In February  the Institute for International Finance said foreign investors put more than  10 billion into Chinese onshore equities ahead of an announced rise in the weighting of A shares in MSCI s benchmark indexes BOND BOOSTGlobal index changes have extended beyond equities On April 1  index provider Bloomberg Barclays began a 20 month process of including some Chinese government and policy bank bonds in its Global Aggregate index  a move expected to draw billions of foreign dollars into China s  13 trillion bond market While initial flows tracking the index will be gradual   at some point in time there will be an inflection point   said Dhiraj Bajaj  fixed income portfolio manager at Lombard Odier in Singapore For active investors  Chinese bonds provide advantages to a diversified portfolio  including lower average durations and significant yield premiums Frances Cheung  head of macro strategy for Asia at Westpac  said the yuan s relative stability could burnish the appeal of yuan denominated assets to some investors  The RMB is less sensitive to risk sentiment than some of its regional peers including the IDR  KRW and MYR  The correlation between USD CNY and Chinese government bonds is also low  These features render CNY bonds a good avenue for portfolio diversification  especially when initial exposure is low for many investors   she said Data from Bond Connect  which gives foreign investors access to China s interbank market  shows trading volumes through the scheme jumped 70 percent  and the number of registered Bond Connect investors rose 41 percent  in the first quarter of 2019 Bond Connect says index inclusion has shifted the focus of trading towards government and policy bank bonds  which accounted for 66 percent of turnover in March  up from 37 percent in December But following a year long rally that pushed yields on 10 year Chinese government bonds down nearly a full percentage point from highs in late January 2018  some investors may be seeing less room for profit  said Bajaj A lack of familiarity with Chinese bonds may also deter some foreign investors  while technical issues such as limited hedging tools and patchy trading of newly issued government bonds remain nagging concerns  I imagine a lot of investors in similar positions like myself have just kind of a lack of experience of the market that probably limits its global safe haven flow   said Ross Hutchison  a global bond fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh   But that doesn t mean that won t change  Craig at J P  Morgan said foreign investors should approach Chinese bonds with care   We do know that the Chinese government has a large amount of debt  We have to think about the quality of what s backing up those bonds   he said But if investors are comfortable with China s ability to contain debt  those concerns should ease  Craig added  We talk about the U S  market being a safe haven  but U S  debt is going to go up if they continue to spend at this rate   he said   Reporting by Daniel Leussink and Andrew Galbraith  Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in SINGAPORE  Editing by Lincoln Feast

JERUSALEM   Israelis vote in an election on Tuesday that could hand conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a record fifth term or see him dethroned by an ex general who has pledged clean government and social cohesion  Dubbed  King Bibi  by both Time and Economist magazines  Netanyahu has rallied a rightist camp hardened against the Palestinians and played up Israeli foreign policy boons that are the fruit of his ties with the Trump administration But the 69 year old Likud party leader s hope of overtaking Israel s founding father  David Ben Gurion  as longest serving premier in July has been dented by a looming graft indictment  He denies any wrongdoing Critics warn of  Bibi fatigue  and argue that the parliamentary election should bring fresh faces to high office Stalking Netanyahu in the opinion polls has been Benny Gantz  a former chief of the armed forces and centrist political novice  Buttressed by two other former generals at the top of his Blue and White party  Gantz  59  has sought to push back against Netanyahu s self styled image as unrivalled in national security  This is a choice between a strong right wing government under Netanyahu or a weak leftist government under Gantz   Likud said in a statement  Gantz told Reuters in response   Netanyahu is not the messiah  nor an irreplaceable legend  The people of Israel long for something else  With little policy daylight separating the two candidates on Iran and the Palestinians  or on Israel s humming economy  much of the voting will by guided by the question of their character In vitriolic campaigns waged largely over social media rather than in town squares or street corners  they have exchanged escalating allegations of corruption  of fostering bigotry and even of conspiring with Israel s adversaries  Netanyahu casts himself as the victim of media bias and judicial overreach  Gantz casts himself as a salve for Israel s religiously and ethnically riven society and its relations with liberal Jews abroad  This election is about one thing   whether or not Netanyahu should remain in office  It s the only thing that really defines 12 out of the 13 parties which will be in the next Knesset   said Anshel Pfeffer  author of the biography  Bibi  The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu  Which man wins is unlikely to be decided when the polling stations close at 10 p m   1900 GMT   No party has ever won an outright majority in the 120 seat parliament  meaning days or even weeks of coalition negotiations will lie ahead Israel s president  Reuven Rivlin  will consult with the leaders of every party represented in the Knesset and choose whoever he believes has the best chance of forming a government Although both Netanyahu and Gantz have publicly ruled out a future alliance in a  national unity  coalition  some analysts predict a rethink   especially if the candidates agree to tackle together a widely expected U S  plan for Middle East peace That plan s sponsor  President Donald Trump  offered an unusually clement observation on the election  telling his Republican Jewish supporters on Saturday   I think it s going to be close     Two good people    Writing by Dan Williams  Editing by Alison Williams and Diane Craft  

LONDON   A senior Brexiteer in Prime Minister Theresa May s government said on Tuesday that she hoped German leader Angela Merkel would agree to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement to get a Brexit divorce deal passed by the British parliament  May will meet Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday to argue for a Brexit delay while her ministers hold crisis talks with the opposition to try to break the deadlock in London  What I think would be fantastic if Angela Merkel will try to support a proper UK Brexit by agreeing to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement   said the leader of House of Commons  Andrea Leadsom   There have been rumors over the weekend that some senior members of the German government would be willing to do that in order to get Theresa May s deal across the line   If we could get the prime minister s deal over the line because the EU have decided to support measures on the backstop then that would be the best possible outcome   she said   Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Costas Pitas  

HONG KONG   China is planning new steps that could put a stop to making Bitcoin there  a move that could cut off one of the world s largest sources of the popular but unstable cryptocurrency The National Development and Reform Commission  China s top economic planning body  this week added cryptocurrency mining to a list of about 450 industries that it proposes to eliminate  If the move is approved  local governments in China will be prohibited from supporting makers of Bitcoin and other digital currencies through subsidies or other benefits The commission said it would seek public comment until May 7 before making a final decision China was once the world s largest Bitcoin maker  though rising government pressure has forced many of those who make the cryptocurrency  known as miners  to other countries  Still  a number of Bitcoin miners could remain  especially if local governments ignored the instructions and found a way to prop up local producers  people in the business say  It is categorized as an industry that is not encouraged or allowed to expand  but it is not a ban   said Zhao Qianjie  a former executive at BTCChina  which was China s first cryptocurrency exchange Instead  he said  some producers may learn to live without subsidies and benefits like discounted electricity   The change will be the mining cost will rise   said Mr  Zhao  who still owns a Bitcoin mine in China s northern region of Inner Mongolia Bitcoin miners use computers to crunch the mathematical formulas that create the basis for the currency  The business can be quite profitable  especially when Bitcoin prices are soaring  but the process requires amounts of electricity  Prices of the currency move up and down considerably and are currently above  5 000  according to Blockchain  a cryptocurrency firm China initially embraced Bitcoin and saw local miners as the potential basis for a new industry focused on digital currencies  China also has plenty of power  thanks to its extensively built out electricity system and the closing of a growing number of heavy industry factories as the economy matures  At one point  China accounted for roughly two thirds of all Bitcoin produced But China keeps a tight grip over how much money flows in and out of its borders  and cryptocurrencies   which are traded on decentralized computer networks and allow people to make transactions anonymously   threatened to undermine those capital controls Cryptocurrencies can also be used to circumvent laws to buy illegal goods  and Chinese officials were also spooked by the possibility that the wildly fluctuating prices could leave investors with big losses and lead to civil unrest The Chinese authorities began to ratchet up pressure on Bitcoin miners  In 2017  China ordered cryptocurrency exchanges to close  It has also banned initial coin offerings  a method by which start ups or online projects can raise funds by issuing cryptocurrency  Many miners began to hide or flee to places with friendlier laws or abundant electricity  including the United States  All the policies have created fear   said Chandler Guo  who owned Bitcoin mines in China but moved to Silicon Valley in 2016   Many have moved abroad  Still  China remains a significant force in the Bitcoin world  Based on different estimates  between 40 percent and 70 percent of the world s mining power is still in China The National Development and Reform Commission s proposal is the first time a central government body has announced a restrictive policy on Bitcoin mining  and it could make it difficult for miners to get loans to expand  said Wang Huiyao  president of the Center for China and Globalization  a research organization in Beijing  Local governments won t act against it  so it will be more difficult for them to be approved or receive loans   Mr  Wang said Miners said that while the crackdown on cryptocurrency had driven some miners abroad  the total cost of mining was still lower in China  where most of the mining machines are produced Yu Wei  a former executive with Bitmain  which makes products for mining cryptocurrencies  said the move could benefit the industry in the long run  That means more miners will move abroad   said Mr  Yu  who owns mines in Xinjiang and Yunnan Province in China  as well as in Central Asia   That will be good for decentralization of cryptocurrency   

WASHINGTON   The House will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump s declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border  Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday  the latest in a series of efforts to stop Mr  Trump from securing money that Congress refused to give him for his promised wall  The president s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds  an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority   Ms  Pelosi said in a statement  The House will once again defend our democracy and our Constitution  this time in the courts   she added   No one is above the law or the Constitution  not even the president  The Trump administration has argued that Mr  Trump s moves to spend more taxpayer dollars on border barriers than Congress had agreed to give him are lawful because he is invoking statutes that granted the president the power to move money around under urgent circumstances  Those statutes placed few limits on a president s authority to determine that such situations exist Mr  Trump and his defenders have also noted that presidents have declared national emergencies nearly 60 times since Congress passed the National Emergencies Act in 1976  although critics point out that in no previous such instance did a president invoke extraordinary powers as an end run around lawmakers after failing to win legislative approval for a proposal The lawsuit was authorized by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group  which consists of the top leaders of both parties in the House  Ms  Pelosi  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the majority leader  Representative James E  Clyburn of South Carolina  the majority whip  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader  and Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana  the minority whip The group met briefly on Thursday and voted along party lines to authorize the lawsuit  It is unclear when it will be filed Legal action has been an option for House lawmakers since Mr  Trump declared a national emergency at the southwestern border in February to activate the power to redirect military construction funds  effectively trying to go around Congress s refusal to fund a border wall at the level he had demanded  Both chambers passed legislation that would have ended the national emergency  but Mr  Trump vetoed the bill   the first veto of his presidency   and the House could not muster enough votes to override it On Thursday  a Pentagon spokesman said that final decisions about what military construction projects would have their funds repurposed for his declaration have not yet been made The House will be joining several other lawsuits already filed  Plaintiffs in another suit challenging Mr  Trump s border barrier plans sought on Thursday to expedite obtaining a judicial order to block the government from taking further steps toward building new border barriers   even as administration officials raced to spend what money they had as quickly as they could The plaintiffs   the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition  which are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union   filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would bar the administration from building new barriers near Yuma  Ariz   and El Paso until the litigation can be resolved on the merits  Last month  the Trump administration had identified those sectors as locations for new or replacement barrier projects  while redirecting  1 billion in excess military pay and pension funds for that purpose That part of Mr  Trump s plans relies not on his high profile invocation of emergency powers  but on another component that has received less attention  using the Pentagon s separate authority to redirect some of its annual budget in order to beef up its counternarcotics programs  which in turn can be tapped for blocking smuggling along the border  Because that money must be spent before the fiscal year ends on Sept  30  the administration is trying to move quickly to issue contracts But the A C L U  says that its clients are likely to prevail in their argument that it is unlawful for Mr  Trump to use such tactics to spend more on border barriers than Congress appropriated  Its motion maintains that freezing any further steps toward construction before a final ruling   even as the clock continues to tick toward the end of September   would be justified because any such construction would  among other things   disrupt these ecosystems and cause irreversible damage  That case is pending before a Federal District Court judge in Oakland  Calif   Haywood S  Gilliam Jr   who was appointed in 2014 by President Barack Obama  The plaintiffs have asked him to hold a hearing on the request on May 9  

LONDON   The United States wants foreign governments to follow Germany in adopting stricter security standards for next generation 5G telecoms networks  a U S  cybersecurity official said on Wednesday  adding that doing so would effectively rule out the use of Chinese equipment vendors Germany last month set tougher criteria for vendors supplying network equipment  stopping short of singling out China s Huawei Technologies for special treatment and instead saying the same rules should apply to all vendors The German decision was seen as a blow to Washington  which has led efforts to get Western governments to ban market leader Huawei due to concerns its equipment could be used to support Chinese state spying  Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations But Robert Strayer  deputy assistant secretary for cyber  international communications and information policy at the U S  State Department  said Washington approved of the German move   We have encouraged countries to adopt risk based security frameworks   he said  speaking on a call with reporters on Wednesday  And we think that a rigorous application of those frameworks     will lead inevitably to the banning of Huawei   At this point we re looking for governments to adopt security standards like we re seeing in Germany  We think it was a very positive step forward in the German standards   The German rules stated that critical equipment should only be used after scrutiny and certification overseen by Germany s BSI federal cybersecurity watchdog  and that  core components may only be procured from trustworthy vendors and manufacturers   German telecoms operators have opposed a ban on Huawei  saying that doing so would delay the rollout of 5G networks by years  and Berlin has pushed to assert its independence in the face of warnings by the United States that it will be unable to share intelligence with allies that use the company s equipment Strayer said the U S concerns went beyond intelligence sharing but that a policy decision had not yet been made  We also have so much more cooperation beyond intelligence   he said  So it will  no doubt  if there are untrusted vendors in another country s network  harm our ability to cooperate in a number of aspects    Reporting by Jack Stubbs and Cassell Bryan Low  Editing by David Evans Keith Weir

JERUSALEM   Israelis vote in a national election on Tuesday  Polls show that veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  seeking a fifth term in office  is best positioned in the tight race to win and head the next government  His decade long dominance of Israeli politics has been the biggest issue of the campaign  WHAT ARE THE POLLS SHOWING Recent polls have shown that the right wing bloc led by Netanyahu will win a majority in the Knesset  But they also show a new centrist party headed by a popular former general emerging as the largest faction in parliament  Surveys detect many undecided voters who could swing the election either way HOW DOES THE ISRAELI ELECTION WORK The 120 Knesset seats are allocated by proportional representation to party lists  In order to win seats in the

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William P  Barr has directed parts of the Justice Department to investigate accusations of discrimination  including claims that the F B I  academy weeded out potential agents for not being  masculine enough  and that it has become harder for transgender people to work at the Bureau of Prisons Mr  Barr s request came in response to a letter that he received last week from DOJ Pride  a Justice Department group founded in 1994 to advocate the interests of lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender employees  Less than half of the group s members said they believed that the Justice Department does not discriminate against them  the letter said  adding that the finding and others from a survey undertaken in October show that members have become more alienated from the department under the Trump administration  Given the crucial role the department fulfills in our society   enforcing the nation s laws and administering justice   we are concerned that so many employees who dedicate themselves to the department do not think the department values them   members of DOJ Pride wrote In response  Mr  Barr vowed that the Justice Department would not discriminate against workers based on sex  sexual orientation or gender identity  as well as a long list of other  non merit based  factors  Employment decisions at the department must be made solely on merit and free from discrimination   he wrote in a letter on Thursday addressed to the group and distributed to the more than 115 000 employees of the Justice Department   Every employee should know that I stand by the principle  The exchange shows how Mr  Barr is working to raise morale after many Justice Department employees described a drop over the past two years  particularly among gay  lesbian and transgender employees The F B I  said in a statement that it needs people  from all different backgrounds  experiences and perspectives  to effectively do its job protecting Americans and that it does not tolerate discriminatory behavior  The Bureau of Prisons did not respond to a request for comment Mr  Barr  who was sworn in as attorney general in February  is settling in to a Justice Department that underwent a drastic shift under his predecessor  Jeff Sessions  who moved away from the civil rights centered agenda of the Obama era to one that reflected his ultraconservative stance on immigration  civil rights and social issues As Mr  Sessions refocused the department s civil rights work onto protections for people of faith  police officers and local government officials  critics warned that those moves effectively curbed the rights of gay  lesbian and transgender people  as well as of minorities who faced discrimination from the police Mr  Sessions also pushed back on departmental efforts to extend civil rights protections to transgender people  He ordered prisons to house transgender women with men  a move that many human rights experts said put the transgender women at risk of assault  and defended President Trump s ban on transgender soldiers in the military  In October  the department sided with a funeral home that had fired a transgender woman  arguing that the definition of sex in the Civil Rights Act was biological and  does not apply to discrimination against an individual based on his or her gender identity  And while the heads of all federal agencies are required by law to issue an Equal Employment Opportunity statement saying that they are committed to providing equal employment under the law and a workplace free of discrimination  Mr  Sessions never did Mr  Sessions s policy positions reverberated inside the department as well  The survey of DOJ Pride members from October  a month before Mr  Trump forced out Mr  Sessions  found that less than a third of respondents believed that the department  values its L G B T Q  employees   and only 43 percent believed that it  does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression  The survey also found that gay  lesbian and transgender employees believed that the department had recently become less welcoming to employees who were not heterosexual  One respondent said that the treatment was grounds for quitting Some members of DOJ Pride were upset when Guy Benson  a Fox News contributor  was chosen to speak at last year s annual gay pride celebration  Some members attended a separate awards ceremony  where one person said that the group would not return to the shadows  according to video of the proceedings obtained by The New York Times In a letter to Mr  Barr last week  the leaders of the group noted that Mr  Sessions had never issued the Equal Employment Opportunity affirmation and said that they believed that it was especially important for Mr  Barr to do so in light of the department s recent decisions not to extend civil rights protections to transgender people Mr  Barr issued that statement on Thursday The attorney general has yet to lay out an agenda on gay rights  During his confirmation hearing  he said that he would support a law that would ban antigay discrimination  but he noted that he does not believe that current sex discrimination laws apply to gay  lesbian and transgender people But in his letter this week  Mr  Barr wrote that the department would act swiftly when employees are found to have discriminated  

LONDON   Pro Brexit lawmakers in Britain s upper house of parliament tried on Thursday to thwart the approval of a new law that would force Prime Minister Theresa May to seek a delay to prevent a disorderly EU exit on April 12 without a deal May has already committed to seek a short extension to Britain s European Union membership and work with the opposition Labour Party to come up with a different exit plan  in a last ditch attempt to keep control after her own Brexit deal was rejected three times by the lower House of parliament But lawmakers have used an unprecedented procedural gambit to pass legislation without the approval of government  seeking additional legal guarantees that May will not give up and lead Britain out of the bloc without a deal The bill passed through the lower chamber  the House of Commons  by a single vote late on Wednesday and is now in the House of Lords  an unelected body whose role is to refine and scrutinize legislation before it is approved The process of passing the bill through the Lords got off to a rocky start on Thursday when some members of the debating chamber   also known as peers   launched a series of attempts to delay or even halt the process  All that lies between us and tyranny is that we respect the conventions of both Houses   said Michael Forsyth  a pro Brexit Conservative member of the Lords  accusing Labour Party spokeswoman Dianne Hayter of setting a dangerous precedent to try and block Brexit  CONSTITUTION IN DANGER By long standing convention  the government usually has sole control of the agenda in parliament but this was overturned last month with the help of a rebellion in May s Conservative Party  She is in danger of tearing up our constitution in order to make a narrow party political point   Forsyth said Thursday s debate began with long speeches on the correct procedure for the legislation and a series of votes  all of which ended in heavy defeat for the filibusterers but ate up time  What we are seeing today     is a small group of unelected peers in an unelected house  firstly trying to stop us considering the bill today and then trying to talk it out and no doubt seeking to go through the night to halt the Commons  desire to prevent a no deal   Hayter said  The stalling tactic proved partially successful  Plans to complete all stages of the process in a single day had to be abandoned  but a source close to negotiations on the timetable for the bill said they expected it to be finalised on Monday The government does not have a majority in the Lords  and the body is seen as largely pro EU  It is expected to vote in favor of the bill  hence its opponents  decision to use procedural means to block it  The law is being rushed through a legislative process which usually takes months  to try and make sure it comes into effect before May attends a summit of EU leaders on April 10  If successful  it would require May to get parliament s approval for the detail of any delay and allows lawmakers to propose a different length of extension  The government has argued that it is an unnecessary measure which could have unintended consequences  Under the revised timetable  the legislation could complete its final stages late on Monday  which would then require May to come to parliament on Tuesday and set out for what length of delay she is planning to ask the EU   Reporting by William James and Kylie MacLellan  Editing by Stephen Addison and John Stonestreet  

BANGKOK   Ly Tong  a South Vietnamese Air Force veteran who dropped anti Communist leaflets over Vietnam from hijacked planes long after the war s end  playing out the fantasies of many defeated soldiers of the south  died on Saturday in San Diego  He was 74 The cause was lung disease  his family said A man who never accepted defeat  Mr  Tong considered it his personal mission to take back his country from the Communists  who have ruled it since winning the Vietnam War in 1975  I have the duty to liberate my country   he said in an interview more than 30 years later   You cannot enjoy yourself when your whole country is in pain  in torture  Mr  Tong became a hero to many Vietnamese refugees in 1992  when he hijacked a commercial airliner after takeoff from Bangkok  ordered the pilot to fly low over Ho Chi Minh City   known as Saigon  South Vietnam s capital  before the Communist victory   and dumped thousands of leaflets calling for a popular uprising He then strapped on a parachute and followed the leaflets down to certain capture  He was released six years later in an amnesty and returned to the United States  where he had become a citizen after the war In 2000  under the guise of taking flying lessons in Thailand  Mr  Tong made a second trip over Ho Chi Minh City  sending down a new cascade of leaflets  which he had signed  Global Alliance for the Total Uprising Against Communists  He was arrested on his return to Thailand and spent six years in prison for hijacking  He was not armed  and no one was hurt on either of his flights  The only thing that matters is the Communists still control my country   he shouted through a double screen of wire mesh during an interview at Bangkok s central jail   I m a pilot  This is what I can do  He timed his second flight to coincide with President Bill Clinton s  visit to Vietnam  the first by an American president since the end of the war  Soon after Mr  Tong scattered his leaflets  Mr  Clinton was in Hanoi  the capital  where he delivered a very different message   The history we leave behind is painful and hard  We must not forget it  but we must not be controlled by it  As the years passed and a new generation of Vietnamese Americans accepted the unsentimental facts of history  the veterans  fantasies of liberation became relics of that distant war But at the end of his life  it became clear that the legend of Mr  Tong   who proved time and again his loyalty to a country that no longer existed   still compelled devotion As word spread that his health was failing  visitors converged on his hospital room in San Diego   as many as 200 people on one recent weekend ImageMr  Ly Tong in 2006 in Bangkok  where he spent years in prison for hijacking  His postwar feats made him a hero to many of the defeated soldiers of South Vietnam CreditSakchai Lalit Associated PressHis most devoted followers were former soldiers like himself  liberated from years in Communist labor camps under an agreement with the United States and arriving by the tens of thousands in the 1990s  the last and saddest wave of refugees  They have come prepared to show the courage of the former soldiers of South Vietnam  but they are showing themselves only as a group of misfit people   Yen Ngoc Do  who was then the editor of the Vietnamese language newspaper Nguoi Viet  said in an interview   Their political and military past has been totally forgotten  Broken in health and spirit  too old or tired to start over again  many of the veterans lapsed into listlessness and despair  I survived the war  I survived prison   one of them  Phan Nhat Nam  a former paratrooper and wartime journalist  said in a 1995 interview in the Little Saigon area of Orange County  Calif  Now I must survive my freedom  and it is very hard   he said   We are old men now  We have lost the ability to adapt and renew  For people like these  Mr  Tong offered an alternate reality   a vision of courage and action  a tragic hero in the tradition of Vietnamese history Ly Tong was born Le Van Tong on Sept  1  1945  in the central Vietnamese city of Hue  according to his family   Other accounts have said that he was born in 1948   He was the son of a well to do farmer who was executed as a revolutionary Mr  Tong joined the South Vietnamese Air Force and served in its elite Black Eagle fighter squadron  As the war neared its end  he was shot down and sent to a re education camp His postwar story began in 1980  with his escape and a 17 month trek to freedom through five countries  He picked his way through minefields  he said  broke out of jails  dodged security patrols and crawled through jungle to avoid border posts He was accepted as a refugee in the United States  where he worked as a security guard and earned a degree in political science from the University of New Orleans  He published a 300 page autobiography   Black Eagle   which made him a celebrity among overseas Vietnamese In early 2000  years after his first flight over Ho Chi Minh City  Mr  Tong burnished his anti Communist credentials with a flight over Havana in a rented plane  scattering leaflets as he had in Vietnam  He was commended on his return by Cuban Americans in Florida  who gave him a victory parade  His second foray into Vietnam came later that year In his final and most bizarre act of defiance  in 2010 in California  Mr  Tong assaulted a Vietnamese singer whom he deemed sympathetic to the government of Vietnam  Disguised as a woman  he walked to the edge of the stage  reached up as if to hand the singer a bouquet and squirted a liquid  which may have been pepper spray  in her face  He was sentenced on multiple charges to six months in jail and three years  probation  He appeared at his trial in drag Mr  Tong lived out his final years quietly in San Diego  He is survived by a half brother  a half sister  three daughters and several nieces and nephews  

CAIRO   Tens of thousands of protesters joined in anti government marches across Sudan on Saturday in what organizers said was one of the largest turnouts in more than three months of demonstrations calling for embattled President Omar al Bashir to step down The demonstrations began in December over price increases and food shortages  and quickly escalated into calls for Mr  al Bashir s resignation  posing one of the biggest challenges yet to his nearly 30 year rule The rallies are being led by the Sudanese Professionals Association  an umbrella group of independent professional unions Footage posted online showed thousands of protesters  mostly young people  marching toward the military s headquarters in the capital  Khartoum  demanding the army s support and chanting   One people  one military   and  Freedom  They also chanted   The people want the fall of the regime   echoing the popular slogan of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that briefly defied despotism in the region  but never made it to Sudan Sarah Abdel Jaleel  a spokeswoman for the organizers  said protesters have started a sit in around the military s headquarters  which they hope to keep in place until Mr  al Bashir resigns  In some videos  troops were seen using tear gas to disperse demonstrators Rallies took place across the country  Footage showed dozens of people marching in front of a United Nations refugee camp in Darfur and shouting   just fall  The large opposition Umma Party said security forces arrested four of its leaders ahead of planned marches in the province of Sennar  around 225 miles east of Khartoum Authorities did not issue any statements on the arrests  and a government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment Saturday s marches marked the 34th anniversary of the overthrow of President al Nimeiri in a bloodless coup The military removed Mr  Nimeiri after a popular uprising and handed power to an elected government  But the dysfunctional administration lasted only a few years until Mr  al Bashir allied with Islamist hard liners and toppled it in a coup in 1989 Mr  Al Bashir has banned unauthorized public gatherings and granted sweeping powers to the police since imposing a state of emergency last month Security forces have responded to the protest movement with a fierce crackdown  killing at least 60 people according to Physicians for Human Rights  a New York based rights group  

By Elaine LiesAKITA  Japan   Taeko Watanabe awoke one cold March night and found a trail of blood in the hallway  a bloody cleaver on her son Yuki s bed and no trace of him in the house  Then police discovered a suicide note in his bedroom  They found him in a canal by the temple and wrapped him in a blanket  After an autopsy  he came home in a coffin  I fell apart   she recalled  eyes welling up as she sat by a photo of Yuki and a Buddhist altar laden with flowers and Fuji apples  Yuki  who was 29 when he died in 2008  was one of many who committed suicide that year in Akita prefecture  450 km north of Tokyo  For nearly two decades  Akita had the highest suicide rate in all of Japan  which itself has the highest rate in the Group of Seven But things have changed  Watanabe said  If her son faced the same situation now   he would never have died  There are people who can prevent it  Watanabe  who contemplated suicide herself after Yuki s death  now leads a suicide survivors group  part of national efforts that have brought Japanese suicides down by nearly 40 percent in 15 years  exceeding the government target  Akita s are at their lowest in 40 years These efforts took off nationally in 2007 with a comprehensive suicide prevention plan  as academics and government agencies identified at risk groups  In 2016  regions got more freedom to develop plans that fit local thinking Corporations  prompted by lawsuits from families of those who took their lives because of overwork  have made it easier to take leave  more offer psychological support  and a law caps overtime  The government mandates annual stress tests in companies with over 50 employees Suicide has a long history in Japan as a way to avoid shame or dishonour  and getting psychological help was stigmatised But when suicides hit a peak of 34 427 in 2003  it alarmed policymakers and drew foreign attention  often a catalyst for change in Japan  For a long time  thinking was that suicide was a personal problem and so the government didn t really deal with it   not just Akita  but the whole country   said Hiroki Koseki  an Akita civil servant in charge of suicide prevention POOR  ELDERLY  ALONESuicides have multiple causes  but experts say Akita has so many because of its remoteness  lack of jobs  long winters  a large number of isolated and lonely elderly  and accumulating debt In 1999  Akita s governor became the first in Japan to budget for suicide prevention  Amid positive media coverage  citizen and volunteer suicide prevention groups sprung up  Akita  with a population of just 981 000  now has one of the largest citizen help networks in Japan  Because it was a personal problem  even governments said tax money shouldn t be used  That paradigm shift occurred in Akita  the rest of Japan followed   said Yutaka Motohashi  director of the Japan Support Centre for Suicide Countermeasures  who worked in Akita in the 1990s identifying at risk groups Akita began depression screening  and public health workers checked in on at risk people  There was also enthusiastic participation by volunteers such as Hisao Sato  who fought depression for years after his business failed in 2000  During that time one of my friends threw himself off a bridge and others had companies fail   added Sato  75  whose own father probably committed suicide    I was angry  I wanted them not to be forced to choose suicide  To help  in 2002 he created  Kumonoito   or Spiderweb  a network of lawyers and financial experts offering practical help  About 60 percent of his funding comes from the Akita government  the rest is from donations Japan s parliament is drawing up a law to create a national organization similar to Sato s  A business failure isn t just an economic problem  it s also a human problem   Sato said         GATEKEEPERSAkita also has an ever growing network of  gatekeepers    people trained to identify those contemplating suicide and  if needed  put them in touch with help  Anybody can undergo several hours of training from Akita public health personnel and take part  Basically  everybody is part of community suicide prevention  It s everybody s business   Motohashi said  Japan s national barbers  association has called on its members to get training  though few have so far  But 3 000 people in Akita have been trained since 2017 and the goal is 10 000  or one for each 100 people  by 2022 Akita also has volunteer  listeners    people like 79 year old Ume Ito  who talks to at risk people  many of whom are elderly  for hours at a time  About 70 80 percent of those we deal with say they want to die  but while they talk they stop thinking about suicide and eventually say   I m looking forward to seeing you    she said One of her clients is Sumiko  73  bedridden after a fall  She spends her days alone until her son s family returns at night  I thought I d be stuck in bed the rest of my life  Is this it for me  I thought I d lose my mind   said Sumiko  who declined to give her last name  If she wasn t coming it d be so depressing  I can t tell my family everything in my heart and darkness remains   she added  smiling at Ito   I tell my son  being listened to saved me  Akita s suicide rate has fallen from a high of 44 6 per 100 000 in 2003 to 20 7 in 2018  according to preliminary data   a drastic improvement  but still the sixth highest nationally Japan s suicides have fallen from the 2003 peak to 20 598 while the rate dropped from 27 per 100 000 to 16 3  The government aims to hit 13 per 100 000 by 2027  By contrast  the suicide rate in the U S   with more than twice Japan s population  was 14 per 100 000 in 2017     SHADOW ON SUCCESSBut 543 Japanese 19 and younger killed themselves in 2018  a 30 year high  Youth suicides were given unprecedented importance in a 2017 suicide prevention plan  with counsellors now at many schools  often starting in primary grades  said Ryusuke Hagiwara  who works on suicide prevention at the Health Ministry Japanese youths often drop out of community activities and focus on school affairs by junior high  limiting possible confidants  Just at the time when stress increases for them  their world narrows   said Yoshiaki Takahashi  a suicide researcher with the Nakasone Peace Institute   We need to open things out  Education Ministry pamphlets aimed at primary school children allow them  through cheery comics  to assess how they re feeling  teaching stress reduction measures such as deep breathing and encouraging them to seek help  If we teach children it s okay to get help  and how  they ll be more open to it later too   Akita s Koseki said   Raising adults like this may help reduce future suicides    Additional reporting by Mayuko Ono  Editing by Gerry Doyle

MEXICO CITY OTTAWA   More than six months after the United States  Mexico and Canada agreed a new deal to govern more than  1 trillion in regional trade  the chances of the countries ratifying the pact this year are receding The three countries struck the United States Mexico Canada agreement  USMCA  on Sept  30  ending a year of difficult negotiations after U S  President Donald Trump demanded the preceding trade pact be renegotiated or scrapped But the deal has not ended trade tensions in North America  If ratification is delayed much longer  it could become hostage to electoral politics The United States has its next presidential contest in 2020  and Canada holds a federal election in October The delay means businesses are still uncertain about the framework that will govern future investments in the region   The USMCA is in trouble   said Andres Rozental  a former Mexican deputy foreign minister for North America Though he believed the deal would ultimately be approved  Rozental said opposition from U S  Democrats and unions to labor provisions in the deal  as well as bickering over tariffs  made its passage in the next few months highly unlikely Canada s Parliament must also ratify the treaty and officials say the timetable is very tight  Current legislators only have a few weeks work left before the start of the summer recess in June  and members of the new Parliament would have little chance to address ratification until 2020 Trump  a Republican  has shown frustration with the Democratic led U S  House of Representatives for failing to sign off on the USMCA  He has threatened to pull out of the old pact  the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   if Congress does not hurry up If Trump did dump NAFTA  the three nations would revert to trade rules in place before it came into effect in 1994 TARIFFSCanada and Mexico are seeking exemption from U S  tariffs on global metal imports imposed last year The metals tariffs were not included in the USMCA and Mexico and Canada are impatient to resolve the issue  Mexico has repeatedly threatened to target new U S  products by the end of April in retribution if tariffs are imposed Meanwhile  Trump on Thursday threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican auto exports unless Mexico does more to stop drug traffickers and illegal immigration Mexico s government is in the final stages of completing a new list of potential U S  imports to be targeted  said Luz Maria de la Mora  a Mexican deputy economy minister  There s going to be a bit of everything   she told Reuters  declining to give details of how the list   originally encompassing products such as bourbon  cheese  motor boats  pork legs  steel and apples   could be modified De la Mora would not be drawn on whether Mexico could refuse to ratify USMCA if steel tariffs are not withdrawn  saying only   All options are on the table  In Ottawa  Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said this week her government was  constantly  looking at its own retaliation list  noting that Trump s tariffs left the country over C 16 billion worth of space to strike back Freeland did not say when that list could change  and a government source  speaking on condition of anonymity  said it might not be necessary  Still  Freeland said Canada was coordinating with Mexico about its options Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  who faces a tough re election battle  on Thursday rejected accepting quotas on Canadian steel and aluminum in exchange for U S  tariffs being dropped Trudeau was criticized during the USMCA negotiations for giving ground to Trump on access to Canada s dairy sector WORKERSU S  Democrats have threatened to block the USMCA unless Mexico passes legislation to improve workers  rights  a demand shared by the Canadian government A bill already in Mexico s Congress to strengthen trade unions should be approved this month  the government says Trump blamed NAFTA for millions of job losses in the United States as companies moved south to employ cheaper Mexican labor  Trump is running for re election in 2020  and his  America First  policy will likely feature prominently in the campaign Forcing Mexico and Canada to rework NAFTA was one of Trump s signature pledges during his shock win in 2016  and Democrats are pulling out the stops to avoid losing again  The closer the election gets  the harder it will be for Democrats to grant Trump a victory  by ratifying the USMCA  said Sergio Alcocer  a former deputy Mexican foreign minister Some Democrats are pushing to change the deal   an idea that both Canadian and Mexican officials resist  People need to be very careful around opening up what could really be a Pandora s box   Freeland said on Thursday Canadian officials say they fear that if one part of the treaty were reopened  it could spark clamor for other sections to be renegotiated as well    Reporting by Dave Graham in Mexico City and David Ljunggren in Ottawa  Additional reporting by

LOS ANGELES   A soccer fan says in a lawsuit that the California Department of Motor Vehicles violated his First Amendment rights by rejecting a personalized license plate he said would celebrate his favorite team  but which the DMV determined might be deemed offensive Jon Kotler applied for a plate that would read  COYW   an acronym of the slogan  Come on You Whites  used by supporters of London based Fulham Football Club  according to the federal lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday  Fulham players wear white jerseys In denying the proposed plate  the DMV said the abbreviation could  have racial overtones  and carry  connotations offensive to good taste and decency   according to the court filing The department s rejection of the application violated his right to freedom of speech  said Kotler  a lawyer and constitutional scholar at the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism The Department of Motor Vehicles said Tuesday that it does not comment on pending lawsuits Kotler s suit asks the court to declare the Department of Motor Vehicles  criteria for personalized license plates unconstitutional  He also wants the department to pay his court costs  You can t allow bureaucrats to make decisions that are fundamental to what it means to be an American  and our free speech is one of those things   Kotler said in a news release   When the government starts to infringe on our rights  that s when the individual citizen must speak up  In its rejection letter to Kotler  the Department of Motor Vehicles acknowledged the difficulties in balancing  an individual s constitutional right to free speech and expression while protecting the sensibilities of all segments of our population  In a 1973 case  the California Court of Appeals upheld the Department of Motor Vehicles  standard of  good taste and decency  in rejecting a plaintiff s claim that his free speech was violated when the department rejected his requested license plate   EZ LAY  Constitutional scholar David L  Hudson said courts are often split in cases claiming censorship over personalized plates  It appears in this case that the government has engaged in regrettable censorship of Mr  Kotler s speech   said Hudson  who teaches at Tennessee s Belmont University and is a fellow at the Freedom Forum Institute   To me courts should be very sensitive to viewpoint discrimination and should err on the side of protecting the individual s speech from government censorship  Kotler is being represented pro bono by the libertarian leaning nonprofit Pacific Legal Foundation  The group criticized the Department of Motor Vehicles   attempt to make itself the speech police  in a statement announcing the lawsuit  You can call Jon a sports fan or a First Amendment expert  but the DMV s misguided efforts to regulate license plates have misbranded Jon as a racist   the foundation said     

CARACAS   After weeks of power cuts and limited access to water  tens of thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets on Saturday to back opposition leader Juan Guaido and protest against President Nicolas Maduro  who they accuse of wrecking the economy Venezuelans  already suffering from hyperinflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine  say the crisis has worsened over the past month  That is when crippling nationwide power outages began to leave vast swaths of territory in the dark for days at a time  cutting off water supplies and cell phone service Guaido  head of the opposition controlled National Assembly and recognized as Venezuela s legitimate head of state by most Western nations  had called for rallies on Saturday to mark the start of what he has billed as a new wave of  definitive  protests to oust Maduro Guaido invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January  denouncing Maduro as a  usurper  for beginning a second term after a 2018 election widely considered fraudulent  Maduro  who retains the support of the military and allies including Russia and China  has derided Guaido as a U S  puppet and said he will face justice In Caracas  thousands of opposition supporters assembled at a main rally point in the eastern El Marques district  Protesters said their homes had been without water for days and many had taken to drawing it from unsanitary pipes or streams running off the Avila mountain overlooking Caracas  We have to get rid of this usurper  and we can t think about anything else   said Claudia Rueda  a 53 year old homemaker at the protest At one point  the crowd chanted   The water has gone  power has gone  and now Maduro what s missing is that you go too  Two massive power outages in recent weeks led Maduro s government to cancel school classes and left many businesses shuttered  The resumption of services has been uneven  with cities such as San Cristobal  Valencia and Maracay still reporting intermittent blackouts  We haven t just come to demand water and power  We ve come to demand freedom and democracy   Guaido said at the Caracas rally  surrounded by a cheering crowd   We can t let ourselves become used to this  we can t put up with it  we aren t going to let these crooks keep hold of our country  While no immediate protest related violence was reported in Caracas  witnesses reported clashes between protesters and police in the steamy oil hub of Maracaibo  Demonstrators in the city  in the western state of Zulia  told Reuters police had fired rubber bullet rounds and tear gas to disperse them  I m fed up  They hurt me  and though I was frightened  what it makes me most is angry   said Denis Fernandez  a 25 year old who said he had been injured by a rubber bullet Fernandez said his daughter had almost died from hepatitis a month ago  as hospitals had no supplies to treat her  When there is no electricity for air conditioning  he said he and his wife had taken to fanning their children at night to keep them cool The National Assembly  on its Twitter account  said two of its lawmakers had been arrested and then released by authorities at the Maracaibo protest  Venezuela s Information Ministry did not respond to a request to comment  TRUE NATIONAL EMERGENCY The ruling Socialist Party staged a rival march in Caracas  center on Saturday  with several thousand people  mostly state workers clad in red shirts and red baseball caps  banging drums and dancing salsa Attendees Reuters spoke to echoed Maduro s statements that the power outages were due to attacks orchestrated by the U S  government  The opposition  along with power experts  blame the blackouts on the government s incompetence at maintaining the network and corrupt officials who have pocketed billions of dollars allocated to develop it  They ve resorted to cyber terrorism  to electromagnetic terrorism   Maduro told the crowd   I ask for understanding     we are in a true electrical emergency  a true national emergency  Venezuela s Constituent Assembly  a parallel legislature controlled by the Socialist Party  on Tuesday approved a measure allowing for the possible prosecution of Guaido by stripping him of his parliamentary immunity The chief prosecutor s office has opened an investigation into Guaido and his alleged links to the blackouts and to  incidents of violence  in January  but it has not yet ordered his arrest or officially charged him with any crime The U S  government on Friday took another step in its efforts to force Maduro out  by imposing new sanctions on Venezuelan oil shipments  and promising  stronger action  against key ally Cuba for helping to keep his government afloat   Reporting by Vivian Sequera and Deisy Buitrago  additional reporting by Mayela Armas and Shaylim Valderrama  Mariela Nava in Maracaibo  Anggy Polanco in San Cristobal  and Mircely Guanipa in Punto Fijo  Writing by Angus Berwick  Editing by Tom Brown and Rosalba O Brien  

LONDON   British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Saturday that the longer it takes to find a compromise with the opposition Labour Party to secure a parliamentary majority for a Brexit deal  the less likely it is that Britain will leave the European Union May has so far failed to secure backing for her negotiated agreement with Brussels as some Conservative lawmakers and Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party  which props up her minority government  have voted it down  She has since turned to the opposition Labour Party in a bid to secure a majority for an orderly Brexit  although its leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Saturday he was waiting for May to move her Brexit red lines  The fact is that on Brexit there are areas where the two main parties agree  we both want to end free movement  we both want to leave with a good deal  and we both want to protect jobs   May said in comments released by her Downing Street office   That is the basis for a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament and winning that majority is the only way to deliver Brexit    The longer this takes  the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all   she said  May has a plan to enshrine in law a customs arrangement with the EU to win over the Labour Party  and her aides have discussed offering the opposition a place in the British delegation to Wednesday s EU summit  The Sunday Times newspaper reported The prime minister has asked EU leaders to postpone Britain s exit from the bloc until June 30  The EU  which gave her a two week extension the last time she asked  insists she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her thrice rejected divorce deal in the British parliament It is the latest twist in a saga which leaves Britain  the world s fifth biggest economy  struggling to find a way to honor a 2016 referendum vote to take the country out of the globe s largest trading bloc  PRESSURES ON BOTH PARTIES May reiterated on Saturday her hope that lawmakers would approve a deal to allow Britain to leave the bloc as quickly as possible   My intention is to reach an agreement with my fellow EU leaders that will mean if we can agree a deal here at home we can leave the EU in just six weeks   she said  One of the most senior Brexiteers in her government  the leader of the lower house of parliament Andrea Leadsom  also said there was a risk of Brexit slipping further from grasp  The vision we had of Brexit is fading away   and we are running out of time to save it   she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper  Some of May s lawmakers are warning they will try to oust her if Britain participates in EU parliamentary elections next month and is forced to extend membership of the bloc beyond June  The Observer newspaper reported The Sunday Telegraph said ministers are discussing whether to resign if a Brexit delay means Britain must field candidates  In a further sign of the ever heavier strains on the Conservatives  more than 100 candidates for upcoming local elections wrote to May warning of the growing anger at the grassroots level and among the public  Our party and our government have completely lost touch with voters   the candidates said  according to The Sunday Telegraph   Let s be clear  more fudge and a further dilution of Brexit is not the answer   Opposition leader Corbyn also faces pressure as more than 80 of his lawmakers warned that another vote on Brexit must be a red line in Labour s talks with the government  The Independent newspaper said   This story has been refiled to fix typo in first paragraph   Reporting by Costas Pitas  Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Daniel Wallis  

BERLIN   Britain should be given a reasonable amount of time to work out its exit from the European Union  though the delay to Brexit could be longer than British Prime Minister Theresa May has requested  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday The EU will grant May a second delay to Brexit at an emergency summit on Wednesday but leaders will debate a longer extension with conditions to prevent any future British leader jeopardizing the bloc May has asked EU leaders to postpone Britain s exit until June 30  I am  and the government is  of the view that we should give the two parties a reasonable amount of time   Merkel said of Britain s ruling conservatives and opposition Labour Party  who are in talks to find a Brexit deal  We will deliberate over what kind of extension we want to grant Britain  It could well be that it is a longer extension than has been requested by the British prime minister   Merkel told Germany s Bundestag lower house of parliament  But we will organize this extension such that when Britain has passed the Withdrawal Agreement  Britain can very quickly thereafter execute the exit in an orderly fashion   Merkel said  So  in summary  the government is still very interested in an orderly exit of Britain from the European Union   she added   Reporting by Paul Carrel  editing by Thomas Escritt  

Since March 31  the defeat in Turkey of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s Islamic conservative Justice and Development Party  the A K P   and its ultranationalist electoral partner Nationalist Movement Party  the M H P   in municipal elections in Ankara  Istanbul and several others cities has led to premature commentary that Turkey is on the verge of change By wresting control of mayoral positions in Ankara and Istanbul  which were held by Mr  Erdogan s party for 25 years  the opposition coalition has shown that Mr  Erdogan is not invincible But it is no victory for liberal values  The opposition coalition of the Republican People s Party  the C H P   and its electoral partner  the Good Party   an offshoot of Mr  Erdogan s ultranationalist partner   is simply another version of the right wing nationalism of the ruling coalition of the A K P  and the M H P The C H P   which is officially a social democratic party  has endorsed the imprisonments of elected Kurdish politicians and nominated ultranationalists  among them Mansur Yavas  the mayor elect in Ankara  the national capital  Kemal Kilicdaroglu  the C H P  leader  has said that he  loves  the ultraright nationalists  He has also said that the left right divide has become irrelevant and that it was a mistake by the left in the past to focus on income redistribution The C H P  formed an alliance with the Good Party  whose leader Meral Aksener as interior minister in the 1990s oversaw a dirty counterinsurgency war against the Kurds  She has not offered any evidence that her views have become more moderate since  Both the M H P  and the Good Party are intensely opposed to changing Turkey s oppressive practices toward the Kurds Fundamentally  Turkey s democratic evolution has been hampered by the absence of a democratic leftist alternative  The authoritarian right has held sway since the Turkish republic was founded in 1923  The historical record shows us   Sweden a century ago or Spain  Greece and Portugal in the 1970s   that a strong democratic left is crucial for democratization The Turkish state has been consistently ruthless in its oppression of the left  In 1921  Mustafa Kemal  Ataturk  had all 15 members of the leadership of the Turkish Communist Party killed  fearing a leftist challenge to his power  He banned trade unions and imprisoned leftist intellectuals of all stripes Mr  Erdogan has carried on Mr  Ataturk s legacy by maintaining a labor hostile order  The A K P  government has banned strikes of nearly 200 000 workers  Twenty two thousand workers have lost their lives in workplace accidents since the A K P  came to power Turkey s democratic travails have conventionally been explained through the supposed clash between Islam and secularism  Turkish democracy is generally   and inadequately   understood to have been undermined by the military allegedly staging coups to protect secularism and  in recent years  by the Islamist ambitions of Mr  Erdogan In fact  the history of Turkey has been shaped by class politics that are obscured by a misleading narrative that pits Islamization against secularism  Closer inspection reveals that Turkey s secularists and Islamists represent the two shades of the same right wing ideology  which includes a commitment to unrestrained capitalism  hostility to labor  conservatism and nationalism Mr  Ataturk s secular reforms laid the foundations of a modern capitalist society  but for his successors it has made sense to use Islam to protect capitalism  With the onset of the Cold War  Turkey s ruling  ostensibly secular elite opted for Islamization to check leftist politics  and religious education was reintroduced in 1946 The rise of socialist student and labor movements in the 1960s and of a democratic left in the 1970s prompted the military to step in to crush the left  Gen  Kenan Evren  who took power in 1980 after a coup  called upon the people to  firmly embrace our religion  to ward off the threat of socialism  His junta made religious education mandatory  opened new religious schools and continued to populate the state bureaucracy with members of religious fraternities  who were reliable anti socialists The military junta also imposed a neoliberal order that the business class had been calling for  it banned trade unions and incarcerated their leaders and activists  together with hundreds of thousands of other leftists Mr  Erdogan rose to power promising to serve the same capitalist interests  He embraced the neoliberal economics of the generals and was endorsed by the secular  westernized business barons who did not mind his religious conservatism The Islamic conservatives recast the class conflict as a cultural conflict between the people and the elite  They won by championing the religious culture of the masses  but privileged the interests of the economic elite after coming to power  Mr  Erdogan s populism notwithstanding  income inequalities have grown under Mr  Erdogan  The richest 1 percent of the population has increased its share of the national wealth by 43 percent  putting it in possession of 54 percent of the country s wealth Conservatives   secular or Islamic   have won every Turkish election since 1950 except once  That exception was in 1977  when the democratic left led by Bulent Ecevit  a progressive populist who called for social justice and respected popular religiosity  won over 40 percent of the votes  Mr  Ecevit s call for social justice alarmed the business elite and the military that feared that a Communist revolution was in the making The present regime in Turkey has its ideological roots in the right wing coalition of the 1970s  when the secular conservatives  ultranationalists and Islamists came together to defeat the ascendant left  This was when Mr  Erdogan began his political career in the Islamist National Salvation Party The paramilitary gangs of the ultranationalist M H P  abetted by the security forces killed thousands of leftist supporters  students  intellectuals and labor activists between 1975 and 1980  Last month  President Erdogan paid tribute to this heritage when he ordered a university in the city of Adana renamed after Alparslan Turkes  the founding leader of the M H P   who led the bloody campaign against the left in the 1970s Mr  Kilicdaroglu  the C H P  leader  endorsed this decision  a stunning step considering that the right wing death squads commanded by Mr  Turkes had attempted to kill Bulent Ecevit  the democratic leftist C H P  leader  in the 1970s But Turkish social democrats have simply never recovered from the devastating blow of the 1980 coup to challenge right wing ideology  instead  they have concluded that they must shift to the right to appeal to the people If the democratic left had not been crushed  Turkey would most likely have followed the same democratic path as Greece  Spain and Portugal  Turkish social democrats today would do well to revisit the example of the 1970s  They need to speak for social justice and freedom  instead of aligning with right wing nationalism  if they want to make a difference RelatedOpinion   Selim

PORTO ALEGRE   Before Brazilian prosecutors could conduct an inspection last year of the prison considered the country s worst  its warden had to clear their visit with the jail s de facto authorities  in house prison gangs  As Brazil s incarcerated population has surged eight fold in three decades to around 750 000 inmates  the world s third highest tally  its prison gangs have come to wield vast power that reaches far beyond the jailhouse walls New President Jair Bolsonaro s vow to crack down on spiralling crime has put him on a collision course with the jail gangs  In a strategy detailed to Reuters for the first time  top security officials said they plan to isolate gang bosses  ramp up surveillance  build more lockups and deploy federal forces to beleaguered state prison systems  Originally formed to protect inmates and advocate for better conditions  Brazil s prison gangs are now involved in bank heists  drug trafficking and gun running  with jailed kingpins presiding over their empires via smuggled cellphones  Their spread has kindled a violent crime wave  turning Brazil into the world s murder capital  With a record 64 000 people killed in 2017  the prison gangs  or  faces   have become the country s most pressing security concern  and a daunting foe for Bolsonaro  a far right former army captain  The solution to public security in Brazil depends on lots of things  and one of those is the prison system   said Fabiano Bordignon  Bolsonaro s appointment as head of the National Penitentiary Department Bordignon  in an interview  said Brazil s roughly 1 500 jails need about 350 000 more spaces to house prisoners  He plans to use a 1 5 billion reais   396 million  federal prison fund to help state governments build between 10 000 and 20 000 spaces this year  By the end of Bolsonaro s term in 2022  Bordignon hopes to lower the deficit by up to 140 000 spaces  But with each new space costing an average of 50 000 reais  he knows he needs more money   We re not going to be able to solve everything in four years   he said  Still  authorities must  retake control  of Brazil s jails  he added  since  in a good number of them  the state has no control  BRAZIL S WORSTNowhere is that reality starker than the Central Prison in the southern city of Porto Alegre  Inaugurated in 1959  it is Brazil s largest lockup  and  according to a 2015 congressional report  also its worst  When investigators from the National Council of the Public Ministry came to inspect the prison last year  its warden told them he had to first okay it with gang leaders  according to the investigators  report  The prison has a capacity of 1 824 people  but when Reuters visited  officials said there were nearly 5 000 inmates from at least eight different gangs stuffed into its moldy galleys   more than the entire prison population of Norway Internally  the prison is controlled by the faces  whose members live in rancid  densely packed cellblocks that armed guards only enter in riot gear  In one gang controlled wing  some 300 inmates lived in a space designed for 200  with many sleeping in the corridor Roughly 30 percent of the jail s population is more or less illiterate  and dozens of prisoners suffer from tuberculosis and syphilis  officials in the jail s educational and medical wings said  In the exercise yard  which inmates share with rats and cockroaches  raw sewage gurgles out of broken pipes  The gangs offer protection from rape and rival crews  but it comes at a steep price  Inmates here must buy their food from their bosses  who even control inmates  intimate visits  During Reuters  tour  a gang boss smoked impassively as inmates filed in and out of a foul corridor  where they snuggled with girlfriends  wives or prostitutes on stained mattresses  Every so often  the boss called out a prisoner s name to indicate his time was up Herique Junior Da Rocha Machado cast his lot with the prison s 780 working inmates  who cook  clean and wash  The orange clad workers are housed apart from the faces  but are reviled for collaborating with their jailers  If you don t go into the workers wing  you go in with the faces  Then  when you return to the street  you end up falling back into crime   said Machado  who was jailed for his role in a kidnapping   The situation only deteriorates   FRESH LEGISLATIONElected in October on a law and order platform to end years of graft and rising violence  Bolsonaro and his government must now pit their tough talk against the gangs To restore order  Bolsonaro has tapped Justice Minister Sergio Moro  a former judge who made his name jailing scores of Brazil s political and business elite in the sweeping  Car Wash  corruption investigation In February  Moro unveiled his signature crime fighting bill  which includes proposals to toughen prison sentences and isolate gang leaders in maximum security lockups Moro s proposal faces an uncertain future in Congress  where Bolsonaro is struggling to marshal a stable coalition  Even if Moro s bill flounders  Bordignon said the government plans to make it harder for cell phones to enter prisons  toughen recruitment of guards and launch a ranking system to help the federal government focus resources on failing jails  He also expressed willingness during the interview to dispatch federal forces to states losing control of their prisons  In January  Bolsonaro s government sent federal agents to calm the northeastern state of Cear  which suffered a wave of coordinated gang attacks after state authorities announced plans to toughen prison conditions The following month  the government struck another blow against the gangs by moving several leaders of Sao Paulo s powerful First Capital Command  PCC   including top kingpin Marcos Willians Camacho  or  Marcola   into federal jails  Reuters visited the federal jail in Brasilia where Marcola and several other PCC leaders are being held  Opened late last year at a cost of 45 million reais   12 million  and modelled after a famous U S  supermax prison in Colorado  the Brasilia jail has 208 individual cells  with 12 extra secure ones for inmates such as Marcola High risk prisoners are locked up for 22 hours each day  exercising for two hours in a small yard adjacent to their cell  Intimate visits are prohibited  and authorities recently put a stop to physical contact between inmates and their relatives or lawyers  Conversations now occur via telephone  with inmates separated from visitors by a hard plastic window  The federal penitentiaries are the most effective tool today to combat organised crime in Brazil   said Marcelo Stona  director of operations for the National Penitentiary Department NEW JAILS  SAME PROBLEMSNonetheless  Brazil has just five federal jails  all built since 2006  with capacity for just over 1 000 inmates   about 0 1 percent of the current prison population Like Porto Alegre s Central prison  the vast majority of Brazil s jails are run by financially stretched state governments  often with patchy results  Overcrowded cell blocks are policed by underpaid guards and deadly riots are common  At least 56 inmates were killed in the northern city of Manaus in 2017  when members of rival prison gangs began slaughtering each other  Many were decapitated and dismembered  Brazil s states have made efforts to build modern   gang free  jails  but they  too  are proving vulnerable  Unveiled in 2016  the Canoas jail is just over 25 kilometres  16 miles  from Porto Alegre s Central Prison  but feels a world away  The Rio Grande do Sul state government hand picks inmates to preserve the jail s integrity  Signal blockers prevent cellphone use  Eight man cells  opened remotely from the floor above  minimize the risks of guards being corrupted  Yet despite those efforts  two prisoners died here in suspicious circumstances in the second half of 2018  and local officials have become alarmed as other overcrowded state prisons send their gang affiliated inmates to fill up Canoas  vacancies  If we keep doing more of the same     we re going to lose everything   said state prosecutor Alexander Guterres Thom  who regularly inspects the Canoas jail   You see that  the gangs  are starting to organise themselves in there  They want to enter  create chaos and take control     Reporting by Gabriel Stargardter  Additional reporting by

HOUSTON   The United States on Friday targeted oil shipments from Venezuela to Cuba in its latest round of sanctions to pressure the government of President Nicolas Maduro  aiming to choke off a crucial supply of crude to the Communist island The U S  Treasury imposed sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Venezuelan state run oil company Petrleos de Venezuela  S A  or PDVSA   and also on two companies and a vessel that delivered oil to Cuba in February and March   Treasury is taking action against vessels and entities transporting oil  providing a lifeline to keep the illegitimate Maduro regime afloat   said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in a statement  Cuba continues to profit from  and prop up  the illegitimate Maduro regime through oil for repression schemes as they attempt to keep Maduro in power   The latest round of U S  sanctions  announced earlier by Vice President Mike Pence in a speech in Houston  aim to further undermine Maduro s government after the United States and most Western nations recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the rightful president of Venezuela Guaido invoked the Venezuelan constitution to assume an interim presidency in January  arguing that Maduro s 2018 re election was illegitimate   Reporting By Steve Holland and Mary Milliken  editing by Grant McCool and Richard Chang  

The House Judiciary Committee may be sitting on its subpoena for the Mueller report  but under federal law  certain other committees need neither a subpoena nor a court order to get access to it and its underlying materials  including grand jury testimony and documents The House and Senate Intelligence Committees should already have certain investigative materials relating to Russian election meddling  in unredacted form  collected by the special counsel  Robert Mueller  This legal structure was created by a provision in the Patriot Act combined with the notification provisions of the National Security Act  The intelligence committees have a lawful right  virtually unbounded  to foreign intelligence information in the possession of the intelligence agencies of the executive branch  Federal law requires that the attorney general provide to the director of national intelligence any foreign intelligence information collected during a criminal investigation  Then the director must by law provide it to the intelligence committees of Congress   either by sending a notification or acting in response to a request from the committees  The director has an obligation to inform policymakers  including Congress  of intelligence assessments so that they can take steps to protect the American people The process is not a partisan tool or a method to take down President Trump  It s about national security  The relevant federal statutes follow a two stage process  First  the language of Section 3040 of Title 50 of the United States Code   part of the Patriot Act   mandates that the attorney general  shall expeditiously disclose to the director of national intelligence  foreign intelligence acquired in a criminal investigation  which may include limitations necessary to protect continuing investigations  Another provision of that act affects grand jury secrecy and disclosure  During the negotiations over the bill  the Justice Department wanted a  may share  exception to grand jury secrecy  Critically  however  the Senate Intelligence Committee insisted on a  must share  provision If the process were working as it was designed  after the director of national intelligence receives relevant material from the Justice Department  the executive branch intelligence agencies would use it to assess and improve their own efforts in deciphering the plans  intentions and capabilities of foreign governments and entities Second  when the information has moved to the director  50 USC Section 3092 of the National Security Act kicks in  This requires the director  and all intelligence agencies under his control  to keep the congressional intelligence committees  fully and currently informed  of all intelligence activities  and any significant failures   Any information that arguably falls outside the notification provisions must  nevertheless  be handed over if the intelligence committees ask for it In this case  if the attorney general had provided information from the Mueller investigation to the director  the director would have been obligated to notify the intelligence committees of the agencies  activities based on that intelligence If the director did not provide it  the congressional committees could and should have demanded the information  At least in the House  it looks like that didn t happen  When Democrats took over this year  the chairman of the Intelligence Committee  Adam Schiff  ramped up its investigation  but statements by him suggest that the committee has not yet received foreign intelligence obtained during the Mueller investigation So  by design or by ignorance  the executive branch agencies may not have followed the laws they have sworn to uphold  And the congressional committees may have failed to fulfill their oversight responsibilities  The House Intelligence Committee should demand immediate attention to the mandates of the Patriot and National Security Acts  The committee s staff should make informal inquiries to determine whether  and the extent to which  William Barr  Jeff Sessions and Dan Coats provided this information to the intelligence committees  If the inquiry yields nothing or reveals that the law has not been followed  Mr  Barr  Mr  Coats and others in the executive branch should be called to testify before the committee Even with the completion of the Mueller investigation  Mr  Barr has argued that grand jury information is sacrosanct and will be redacted from the materials he gives to Congress and the public  Yet the entire purpose of Section 3040  as well as the specific exception added to the grand jury secrecy rules themselves  were to require the identification and sharing of critical intelligence collected by law enforcement during an investigation  and certainly after it has ended  Moreover  the constitutional requirements for congressional access mandate that the executive branch give all national security information to Congress   if the intelligence committees demand it  No court has ever ruled that the executive can withhold such information from Congress  As a nation in 2001 we learned a very painful lesson  that keeping vital foreign intelligence from the intelligence agencies  and ultimately Congress  must give way in the face of potential terrorist attacks If Mr  Barr wants to argue that attacks by foreign enemies on our democracy are any less critical to our national security than terrorism  we will see how Congress and the American people respond  the mueller reportOpinion   Jerrold L  Nadler  America Is Done

  Attorney General William P  Barr  appearing before Congress for a second straight day on Wednesday  said the government spied on the Trump campaign and said he would look into whether any rules were violated   Mr  Barr signaled he was open to sharing more information with lawmakers about the redacted Mueller report than is released to the public and that he  hoped  to make it public  next week    Meanwhile  the Senate Judiciary Committee is considering the nomination of Jeffrey A  Rosen  President Trump s nominee to succeed Rod J  Rosenstein  who appointed and oversaw the special counsel  as deputy attorney general Barr will review potential  spying  on the Trump campaign With the Russia investigation complete  Mr  Barr said he was preparing to review  both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign   including possible improper  spying  by American intelligence agencies  I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal   Mr  Barr said  adding that he believed  spying did occur   Mr  Trump and his allies have accused the F B I  and other government officials of abusing their power and cooking up the Russia investigation to sabotage the president  I am not suggesting that those rules were violated  but I think it s important to look at them   Mr  Barr said  Later he said he wanted to ensure that there was no  improper surveillance    not suggesting there had been  but that the possibility warranted review It was not immediately clear what Mr  Barr was referring to  and he did not present evidence to back up his statement  The F B I  obtained a secret surveillance warrant on a former Trump campaign adviser  Carter Page  after he left the campaign  and reports have suggested it used at least one confidential informer to collect information on campaign associates Mr  Barr said that he will work with the F B I  director  Christopher A  Wray  to examine the origins of the bureau s counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign  and that he would soon set up a team for that effort  He noted that Congress and the Justice Department s inspector general have already completed investigations of that matter  and that after reviewing those investigations he would be able to see whether there were any  remaining questions to be addressed  Barr gave up a few more details about Mueller s report Under intense questioning from Democratic senators  Mr  Barr further pulled back the curtain on the Justice Department s handling of the special counsel investigation  though only by a few inches Mr  Barr shed some additional light on Mr  Mueller s decision not to reach a prosecutorial decision about whether Mr  Trump criminally obstructed the investigation and his own decision to conclude in his letter to Congress delivering the investigation s conclusions last month that the evidence did not meet that bar Mr  Barr said he had spoken with Mr  Mueller about why he did not reach a decision on obstruction of justice  but declined to offer details of their conversations  The attorney general said that Mr  Mueller did not explicitly ask that Congress be allowed to judge the evidence and decide for itself  nor did he say that the attorney general should  But that is generally how the Department of Justice works   Mr  Barr said  saying that the department s job is to make prosecutorial decisions   and he had  I am looking forward to explaining my decision that I briefly outlined in the March 24 letter  but I don t think I can do it until the report is out   he said The redacted Mueller report may be released  next week   Barr says On the timing of the redacted report s release  Mr  Barr said Wednesday that he  hoped  to make it public  next week   The answer differed slightly from what he told House lawmakers on Tuesday  that he intended to put out the report  within a week  He said Justice Department lawyers and members of Mr  Mueller s team  who are reviewing the report for sensitive information to black out before release  would not remove information that would harm the  reputational interests  of Mr  Trump  Mr  Barr also said that he had not overruled Mr  Mueller s team on any proposed redactions from the Mueller report  and had not discussed with the White House what he was blacking out Barr is willing to work with Congress on redacted information Democrats in the House have slammed Mr  Barr for what they view as his refusal to share the investigation s underlying evidence and material he may redact from the report  But Mr  Barr told senators on Wednesday he would be willing to re evaluate that decision to try to accommodate lawmakers  concerns  I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees  the chairmen and ranking members of each  what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that   he said Democratic lawmakers argue that they need such material so they can fully understand the implications of Mr  Mueller s findings and judge whether or not Mr  Barr had fairly represented what was found  In the House  they have already approved a subpoena to issue to try to compel the release of this kind of information Barr again refused to say if he had briefed the White House Mr  Barr again declined to say whether he had briefed the White House on the fuller Mueller report  even though Justice Department officials had previously said it had not been shown to the White House His refusal to say one way or the other raised the possibility that since then  the Justice Department may have briefed Mr  Trump or his inner circle about its contents  I m landing the plane right now   Mr  Barr said under Democratic questioning   I have been willing to discuss my letter and the process going forward  The report is going to be out next week and I m not just going into the details of the process  Trump says there is nothing to clear up   I won  Interest in the report remains intense among congressional lawmakers  President Trump  not so much Speaking to reporters as he left the White House on Wednesday  the president slammed the investigation as an illegal  attempted coup   But he said he had  won  and could care less about the report itself  I have not seen the Mueller report   Mr  Trump told reporters   I have not read the Mueller report  I won  No collusion  no obstruction  I won  Everybody knows I won  He continued   As far as I m concerned I don t care about the Mueller report  I ve been totally exonerated  The report  which runs nearly 400 pages  is likely to be less black and white  Mr  Barr has said Mr  Mueller did not find the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to undermine the 2016 election  but he has said that the special counsel s team did not reach a prosecutorial decision about whether Mr  Trump criminally obstructed the investigation  Mr  Barr  assessing the evidence for himself  concluded the evidence did not meet that bar Rosen vows to keep politics from improperly influencing his decisionsMeanwhile  at the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for Mr  Rosen  Senator Amy Klobuchar  Democrat of Minnesota  pressed the nominee to commit to allowing all pending criminal matters related to the special counsel s investigation to proceed without improper political interference  If I am confirmed  I would expect in all prosecutorial matters to proceed on the facts and the law and not any improper political influences   Mr  Rosen replied Ms  Klobuchar did not name which matters she had in mind  though several cases are still working their way through the court system  But Mr  Mueller s office obtained the indictment of Roger J  Stone Jr   a longtime informal adviser to President Trump  and is handing that matter off to regular prosecutors to bring to trial  The Mueller team also investigated other matters  like the finances of the Trump inauguration committee  which continue to be investigated elsewhere Rosen defends his role in the Trump administration s fuel efficiency proposalUnder questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  Mr  Rosen defended his role in crafting a Trump administration proposal on tailpipe pollution rules  Ms  Feinstein referred to a New York Times article that portrayed him as pushing to let cars emit more greenhouse gases  Mr  Rosen said the article had several errors  although he did not identify them He also said the issue was how to implement a law that required annual increases in fuel economy standards through 2020  and then set criteria for decisions about whether to require any further escalations in the years after that  The Trump administration  he said  was merely proposing a  time out  after 2020 In fact  the current regulations  put forth by the Obama administration  already require automakers to keep improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles through 2025  The Trump administration s preferred proposal would therefore allow more greenhouse gas pollution than current rules Mr  Rosen also portrayed himself as playing a  managerial  role in overseeing the crafting of the rule  such as by ensuring deadlines were met  But 11 people interviewed by The New York Times at the time of the negotiation said that Mr  Rosen pushed forcefully for that outcome

LONDON BRUSSELS   Policymakers looking to persuade Germany and other wealthy euro zone countries to pool their debt with less well off neighbours may need to keep things short and simple A persistent shortage of triple A rated bonds has kept momentum for a pooled euro zone sovereign bond alive despite opposition from Germany  The euro zone s largest economy has so far rejected any proposal that could potentially leave its taxpayers on the hook for the debts of other countries Plans for a synthetic common bond  comprised of debt from the 19 euro zone countries  have stalled since they were first unveiled by the European Commission  EC  last year  prompting officials to look at other options  including short term euro bills European Central Bank  ECB  policymaker Ewald Nowotny flagged the possibility of creating euro bills  jointly guaranteed by euro zone member states  in February and officials at the Commission  the bloc s executive body  have discussed them as an option for strengthening Europe s capital markets  according to an industry source Such debt could mature in one year or less No real progress on creating a joint  safe asset     so called because there is not meant to be a risk of default    is expected until after a new Commission is formed following elections to the European Parliament in May  Even then  expectations for a quick breakthrough are low  The Commission proposal to create a Sovereign Bond Backed Securities or SBBS  has not been discussed by EU states since an internal Franco German paper on eurozone reforms in June said SBBS had  significantly more disadvantages than potential benefits and should not be further pursued  A DANGEROUS FIRST STEP A proposal for short dated euro Treasury bills was first aired in 2011 by Graham Bishop  a consultant on European Union  EU  financial regulation who had been appointed in 2013 by then Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to an expert group advising on possible joint issuance of debt  The group was dissolved in 2014 Bishop said the short term nature of his proposal  which involves setting up a new body  dubbed the Temporary Eurobill Fund  made it an ideal testing vehicle  Under his proposal  a common bill with a maturity of two years would be issued  He is working on another version with a maturity of six months  Simply  governments have to commit their short term funding under two years via the fund   perhaps by treaty commitment   said Bishop  vice chair of the European Movement in Britain  a group which campaigns for greater European integration and for reform of the EU  The bill is made up from a pool of bills from the euro area and then reissued  Under Bishop s proposal  member states which break EU fiscal rules would be excluded from the Fund and member states would not be liable for the debt obligations of others Analysts said euro Treasury bills made sense  particularly for banks  which need high grade sovereign debt to fund their operations and are concerned about a dwindling supply as Germany and the Netherlands  both triple A rated sovereigns  issue less  Given the political opposition to a euro bond  a safe euro zone bill full stop would be seen as a good step in the right direction   said David Owen  chief European economist at Jefferies in London  Critics  however  said euro Treasury bills would create pressure for governments to share liability   Once such a so called  safe asset  is in place  calls for mutualisation will be inevitable  Therefore  we should not even start going down that path   said German EU lawmaker Markus Ferber  who leads the largest conservative grouping in the economic committee of the European Parliament THE DOOM LOOPThe potential benefits of a common euro zone bond were highlighted during the euro zone debt crisis  when banks  reliance on debt issued by their home government created a so called  doom loop  in which concerns about the creditworthiness of indebted European countries coloured investors  view of their banks and vice versa  amplifying market tensions Despite the introduction of tougher banking regulation and oversight in the wake of the crisis  the doom loop remains  Indeed  European banks have used cheap credit from the ECB to buy more government bonds Italian lenders hold close to 20 percent of Italy s roughly 2 trillion euro debt pile and concerns about the government s spending plans sparked a nasty sell off in sovereign bonds last year  raising the banks  cost of funding Graphic  Europe banks more exposed to sovereigns than U S   https   tmsnrt rs 2CPzwvc The average European bank now has sovereign debt exposure equal to 170 percent of its core tier one capital  a key measure of a bank s financial strength  according to a Deutsche Bank analysis  That is more than triple the exposure of U S banks Graphic  Allocated share of global currency reserves  https   tmsnrt rs 2WEJZ4k In addition to reducing bank stability risks  EU officials want to increase the offer of euro denominated assets viewed as safe to make the euro more attractive to foreign investors and counter the dollar s dominance as a reserve currency Graphic  European banks  exposure to home government bonds  https   tmsnrt rs 2VwBxUG The share of the safest  triple A rated sovereign bonds that come from the euro zone has dropped from about half before the financial crisis to around 25 percent currently  as the rating of public debt in several euro zone states deteriorated  Bishop said the idea of a euro bill would be easier to sell to sceptical states now than it was 10 years ago because the yields of short dated bills have converged  so the cost of participating for the likes of Germany  whose Bunds are considered the safest European assets of all  would be low A spokesman for Germany s finance ministry declined to comment  Asked about a safe asset at last month s ECB news conference  President Mario Draghi said the final decision was up to the politicians  This doesn t detract at all from the argument that it s absolutely rational to have a safe asset at European level   he said   The online version of the story corrects typo in headline to

WASHINGTON   The United States is scrutinising state owned Qatar Airways  acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Air Italy  which has been flying to U S  destinations since June in a move seen by U S  lawmakers as flouting a deal not to add new flights to the domestic market  Questioned repeatedly about the acquisition during a U S  Senate hearing  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday   We re looking very closely at this recent decision by Qatar to take on 49 percent of this airline  Both Republicans and Democrats at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing said they were concerned that the deal with the Italian carrier violated an agreement Qatar Airways reached with the United States in early 2018  There are lots of consultations taking place   Pompeo said  In January  U S  and Qatari officials met to discuss civil aviation matters  the State Department said earlier this year Since 2015 the largest U S carriers   Delta Air Lines  American Airlines Group and United Airlines   have argued their Gulf rivals are being unfairly subsidized by their governments  distorting competition Gulf airlines have always denied those accusations and last year the three major Middle Eastern carriers reached a voluntary agreement  saying they would not add new flights to the United States However  Air Italy has been flying to New York and Miami since June last year and was due to start serving San Francisco and Los Angeles from this month and Chicago in May Qatar Airways acquired 49 percent of Italian airline Meridiana in 2017  rebranded it Air Italy and transformed it into a carrier with five announced non stop U S  destinations from Milan Scott Reed  campaign manager for the Partnership for Open   Fair Skies  a group representing the three largest U S  airlines and aviation unions  said  the future of this industry   and the jobs it supports   depend on the Trump administration holding Qatar accountable for its trade cheating actions  In December  11 Republican senators wrote a letter to Pompeo suggesting the flights from Milan  were consistent with Qatar Airways pattern of adding subsidized capacity in markets where demand is already well served  Reed said  there is bipartisan concern that Qatar Airways is violating last year s agreement with the United States   making its finances more opaque instead of less and using Air Italy as a proxy to undermine the U S  airline industry  An aide to Senator Bob Menendez  the ranking Democrat on the foreign relations committee  noted that January marked the one year anniversary of agreements between the United States and Qatar on government subsidies to Qatar Airways  In a side letter to the agreements  the Qatari government indicated there was no intention to launch additional flights from Qatar to U S  destinations but said some passengers would board flights in Europe before flying to U S  destinations    Reporting by Patricia Zengerle  David Shepardson and Lesley Wroughton  Editing by Susan Thomas and Tom Brown

LONDON   Britain will suffer economic damage equivalent to the loss of at least 2 3 years of normal growth between now and the end of 2021 if it leaves the European Union without an exit deal  the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday The world s fifth biggest economy could quit the EU as soon as Friday  disrupting its ties with the bloc that it joined 46 years ago  if Prime Minister Theresa May cannot agree a delay with EU leaders on Wednesday The IMF said that even in a relatively orderly no deal Brexit scenario    with no delays at borders and minimal financial market turmoil    the economy would grow 3 5 percent less by the end of 2021 than it would under a smoother Brexit  The increase in trade barriers has an immediate negative impact on UK foreign and domestic demand   the IMF said The EU economy would suffer too but by much less than Britain  facing an estimated 0 5 percent hit to gross domestic product compared with a smooth Brexit scenario  the IMF said British exports to the EU and other countries which have trade deals with the bloc would face new tariffs and regulatory barriers if Britain reverted to the World Trade Organisation rules favoured by some Brexit supporters Supporters of an abrupt Brexit have accused the IMF of making politically motivated forecasts in the past In its report on Tuesday  the fund said a worse case no deal Brexit scenario involving border delays and financial market turmoil would increase the damage to about 4 percent of GDP by 2021 The forecasts took into account the British government s plans not to impose tariffs on most categories of imports in the event of a no deal Brexit  and also assumed that the Bank of England would cut interest rates BoE Governor Mark Carney gave broadly similar estimates of the cost of a no deal Brexit last month  when he said preparations by government and businesses could mitigate only some of the damage of a no deal Brexit A spokesman for Britain s finance ministry said the government wanted to leave the EU with a deal but was getting ready for a possible no deal Brexit The IMF downgraded its forecast for economic growth in Britain this year to 1 2 percent from a forecast of 1 5 percent it made three months ago  which would be the weakest since 2009 Growth for 2020 was seen picking up to 1 4 percent  but in both years Britain s economy was predicted to grow less than the euro zone  in contrast to before the 2016 Brexit referendum  The downward revisions     reflect the negative effect of prolonged uncertainty about the Brexit outcome  only partially offset by the positive impact from fiscal stimulus announced in the 2019 budget   the IMF said The BoE should take a  cautious  data dependent  approach to monetary policy  it added   Reporting by David Milliken  Editing by William Schomberg  

TRIPOLI BENGHAZI  Libya   A warplane attacked Tripoli s only functioning airport on Monday as eastern forces advancing on the Libyan capital disregarded international appeals for a truce in the latest

election to end rivalries between parallel administrations in the country s east and west The eastern Libyan National Army  LNA  forces of Khalifa Haftar   a former general in Gaddafi s army   said 19

took the oil rich south of Libya earlier this year before advancing fast through largely unpopulated desert regions toward Tripoli Seizing the capital  however  is a much bigger challenge  The LNA has conducted air strikes on the south of the city as it seeks to advance along a road from a disused former international airport Witnesses said on Monday afternoon the LNA had lost control of the old airport and withdrawn from positions on the airport road  Forces allied to the Tripoli administration were seen inside the airport  while clashes with the eastern forces were raging south of the airport  a Reuters reporter at the scene and residents said On Sunday evening  LNA forces had moved up from the airport  coming as close as 11 km  7 miles  from the city center before retreating

Dujarric said The violence has jeopardized a U N  plan for an April 14 16 conference to plan elections and end anarchy that has prevailed since the Western backed toppling of Gaddafi As well as the United Nations  the European Union  United States and G7 bloc have all urged a ceasefire  a halt to Haftar s advance and return to negotiations Haftar casts himself as a foe of extremism but is viewed

fungus called Candida auris  which can kill people with weakened immune systems  has appeared in countries around the world over the past five years  The U S  Centers for Disease Control and

KUALA LUMPUR   Oman will face a race against time to build a stadium large enough to satisfy FIFA requirements if football s governing body decides to expand the Qatar 2022 World Cup finals and asks the Sultanate to co host the enlarged tournament Oman Football Association president Salem Said Salem Al Wahaibi told Reuters that FIFA president Gianni Infantino has sounded out the country s government over their ability to co host the event should it be expanded from 32 to 48 teams But with Muscat s Sultan Qaboos Stadium falling short of minimum capacity requirements for the World Cup  the Omanis would need to overhaul their biggest stadium to be considered a viable host  Mr Infantino visited us and he gave a proposal to the government and they are still thinking about it   said Al Wahaibi on the sidelines of the Asian Football Confederation s congress on Saturday  They haven t come to a decision yet  but it s not a federation decision  We have some issues  We don t have a stadium for 40 000  so if we take it we will be working against time  That is the first enemy for us  There are so many issues and it won t be as easy as it looks  Our stadium  the maximum capacity we have is 29 000  so in two years can we get that  That s the question for the government  plus the other logistics  I m optimistic but let s see  Qatar was awarded the rights to host a 32 team World Cup in December 2010  but after becoming FIFA president in 2016 Infantino has been open to the idea of expanding the tournament to accommodate 16 additional teams The 2026 edition is already slated to feature 48 nations and Infantino is keen to bring forward the enlarged format by four years  Sharing a few games with a few of the neighbouring countries is  of course  an option as well to make it a true World Cup for the world and for the whole Gulf region   he said on Saturday  It s something to discuss  something to think about and something we are working on with Qatar and together with all of you and  of course  it would be a nice achievement if the first World Cup with 48 teams would be played in Asia  FIFA DECISIONA decision on the proposal to expand the World Cup is expected at the FIFA congress in Paris in June Qatar has said it will not take a decision on expanding the tournament until it sees the details of a feasibility study from FIFA The Omanis  meanwhile  believe hosting matches in 2022 would invigorate the sport in a country that has never qualified for the World Cup or accommodated a major football event  FIFA wanted the approval of the two countries   Kuwait and Oman   and then the congress will discuss if it goes from 32 to 48 and then we will see   said Al Wahaibi  But it would be marvellous and it would give us a boost and put Oman on the global map of football  It would be a gift to the young generation and not in my lifetime have we ever had this chance  it would be history for my country that Oman would host some games of the World Cup in 2022    Reporting by Michael Church  Editing by Christian Radnedge  

Across the decade that preceded Donald Trump s election  American politicians of both parties consistently tried to pass big  sweeping immigration bills that would legalize most of the country s illegal population and increase immigration overall  These bills failed because of populist opposition  at first bipartisan  the resistance of a certain socialist senator from Vermont helped doom the 2007 effort  but increasingly simply conservative  and over time the conservative opposition developed a well founded suspicion of Republican elites  whose plans on immigration always seemed to require ignoring their own base This sense of betrayal was fertile ground for Trump  who used bigotry and bluster to sell himself to immigration hawks as a Republican who wouldn t  indeed couldn t  sell them out  You could trust him more than the Bushes and Rubios because he was willing to be disreputable  willing to give the finger to elite opinion  willing to play not only the tough guy but the bad guy  And you had to trust him  some hawks argued  because the Democrats had been radicalized on the issue and the hour was late  it was either Trump or a Californian future  in which waves of immigration transformed the entire United States into a one party  Democratic governed state But the irony was that the populist resistance had already itself been reasonably effective in achieving some of the goals that Trump promised to pursue  Over the years when bipartisan elites were seeking the grail of  comprehensive  reform  they tried to appease skeptics with various forms of border security spending  and this spending really did gradually harden the United States Mexico border and make it much more difficult to simply slip across  Combine this with economic and demographic change in Latin America  and by the time Trump took office  border crossings had fallen by two thirds since the presidency of George W  Bush In this sense Trump was a lagging  not a leading  indicator  He represented the political triumph of an attitude that had already changed policy  albeit in piecemeal and only half intentionally  and partially sealed the porous borders of 15 years before  And his chief proposal  the famous wall  would have been a  literal  extension of the existing border security project rather than a radical addition  Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  This reality created an interesting opening  especially in Trump s first year  for a different kind of comprehensive deal  between restrictionists feeling a little more secure in their position and immigration advocates feeling chastened by populist backlash  And there was even some evidence that the White House might be groping in this direction   toward reforms that would seek stability more than radical change  tilting the entire system away from low skilled immigration and toward recruitment  and compromising between restrictionists and enthusiasts by trying to keep the overall immigration rate about the same But that possibility has evaporated because of the second irony of immigration in the Trump era  Having inherited a border situation that was somewhat better than his rhetoric of crisis suggested  Trump has now been handed an actual crisis   a wave of Central American families claiming asylum  which has returned monthly crossings to their highest levels in a decade and overwhelmed the system for handling new arrivals There is a sense in which this crisis vindicates immigration hawks  who warned from the late Obama era onward that the immigration decline wasn t necessarily permanent  that there could easily be another wave  that United States policy   particularly the Obama precedent of a tacit amnesty for child migrants   created specific incentives for families and children to come north But those same hawks ended up electing a president whose signature immigration policy  more walls to deter border crossers  has proved largely ineffective in dealing with an immigration crisis created by people surrendering to Border Patrol officers and asking for asylum Nor does that president have the capacity to devise a more effective response  it seems  since any policy solution would require two negotiations  First  negotiation with Congress  to change asylum law to override the court decisions currently tying up the Trump White House s attempts at deterrence   like the attempt to make Central American asylum petitioners wait out the process in Mexico  Second  negotiation with the Mexican government  to get more help discouraging migration on its side of the border  For a different president these tasks would be challenging  for Trump  they seem impossible Hence the flailing on display this week  with the president purging his entire Homeland Security apparatus  in the hopes of finding somebody with the requisite toughness to succeed where the present staff has failed  Since  toughness  apparently means one of two things   returning to the cruelty of child separation or ordering Border Patrol agents to simply ignore asylum law themselves   it s doubtful that this purge will produce anything except more unpopularity for Trump s policies  and more unsuccessful collisions with the courts The flailing also absolves the Democratic Party  currently torn between radicalism and evasion on immigration  from actually having to propose a coherent alternative to the White House s approach  If this sort of crisis were happening on President Hillary Clinton s watch  it would create all kinds of political problems for the Democrats  as it stands  they can point at the man who once boasted of Washington that  I alone can fix it  and say  well  why don t you There is still some political peril here for liberals  who may be inclined to confuse the public s distaste for Trump with a consensus for an open door  though that Vermont socialist is still willing to swat down calls for open borders   But the greater peril by far is for conservative immigration skeptics  for whom the Trump presidency is at risk of turning into a policy disaster The attempts to increase deportation have been real enough  but they will be evanescent should Trump lose in 2020  The attempt to legislate sustained legal immigration cuts has conspicuously failed  Someone in the administration is making deals behind the scenes to increase visas for low skilled guest workers   one of the policies that hawks resisted for years in  comprehensive  bills  And the longer the current border crisis goes on  the more this White House s most important legacy may be offering evidence that even Donald Trump  even Donald Trump  can t really stop illegal immigration when enough people get the idea to bring their kids and come For every conservative faction  supporting Trump was a gamble   do you reach for short term victory  even though his incompetence and unfitness might cost you in the long run  The danger for immigration hawks is that the long run has already arrived trump and immigrationTrump Says the U S  Is  Full   Much of the Nation Has the Opposite Problem

There s no reason to mourn Kirstjen Nielsen s departure from the Department of Homeland Security  She was an immigration hard liner working aggressively to carry out President Trump s restrictionist agenda  She spearheaded efforts to crack down on migrants and asylum seekers  She requested military assistance at the border  She limited the number of people who can legally present for asylum at ports of entry  And she vastly increased the number of immigrants in detention She also carried out the president s  zero tolerance  policy  resulting in the separation of thousands of families at our border with Mexico  Many parents are still searching for their children But there were limits to Nielsen s embrace of Trump s immigration policies  She pushed back on his demands to break the law to stop migrants from entering the country  according to The Times  and repeatedly reminded the president of  the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws  court settlements and international obligations  In almost any other administration  this would be unremarkable  It simply means Nielsen took her job and its legal obligations seriously   what we would expect from any civil servant  But Trump is unusual among modern presidents for his routine elevation of people who lack that basic sense of public ethics  If regular pressure to break the law was part of Nielsen s decision to leave the administration  then her departure illustrates how any belief in the public good  no matter how slight  is incompatible with working for this president  even if you share his views  Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing  culture and ideas from around the internet  For exclusive thoughts  photos and reading recommendations  sign up for his newsletter  This was evident from previous resignations and firings  Rex Tillerson  Trump s first secretary of state  seemed to share the president s skepticism of the department  carrying out an agenda meant to shrink its influence  But when Trump wanted to break the law   which  Tillerson said in an interview after leaving the administration  was  often    Tillerson would push back  unwilling to completely subordinate himself to the president s will   I would have to say to him   Mr  President  I understand what you want to do  but you can t do it that way  It violates the law   The president s first attorney general  Jeff Sessions  faced similar pressures after he recused himself from any investigations related to the prospect of Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election  Sessions took that step after The Washington Post revealed his meetings with the Russian ambassador  Sergey Kislyak  during the campaign   the kind of contact he had denied during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Trump was furious  which grew into rage after the deputy attorney general  Rod Rosenstein  appointed Robert Mueller special counsel  Trump reportedly berated Sessions in the Oval Office   which the attorney general called his  most humiliating experience in decades of public life    and complained that the recusal was  unfair  Trump wanted Sessions to derail the Russia investigation and protect him from scrutiny  essentially making himself above the law  And he spent much of 2018 pressuring the attorney general to do just that  either attacking him in public or cajoling him in private  Sessions  who shared Trump s politics but not his complete contempt for the rule of law  wouldn t budge   As long as I am the attorney general  I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor  and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution   he said in a February 2018 statement  This stalemate resolved itself after the midterm elections  when a frustrated and weakened Trump finally fired Sessions  replacing him temporarily with Matthew Whitaker  a loyalist who served as Sessions s chief of staff  and permanently with William Barr  who served as attorney general under George H W  Bush  shielding him from the fallout of the Iran contra scandal The overall pattern is clear  Trump wants to act with impunity  breaking the law if he needs or even just wants to  His appointees  who share his goals but not his methods  resist  He scolds and attacks them until they resign  replacing them with loyalists who may actually bend to his will Rex Tillerson was replaced by Mike Pompeo  then serving as director of the C I A  Unlike Tillerson  who attempted to contain Trump s worst instincts  Pompeo has been willing to say or do nearly anything to stay in Trump s favor  It s why he would echo the president s widely criticized flattery of Kim Jong un and the North Korean government Trump says that Kevin McAleenan  until now the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  will take over for Nielsen as acting secretary of Homeland Security  Like Nielsen  McAleenan backs the president s harsh border policies  He defended border patrol agents after they used tear gas on hundreds of migrants  including women and children  who tried to enter the United States near Tijuana  Mexico  Some attorneys say it s unclear if Trump can elevate McAleenan  since the laws regarding succession point to under secretary for management Claire Grady as next in line as acting director For a more permanent replacement  Trump is reportedly considering Ken Cuccinelli  the former Virginia attorney general turned conservative television personality  and Kris Kobach  the former Kansas secretary of state notorious for his aggressively anti immigrant policies With either choice  Trump would affirm the pattern of his administration so far  jettisoning people who act as if they were accountable to the public and replacing them with people who above all are loyal to Trump  willing to go in the  tougher    and possibly illegal   direction he demands on kirstjen

CANBERRA  Australia   New Zealand s official privacy watchdog on Monday described Facebook as  morally bankrupt  and suggested his country follow neighboring Australia s lead by making laws that could jail executives over streamed violence such as the Christchurch mosque shootings Privacy Commissioner John Edwards has been critical of Facebook s response to a gunman using the platform to livestream some of the slaughter of 50 worshippers and the wounding of 50 more at two mosques on March 15 Edwards made his comments after Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg recently rejected calls to introduce a delay in his livestreaming service Facebook Live  saying it would interfere with the interactivity of livestreaming  Facebook cannot be trusted  They are morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide  Myanmar   facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions   Edwards posted on Twitter Facebook has been criticized for not doing enough to police hate speech in Myanmar  where a government campaign against minority Rohinyga Muslims has been described by the UN as ethnic cleansing  The platform has also been at the center of claims that Russia meddled in the 2016 U S  presidential election Facebook responded to Edward s post with a statement that said its chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  had recently shared the policy and technical steps the company was taking to strengthen the rules for using Facebook Live  address hate on Facebook platforms and support the New Zealand community  We are deeply committed to strengthening our policies  improving our technology and working with experts to keep Facebook safe   the statement said Edwards  who is tasked with protecting New Zealanders  personal information according to the country s Privacy Act  said that governments needed to come together and  force the platforms to find a solution  to the problem of livestreaming of atrocities like the Christchurch slayings as well as suicides and rapes  It may be that regulating  as Australia has done just in the last week  would be a good interim way to get their attention and say   Unless you can demonstrate the safety of these services  you simply can t use them    Edwards told Radio NZ Edwards regards himself as an advocate for Christchurch victims who had their right to privacy violated by having their deaths broadcast via Facebook to the world in real time His office said the privacy commissioner had taken to making his criticism of Facebook about its lack of livestreaming safeguards public  because he has few other options   Under the current Privacy Act  his office has no penalties it can impose on global tech companies like Facebook   the commissioner s office said in a statement  His only resort is to publicly name Facebook for not ensuring its livestreaming service is a safe platform which does not compound the original harm caused by the Christchurch killings   the statement added The Australian Parliament on Thursday passed some of the most restrictive laws about online communication in the democratic world It is now a crime in Australia for social media platforms not to quickly remove  abhorrent violent material   The crime would be punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 10 5 million Australian dollars   7 5 million   or 10  of the platform s annual turnover  whichever is larger The Digital Industry Group Inc    an association representing the digital industry in Australia including Facebook  Google and Twitter   said taking down abhorrent content was a  highly complex problem  that required consultation with a range of experts  which the government had not done Australia wants to take its law to a Group of 20 countries forum in Japan as a template for holding social media companies to account New Zealand s Justice Minister Andrew Little said last week his government had also made a commitment to review the role of social media and the obligations of the companies that provide the platforms  He said he had asked officials to look at the effectiveness of current hate speech laws and whether there were gaps that need to be filled Facebook last year disregarded Edwards  ruling that it had breached the Privacy Act by not releasing information to a New Zealand man who wanted to know what others were saying about him on the social network Facebook argued that it was not bound by New Zealand s Privacy Act because it was based overseas  but later agreed to comply with the local law New Zealand s Parliament is amending the Act to give the privacy commissioner more powers and to clarify that offshore companies that hold information about New Zealanders must comply with the Act  

SRINAGAR   Most nights in recent weeks  journalist Asif Qureshi s phone vibrates with a message from a known number of Jaish e Mohammed  JeM   a Pakistan based militant group that killed 40 Indian paramilitary policemen in a suicide attack in Kashmir in February   Allah always keeps you in safety and security   They want to tell us that we are monitoring you   said Qureshi  the Kashmir bureau chief for Delhi based TV channel ABP News  He is one of the many journalists caught in the crossfire   metaphorically and literally   between the Indian government and militant groups fighting for India controlled Kashmir s independence  Both sides are making increasing attempts to control the flow of information  journalists say  after the conflict in Kashmir  a Muslim majority region claimed by both India and Pakistan  escalated dramatically over the past few months  India blames Pakistan for harboring JeM  a claim Islamabad denies  and both nuclear armed nations said they carried out air strikes and downed enemy jets after the suicide attack  to the alarm of world powers  The present situation is the most dangerous and difficult for journalists in decades  according to dozens of journalists in Kashmir Reuters spoke to in recent weeks  In the past two years  journalists in the scenic Himalayan valley have been threatened by militants  blinded by pellet guns fired by security forces  and murdered by unknown assailants  Many reporters say that self censorship is often the only option to keep working safely in the region  We have become a punching bag for both sides   Qureshi said  LOCAL PRESSURESrinagar s Press Enclave  where many newspapers and TV channels have offices  has been under armed guard since Shujaat Bukhari  the editor of several newspapers and a high profile moderate in Kashmir  was shot dead outside his office by unknown gunmen in June 2018  No one has been charged in connection with the crime  The physical danger they face is a major reason why India is one of the worst places in the world to be a journalist  according to international monitor Reporters Without Borders  that currently ranks it 138th out of 180 countries on its press freedom index  Local newspapers  that rely overwhelmingly on government advertisements for revenue  are also facing increasing financial pressure Last month  the government stopped advertising in two of the largest newspapers  Greater Kashmir and Kashmir Reader  to protests from the Kashmir Editors  Guild   We have written to the government of India for a reason  but so far they have not provided it   said Sajjad Ansari  the vice president of the Guild and editor of the Kashmir Observer  another leading newspaper   Editors assume it is because the papers carried stories on human rights and other material critical of the authorities  On March 10  fifteen newspapers  making up 95 percent of all sales in Kashmir  carried blank front pages in protest at the advertising decision It has had little effect  On April 2  the government pulled advertising from a third paper  Kashmir Uzma  according to the Guild  Gulzar Ahmed Shabnam  the director of information for Jammu   Kashmir state  declined to comment on the withdrawal of advertising   I don t think the independent voice can survive here   said Morifat Qadri  the editor of Aafaq  an Urdu language newspaper  of the situation in Kashmir   An editor either has to surrender or leave this job  NATIONAL TENSIONReporters working for national outlets like Qureshi say they are facing renewed hostility from local people  who are often sympathetic to separatist groups and resent the Indian media s increasingly nationalist stance India goes to the polls on a rolling basis from April 11 to May 19 in a general election that is being dominated by the tensions with Pakistan  to the benefit of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  pollsters say  Everybody knows the  national  media is slanted toward the establishment right now   Qureshi said   Right now you have to watch your back  Qureshi said locals often become aggressive when they saw the ABP News badge on his equipment  recognizing it as a national outlet  His cameraman  Arshad Hussein Shah  said he has been injured more times than he can count by security forces  often in scuffles involving batons and rifle butts But injuries can sometimes be more serious  In 2016  freelance photographer Zohaib Butt was covering a clash between protesters and security forces  A policeman came toward him  Butt showed the man his cameras  but he raised a shotgun loaded with metal pellets  and fired in his direction from less than 20 meters away  The photographer sustained severe eye injuries   For the first five seconds I was shouting like a dog   Butt said   It was like looking at a broken mirror  Butt is one of several journalists injured over the last two years by pellet guns used by the security forces  In January  four were hit in a similar incident  Sometimes the authorities go beyond their powers and I will be investigating these cases   said Shabnam  who became the state s director of information in February  A spokesman for Kashmir s police force declined to comment on Butt s case  and on injuries to journalists generally  After multiple rounds of surgery  Butt is still partially blind  unable to work as a photojournalist  The man who shot him has never been identified  Hundreds of metal pellets are still lodged under his skin  and he struggles with depression   Every day I relive those five seconds of my life  Sometimes when I am taking a shower I cover my eyes and think why didn t I do it at the time   he said   I trusted the cop that he wouldn t shoot    Reporting by Alasdair Pal and Fayaz Bukhari  Editing by Martin Howell and Raju Gopalakrishnan

TREVISO  Italy   Matteo Salvini  the anti immigrant politician who is the most powerful figure in Italy s government  on Monday announced the formation of a new European alliance of populist and far right parties ahead of critical European Parliament elections in May  Others will join between now and the 26th of May   the last day of voting  Mr  Salvini  leader of the League party in Italy  said at an event in Milan with allies from Denmark  Finland and Germany   Our objective is to be the force of government and change in Europe  The elections in May have become a rallying point for European populist parties  once relegated to the margins  to seize their building momentum and expand their power across the continent Marine Le Pen  the leader of France s far right National Gathering party  did not attend the announcement on Monday  though she has signaled her support for the new group But it is still unclear how populous the new populist alliance will be Noticeably absent from the event were some political figures who would appear to have an affinity with the project  like Hungary s prime minister  Viktor Orban  Mr  Orban s Fidesz party still belongs to the European People s Party group  the alliance of center right parties that leads the 28 nation European Parliament Under a sign that read  in four languages   Towards a Common Sense Europe  People Rise Up   Mr  Salvini maintained that he was a stand in for his Austrian  Belgian  French and other potential partners  because it would have been unwieldy to have a news conference with so many people  And he said that the full strength of the alliance would be demonstrated on May 18 during a large event in the Piazza Duomo in Milan  We are working for a big party for the new Europe   said Mr  Salvini  Italy s deputy prime minister and interior minister  whose efforts overlap with those of Steve Bannon  the former strategist for President Trump ImageViktor Orban  the Hungarian prime minister  has not yet allied his far right Fidesz party with Mr  Salvini s coalition CreditPool photo by Julien WarnandJrg Meuthen  a leader of the far right Alternative for Germany party  or AfD  said at the news conference that there were absent partners  who will join us soon   Immediately after the elections in May  he said  the allied parties will form a new group in the European Parliament called the European Alliance of Peoples and Nations  the result of numerous meetings over recent months Olli Kotro  a member of the Finns Party who attended the event  was more cautious  saying   It remains to be seen who will join us  While they share common ground when it comes to strong borders against migration and an emphasis on traditional  national identities  Europe s far right populists also disagree on many points of policy  Mr  Salvini s German and Scandinavian partners lean toward free market economics  while their French allies are more protectionist Mr  Salvini has argued repeatedly that other European Union members must take their fair share of migrants  but some countries  like Hungary  have slammed the door shut  And Poland does not share the warmth that Mr  Salvini and other populists have toward Russia On Monday  Mr  Salvini rejected the suggestion that he and his allies were extremists and said they all had a  clear memory of what happened in the past  but the tired debate of left and right  fascists  communists  that s not what we are passionate about or what 500 million European citizens are passionate about  The debate on the past we will leave to the historians  For Mr  Salvini  the European elections could affect his standing at home  as well as across the continent  A strong showing in May would help him consolidate power in Italy s governing coalition  where he is technically a junior partner to the anti establishment Five Star Movement  which has hemorrhaged support since the election in March 2018 But his Italian allies are less than pleased with his international project On Monday  Mr  Salvini s struggling coalition partner  Luigi Di Maio  the Five Star leader  wrote an open letter to Corriere della Sera  Italy s leading newspaper  arguing that ahead of the European elections in May he found it  paradoxical  that Mr  Salvini was seeking a formal alliance  with those countries who refuse to accept the redistribution of migrants who arrive in Italy  He added   It would be nonsense to complain to the European Union that they don t accept the quotas and then hold close to parties from the same countries  I m thinking of Orban  that are the cause of our emergency  Countries that snub us  violate the laws and lack respect for Italy and the Italians  ImageLuigi Di Maio  the leader of the Five Star party in Italy  has been critical of Mr  Salvini s efforts to form a Europe wide populist coalition CreditAlessandro Di Meo EPA  via ShutterstockAsked about those comments  Mr  Salvini said  with all due respect for the sensibilities of whoever  we have a big plan   I don t comment on what my government allies do   he said  before doing precisely that  reminding reporters of Mr  Di Maio s attempts to form an alliance with the Yellow Vest movement in France  damaging relations with the French government When Mr  Di Maio  goes to Paris and meets someone who then puts in difficulty the Italian government  I don t comment   Mr  Salvini said  He then noted that while Mr  Di Maio now criticized the League s alliance with the AfD   in the past years  the path of Five Star was with our friends in AfD  For now  Mr  Salvini said  his goal is for the aligned parties to win as many votes as possible and take control of the machinery of the European Parliament  He elided questions about whether he or Ms  Le Pen would be the leader of the new group  Today there is no personal ambition  at least for me   he said  A moment later  though  he added  that as an Italian he was proud that  this departs from Italy  this dream  this project  this vision  this future  departs from Milan and Rome  Those present seemed to prefer Mr  Salvini  who has refused to allow ships carrying migrants from Africa and the Middle East to dock in Italy Mr  Meuthen talked about how  when it came to enforcing borders and sending migrants back from whence they came   Matteo Salvini and the League are the exemplars from this point of view  Anders Vistisen of Denmark s Dansk Folkeparti  said that while Mr  Salvini had not asked for any such support  he would make a superb president of the European Commission  

My mother is a devout Democrat  but also one of the most socially conservative people I know  This is typical of our home state of Louisiana among black citizens   they can be as conservative as any Republican  but are also completely convinced  by dint of history and experience  that the Republican Party not only abides racists  it courts them  and therefore they would die rather than vote red My mother is so austere that she never drank or partied in any way  except for the one time she told me that she went to a nightclub and tried a drink  She didn t much like the dingy space or the bitter beverage  so she swore them both off She abhorred the showy  deeming it vulgar  so every single article of clothing in her closet was white  black  brown or navy blue  Red  Yellow  Green  God forbid And she was unshakable in her sense of moral rectitude  viewing sins like lying  gambling and philandering as absolute corruptions of character And yet  through my time growing up there and going to college there  she took a devilish pride in enthusiastically supporting and voting for the four term Democratic governor  Edwin Edwards  a cocksure  gambling womanizer who would end up in federal prison in 2002 for bribery and extortion On the surface  it doesn t make sense that my mother  who thought herself a moralist  would find a champion in a flaunting immoralist  but she did as did many other Louisiana voters  And I believe this was possible because Edwards achieved something that few politicians achieve  He transcended the political  and on some level even the rules of the workaday world  and entered the astral league of folk heroes The rules don t apply to the folk hero  People don t measure them by the same tape  Behavior that people would never condone in their personal lives  they relish in the folk hero I believe that the great miscalculation people make in trying to understand Donald Trump and the cultlike devotion of the people who follow him is that they continue to apply the standard rules of analysis  I believe that  like Edwards  Trump ascended to folk hero status among the people who like him  and so his lying  corruption  sexism and grift not only do no damage  they add to his legend The folk hero  whether real or imaginary  often fights the establishment  often in devious  destructive and even deadly ways  and those outside that establishment cheer as the folk hero brings the beast to its knees The only vulnerability the folk hero has is an exposed betrayal of the folk  Trump fawns over his base  and they reciprocate Edwards once joked on the eve of one of his elections   The only way I can lose this election is if I m caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy   He won  of course  This is not wholly unlike Trump joking   bragging    that  I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn t lose any voters  O K    He won  of course I think it is a mistake to believe that Trump s supporters don t see his lying or corruption  They do  But  to them  it is all part of the show and the lore  They have personal relationships and work relationships like the rest of us  and those relationships depend on honesty and virtue  They  like my mother did  are allowing in him something that they would not allow in themselves And  when you survey the constellation of folk heroes  you see that many have been criminals  Bonnie and Clyde  John Dillinger  The Sundance Kid I would also argue that some other recent troubled  corrupt or corrosive politicians came close to the definition without receiving the designation  The former Washington  D C   mayor  Marion Barry  The former Toronto mayor  Rob Ford  The former Maine governor  Paul LePage And this elastic morality around the folk hero appears to be a global human inclination  El Chapo  who  as CNN pointed out   Claimed in 2014 that he has killed 2 000 3 000 people   was a folk hero in Mexico Like Edwards and Bonnie and Clyde and El Chapo  Trump s Br er Rabbit like ability to avert the best attempt by authorities to hold him accountable  at least for a while  only increases the chorus of applause Perhaps one of the most popular folk heroes in the world is mythological  Chinese folklore s Monkey King The British Council wrote of his legend  Despite his superpowers  at the heart of the Monkey King s appeal is his human fallibility   he is greedy  selfish  and prone to sudden changes of mood and outbursts of exceptional violence  He defies divine authority  laughs at attempts to be controlled  and leaves chaos in his wake  But we know that there is fundamental good within him  He is the misbehaving child who only needs a firm hand and a sense of purpose to come good  Sound familiar Anti Trump forces must stop operating as if they are doing battle with a liar  they are doing battle with what his supporters have fashioned into a legend  How does one fight a fiction  a fantasy  That s the question  Its answer is the path to America s salvation The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some

MEXICO CITY   If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal it could have  very significant  costs for some parts of the British economy  Roberto Azevedo  Director General of the World Trade Organisation  WTO   said on Thursday The British government is scrambling to find parliamentary consensus over the terms of its departure from the European Union ahead of an April 12 deadline  prompting warnings from some officials that the risk of a no deal exit is increasing Azevedo said in Mexico City that economists were best placed to estimate the potential impact of a no deal Brexit  which would leave the British economy trading on WTO rules  But I would say there will be costs  and the costs may be very significant in some sectors  and maybe less significant in other sectors  But overall  there will be an impact  we all know that   he told Reuters in an interview Separately  Azevedo sounded a note of caution on ongoing efforts to resolve a dispute over the future of the WTO s Appellate Body  the top court of global trade Washington has long argued that WTO judges have routinely broken with procedures and exceeded their mandates  and in a bid to force reforms  the U S  government has blocked the appointment of judges to the Appellate Body If continued  the tactic could render the body inoperable by December  when terms end for two of the remaining three judges  Under WTO rules  three judges are required to hear appeals Azevedo said WTO member states were seeking to find a way around the impasse  noting that it was chiefly a U S  concern  The truth is that it s difficult to know if we re advancing or not   he said   because the Americans haven t been contributing in a very active way to these discussions    Reporting by Dave Graham  Editing by Shri Navaratnam

LONDON BRUSSELS   Britain s opposition Labour Party said on Friday that talks with the government on a last ditch Brexit deal had made no progress  as EU leaders said Prime Minister Theresa May had not convinced them that they should let Britain delay its departure next week May wrote to Brussels asking European Union leaders to postpone Britain s exit from next Friday until June 30  But they have insisted that she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her divorce deal in the deadlocked parliament Labour  which she turned to reluctantly after failing three times to get her deal passed  said the government  has not offered real change or compromise  in three days of talks  We urge the prime minister to come forward with genuine changes to her deal   a statement said Labour Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said his party wanted the talks to go on  and a spokesman for May s office said the government had  made serious proposals  in the talks and wanted them to continue over the weekend  in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides  May badly needs evidence of a viable divorce strategy to persuade the other 27 EU leaders at a summit next Wednesday to grant a delay  preferably on her preferred departure date Any extension would require unanimous approval from the other EU countries  all weary of Britain s Brexit indecision  and could come with conditions  If we are not able to understand the reason why the UK is asking for an extension  we cannot give a positive answer   said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire  German Justice Minister Katarina Barley tweeted   This playing for time must end  Deep divisions in May s Conservative Party and government  and in Labour  have led to a marathon of votes in parliament  in which scenarios ranging from abandoning the EU with no transition period to cancelling Brexit have all been defeated Last Friday  May did the unthinkable by asking Labour to negotiate with her on a deal that might work for both   although some in Labour said she was luring the party into sharing responsibility for her failure LETTER TO BRUSSELSHoping this would satisfy EU leaders  May wrote to EU summit chair Donald Tusk proposing a delay until June 30 at the latest  accepting that Britain might have to hold European Parliament elections on May 23  which she had hoped to avoid  The government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May  2019  and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections  but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible   the letter said So far  there has been little appetite in Brussels for an extension that could create another cliff edge in three months  May asked two weeks ago for a delay until June 30  only to be turned down Tusk is planning to propose an extension of a year  which could also be shortened if Britain ratifies the withdrawal agreement  senior EU officials said  The only reasonable way out would be a long but flexible extension  I would call it a  flextension    one official said  It seems to be a good scenario for both sides  as it gives the UK all the necessary flexibility  while avoiding the need to meet every few weeks to further discuss Brexit extensions  But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said May s letter raised questions  adding   We hope for more clarity from London before next Wednesday  And France  which wants the EU to move on to other business including reforms proposed by President Emmanuel Macron  indicated it was not ready to accept any delay without a clear plan  If we are not able to understand the reason why the UK is asking for an extension  we cannot

neighboring Ireland say would cause huge disruption Germany  as one of those with most to lose from a sudden dislocation of trade  has been one of those most tolerant of Britain s turmoil Justice Minister Barley tweeted that  there can only be an extension with a clear direction   but also proposed a potential way out by adding   This includes the question of a second referendum  The idea of asking Britons   who voted by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU three years ago   to confirm or reject any divorce deal has been gaining ground in Britain Yet May herself and many lawmakers in both main parties are strongly opposed  saying it would betray voters and undermine democracy  especially if it offered an option to stay in the EU Both main parties made commitments after the referendum to deliver Brexit  but they never settled on a plan for how to leave or what future relationship to seek May long insisted that her plan   quitting all EU institutions  with a 21 month standstill period to negotiate a bespoke free trade deal   was the only viable one  But it still split her cabinet and infuriated the most eurosceptic of her Conservatives Labour wants closer ties than May has

AMHERST  N H    In the cozy confines of a rather stately New Hampshire home  Senator Cory Booker on Saturday offered a detailed outline of his proposal to address growing income equality with  baby bonds   a government run savings program for children Speaking to a crowded living room  Mr  Booker of New Jersey wrapped his proposal in familiar campaign themes of appealing to the country s higher morals  and tucked it in after 20 minutes of his more traditional stump speech But the in depth policy discussion  aided by the rare presence of a note card in Mr  Booker s hand  reflected an increased focus on policy specifics in his campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination  Up to now  Mr  Booker s campaign has focused largely on sweeping upbeat oratory and calls for unity to salve the country s growing political divisions He hinted at such a shift in a speech to the National Action Network in New York on Friday  telling the crowd   Not just sentiments  I m fighting to deliver substance  At his Saturday event here in the home of a local state senator  Mr  Booker delivered a broad lesson in economic policy and the racial wealth gap  When a child is born in America  and they become 18 years old  their ZIP code and their family income is a powerful determinant of their destiny   Mr  Booker said  as he cited statewide birthrate statistics and how they would be affected by his proposal  reading from an index card   We would actually take our stratifications of wealth in this country and begin to give people in the lower rung the ability to create wealth and grow  Mr  Booker was introducing the audience to what is becoming a central component of his emerging platform  an economic proposal known as baby bonds that would create a government run savings account for every child born in the United States  The program is designed to aggressively address the nation s growing wealth gap  and the government s contributions would increase based on a family s economic standing Though Mr  Booker introduced his baby bond proposal last year in the Senate  and has made passing reference to it in his stump speeches and town halls since  it had not yet played a central role While other campaigns have enjoyed early surges  Mr  Booker has largely trod an under the radar  workman s path of reaching out to voters  One of the most prolific travelers in the crowded Democratic field  having visited at least 28 communities in March alone  Mr  Booker has attracted packed rooms at most events  But he has not had any breakthrough moments or introduced meaty policy proposals that have helped propel other candidates at least temporarily into the spotlight In choosing to focus on his baby bonds proposal  Mr  Booker is seizing on an issue that has come to define the early primary race  inequality of wealth and income  While many other candidates paint broad agendas to combat the growing wealth gap  such as calls for  Medicare for all   Mr  Booker s baby bonds proposal is among the most complex and specific offered by a presidential candidate On the campaign trail  Mr  Booker touts a Columbia University study from January that concluded that baby bonds  would dramatically reduce racial wealth inequality  A broad rewriting of the social contract  Mr  Booker s proposal calls for every child born in the United States to be given a  1 000 bonded savings account that is run through the Treasury Department  Each year  the federal government would contribute to the account on a tiered basis  those who come from a family of four making less than  25 100 a year would be given  2 000  The contributions would be lowered as families move up the income ladder  and any family of four making more than  125 751 would receive no contributions The proposal estimates that children from the nation s poorest families would receive roughly  46 000 when they turned 18  But the money would carry restrictions  it could only be spent on  wealth building  transactions like paying for college  buying a home or starting a small business Mr  Booker s office estimates that the program would carry an annual price tag of about  60 billion  and would be paid for by restoring the estate tax rate to its 2009 levels  closing loopholes in the capital gains tax  and adding a surtax rate for estates worth at least  10 million and at least  50 million But just before Mr  Booker was about to delve into the more intricate details of his baby bonds proposal  he was interrupted by one of the home s residents   Sadie  a golden lab  What are your questions   he said  pausing his remarks to rub the dog behind the ears   I am the leader in the Senate on animal issues

PARIS   President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Sunday that he wanted to create a national day of commemoration for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda  which has been a longstanding source of tension between the two countries Mr  Macron said in a statement that he wanted to create a national day of remembrance on April 7  the date 25 years ago that Rwanda s Hutu majority began systematically massacring members of the Tutsi minority  leaving an estimated 800 000 to one million people dead  On this day of commemoration for the 25th anniversary of the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda  the president of the republic expresses his solidarity with the Rwandan people and his compassion for the victims and their families   the statement said Rwanda  led by President Paul Kagame  has long accused France of complicity in the genocide and of helping some of the perpetrators escape  poisoning ties between the two countries  even though relations have warmed since Mr  Macron s election in 2017 France has been accused of providing weapons and military training to the Hutu dominated government in the years that led up to the genocide  and of failing to prevent or even supporting the massacres when they started  despite the presence of French peacekeeping soldiers Ibuka France  a group that advocates remembrance of the genocide  praised Mr  Macron s announcement  Marcel Kabanda  the head of the group  told Agence France Presse that Ibuka France had suggested the idea in a meeting with Mr  Macron on Friday ImagePresident Emmanuel Macron of France and Paul Kagame  president of Rwanda  meeting at the lyse Palace in Paris last year CreditFrancois Mori Associated PressMr  Macron did not say what the day of commemoration would entail or how he would create it  He could proceed by decree  or have his government present a bill in Parliament  where his party has a majority in the more powerful lower house France has admitted mistakes in how it handled the killings but has always denied the accusations of complicity  After meeting with survivors and members of Ibuka France on Friday  Mr  Macron ordered a two year government study of France s role in the genocide The study will be led by a commission of eight historians and researchers  They will have access to official French archives covering the period between 1990 and 1994 in order to  analyze the role and involvement of France  during the massacres and to help shape French school curriculums  Mr  Macron said In Rwanda  a week of commemorations started on Sunday  as did 100 days of mourning for victims of the genocide  Mr  Kagame laid a wreath and lit a flame at the Gisozi memorial site in Kigali  the capital  Over 250 000 people are believed to be buried at the site A remembrance walk was scheduled to go from the Rwandan Parliament building to the national soccer stadium  Several heads of state were expected to attend  but not Mr  Macron  who sent Herv Berville  a member of France s Parliament and survivor of the Rwandan genocide  as his representative Mr  Berville  29  was evacuated by the French Army at the age of 4 and adopted by a couple in Brittany  He was part of the wave of first time politicians elected to the lower house of Parliament in 2017 for Mr  Macron s party  It is both a source of pride and a great responsibility to go there to represent France   Mr  Berville told RFI radio on Tuesday Mr  Macron also announced last week that more resources would be granted to the French judicial authorities who are working to identify and prosecute those suspected of perpetrating the genocide  some of whom fled to France after the violence ended  

Businesses in Britain came under criticism this week as a new report showed that the gap between salaries for men and women had widened at about 40 percent of the companies that reported  and that the majority of employers were still paying men more than women  The report was a disappointment for some advocates of a 2017 regulation that required companies with at least 250 employees to report to the government the difference between average salaries and bonuses for male and female staff  A number of countries  including Australia and Germany  have started requiring companies to report their gender pay gaps in recent years  Proponents argue that transparency can lead to improvement  The first year s figures were often accompanied by promises and plans to reduce the gap  But the second year s numbers  reported by Friday  showed that not all companies had been shamed into action  Although the pay gap narrowed slightly over all in Britain  the slow pace of change and the regression at some workplaces have prompted calls for companies to be clearer about how they intend to do better   In some cases  employers will have a wider gap because they have taken on new female junior staff to build their pipeline   said Sam Smethers  the chief executive of the Fawcett Society  a women s rights and equality organization   But unless they can demonstrate that  it is more likely that they ve failed to make changes   The penalties for companies that do not set out a long term strategy and follow through should be tougher  Ms  Smethers said   Government needs to require employers to publish action plans that we can hold them accountable to  with meaningful sanctions in place for those who do not comply   she said  That idea has received some backing in Parliament   We need to start taking the next steps and ensuring that companies have action plans that are part of the reporting procedures  and that if they do not try to close their gender pay gap that they face additional fines   Dawn Butler  the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities for the opposition Labour Party  said in the House of Commons on Wednesday  The Equalities and Human Rights Commission in Britain is responsible for enforcing the reporting of gender pay gap statistics  but has no say over what businesses do to improve those statistics  It said on Friday that about 440 companies had not met the reporting deadline   We will be taking enforcement action against all organizations that have not filed by the deadline  requiring them to report immediately   Rebecca Hilsenrath  the commission s chief executive  said in a statement The organization has joined the calls for mandatory publication of action plans   Unfortunately  despite the scrutiny provided by reporting  our research has shown that very few employers have so far committed to specific measures to reduce their gaps and to set deadlines for making progress   Ms  Hilsenrath wrote in a blog post in March  About half of the roughly 10 500 employers that reported have outlined how they will tackle their pay gap  according to the Government Equalities Office  The office added that the government wanted more companies to put plans in place   We recognize that in order to close the gap entirely  we still need a much wider cultural change   Penny Mordaunt  the minister for women and equalities  said in a statement  The gender pay gap for Britain as a whole   the difference between median hourly pay for men and women   edged down to 17 9 percent from 18 4 percent the year before  according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics in October  The budget airline EasyJet had one of the wider gender pay gaps last year  at 45 5 percent  After scrutiny of these numbers  the company s chief executive  Johan Lundgren  took a pay cut so that he would earn the same as his immediate predecessor  Carolyn McCall  But the gap widened further in the airline s latest report  showing that median pay was 47 9 percent higher for men than for women  The airline blamed gender imbalance among pilots and the hiring of more women for cabin crews   Improving the gender balance in the pilot community is a real focus for us  and I believe no other airline is doing more on this issue   Mr  Lundgren said in a recent statement   As this is a structural issue  we know it will take some years for our gender pay gap to materially improve  but we are absolutely focused on improving it in the coming years   The lack of change at some companies has prompted calls for companies to put more women in senior positions  The fundamental cause of the problem is the lack of women in senior roles   Suki Sandhu  the chief executive of Involve  an organization focused on diversity  said in a statement   We need to be championing women in senior positions  showcasing fantastic role models for future generations  and ensuring that women feel they belong in leadership positions  More on

HAVANA   Cuba says a paper shortage is forcing it to cut back on pages and circulation at several state run newspapers including the Communist Party daily Granma  highlighting the severity of the country s cash crunch as scarcity of basic goods increases  The Communist government said on Thursday that it was halving the edition size of some weeklies as well as Granma on certain days due to the lack of newsprint  which it imports  It will also no longer publish the Union of Young Communists  newspaper  Juventud Rebelde  on Saturdays It was the first time Cuba had taken such a measure since the 1990s depression spawned by the fall of former ally the Soviet Union  It comes as Cubans are having to queue sometimes for hours for basics such as eggs and flour whenever they appear on store shelves Last year s introduction of mobile internet and a state app called  Donde Hay    Where there is   have to some extent multiplied the mayhem as they have made it easier for Cubans to find out in real time when new stock has arrived  There s nothing at the moment  and when they finally put something in the shops there are huge queues and you have to fight for it   said Niurka Fontana  33  a Havana resident who works at an ice cream parlor   Every day it s worse  While Cubans have long faced sporadic shortages of particular items due to external shocks to the state run economy and often dysfunctional central planning  widespread scarcity of some basic goods has picked up over the past few months First it was medicine and then flour  then vegetable oil and now eggs and meat  I ve had this prescription for renal antibiotics on me for two months now  but you can t find them anywhere   said pensioner Georgie Pi The shortages have pushed up prices of some goods on the black market that not all Cubans can afford given the average state salary is around  30 per month The government has acknowledged that some shortages  like medicines  are due to a lack of imports of goods necessary for production Cuba announced austerity measures three years ago due to lower exports and liquidity problems as aid from key ally Venezuela shrank amid its own economic crisis It has since also had to contend with a tightening of the decades old U S  trade embargo under President Donald Trump and the end of medical services exports to Brazil following the election of far right Jair Bolsonaro as president It faces another threat to its exports of doctors and nurses as protests roil old friend Algeria President Miguel Diaz Canel told the National Assembly in December that the government would be increasing austerity this year The Economy Minister Alejandro Gil Fernandez said last month that egg production had recently been affected by problems with the importation of avian feed  Cuba would import more of certain basic goods in upcoming months and take measures to avoid hoarding  he added Many state run shops are already rationing sales  creating a new headache for private eateries that do not have access to wholesale markets Most Cubans say they are used to shortages  although some fear they will only get worse  If there is a crisis in Venezuela  it affects us directly   said state worker Carlos Perez  51   Reporting by Sarah Marsh  Additional Reporting by Nelson Acosta  Editing by Daniel Wallis

WASHINGTON   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers on Tuesday that White House lawyers had been in touch with his department about a congressional request for President Trump s tax returns but said he had not personally spoken to Mr  Trump or those lawyers about how the matter was being handled Mr  Mnuchin s disclosure is the first public acknowledgment of communication between the White House and the Treasury Department related to Mr  Trump s tax returns  It comes as the president has made clear he has no intention of handing over his personal financial records without a fight Mr  Mnuchin  in testimony on Tuesday before two congressional committees  acknowledged that White House lawyers had been in touch with his department before the formal request was made last week  But he said that he had not been briefed on those discussions and described them as  informational   Our legal department has had conversations prior to receiving the letter with the White House general counsel   Mr  Mnuchin said   I acknowledge there were conversations  I am not briefed on the full extent of those conversations  During a marathon set of hearings that lasted more than four hours  Mr  Mnuchin parried multiple questions about how he would handle a request for the president s taxes  Mr  Mnuchin both defended Mr  Trump s right to keep his tax returns private and tried to assure lawmakers that he would not allow politics to interfere with Treasury s decision about whether to provide the records to Congress  Democrats appeared largely unsatisfied  at one point questioning Mr  Mnuchin about whether he was putting his job security before his legal obligations  It is our intent to follow the law   Mr  Mnuchin said   It is being reviewed by the legal departments and we look forward to responding to the letter   I am not afraid of being fired at all   he added Still  Mr  Mnuchin suggested he believed that Congress was overreaching its authority and defended Mr  Trump s right not to release his tax returns  The general public when they elected President Trump made the decision to elect him without his tax returns being released   Mr  Mnuchin said  adding that the president complied with requirements to release a financial disclosure form Mr  Mnuchin said it would be  premature  to comment on how his agency would respond to the formal request by House Democrats for six years of Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns The request for Mr  Trump s tax returns is putting Mr  Mnuchin  one of his most loyal aides  at the center of what is shaping up to be an extraordinary legal battle between two branches of government A decision on whether to hand over the financial records is expected to fall to the Internal Revenue Service and Mr  Mnuchin  whose Treasury Department oversees the tax collection agency  While Mr  Mnuchin has been fairly cautious in discussing the request  Mr  Trump and his top advisers have made it increasingly clear that they will not allow the president s tax returns to be released without a fight On Friday  Mr  Trump s personal lawyer asserted Mr  Trump s right as a citizen to keep his tax returns private and told the Treasury Department not to hand the returns over to House Democrats Mr  Mnuchin said that he believed it was  appropriate  for the Treasury and White House legal departments to have spoken generally about a potential request  but he emphasized that he would not be taking direction from the president on the decision  We would not ever ask for the White House s permission on this  nor did they give us permission   Mr  Mnuchin said His statement that the White House had reached out to Treasury about the congressional request sent Democratic aides scrambling to assess whether those conversations represented political interference and violated the law But Lawrence B  Gibbs  a former I R S  commissioner and counsel during the Nixon administration  said he was aware of no legal statute that prohibited such dialogue Mr  Mnuchin s turn in the spotlight comes at a delicate moment for him  One of the longest serving members of the president s cabinet  he has been dogged in recent weeks by questions over his financial ties to the film industry  as well as questions surrounding the Treasury Department s removal of sanctions against three companies controlled by an influential Russian oligarch  Mr  Mnuchin has also been at the center of Mr  Trump s growing frustration with the Federal Reserve  which he publicly blames for slowing American economic growth  Mr  Trump has aimed much of his criticism at the Fed chairman  Jerome H  Powell  whom the president installed to the top job on the recommendation of Mr  Mnuchin VideoRepresentative Maxine Waters and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had a tense exchange during testimony on Tuesday before two congressional committees  As the hearing went into the evening  Mr  Mnuchin said he needed to attend a meeting with an official from Bahrain CreditCreditZach Gibson Getty ImagesMr  Mnuchin s handling of the matter will be watched closely by Mr  Trump  who has kept his tax returns closely guarded despite promises as a candidate to eventually release them  Democrats are using a little noticed provision of the tax code to request the documents  and the Trump administration has asserted that those efforts are outside the bounds of congressional authority and that the request is nothing more than political harassment  Last week  Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  who leads the House Ways and Means Committee  requested that the I R S  hand over six years of Mr  Trump s tax returns  The Democrats will never be satisfied  no matter what they get  how much they get  or how many pages they get   Mr  Trump said on Monday in a Twitter post   It will never end  but that s the way life goes  Mick Mulvaney  the president s acting chief of staff  said over the weekend that Democrats would  never  obtain the president s taxes and called their efforts  a political hit job  Mr  Mnuchin suggested that an attempt to obtain tax returns for political purposes could ultimately harm both parties and give lawmakers discretion to obtain financial records of political enemies  Mr  Mnuchin noted that Representative Kevin Brady of Texas  who was the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means committee during the Obama administration  did not make such requests  I am sure there are many prominent Democrats who are relieved that when Kevin Brady was chairman of the committee that he didn t request specific returns   Mr  Mnuchin said As Mr  Mnuchin s second hearing of the day drifted past 5 p m   he erupted in frustration at Representative Maxine Waters  who oversees the House Financial Services Committee  saying he needed to go so he could attend a meeting with an official from Bahrain When Ms  Waters refused to conclude the hearing and said he could leave if he wished  Mr  Mnuchin advised her to use her gavel and dismiss him  If you wish to keep me here so that I don t have my important meeting and continue to grill me  then we can do that   Mr  Mnuchin said   I will cancel my meeting and I will not be back here  I will be very clear  if that s the way you would like to have this relationship  Mr  Mnuchin and the I R S  have until the end of Wednesday to comply with Mr  Neal s request  based on a deadline the lawmaker outlined last week  What comes next depends on their answer  The Treasury secretary told reporters after the hearing that it would be a  good guess  that his department would respond to the request by the deadline If the I R S  complies  Mr  Neal is unlikely to immediately say anything else to the public  If the agency objects to the request or does not answer  Mr  Neal could press his case and warn the agency that House Democrats will view not handing over the documents as a violation of the law At that point  Mr  Neal is likely to turn to the courts to try to enforce his request  teeing off a legal battle that could take months or years to sort out and could wind up at the Supreme Court Charles Rettig  the I R S  commissioner  under questioning by Democrats in another House hearing room  did his best to avoid divulging internal deliberations over Mr  Neal s request  but said that he and the I R S  general counsel had been  interactive  with the Treasury Department in sorting out how to respond  He did not clearly state who he believed should have a say in the outcome  There was a discussion about who is going to handle the response   Mr  Rettig said   There is no conclusion on that  Mr  Rettig said he was not aware of anyone at the I R S  having communicated with the White House about the matter While Mr  Mnuchin might try to defer a decision on Mr  Trump s taxes to the department s lawyers  he may ultimately have to weigh in Former I R S  officials have suggested that privacy will be Mr  Mnuchin s strongest argument and that the administration will probably look to undercut the nature of the House Democrats  request for the returns as part of the committee s oversight of  the extent to which the I R S  audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president  Mr  Gibbs noted that the provision Democrats were using to seek Mr  Trump s returns was drafted when the tax code was being rewritten to improve protection of taxpayer privacy  Despite the language in the code  which appears to clearly give Congress the power to access anyone s tax returns  a request that is political in nature could ultimately be shot down by the Supreme Court  This goes way beyond the president   Mr  Gibbs said   If our politicians  at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue  can obtain taxpayer information  taxpayers have to wonder if there really is confidentiality anymore

  Attorney General William P  Barr said he will deliver the Mueller report to Congress and the public within a week  reiterating his earlier promise to release it by mid April   Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday  Mr  Barr said he would be transparent about redactions in the report  But he demurred when asked whether he has briefed the White House on it   The Justice Department inspector general expects to finish an examination of aspects of the Russia investigation by May or June  Mr  Barr revealed   Mr  Barr has tried to keep the appropriations hearing focused on the department s proposed  29 2 billion budget  which includes money for 100 new immigration judges as President Trump hardens his stance on immigration along the southwestern border Barr says Mueller report is coming  within a week  Mr  Barr  hit immediately with questions about his handling of the Mueller report by Democrats  reiterated his vow to be as transparent as possible and said that he will turn over a redacted version of the report to Congress and the public within a week Mr  Barr went over the categories of information he says he must black out   like information that is subject to grand jury secrecy rules   and said that whatever he censors in the report  he will identify the reason  This process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid April stands   he said   And so I think that from my standpoint  within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public  Representative Jos E  Serrano  Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department  pressed Mr  Barr to say whether the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  or his staff had played any role in drafting or reviewing two letters that Mr  Barr sent to Congress late last month about the report  Mr  Barr said that the special counsel had not participated in writing those letters  nor seen them in advance  though he gave Mr  Mueller the chance to see his letter summarizing the investigation s main findings  The letter of the 24th  Mr  Mueller s team did not play a role in drafting that document  although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that   Mr  Barr said   The letter on the 29th  I don t believe that that was reviewed by Mr  Mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter  Barr won t say whether the White House was briefed on the report Representative Nita M  Lowey  Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee  pressed Mr  Barr to say whether the White House has seen or been briefed on the contents of the Mueller report beyond what was in his letters about it to Congress  But Mr  Barr refused to answer  I ve said what I m going to say about the report today   he said   I ve issued three letters about it  I was willing to discuss the historic information of how the report came to me and my decision on Sunday   March 24  when he wrote a four page letter to Congress laying out the special counsel s top line findings  But I ve already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week   he added   I m not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it  In the past  Justice Department officials have said that Mr  Barr had not shown the White House any part of the Mueller report or briefed Mr  Trump s team about its contents  His demurral on Tuesday raised the possibility that the situation has shifted and the White House knows more than the public or Congress about what Mr  Mueller said Democrats press Barr on Mueller Democrats who lead the House Appropriations Committee were eager to press Mr  Barr on what one called  the elephant in the room   his handling of the highly anticipated special counsel s report  The American people have been left with many unanswered questions  serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter  and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report   Mr  Serrano said in his opening remarks  I think it would strike a serious blow to our system and yes to our democracy if that report is not fully seen   he added Democrats have criticized Mr  Barr s decision to share Mr  Mueller s top line findings in a four page letter that quoted sparingly from the report itself and his declaration that Mr  Trump had not committed an obstruction of justice offense after Mr  Mueller declined to make a prosecutorial judgment  They renewed their complaints after The New York Times revealed last week that some of Mr  Mueller s investigators have complained that Mr  Barr failed to fully represent their findings and that they were more damaging for the president than the attorney general indicated On Tuesday  they had their first chance to level criticism in person  Ms  Lowey called Mr  Barr s handling of the Mueller report  unacceptable  and questioned how quickly he summarized the findings in his March 24 letter  Even for someone who has done this job before   she said  referring to Mr  Barr s first stint as attorney general in the 1990s   I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive  Barr renews his own public defense Batting back Democrats  criticism  Mr  Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the  bottom line  conclusions of the special counsel s investigation in his letter to Congress and warned that attempting to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism Asked about The Times s reporting on frustrations among some of Mr  Mueller s investigators about the narrow scope of his letter laying out their findings  Mr  Barr appeared unswayed  I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize   Mr  Barr said   because I think any summary  regardless of who prepares it  not only runs the risk of being under inclusive or over inclusive  but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once  Each page of the report was marked that it might contain secret grand jury material and could not be readily released anyway  he said  He also said he had asked the intelligence community to review the report for any information that might compromise their sources and methods of intelligence gathering and would thus need to be redacted But he did not address his decision to step in and make a judgment on whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed justice after Mr  Mueller s team conspicuously did not Republicans tried to help Mr  Barr hammer home the report s top line findings  The conclusions were simple  no collusion  no obstruction   said Representative Tom Graves  Republican of Georgia  ignoring Mr  Mueller s statement that the investigation did not  exonerate  Mr  Trump of obstruction and that it found no criminal conspiracy between any Trump associates and Russia s election interference Mr  Graves added   Is there anything new you have seen that would change your conclusions  Mr  Barr responded   There is nothing to suggest to me  that the conclusions have changed   The letter speaks for itself   Congress waits as Barr blacks out parts of the Mueller report  Barr won t ask a judge to let him reveal secret grand jury details One of the key reasons Mr  Barr has said he must black out portions of the Mueller report before showing it to Congress is a federal rule of criminal procedure that forbids Justice Department officials from disclosing grand jury information to outsiders On its face  that rule   known as 6 e    makes no exception for Congress  There are exceptions to the rule  however  particularly if a judge issues an order permitting the material to be disclosed  That happened in 1974  when a judge overseeing the Watergate grand jury permitted the evidence it gathered to be sent to the House Judiciary Committee  which had opened an impeachment inquiry into President Nixon But the executive branch in 1974 supported sending the evidence to Congress  Mr  Barr was asked whether his Justice Department would be willing to join a similar motion to allow Congress to see the grand jury material that Mr  Mueller gathered But Mr  Barr said he has no such intention  He said if House Judiciary Committee members want to see that material  they can ask the judge  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is free to go to court if he feels one of those exceptions is applicable   Mr  Barr said  adding   My intention is not to ask for it at this stage  I mean  if the chairman has a good explanation of why 6 e  does not apply and his need for the information  I m willing to listen  Barr recalls Democrats  anger over the publication of the Starr report Under pressure to give Congress the entire text of the Mueller report  Mr  Barr repeatedly reminded his critics that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Whitewater Monica Lewinsky scandal  where Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence  including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president Mr  Barr s point seemed to be  If you have a problem with this process  blame the Clinton Democrats  This whole mechanism for the special counsel  as I said  was established during the Clinton administration in the wake of Ken Starr s report   Mr  Barr said   That s why the current rule says the report should be kept confidential  because there was a lot of reaction against the publication of Ken Starr s report and many of the people who are right now calling for release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report  Mr  Starr  the independent counsel leading the Clinton investigation  was operating under a now defunct law that gave him the authority to send a report directly to Congress  The Republican controlled Congress promptly made the whole thing public That experience helped persuade members of Congress of both parties that the independent counsel law should be permitted to lapse in 1999  But there was still a need for some kind of mechanism for prosecutors with a degree of independence to investigate potential high level executive branch wrongdoing Under then Attorney General Janet Reno  the Clinton administration issued the special counsel regulation that governed Mr  Mueller s investigation  Among other things  it called for the special counsel to write a  confidential  report for the attorney general  who would then relay his own report to Congress saying the investigation was over  In short  those rules did not envision a lengthy report from Mr  Mueller going to Congress and being published for the public to read   in any form  You will recognize that I m operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report   Mr  Barr said   But I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can  Barr  Don t worry about defense of health care law  The government will likely lose in court Representative Matt Cartwright  Democrat of Pennsylvania  assailed Mr  Barr and the Justice Department for declining to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal court in Texas  where a judge recently struck down the sweeping health care law as unconstitutional Mr  Cartwright accused Mr  Barr of putting the weight of the Justice Department behind a political effort to invalidate the law and warned that it could result in millions of people losing their health care coverage Mr  Barr did not dispute that he had decided to no longer defend the law but told Mr  Cartwright that he had  nothing to worry about  if he thought that the department had taken  such an outrageous position  because the government was likely to lose the case in question   Let the courts do their job   Mr  Barr said Republicans have challenged the law in various court cases since it was passed nine years ago  Late last year  a federal judge in Texas struck down the law on the grounds that its requirement that Americans buy health insurance was unconstitutional  The Justice Department had said last summer that it would no longer defend that mandate  and broadened its attack on the law last month  telling a federal appeals court that it believed the entire law should be invalidated If the court accepts that argument  millions of people could lose health insurance  Mr  Barr declined to speculate about the impact of the Justice Department s decision not to defend the law  though he acknowledged that it could end with no plan in place for those who depend on the law to maintain coverage The exchange underscored Mr  Barr s sweeping view of executive power and that the attorney general ultimately answers to the president  Though the Justice Department generally defends the law in any challenges to it  Mr  Barr indicated he was willing to make an exception in a case where the president asked for something different so long as it was legally defensible Barr seeks immigration spending for Trump s priorities Mr  Barr is requesting an additional  72 1 million for immigration enforcement   an amount that would fund 100 new immigration judges   at a time when Mr  Trump has hardened his stance against illegal immigration and asylum seekers  Over the past two days  he has purged top immigration and security leaders to accelerate that goal While the additional judges will  provide some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts   Mr  Barr said  he also said that an influx of cases  constrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases  and other reforms are necessary  The Justice Department oversees the nation s immigration judges  who are separate from the judicial branch Mr  Barr also said that  attacking those transnational criminal organizations is a high priority  for the department and noted that the Justice Department is asking for more than  140 million in budget increases at the F B I   the Drug Enforcement Administration and elsewhere to address drug crimes A review of the Russia investigation will be done in the coming months The Justice Department inspector general intends to complete by May or June his investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry  including whether law enforcement officials abused their surveillance powers to spy on a Trump campaign aide  Mr  Barr said The inspector general  Michael E  Horowitz  has been examining how the F B I  and Justice Department obtained a secret warrant in October 2016 to wiretap Carter Page  a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser  Republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the warrant because they relied in part on Democratic funded opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele  a former British intelligence officer who was also an F B I  informant  in seeking permission from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to surveil Mr  Page As part of his investigation  Mr  Horowitz is also scrutinizing the F B I  s relationship with Mr  Steele Mr  Barr also said he was studying the F B I  s decision to begin investigating ties between Russia and Mr  Trump s campaign during the 2016 election  Mr  Barr said  He said he was trying to get his  arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation

HOUSTON   President Trump signed two executive orders on Wednesday that he says will speed up construction of pipelines and other projects to enhance the production and transport of oil and natural gas between states and across international borders The actions are unlikely to have much of an immediate impact  and they will probably attract legal challenges by state governments seeking to preserve control over such projects  But the orders are symbolically important for a president who likes to take credit for a boom in energy production and exports  And he delivered the message in Texas  an oil rich Republican state where Democrats recently made electoral gains One order directs the Environmental Protection Agency to review and tighten rules to make it more difficult for states to scuttle pipelines by invoking provisions of the Clean Water Act Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo of New York  an opponent of hydraulic fracturing  has blocked natural gas pipelines that would connect several Northeastern states to Pennsylvania s Marcellus shale gas field  A shortage of natural gas pipeline capacity prompted Consolidated Edison to impose a moratorium on new gas connections last month in parts of Westchester County The other executive order would transfer authority for approving the construction of international pipelines from the secretary of state to the president  eliminating a lengthy State Department review process  The goal is to speed up projects like the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico Mr  Trump issued a new presidential permit last month to Keystone XL  which has been delayed since the early years of the Obama administration  But the pipeline is being contested in the courts by environmentalists  farmers and some Native American groups  Too often  badly needed energy infrastructure is being held back by special interest groups  entrenched bureaucracies and radical activists   Mr  Trump told an audience at the International Union of Operating Engineers training center in Crosby  Tex   near Houston   This obstruction does not just hurt families and workers like you  It undermines our independence and national security  ImageMiles of unused pipe  prepared for the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline  piled up in North Dakota in 2014  An executive order by President Trump is intended to speed up international pipeline projects by eliminating State Department review CreditAndrew Burton Getty ImagesEnvironmentalists were quick to criticize the orders issued Wednesday  which they said would exacerbate climate change  President Trump is curtailing the public s voice in an attempt to force dirty energy projects on communities across America   said Joshua Axelrod  a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council   Pipelines like Keystone XL pose dangers to our water  our farms and our climate  But oil executives said the orders would give Washington greater flexibility as it tried to limit oil exports from Venezuela and Iran while keeping gasoline prices low  These are things that are good for our country and for the energy business to continue to help us be energy independent   said Dale Redman  chief executive of ProPetro  a major Texas oil service company Delays in pipeline construction have long bedeviled oil and gas companies  constraining production growth in West Texas and elsewhere  But new pipelines crossing Texas will be completed at the end of this year and in 2020 without much federal intervention In some cases  oil field economics  not federal policy  have stood in the way of new pipelines  Many energy companies have been burning gas that bubbles up with crude oil   a process known as flaring   because gas prices are so low that it would not be profitable to build pipelines to bring all of it to market But several states have put up roadblocks to Mr  Trump s efforts to champion fossil fuels like oil  gas and coal  Washington State has blocked the building of export terminals vital to the survival of the Western coal industry at a time when utilities are shutting down coal fired power plants  And Michigan last month halted an underwater oil pipeline project proposed by Enbridge  a major Canadian energy company  to import oil from Canada Mr  Cuomo said in a statement on Wednesday   President Trump s executive order is a gross overreach of federal authority that undermines New York s ability to protect our water quality and our environment  Wednesday s orders direct federal officials to pursue policies designed to expedite projects  For example  the president is telling Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta to review barriers to financing energy projects  including decisions by universities and pension funds to divest from oil  gas and coal companies  And he is instructing the Transportation Department to allow freight railroads and tanker trucks to haul liquefied natural gas  a growing export commodity

DANAO  Philippines   In the remote  mist covered slopes outside the city of Danao in the central Philippines sits the illegal  makeshift workshop of a master gun maker Accessible only by foot on a steep  winding pathway camouflaged by thick vegetation  the ramshackle shop owned by I  Launa has a tattered tarpaulin roof  a work table and several machines for cutting and shaping steel  The whole operation can be packed up and moved on short notice Illegal gun making is a livelihood that has helped put food on the table and send the family s children to school since the 1970s  and Mr  Launa  who asked that only the initial of his first name be used for fear of being arrested  is just one of a host of such small scale gunsmiths in the region  His village alone is home to about a dozen The trade   which contributes to the estimated two million unregistered guns in the Philippines  slightly more than the 1 7 million legally registered weapons   is able to flourish in a remote place where jobs are scarce  police presence is thin and lawlessness runs deep Gun making  is an essential craft passed on from one generation to another here   said Mr  Launa  63  who learned the craft from his father and has now taught it to his son ImageEven an enthusiast would have a hard time determining that the guns are illegal copies CreditJes Aznar for The New York Times Many presidents have come and gone   he added  as a single fluorescent light illuminated the table in front of him  where several unfinished Colt  45 pistol replicas lay   But we are still here  Gunsmithing blossomed in the area during World War II  as locals were taught to make weapons to support a guerrilla movement fighting the Japanese  By the 1960s  Danao had become the go to place for outlaws and ordinary citizens wanting cheap but high quality replicas Once these gun makers would sell their products out in the open  but now they employ runners to surreptitiously deliver their wares  Sometimes  a broker stops by to commission a gun for a client In the 1990s  an effort was made to legalize the trade by regulating gun makers  but the project failed to win government support The handguns   which even an enthusiast would have a hard time determining are illegal copies  down to the  Colt Automatic Caliber  45 Government Model  engraving   are sold to buyers for around 7 000 pesos  about  130  much cheaper than authentic models         g 0220 for webPHILIPPINES GUNSmap box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g 0220 for webPHILIPPINES GUNSmap box  g artboard p     margin 0       g aiAbs

craft practiced here is taking a deadly toll across the country The police say that hit men working for rival politicians have been known to source their weapons from the Danao area  and that sales have picked up slightly as the country prepares for elections in May  Several politicians have been killed in election related violence Danao made guns  according to the police  have been found at the site of extrajudicial killings  which have been attributed to pro government militias carrying out orders by President Rodrigo Duterte to stamp out drug crimes The police have said the guns have also made their way into the hands of Abu Sayyaf  a small but violent terrorist group in the south that is increasingly allying itself with the Islamic State  Right now  anyone can buy a gun here  as long as you have the money to pay  even if you were a thief  a killer or a gun for hire   said the local police chief  Col  Jaime Quiocho  who noted the appeal of such illicit purchases to criminals   Will

mountain ranges  Danao lies 20 miles from Cebu  the bustling main city of the central Philippines  An electronics factory provides jobs to a portion of the population of 130 000  which is mostly Catholic and mostly poor  though farming and fishing are the main industries At Mr  Launa s workshop  which on any given day might be working on four gun orders  metal cuts of gun parts were scattered on the table His 28 year old son was fine tuning a barrel and a trigger mechanism for a pistol  He chiseled and hammered every inch of the weapon before assembling it and repeatedly checking its mechanism  As a final test  he fired into a hole in the ground Asked whether he ever felt guilty knowing his guns might have been used in summary killings  Mr  Launa said   I make guns  but I don t tell people to kill others  The popularity of its guns has  in a way  made the local industry a victim of its own success  The more the guns have become known  the more they have attracted the eyes of organized groups of thieves and of police officers who want to shut the workshops down ImageAn estimated two million unregistered guns are owned in the Philippines  greater than the number of registered weapons CreditJes Aznar for The New York Times We have to hide  because one has to be careful nowadays   Mr  Launa said Colonel Quiocho acknowledged that the gun makers had little incentive or opportunity to abandon a trade that has provided a livelihood for generations  It has been a way of life for many   he said   If they stop it  what will happen to them  The police chief said pursuing illegal gun makers was only a stopgap measure that could not fully solve a problem also rooted in poverty  That isn t to say he has given up trying The police conducted about 70 raids last year that led to the seizure of about 92 firearms  Colonel Quiocho said  Charges were filed against around 80 people  though some were released on bail Tracking down the gun makers has not been easy  Many of them have spies who inform them of impending raids  giving them time to move to another location  Others have migrated elsewhere The police chief suggested legalizing the industry so that Danao guns could be properly tracked  They will make guns whether we like it or not   he said   So why not control the industry  their quality and where they go  ImageCol  Jaime Quiocho  the local police chief  said illegal gun makers had little incentive to abandon their trade  but he continues to pursue them CreditJes Aznar for The New York TimesImpressed by the quality of the confiscated guns he came across in the course of raids  Colonel Quiocho said Danao gun makers could compete with other manufacturers in the region if given the support  Gunsmiths here can make replicas just by looking at the pictures   he said   That is a testament to their advanced skills  They can compete with high end makers  Francisco Lara Jr  of International Alert Philippines  a conflict monitoring group  said he agreed that Danao guns should be legalized  to  stem the product and flow of illicit weapons into the market  The city government has tried to offer alternative livelihoods  though it has been a tough sell in a place where gun making is ingrained in the fabric of society Mr  Launa s son initially set out on a different path After finishing high school  he hoped to support himself with a job in the city so that he could save up to study to become an engineer  But his menial jobs paid just enough to eat  and eventually he decided to return home  So here I am   he said   I make guns for a living  It is an honest job   

ISLAMABAD   Pakistan s push to curb armed militant groups in the wake of a standoff with India that brought the nuclear armed neighbors close to war reflected an urgent need for stability to meet growing economic challenges  Prime Minister Imran Khan said Facing a financial crisis and heavy pressure to take on militant groups to avoid sanctions from the Financial Action Task Force  FATF   a global money laundering and terror finance watchdog  Khan said Pakistan was acting in its own interests  Everyone now knows that what is happening in Pakistan has never happened  before    Khan told a group of foreign journalists at his office in Islamabad on Tuesday  outlining a push to bring the more than 30 000 madrasas across Pakistan under government control and rehabilitate thousands of former militants  We have decided  this country has decided  for the future of the country   forget outside pressure   we will not allow armed militias to operate   he said The comments underline a push by Pakistan to improve its image after years of accusations that its security services have exploited militant groups as proxies against neighbors  including India and Afghanistan Islamabad has consistently denied the accusations and said Pakistan has suffered more from militant violence than any other country  with tens of thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in economic damage over recent decades But Khan  a former cricket star  implicitly accepted the role played by Pakistan in fostering and steering militant groups that grew out of the U S  backed mujahideen fighting Soviet forces in neighboring Afghanistan in the 1980s  We should never have allowed them to exist once jihad was over   he said  rejecting suggestions that he could face opposition from the powerful military and the ISI  Pakistan s main intelligence agency  Today  we have the total support of the Pakistan army and intelligence services in dismantling them   Khan said   What use has ISI of them any more  These groups were created for the Afghan jihad  BROKEN PROMISESPakistan s critics  including India  have dismissed Khan s promises of a crackdown  saying similar pledges have been repeatedly made by previous governments only to be quietly dropped once attention shifted They point to Pakistan s continued failure to arrest Masood Azhar  leader of Jaish e Mohammed  JeM   the group which claimed responsibility for the Feb  14 attack in Pulwama district of Indian controlled Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitary police Khan said Pakistan was constrained by the need to build a legal case that would stand up in court but said Azhar had been driven underground and was  ineffective  and unwell  More important than him is the set up and that is being dismantled   he said Although Khan insisted that the actions against militant groups were being undertaken for Pakistan s own benefits  his government  which came to power last August  faces severe economic headwinds that have made international support vital In discussions with the International Monetary Fund over what would be its 13th bailout since the 1980s  Pakistan is struggling to stay off the FATF blacklist  which would bring heavy economic penalties   We can t afford to be blacklisted  that would mean sanctions   Khan said With a currency that has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past year  a yawning current account deficit and galloping inflation running at over nine percent  Pakistan is in desperate need of a respite to get its economy on track Elected on a platform of tackling the endemic corruption that has helped cripple Pakistan s economy  Khan said his top priority was to take 100 million people  or around half the population  out of poverty  You can only do this if there is stability in Pakistan     Reporting by James Mackenzie  Editing by Nick Macfie and Michael Perry

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  For more than two years  Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo has railed against President Trump  attacking his policies on everything from immigration and reproductive rights to his handling of the disaster response in Puerto Rico Now  Mr  Cuomo  a third term Democrat  has said he would throw his weight behind an attempt to obtain what may be some of the president s most sensitive secrets  those that could be buried in Mr  Trump s state tax returns Mr  Cuomo s office said late Monday that it would back a new bill that would permit the New York Department of Taxation and Finance to release any state tax return   including the president s   if it were requested by leaders of three congressional committees for any  specified and legitimate legislative purpose  The office had originally suggested on Monday that the intensifying legislative efforts to obtain those documents could  politicize the process   even allowing that  transparency and disclosure is vital   But hours later  it clarified Mr  Cuomo s position  As long as it applies to everybody   said Richard Azzopardi  a senior adviser to the governor   we support it  The bill  sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman  a Manhattan Democrat  was expected to be debated by the Democratic majority in Albany s upper chamber this week  according to a Senate official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the bill had not yet been formally discussed in conference  Under that timetable  the bill could be set up for passage after the upcoming recess  which ends April 29 It is just one of three similarly themed bills currently circulating in Albany  including the New York Truth Act  which would permit the state tax department to release five years of state income tax returns from eight federal and state officials  including the president  if they earn income in New York Originally introduced in 2017  the New York Truth Act foundered in the Assembly after concerns were raised about the mass release of politicians  tax information  Since then  however  the Assembly sponsor  David Buchwald  a Westchester County Democrat  said he has solidified the support of more than 90 Assembly members   more than enough to pass a bill in that chamber  Mr  Hoylman  the Senate sponsor  has said he also has commitments from a majority of Senate members to pass the bill Carl E  Heastie  the Democratic speaker of the Assembly  said that  there seems to be nationwide desire  to see Mr  Trump s taxes  and that his chamber would discuss the bill after the spring recess  He also said that any proposal to seek state tax returns   which would likely contain much of the same information as the president s contested federal returns   would need to be vetted by lawyers Mr  Trump  who is from New York and whose business is still headquartered here  has steadfastly refused to release his federal tax returns  And while Republicans suggested that the attempts by the Democrat led Legislature were partisan  both Mr  Hoylman and Mr  Buchwald defended their bills  saying that voters had a right to know about Mr  Trump s personal and business finances  Making sure that the public has information about the man currently in the White House is something that I feel is incumbent upon us to make sure is released   Mr  Buchwald said  adding   There s a copy of President Trump s New York State tax returns right here in New York State  in an office somewhere  Both lawmakers said that the urgency of their bills had increased since last week  after a request from the House Ways and Means Committee chairman  Representative Richard E  Neal of Massachusetts  to release six years of Mr  Trump s federal returns by April 10  The I R S  and the Treasury Department in Washington are still deciding whether to comply with that request  but on Sunday  the White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  said that Democrats would  never  see the president s tax returns Andrew Sidamon Eristoff  a former commissioner of taxation and finance under Gov  George E  Pataki  said that Mr  Hoylman s bill would  generate furious and lengthy litigation  if passed  because of federal laws protecting tax information  The I R S  and others will likely argue that most New York return information is based on protected federal return information   Mr  Sidamon Eristoff said   Disaggregating the information will be a major practical challenge  if not impossible  In January  Mr  Cuomo had proposed a plan to have all candidates for statewide and legislative office release several years worth of returns  but the measure did not advance  Mr  Cuomo allows reporters to see his taxes every April  but does not allow copies to be made The bill introduced on Monday by Mr  Hoylman would amend current state laws that generally prohibit such private tax information from being released  and would cover a broad range of filings  including personal income taxes  corporation taxes and real estate transfer taxes  Under it  the chairman of any of three congressional committees   the Senate Finance Committee  the House Ways and Means Committee  and the Joint Committee on Taxation   could request tax returns from the New York tax department  which would be authorized to release the information Mr  Hoylman is also the sponsor of a third bill that would require candidates for president and vice president to reveal their past tax returns in order to appear on primary and general election ballots  a strategy tried by lawmakers in more than a dozen other states On Monday  Mr  Hoylman said that he would be happy with the passage of any of the three pending bills  I don t care how we get it done  frankly   Mr  Hoylman said   I want the route that is most politically feasible  which I m certain is the one the Legislature will follow

LONDON   Britain s parliament approved legislation on Monday that gives lawmakers the power to scrutinize and even change Prime Minister Theresa May s request that the European Union agree to delay Brexit until June 30 May has already asked Brussels to extend Britain s EU membership to allow talks with the opposition Labour Party in search of different exit plan   a last ditch attempt to keep control after parliament rejected her Brexit deal three times But lawmakers want additional legal guarantees against a  no deal  exit happening on April 12   the current exit day   and have crafted a law forcing ministers to consult with parliament on Tuesday before May goes to Brussels   Both houses of parliament have tonight strongly made clear their view that a no deal would be deeply damaging to jobs  manufacturing and security of our country   said lawmaker Yvette Cooper  one of those responsible for proposing the legislation  The bill gives lawmakers the chance to make legally binding changes to May s requested departure date during a debate scheduled to last 90 minutes on Tuesday  The prime minister would retain some freedom to agree a different date with the EU May is due to travel to Paris and Berlin on Tuesday to press her request for a short delay  before it is formally discussed by EU leaders at a special summit on Wednesday The bill passed through the Commons by a single vote last week and was then approved with minor changes in the House of Lords  an unelected body whose role is to refine and scrutinize legislation  which the Commons then had to sign off on  The passage of the bill represents a significant blow to May s authority  overturning the long standing convention that the government has sole control of the agenda in parliament  allowing it to control what laws are passed It also creates another flashpoint in a deeply divided body of lawmakers that could undermine May s attempts to persuade Brussels she can get parliament to back a Brexit deal if the EU gives her more time The government had warned that the legislation was poorly drafted  rushed through parliament and set a dangerous constitutional precedent  Pro Brexit lawmakers also fiercely opposed the bill    It  is like tossing a hand grenade into our constitutional arrangements   said eurosceptic Conservative lawmaker Bill Cash    Reporting by William James  Editing by Giles Elgood  Frances Kerry and Sonya Hepinstall  

WASHINGTON   The United States and the European Union are preparing to impose tit for tat tariffs on each other s products  the latest escalation in a 14 year fight over government aid given to Boeing and European rival Airbus  The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States  which will now put Tariffs on  11 Billion of E U  products   President Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday morning   The E U  has taken advantage of the U S  on trade for many years  It will soon stop  The office of the United States trade representative said on Monday night that it was preparing a list of European products to tax as retaliation for European subsidies to Airbus  which the World Trade Organization ruled were illegal in May 2018  That prompted the European Union to announce that it was also readying a list of tariffs to counter American subsidies to Boeing The moves come amid tense trade relations between the United States and Europe  which are engaged in a battle of tariffs after Mr  Trump s decision last year to tax European steel and aluminum  Mr  Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs on European cars and car parts if the European Union does not agree to better trade terms for American products  and Europe has said it will retaliate on American goods if Mr  Trump follows through on that threat The announcement of new tariffs stems from a dispute that began in 2004 related to government subsidies that Europe provides to Airbus Last May  the W T O  found that Airbus had received illegal funding for several of its aircraft models  The United States requested the authority to impose retaliatory tariffs of  11 2 billion per year  and the two sides are awaiting a decision on the level of tariffs that the United States will be authorized to levy on the European Union In preparation for that decision  which is expected this summer  the United States announced Monday night that it was beginning to identify European products to tax  so it could impose the duties as soon as the organization ruled  The initial list  would cover  11 billion of trade in products including airplanes  cheese  fish  wine  clothing  nails  pipes and clocks   the same dollar amount of harm that the United States trade representative estimated European subsidies cause each year  This case has been in litigation for 14 years  and the time has come for action   Robert Lighthizer  the United States trade representative  said in a statement  Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the E U  to end all W T O  inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft   Mr  Lighthizer said   When the E U  ends these harmful subsidies  the additional U S  duties imposed in response can be lifted  The European Commission indicated on Tuesday that it considers the  11 billion in retaliatory measures to be overblown and not justified by any findings by the World Trade Organization  The figure quoted by the U S  trade representative is based on U S  internal estimates that have not been awarded by the W T O    Daniel Rosario  a European Commission spokesman  said during a press briefing in Brussels Tuesday  reading from a prepared statement In a statement  Airbus called the American tariff announcement  totally unjustified  and said that the European Union would take  far larger countermeasures against the U S  Mr  Rosario said the commission  the European Union s administrative arm  would ask W T O  arbitrators to authorize retaliatory measures  which would be in response to a W T O  finding last month that Boeing received tax breaks in Washington State and incentives in South Carolina that amounted to subsidies The European Commission has begun drawing up a list of products that would be covered by retaliatory tariffs  but is awaiting a W T O  decision before specifying which products would be targeted and how much trade they would encompass In a statement  Boeing said that it supported the United States trade representative and hoped that the draft tariff list would encourage the European Union  to comply with past W T O  rulings against it  and  end all illegal government support for Airbus  The escalation comes at a difficult moment for Boeing  which is in the midst of a crisis after two of its 737 Max jet planes were involved in fatal crashes in five months  The company announced last week that it would begin slowing production of the jet  which represents billions of dollars of outstanding orders in the coming years  Stock markets in the United States were slightly lower on Tuesday  with the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index down 0 6 percent  Shares of Boeing were down 1 5 percent The United States  arguments at the W T O  have centered on billions of dollars of  launch aid  that the European Union has given Airbus to develop new products  The United States has long argued that such aid gave Airbus an unfair advantage  allowing it to gain market share in Europe  Australia  China  South Korea and elsewhere at Boeing s expense European criticism of the American aviation sector has mostly focused on government research contracts granted to Boeing through agencies like the Defense Department and NASA  as well as tax breaks at the federal  state and local levels While the subsidy dispute predates Mr  Trump s trade war by many years  the conflict has recently taken on some of the same tone that has characterized relations between the United States and Europe during the last two years  including reciprocal threats  radically different interpretations of the same facts  and an undercurrent of hostility among the NATO allies The two governments announced plans in July to negotiate an agreement that would reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade on both sides of the Atlantic  but have since disputed exactly what would be included in the agreement Chad Bown  a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute  said the list being drawn up by the United States was notable because it targeted European aircraft sales  which have not typically been included on past retaliation lists   If Trump goes first  expect the E U  to respond by hitting Boeing s sales in Europe   Mr  Bown said He added that tariffs on Airbus would also affect American companies  since it purchases many components for its aircraft from the United States Trade experts suggested the organization was likely to decide in the United States  favor on the tariffs  which they described as significant but not surprising Jennifer Hillman  a professor at Georgetown Law  said the Trump administration s tariffs appeared to be compliant with W T O  rules  as long as the United States waited for the organization s final decision before imposing its tariffs   If U S T R  wants to impose the tariffs as soon as the arbitration amount is announced  they need to start the public process now so as to be ready with a specific list of products as soon as arbitrator says the amount  Matthew Gold  an adjunct professor of law at Fordham University  said   The W T O  dispute settlement body will likely authorize the United States to impose retaliatory tariffs in the magnitude we re asking for  or close to it  Mr  Trump and his advisers have fiercely criticized the World Trade Organization for infringing on trade decisions that they insist should be the purview of the United States  and for failing to police unfair behavior by China However  they also have been quick to publicize the organization s decisions when it finds in their favor In its statement Monday  the Trump administration emphasized that its latest measures against the European Union would comply with the rules of the World Trade Organization  And Mr  Trump also cited the organization in his tweet supporting the tariffs  In a separate announcement Tuesday  the United States trade representative said the W T O  made a decision in its favor in a separate long running dispute with Canada over trade in lumber

SAN LORENZO DE EL ESCORIAL  Spain   The Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid seems peaceful enough on a sunny spring day but  with national elections just around the corner  its distinction as the burial place of Francisco Franco has turned it into a political battleground The outgoing Socialist government passed legislation to exhume Spain s former dictator and turn the site into a memorial to the victims of the brutal 1936 39 Civil War that marked the start of his fascist regime But newcomer Vox  which the April 28 ballot will usher in as the first far right party to sit in parliament since the 1970s  has challenged that decision Forty four years after his death  Franco s legacy remains a source of deep divisions in Spanish society It has also become an element of Vox s election campaign as the party seeks to grab votes from the traditional center right PP  adding a further complication to what promises to be one of Spain s most unpredictable and bitterly fought elections in decades  Well  I thought to myself  over my dead body   said Pilar Gutierrez   whose father was a minister under Franco   in reference to the exhumation  She heads a group campaigning to keep his body where it is and she has no doubt who she ll be voting for   Vox is the only party that can stop it  the exhumation    she said  speaking next to the mausoleum  hewn into the rock of the pine forested valley and dominated by a 152 metre  500 foot  cross  They have principles  Conventional parties don t have principles  Franco s regime killed or imprisoned tens of thousands to stamp out dissent  and up to 500 000 combatants and civilians died in the war between his forces and leftist Republicans On the other side of the political divide sits Francisco Mendieta  who exhumed his grandfather Timoteo from a mass Franco era grave in 2017 to give him a proper burial  He  Franco  is a man who has no reason to be there  in the Valley of the Fallen    Mendieta said    He  was a dictator who signed off on death sentences  In a democracy I see it as an aberration  Franco never showed any mercy  so if his exhumation upsets anybody  then they deserve it   he added While mostly focusing on specific Spanish issues Vox has  like similar parties in neighboring countries  also benefited from a public reaction against immigration that has seeped into European politics In a major poll published on Tuesday  it was seen winning up to 37 seats on April 28 The same poll also showed that the Socialists and their far left allies Podemos could win a majority  But that was a best case scenario and several other coalitions  either left  or right led  are also possible APPEALING TO THE LEFTThe Socialists have also leveraged Franco to appeal to their voter base They set the date for his exhumation last month after the election was announced  with Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo saying that  only the mortal remains of people who died as a result of the Spanish Civil War  would lie in the Valley of the Fallen Franco s descendents have also challenged the exhumation  approved by parliament in September  but the government has said his remains will be dug up on June 10 unless the Supreme Court blocks it  Both the PP and the centrist Ciudadanos abstained from the parliamentary vote  arguing the exhumation was not an urgent issue In public at least  Vox leader Santiago Abascal is still confident it will not take place   I am taking it for granted that it won t happen  it is just government propaganda   he has said Vox says it does not endorse Franco politically  though its election candidates include four former generals  two of whom signed a pro Franco petition last year Antonio Barroso  managing director of political consultancy Teneo  said that  while Vox s position on Spanish  cultural  issues like Franco and separatism   which it opposes   was clear  little was known about its stance on broader policy matters  It is impossible to know   how much support Vox will get in the election  said Barroso   One thing we do know is that right wing voters are more undecided  And they  Vox  are a new disruptive element    Writing by Axel Bugge  Additional reporting by Belen Carreno  Editing by Ingrid Melander and John Stonestreet  

STOCKHOLM   Sweden s Social Democrat led government will outline tax cuts for top earners on Wednesday  widening the gap between rich and poor in a country that has long enjoyed a reputation for social equality The boost for wealthy Swedes is part of a compromise deal  struck between center left and center right parties after a September election resulted in a hung parliament  aimed at excluding the anti immigration Sweden Democrats from government It mirrors a dilemma facing politicians in other European countries such as Germany and Denmark where mainstream parties have faced a choice between papering over left right animosity or giving populist parties a taste of power  But with many Swedes increasingly unhappy with public services such as policing  schools and care for the elderly  analysts warn the tax cuts in fact risk fuelling xenophobia and populist sentiment  widely seen as rooted in growing inequality The policy  which will be outlined in a  mini budget  update to the main autumn bill  scraps a 5 percent surcharge levied on the income of workers who earn more than about 700 000 Swedish crowns   75 700  a year  The extra tax was introduced during the economic crisis of the early 1990s to support public finances Those top earners will still be heavily taxed compared with many other countries  at around 60 percent  But the move  which takes effect next year  is likely to widen the divide between society s  haves  and  have nots   It follows a series of policies in recent years that benefited the well off  including the scrapping of a wealth tax While Sweden is still has one of the most equal societies  the divide between the richest and poorest people has grown faster than in any other developed nation in recent decades  according to the OECD  The organization uses the  Gini coefficient  to measure how equally income is distributed across society The 20 billion crown revenue loss from this tax cut and a wider income tax reduction introduced in December s 2019 budget  will in part be offset by cuts in spending on care for the elderly and the overseas aid budget  and higher environmental taxes  Some in the center left Social Democrats are angry over what they see as a betrayal of the values of a party that built Sweden s famed welfare state and engineered a society widely seen as setting the standard for equality and fairness  It s about defending democracy and for our group that means defending the welfare state where no one is left behind   said Markus Kallifatides  a Social Democrat lawmaker  Sweden is not that society anymore   But for many others  sidelining the anti immigration Sweden Democrats is worth the price   Reducing taxes for high income earners is not going to reduce inequality  of course   Swedish Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson told Reuters on March 29   There is no question this is not the priority of the Social Democrats  but you need to get a majority so you have to compromise  In September s election  the Social Democrats posted their worst result for more than a century with the Sweden Democrats  eurosceptic nationalists who want to close the doors to asylum seekers  becoming the third largest party To break the deadlock  the Social Democrats and Greens agreed a four year  73 point program with the Centre and Liberal parties who insisted on income tax cuts and deregulation of the housing rental and labor markets as the price of support  NOT SO EQUALWhile the measures may be painful for the architects of Sweden s welfare state  they are just part of a change that has been going on for years The top 1 percent in Sweden now own a greater share of the country s wealth than the top 1 percent in the United States  according to Credit Suisse s 2018 Global Wealth Report  There is a kind of renaissance of an economic aristocracy   said Ola Pettersson  chief economist at the Swedish Trade Union Confederation While Sweden has not seen the kind of unrest that has hit some countries  there is a growing sense among many Swedes that riots in Stockholm in 2013 and a surge in gang violence are evidence of the kind of social fragmentation that has provided fertile soil for populists around Europe  Until the 1970s  successive Social Democrat governments turned the screws on Sweden s elite with high income taxes  wealth taxes  inheritance taxes  gift taxes and real estate taxes Many rich Swedes   like IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad   took their fortunes abroad Faced with the exodus  Sweden instituted market oriented reforms and embraced small businesses and entrepreneurs A wealth tax  which had been reduced and watered down over many years  was abolished in 2007  High property tax has been replaced with a fee capped at 7 812 crowns Inheritance tax has also been scrapped  Compare that to Britain  where beneficiaries pay 40 percent tax over a threshold of 325 000 pounds   425 000  At the same time a decade of ultra low rates has meant the value of real estate and stocks has soared  giving a boost to those who rely on capital gains as opposed to a monthly wage for the bulk of their income  Between 2006 and 2014  a center right government also started reducing income taxes  with the top rates   excluding the surcharge   coming down in steps to around 60 percent from about 90 percent in the late 1970s  Welfare benefits were cut  Sweden is the best country in the world  for rich people   Jan Emanuel Johansson  a Social Democrat lawmaker turned healthcare businessman  said in a satirical video on YouTube The millionaire  a popular public figure who won Swedish reality TV survival series  Robinson   said growing inequality would have exact a price for society as a whole  including social unrest on the streets   Either you can say  I don t care  I m one of the privileged and I can build a higher wall round my house   he added   Or we have to realize that what is bad for those who ride the subway  at some point in the future is going to be bad for those who drive a Rolls Royce    Reporting by Simon Johnson  Editing by Pravin Char

An Israeli public relations firm aligned with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s Likud party said it was behind the placement of some 1 200 cameras in predominantly Arab polling stations  and claimed the tactic helped lower Arab voter turnout in the election Tuesday The company  Kaizler Inbar  said in a  Facebook post on Wednesday that it had worked with Likud not only to distribute the cameras but also to deploy more than 1 300 activists to polling stations Arab voter turnout was just over 50 percent  a historically low level  Israeli news outlets reported  But that most likely resulted from several factors  analysts said  including a boycott of the vote by some Arabs over the passage of laws seen as discriminatory and a lack of robust representation On Wednesday  Mr  Netanyahu was in position to take a fourth consecutive term in office  with nearly all of the votes counted and the rival Blue and White alliance having conceded the race Likud claimed that it used the cameras  some of which were concealed  to record evidence of potential voter fraud  The Arab party Hadash Taal filed a complaint on Tuesday over the use of the cameras  calling it a voter intimidation tactic The Central Elections Committee s legal counsel said the action was prohibited  and the police confiscated dozens of the cameras Kaizler Inbar played off the committee s ruling on Wednesday  writing in its Facebook post   Shhhh     Don t tell anyone  It was us  After a  long period of preparations  and a  tight partnership with the best of people in Likud   the company wrote  it made a contribution to  the most important accomplishments of the right wing bloc  Kaizler Inbar is headed by Sagi Kaizler  a former leader of a West Bank settler group  The organization claimed it sent some 1 350 people to Arab polling stations Afif Abu Much  37  a computer engineer and political activist from Baqa al Gharbiyye  a town bordering the West Bank  said he was not surprised by Likud s decision to deploy the cameras  It is part of our prime minister s campaign of repression against Arab citizens in Israel   he said  Among other things  he cited the passage of a law last summer that declared Israel the  nation state of the Jewish people  Mr  Abu Much said Mr  Netanyahu would have been hurt by a large Arab turnout  an assessment shared by analysts   To beat Netanyahu  you need Arabs   he said   Without the Arabs  you cannot send Netanyahu home  He knows that  But Mr  Abu Much wasn t convinced that the cameras were the driving reason for the low Arab turnout  He noted that the Blue and White alliance  seen as the main threat to Likud  had done little to appeal to Arab voters or align itself with Arab parties  

SYDNEY   Australia s government proposed on Wednesday to criminalise some actions of animal rights protesters after activists blocked traffic in Melbourne and stormed farms and abattoirs this week to protest factory farming The new law proposed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison is unusual  legal experts say  because it appears to be a specific response to the actions of a vegan activist group  AussieFarms  The group has posted an interactive map online of animal businesses  including farms  zoos and horse racing tracks  to promote a documentary film that calls for a ban on slaughterhouses Under the new law  people who encourage trespassers by posting the location of an agricultural business on the Internet could face up to a year in prison if found guilty  the government said  When they are using people s personal information  details about their homes  it s not just their farm  it s their home  it s where their kids live and grow up   Morrison told reporters in the rural state of Tasmania  They are being targeted in the most mercenary way by an organisation that can only think of itself and not think to the real damage that is being done to the livelihoods of these hard working Australians   he added Australia is due to hold an election in May and most polls predict Morrison will lose  partly due to a drift of rural voters to other conservative parties Traffic stopped for an hour in central Melbourne on Monday when about 100 protesters waved signs to promote the AussieFarms documentary  Dominion  which used drones and undercover footage to film feedlots and saleyards   nL3N21Q1B8 It was part of a wave of action in three states  where activists targeted abattoirs in the middle of the night and at some farms chained themselves to equipment Hugh de Kretser  executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre  said there were laws in place that limited the actions of environmental campaigners  including a ban on trespassing   There s a suite of powers available to police and law enforcement agencies to deal with trespass and obstruction of traffic and the like   de Kretser told Reuters  Any attempts to further limit protest rights need to be very carefully scrutinised to make sure any penalty is not crushing  and the scope of any offence is not disproportionate to the conduct they re trying to prevent   he added Chris Delforce  the director of Dominion  said he would rather go to jail than take down the group s website  All we re trying to do is enforce transparency on these industries   he told Reuters by telephone   Whatever happens to me cannot compare to what s happening to animals     Reporting by Byron Kaye  editing by Darren Schuettler  

TOKYO   Japan s machinery orders posted their first monthly increase in four months in February due to improved demand from the energy and telecommunications sectors but weakening global conditions remain major challenges for the world s third largest economy The 1 8 percent increase month on month in core machinery orders  an often volatile leading indicator of capital expenditure  followed a 5 4 percent decline in the previous month But the expansion was weaker than the median forecast for a 2 5 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists  It is also unlikely to ease concerns that companies could drastically cut business investment due to the U S  Sino trade war and rising inventories of electronic parts  The rebound in machinery orders is not as strong as it seems  and companies are likely to remain cautious because their business plans depend a lot on the global economy   said Shuji Tonouchi  senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities  In the current environment  Japan s growth is likely to be somewhat sluggish  Orders from manufacturers rose 3 5 percent in February  following a 1 9 percent month on month decline in January  Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday Orders from non manufacturers fell 0 8 percent month on month in February after an 8 0 percent decline in January from the previous month Of some encouragement for policymakers  machinery orders from overseas rose 19 0 percent  recovering from an 18 1 percent tumble in January  Core  machinery orders exclude those for ships and from electricity utilities The United States and China are trying to narrow their differences over trade but are yet to agree to a deal that would unwind punitive tariffs and restore global trade flows The two countries have been embroiled in a tit for tat tariff battle since July 2018  which has roiled supply chains  Japanese manufactures rely on selling heavy machinery and electronic parts to companies operating in China  which are used to make finished goods Adding another source of concern for policymakers are Tokyo s own trade talks with the United States expected later this month  which could potentially threaten Japan s auto exports to the U S  market Economists say uncertainty over trade policy could discourage Japanese companies from increasing capital expenditure  which will act as a curb on economic growth Another risk for Japan s economy is the government s plan to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October  The government needs the extra revenue for rising welfare costs  but the tax hike could also weaken consumer spending   Reporting by Stanley White  Editing by Sam Holmes

KIGALI   Rwanda began a week of solemn ceremonies on Sunday to commemorate the lives of 800 000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus murdered during the Rwandan genocide  a three month killing spree that began 25 years ago President Paul Kagame laid a wreath at the Gisozi genocide memorial site  where over a quarter a million of people are buried  before an afternoon of speeches and song  Later  a candelit vigil was held in the packed national soccer stadium   There is no way to fully comprehend the loneliness and anger of survivors and yet over and over again we have asked them to make the sacrifices necessary to give our nation new life  Emotions had to be put in a box   Kagame said  his tall  thin form projected onto television screens around the nation   We are far better Rwandans than we were  But we can be even better still  We are the last people in the world who should succumb to complacency  The 100 days of slaughter began on April 6  1994  after President Juvenal Habyarimana and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi    both Hutus    were killed when their plane was shot down over the Rwandan capital  The attackers have never been identified Among the legacies of the genocide is the International Criminal Court  which grew out of tribunals to investigate and prosecute those responsible for atrocities committed in Rwanda and during the Balkan wars of the 1990s  At Gisozi on Sunday  popular Rwandan artists sang songs like  Turabunamira twiyubaka   meaning  honouring them as we rebuild   Remembering is necessary because it s only thanks to looking back at what happened  that we can  ensure that it never happens again   said hairdresser Olive Muhorakeye  26 In the late afternoon  thousands of people marched from parliament to the national soccer stadium  After they had entered  the lights were extinguished and the dark stadium was lit only by a sea of flickering candles as survivors spoke   I named my children after all my siblings that died   Samuel Dusengiyumva told the emotional crowd  before praising the actions of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  RPF   a Tutsi led rebel movement led by Kagame that ended the genocide   I thank the RPF army that rescued us as the rest of world did nothing  As the testimonies continued  counsellors in green jackets hurried through the rows of seats as some members of the crowd wept or screamed  Others took selfies  NEIGHBOUR TURNED ON NEIGHBOUR    The downing of Habyarimana s plane was immediately followed by killings as Hutu government soldiers and allied extremist militia began trying to exterminate the Tutsi minority In villages across the densely populated country  neighbour turned on neighbour  Men  women and children were hacked to death  burned alive  clubbed and shot     As many as 10 000 people were killed daily  Seventy percent of the minority Tutsi population was wiped out  and over 10 percent of the total Rwandan population     The fighting ended in July 1994 when the RPF  led by Kagame  swept in from Uganda and seized control of the country      Under Kagame  any talk of ethnicity is strongly discouraged  The opposition says the tight control of the media and political sphere is also used to stifle dissent     The ruling party has decided to adopt dictatorship from early days after the genocide as they said they were protecting the national sovereignty  but now I feel that should end   opposition figure Victoire Ingabire told Reuters   The government should let the opposition politicians work freely because denying them their rights will create problems  Twenty five years is enough  the government should let people be free to express their opinions  Kagame  who won nearly 99 percent of the vote in 2017 polls on a 96 percent turnout  rebuffs such criticism  pointing to Rwanda s strong economic growth and relative peace since the genocide  In Sunday s speech  he also issued a challenge to anyone who might threaten the country  What happened here will never happen again  For those  who      want to mess with us     we will mess up with them big time   he said    Editing by Katharine Houreld and Catherine Evans  

LONDON BUCHAREST   Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to move the  red lines  that have blocked a deal for Britain to leave the EU  opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Saturday  after May launched talks with him in a last ditch bid to save Brexit With Britain due to leave the bloc on April 12 and no sign of her minority government being able to pass a deal through parliament on its own  May turned to Labour Party leader Corbyn in recent days in the hope of securing a bi partisan agreement A deal with Corbyn could be May s last chance to deliver Brexit without either a long delay or leaving with no deal at all  But Corbyn said the prime minister had yet to show the flexibility that Labour would need to say yes  I m waiting to see the red lines move   he told the BBC   I hope we can reach a decision in parliament this week which will prevent a crashing out   No talks have been arranged yet between the two sides for this weekend  a Labour source told Reuters May s decision to seek an agreement with Corbyn was an astounding reversal after months of saying her plan for Brexit was the only possible course  It reflects weeks of high drama in parliament that saw May s deal rejected by a historic majority but no agreement emerge on an alternative plan While both major parties have said they are committed to carrying out the results of Britain s 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU  Labour has long demanded a softer break than May has been willing to consider In particular  Labour seeks a customs union with the EU after Britain leaves  which would cross one of the  red lines  May set out at the start of negotiations by preventing Britain from setting its own trade tariffs Many Labour lawmakers also want a second referendum on the terms of Brexit  which May says would be a fundamental threat to Britain s democracy after the vote to leave  Her decision to open talks with Labour infuriated Brexit supporters in May s Conservative party and divided her cabinet With time running out  May has asked EU leaders to postpone Britain s exit from the bloc until June 30  The EU  which gave her a two week extension the last time she asked  insists she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her thrice rejected divorce deal in the British parliament EU leaders have also indicated they would be more likely to offer a longer extension of up to a year  to avoid setting a firm new deadline in a few months  time that would cause yet another cliff edge crisis  HAMMOND OPTIMISTICFinance minister Philip Hammond told reporters in Bucharest on Saturday he was  optimistic  of reaching some form of agreement with Labour and that the government had no red lines in the talks Hammond said he expected more exchanges of documents on Saturday between the government and Labour in a bid to reach a deal  He also signaled optimism about next Wednesday s EU summit  saying most EU states agreed on a need to delay Brexit   Most of the colleagues that I am talking to accept we will need longer to complete this process   he said on the sidelines of a meeting of European Union finance ministers Britons voted in 2016 by a 52 to 48 percent margin for Brexit  The two main parties  parliament and the nation at large remain profoundly split over the terms for departure  or even over whether to leave at all A delay in Brexit of more than a few months would require Britain to participate in May 23 elections to the European parliament  It is a prospect May and many in her Conservative party are anxious to avoid  fearing a backlash from voters  Going to the EU elections for the Conservative Party  or indeed for the Labour Party  and telling our constituents why we haven t been able to deliver Brexit I think would be an existential threat   junior education minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC radio on Saturday   I would go further and say   it would be the suicide note of the Conservative Party    Editing by Peter Graff

BUCHAREST   The Italian government and the European Commission have reached a provisional agreement to reimburse some investors who bought shares in failed banks  an Italian official said  in an unprecedented move that would soften EU rules on bank rescues The bail in rules devised after the last decade s financial crisis were designed to make any given bank and its creditors   instead of taxpayers   financially responsible if it went bust  with shareholders first in line to pay up Since the regulations came into force in 2016  shareholders have been all but wiped out in all bank collapses  including Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and two smaller north eastern banks that Italian authorities intervened to save in 2017 Losses have also been inflicted on bondholders in some cases  while depositors have always been spared But under the new provisional deal between Brussels and Rome  bondholders and shareholders of failed Italian banks could claim their money back  the official from the Italian finance ministry said  The Commission is in constructive contact with Italy on the proposed measures   the EU commissioner for financial services Valdis Dombrovskis said  declining to comment further Under the agreement  shareholders with annual incomes below 35 000 euros  30 074 23 pounds  and assets worth less than 100 000 euros would be automatically compensated for their losses in past bank rescues  the official said The deal would notably benefit Italian savers forced to buy bank shares in exchange for mortgages in what appears to have been fraudulent transactions  but its critics say it is unlikely that all those entitled to claim compensation under the wealth criterion were victims of swindling In a March ruling that has been interpreted as a softening of the bail in rules  EU judges overturned a decision the European Commission took in 2014 to block the rescue of Tercas  a small Italian bank  with money from the country s depositor fund  While Brussels could appeal that ruling  the deal with Italy would further weaken the legal framework The agreement would need to be approved by the two parties in Italy s eurosceptic government  which is campaigning for EU elections in May  The anti establishment 5 Star Movement wants even softer terms to compensate those who were allegedly missold bank shares and bonds  an Italian official said  It and the co ruling far right League pressed for generous compensation for bank creditors before last year s national elections in Italy  This story has been refiled to clarify threshold applies to capital  not just property   Reporting by Francesco Guarascio  additional reporting by Valentina Za in Milan  editing by John Stonestreet  

SARAJEVO   Bosnian prosecutors said on Friday they would investigate Security Minister Dragan Mektic for revealing secret information and giving false statements related to a case of alleged recruitment of Bosnians by Croatian intelligence and diplomats  Last month Mektic publicly confirmed a media report that Croatian intelligence officers had tried to recruit Bosnians who worked in EU countries to stash arms near mosques used by followers of the Salafi branch of Islam in Bosnia to show they were arming themselves  Croatia strongly denied the allegations Mektic said the operation was intended to prove allegations by Croatian President Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic about a danger posed by  thousands of fighters returning to Bosnia from Syria and Iraq   Mektic has repeatedly denied suggestions that radical Bosnian Muslims pose a significant terrorist threat to Europe The news site Zurnal  which published the report  said a Bosnian government official and a journalist linked with a Croatian diplomat serving in Bosnia had been involved in the recruitment drive Mektic said the government official and the journalist were relatives of Bosnian Chief Prosecutor Gordana Tadic  information later confirmed by the two men Tadic s office promptly launched an investigation into the case and questioned all persons involved  including a Zurnal journalist and Mektic  Earlier this week  the prosecutors cleared the officials who were allegedly involved in the affair  saying there was no basis to pursue their investigation But they will continue to collaborate on the matter with Croatia and Slovenia after the investigation unearthed new details in the recruiting case  the prosecutor s office said The office said it would investigate Mektic because he had collected confidential information  distributed it to unauthorized persons and then given false statements both to the public and to the prosecution with  grave consequences for the security  rule of law and reputation of Bosnia and Herzegovina  Mektic  who has long criticized the prosecution for not tackling cases of serious crime and corruption  dismissed these allegations and accused the prosecution of being led by private interests in the investigation  This is a farce   he told an urgently convened news conference  adding he did not expect anything to emerge from an investigation he said was devised  only to mislead the public  This week the European Union launched an initiative to monitor Bosnia s law enforcement agencies and courts  The judiciary in ethnically divided Bosnia has been long criticized as ineffective and subject to political pressure Bosnian Muslims generally practise a moderate form of Islam  but some have adopted radical Salafi Islam from foreign fighters who came to the country during its 1992 95 war to fight alongside Muslims against Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats    Reporting by Daria Sito Sucic  Editing by Gareth Jones

WASHINGTON   President Trump s personal lawyer on Friday asserted Mr  Trump s right as a citizen to keep his tax returns private and told the Treasury Department not to hand the returns over to House Democrats  foreshadowing what has the potential to be a far reaching legal fight that could reach the Supreme Court The lawyer  William S  Consovoy  argued that Democrats who have demanded to see Mr  Trump s tax information had no legitimate legislative reason to request it and that Representative Richard E  Neal s decision this week to ask for six years of the president s personal and business returns flouts  fundamental constitutional constraints   He also called it a  gross abuse of power   Even if Ways and Means had a legitimate committee purpose for requesting the president s tax returns and return information  that purpose is not driving Chairman Neal s request   the lawyer wrote  referring to Mr  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  who leads the House Ways and Means Committee   His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech   Read the lawyer s letter  Mr  Consovoy s views have no direct bearing on the case  The little known tax code provision employed by the Democrats in demanding Mr  Trump s returns says only that the Internal Revenue Service  shall furnish  the information  giving it and its parent agency  the Treasury Department  little leeway in deciding how to respond Democrats anticipate that the Trump administration could present an argument similar to the one made on Friday by Mr  Consovoy  namely that Mr  Neal s request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and  based on past court precedent  must respect Mr  Trump s right to privacy Nonetheless  the length and forcefulness of Mr  Consovoy s letter underscores what is at stake for a president who has defied modern political norms by refusing to voluntarily release his tax returns  If Mr  Neal prevails and gains access to the president s long hidden returns  it would allow Democrats for the first time to peek past Mr  Trump s public claims about his wealth and investments and into the heart of his personal and business finances The I R S  and Treasury Department have given no indication of how they view the request since it was made on Wednesday  Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  told Congress last month he would consult with his legal team and follow the law when a request was made  He will most likely face questions about the request again next week when he returns to Capitol Hill to discuss the department s budget Mr  Trump has indicated in recent days that he is ready to fight to keep his financial information private  Asked on Friday if he was confident he would succeed  Mr  Trump offered an ambiguous prediction  Oh  I don t know   he said   That s up to whoever handles it  I don t know  Hey  I m under audit  But that s up to whoever it is  From what I understand  the law is 100 percent on my side  Mr  Neal made the request through an obscure but frequently used provision of the federal tax code   Section 6103   that allows Congress s tax writing committees to view tax information on any filer  The authority is regularly used by the committee to confidentially measure how changes to the tax code would affect different types of taxpayers  It has been used for more investigative purposes  as well  most recently in 2014  when committee Republicans obtained and publicly released tax information as part of an investigation into whether the I R S  discriminated against conservative entities seeking tax exempt status But there is little precedent for using it to examine the returns of a president without his consent Mr  Neal gave the I R S  until next week to comply  If it does not  the House could go to court to try to enforce the request   a process that legal experts said could take years to sort out   The Supreme Court has flagged twice now that it is unclear as to whether a congressional committee can sue the president and force the executive branch to do something   said Andy Grewal  a University of Iowa law school professor   I think we are a very long way from getting an answer over legitimate legislative purpose  After months of speculation  the back and forth was initiated on Wednesday when Mr  Neal formally requested that the I R S  hand over six years of Mr  Trump s personal and business tax returns as part of what he said was a committee oversight investigation of tax law enforcement  Even if Mr  Neal does get access to the information  it would not automatically become public because the committee would have to vote to disclose anything it sees In making his request  Mr  Neal jettisoned issues  like possible tax fraud  that Democrats have warned that Mr  Trump may be hiding  instead saying that he wanted to examine audit procedures for a president Mr  Neal worked closely with House lawyers to prepare the request to hold up against legal challenge  He framed the request as part of the Ways and Means Committee s oversight of  the extent to which the I R S  audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president   Under I R S  policy  the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year  This request is about policy  not politics   Mr  Neal said at the time   My preparations were made on my own track and timeline  entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration  Daniel Rubin  a spokesman for Mr  Neal  declined to comment on Friday s letter Mr  Consovoy said that Mr  Neal s stated justification only thinly veiled what Democrats were really after  political gain  They have demanded for years that Mr  Trump release his tax returns  Mr  Consovoy argued  and they promised to use the House majority to find out whether the president had undertaken financial fraud  Once this Pandora s box is opened  the ensuing tit for tat will do lasting damage to our nation   Mr  Consovoy wrote Though he was defending Mr  Trump s privacy rights as a taxpayer  his arguments also closely mirrored those used by Republicans in Congress who have argued against making the request  If Chairman Neal genuinely wants to review how the I R S  audits presidents  why is he seeking tax returns and return information covering the four years before President Trump took office   Mr  Consovoy asked   Why is he not requesting information about the audits of previous presidents  Mr  Consovoy s argument bears similarity to one made by other Trump lawyers throughout the course of the obstruction of justice investigation led by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  In that case  the president s lawyers repeatedly argued that he did not lose his rights as a citizen by dint of being the commander in chief  Those included his rights to free speech  his lawyers argued  a point echoed in the letter sent on Friday Mr  Grewal said he thought Mr  Consovoy raised a valid objection about the legitimacy of Mr  Neal s investigation  but cautioned that his letter was  part of public relations and advocacy  as opposed to any kind of official action  that would affect the case George K  Yin  a tax law professor at the University of Virginia  disagreed  He said Mr  Neal s argument was cleverly framed  particularly in light of a relevant past use of Section 6103 by Congress in examining whether President Richard M  Nixon had properly paid his taxes  There is an inherent conflict of interest when the agency is responsible for auditing its boss   he said Facing questions about his own tax obligations  Nixon asked Congress to investigate whether he had taken improper tax positions as president  Using materials he handed over and referencing Section 6103  Congress found that despite being audited by the I R S   Nixon had significantly underpaid After Nixon and his immediate successor  Gerald R  Ford  all American presidents until Mr  Trump voluntarily released their taxes

ImagePresident Trump spoke at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner in Washington on Tuesday  mentioning health care as one of the topics he wanted the party to focus on CreditPool photo by Ron SachsWe don t know what will emerge as President Trump s plan to replace Obamacare  which he has promised to unveil immediately after the 2020 elections  But he has recently endorsed several proposals  and they could provide clues Over the last two weeks  he has sought to re emphasize health care as an issue  after a set of bruising legislative defeats in 2017  He directed the Justice Department not to defend the Affordable Care Act against a legal challenge  And he issued statements and tweets calling for Republicans to become  the party of health care   at a moment when many of his party s leaders had hoped to focus on different issues He also began reprising various promises about what a future plan to repeal and replace parts of the Affordable Care Act might achieve  The plan  short on specifics  will come with  far lower premiums  costs    deductibles   he said this week in a series of tweets  He promised that any Republican health plan would protect Americans with pre existing health conditions  a major concern of voters that Democrats effectively exploited in the 2018 midterm elections After his election  President Trump made similar promises  saying that the Republican proposal would be  far less expensive and far better  than Obamacare  The legislation that came later  and earned his endorsement  would have made insurance less expensive  but only for certain groups of young  high income  healthy Americans  The bills would have also eliminated coverage for millions of people by scaling back Medicaid  and would have made it harder for those with pre existing illnesses   and those who are older with low incomes   to find meaningful affordable options if they didn t get insurance from work The three senators he has chosen to lead the effort   Bill Cassidy of Louisiana  John Barrasso of Wyoming and Rick Scott of Florida   have so far also declined to point to many specifics  When asked about an Obamacare replacement this week  they mentioned their more modest bills to reduce health care costs in the emergency room and at the drugstore   A fourth senator the president has mentioned  the majority leader  Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  has been even more clear that he has little interest in pursuing comprehensive health care legislation  One clue to Mr  Trump s thinking is the choice of Mr  Cassidy  Along with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  he was the author of a legislative plan that received some scrutiny in 2017 but never came up for a vote  Another hint can be found in the president s own budget  released just before his reinvigorated health care push  A third is a draft proposal developed by a group of conservative Washington policy groups The Graham Cassidy billThe president has spoken fondly several times about this proposal  which did not have enough support in Congress to advance to a vote  It would eliminate current programs funding Obamacare s Medicaid expansion  which covers the working poor  and insurance subsidies helping low  and middle income Americans buy their insurance  Instead  that money would be grouped together  then parceled out to states to use in the service of health care programs they favor The legislation attaches some rules to how the money can be used   it must go toward health care  for example   but its main goal is to provide states with maximum flexibility to develop local and innovative solutions   Some experts worry that states could struggle to develop such plans on the bill s abbreviated timetable  That flexibility would allow states  if they so chose  to waive Obamacare s rules that plans must cover a standard set of medical benefits  and that insurers must charge the same prices to customers with different health histories  It would be easy for states to circumvent current protections for Americans with pre existing conditions  That ability would be at odds with the president s recent promises to protect such rules  The bill would also restructure the Medicaid program  even for populations that were enrolled in the program before Obamacare The bill s formula for allocating money among the states would also lead to big redistributions  generally taking money away from states that have expanded Medicaid  toward those that have not  It would also restrict the growth of the block grants over time  Those funding formulas  while technical  make a big difference in the impact of the program  It would result in substantial funding shortfalls for several large states nearly immediately  and leave nearly every state in a funding crunch over the long term The budgetBecause the 2020 White House budget was developed and published by the White House itself  it is perhaps the most useful clue about how the president imagines a world without Obamacare  Like the Graham Cassidy proposal  it includes block grants to the states to replace the Obamacare coverage expansion  and it replaces the remainder of Medicaid with a set of fixed payments to states But the rate at which the different grants would grow over time would be even smaller than under the legislation   to make the system more efficient  The budget is vague about what sorts of insurance regulations would be allowed  but it does note that a tenth of funds would need to be set aside for people with pre existing conditions  a sign that states would be allowed to exclude such people from the mainstream insurance markets The conservative coalition proposalA group of conservative health policy experts  including the Heritage Foundation  has developed a health care proposal that shares a basic structure with the two systems described above  It would hand states blocks of money and a few rules  and encourage them to develop their own health care systems The rules in the conservative plan differ a bit from those in Graham Cassidy  The plan would require that government subsidized systems offer every American a choice of a private health plan  a requirement that would probably foreclose a liberal state from enacting a single payer program and that might require restructuring of some state run Medicaid programs The plan shies away from specifying funding formulas  It doesn t say how the block of money should be divvied up among the states  though it says that states with more low income residents should get a bigger share  It also doesn t specify precisely how quickly the pot of money should grow over time Like the budget proposal  it nods to concerns about Americans with pre existing conditions by encouraging states to develop special programs  like high risk pools  to insure people with expensive health needs  But it also encourages insurance strategies  like discounts for young customers  or stripped down benefit plans  that would tend to make mainstream insurance less useful for people with serious health needs The proposal also leaves the legacy Medicaid program as is  That choice neutralizes one possible political line of attack  But it also substantially diminishes the program s possible cost savings The court case over the Affordable Care Act will be decided on the judiciary s timetable  so it s not clear how long the White House may have to develop a replacement plan  But  since it certainly has at least months  there is time to develop some new proposal more aligned with the president s recent promises Doing so will not be easy  however  Health care in the United States is expensive  which means that health plans that cover everyone with low deductibles are likely to be costly  The block grant plans the president has admired reduce rather than increase current federal spending on health care  Looser rules on health insurance are likely to increase costs on customers unfortunate enough to need care  That makes the block grant approach a troublesome fit with the president s stated desire for a system that Americans find  far less expensive   much more usable than Obamacare

Shahidul Alam traded his Ph D  in Chemistry for what seemed like an uncertain future in photography in his native Bangladesh  But since 1984  he has gone from taking baby pictures to becoming a respected photojournalist  educator  writer and human rights advocate  His images have won numerous awards  and his dedication to press freedom landed him a spot as one of several journalists who were part of Time s Person of the Year in 2018 It also landed him in jail He spent 107 days behind bars for violating a Bangladeshi law prohibiting criticism of the government on digital platforms  Though granted bail after an international outcry  he still faces a possible prison sentence of 14 years Mr  Alam was in New York City recently to receive an Infinity Award from the International Center of Photography and address participants in the New York Portfolio Review  He took advantage of his stay to continue pressing for press freedom in Bangladesh  If you get beaten up and you shut up  then it s O K    he said   The problem in my case was  I didn t shut up  The following interview is from his appearance at the Portfolio Review  where Lens co editor David Gonzalez led a discussion with him and the audience  The interview has been edited for length and clarity      Q  What advice do you have for younger photographers regarding today s professional and political environment A  Most of us worry that we have disadvantages  be it color  location  whatever  we have things we need to deal with  I would turn it around and look at those very things as things that make us unique  things that separate us from the others  And it s remarkable how we tend to overlook that We think  O K   I am a particular type of photographer who is marginalized because these are the things I don t have  But that very thing makes you unique in another way One of the things I talk to our photographers about is to do a resource mapping  And in your resource mapping the things that many people talk about   I have a camera  I have this or that   the fact that you happen to know that person who lives in the corner store who has that connection  whose uncle is something  is a unique advantage that you have that no one else probably has to that extent  Each one of us has some unique advantage Q  Your school educates many young photographers  Yet sometimes photographers ape previous incorrect narratives  How can they go beyond that A  I took on photography because I recognize its power in addressing issues of social change  I was looking for the best tool available  and at that point in time I thought it was photography  Photography continues to be a very powerful tool  though if I were starting today I would probably look at social media as well If I was to be effective in bringing about social change  I needed more warriors  So if you need more warriors  you build your soldiers  you train them  And that s what the school was about  So the school took photography but not for the purpose of teaching shutter speeds and F stops  but why one uses photography  why photography matters Right from the beginning  our emphasis has been on critical thinking  on analysis  on working out how one engages with those situations and how one uses photography  So I think while we teach the techniques  like you have to do at any level  I think right from the beginning students are considering why they do what they do ImageA Rohingya man with his daughter at Sadar Hospital in Bangladesh in November 2017 CreditShahidul Alam DrikQ  How do you get someone to start getting at their motivations  the why that they re doing it  and how they develop their own perspective A  One of the things being done is constantly provoke the students  Push them  Test out their ideas  So one of the things they have to do is defend their ideas  None of us has a problem with their thinking differently  but we do have a problem with not being able to defend your position  And it is through that that you actually sharpen not only your photographic skills  but your logical skills  your argumentative skills  your persuasion skills  and at the end of the day you are being judged on the basis of how convincing you are to that other person  If as a communicator you cannot get your own ideas across  how are you going to get them across to other people Q  Going beyond diversity of photographers  how do you address representation in mass media  especially of people of color or marginalized communities A  It doesn t really matter what you re photographing  make sure that you do it with respect and with dignity  It might sound that I have problems with white press and photographers coming to our country and taking pictures  I don t What I do have problems with is them having a monopoly on my story  But my point of view needs to be challenged just as much as everyone else s  I suffer from the same blind spots that other people do  I also have biases and prejudices and they need to be questioned Plurality within the media is what gives it that richness  But having said that  I think coming back to being able to be respectful of the people around you  and that really is where the diversity comes in because often the stories are about people who are in a particular situation and a particular point of view in a particular crisis perhaps  and someone who knows them  understands them  empathizes with them  is far better placed to tell that story  And it is that empathy that you bring in that makes it unique Because at the end of the day  it is the person who holds the narrative who determines what the story is about  And we as photographers are those other people who hold that narrative  We are in a very powerful position  The onus is upon us to ensure that the story that we tell is respectful  is authentic  is what tells the story as it should be said  and does it with dignity  That should be our guiding mantra  Not what some other great photographer has done Q  Tell us about your legal case A  One of the things we were very concerned about was that a lot of people were getting disappeared and when they came out they said nothing  And some of these were our friends and we wanted to find out  and my partner and I decided we would make this a project where we try and find out what happened to people when they disappeared I didn t realize I was going be the guinea pig and find out for myself Initially there were road accidents  A lot of students came out into the streets protesting  An Al Jazeera journalist asked me  Why such an outcry over road accidents   The point is  road accidents wasn t the point  there was a lot of anger over a whole range of things happening  and this was the valve that let it through  And the students came out into the streets in protest I was taking pictures on the 4th of August  I got attacked  my equipment got smashed up  I got beaten up  because what the government did was they unleashed their goons to beat up the students  And that s what I was photographing  so  that s why they got upset The following day I continued reporting  I did my Facebook live updates and whatever  And then there was the interview on Al Jazeera  I finished the interview  then I m uploading the material  I was actually talking to a BBC journalist for the interviewers getting ready for the next day  and the doorbell rings  I m the only one in the house  and I look through the peephole  there s a young woman with short hair and she calls me Uncle Shahidul  like this sort of  you know  one of my students  I opened the door  and then all these people from behind come up and there s a huge number and I realized straightaway what s happening ImageMr  Alam making a court appearance in Dhaka in 2018 CreditMunir Uz Zaman Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesQ  And then A  My first concern is that I want people to know this is happening because if they quietly take me away and people come into the house and find   Oh he s not there  what s happening   by then too much time has passed  Those few minutes were very  very critical  So I screamed  I resisted  I did as much as I could to get attention  It didn t delay or stop them  but it alerted people and then they knew something was happening by the time they came down I d been picked up and handcuffed  blindfolded  taken away  But the buttons had been pressed  And that alert started to go around very very quickly I was taken in  I was tortured  the following day I was taken to Police Headquarters  and offered a deal  So I realized that this is what happens  You get this treatment and then you re offered the deal  and generally you accept the deal  And the deal is   We forget anything that happens  you go away  we drop you home  you stop speaking   So essentially  your freedom at the cost of your voice Q  But you didn t stay quiet A  I wasn t expecting it to happen at that time  but those are the risks we take  I was doing what we had collectively felt was each one s duty  Essentially  the government had played out every trump card they had  This trick was  you give them hell  they cow down  and they stay quiet  If that doesn t work  then in court they stay quiet  If that doesn t work  you put them in remand and they stay quiet  If that doesn t work you put them in jail  And what happens in jail is usually the family then calls a press conference  gives a plea to the prime minister for magnanimity and the prime minister releases the person through her largess  and the person comes out and thanks the prime minister None of that happened  I m in jail 107 days  so much pressure that they eventually have to let me go  Outside of jail I continue doing exactly what I was doing before  I said what needed to be said  I continue to say what needs to be said I arrived yesterday at the airport  the first thing I did was to give an interview to a local Bangladeshi media on Infotube because in Bangladesh the mainstream media has largely abdicated  They no longer report as reporters have mostly become spokespeople for the government  So today  the alternative space is social media  And one of the most well followed pieces is this Bangladeshi channel called Bangladesh Infotube  So I made contact  they came to the airport to receive me  Before I did anything else  we did that interview and then I went on to other things  And I will continue to do that  That is my job  It involves risks and I think one of the things one needs to recognize is  as a journalist  your job is to stay at the edge  It s where the heat is  if you go too far you get singed  You can t walk too far back  you re inactive  So that edge where you re feeling the heat constantly is the only place where you belong Q  How did you spend your time in jail A  Over the 107 days I was there  one of the things I was able to do with the help of other prisoners  we had murals drawn  faces  on the walls of the jail  so there are over 40 murals painted on all the side walls  One picture some of you may have seen  a picture of the red sailboat  which is quite a well known picture of mine that s been on National Geographic and many other places  The prisoners painted that as homage to me on the wall  so there it is  that s my proudest publication  They told me  could we have musical instruments  So I sent out an appeal  Friends of mine sent musical instruments  They formed a band  I ve got messages that they ve written 40 new songs  they re recording  We planted a vegetable patch so they now have fresh vegetables  We started adult education classes  We now have over 200 students and the hall cannot accommodate everyone  In the band  the warden s joined the band and become a guitarist in the band  So we can turn the whole thing around  Every opportunity you have  you turn it around ImageA barber in Balakot  Pakistan  resumed business after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake CreditShahidul AlamQ  Are other Bangladeshi photographers in jail  who deal with social issues  who are also imprisoned or were imprisoned A  There are many people who gave likes on my Facebook post and shared my Facebook post who are still in jail  Now we are challenging the validity of section 57 2  which is what I was accused of  Essentially  it means that if someone in electronic media  digital platform  says something which goes against the government or offends their sensibility   it s a very sweeping thing   the government can arrest people without warrant We did protest against it and the government replaced that bill with the digital security act  which is actually worse  But what has happened is  despite the fact that that particular law has been repealed  people like me still have been jailed on the basis of it  And if  as seems plausible now  the court rules in my favor  that would open an entire floodgate where all these people who are in jail will then be able to be released Q  Does the spotlight that you are in right now affect your own photography A  I m still in danger  The case still hangs so I still potentially face 14 years in prison  More significantly  on an everyday level  the way I operate is very different  I go around on my bicycle  I stop in the street  I talk to people  I work in a very organic manner  Now it s no longer safe for me to do that because when I was being attacked on the 4th of August  I was just one person taking pictures Now the spotlight means that I am visible and they know that I am a threat to the government  So there are lots of people out there who would want to get Brownie points  Getting rid of a bad guy would give them credit with the government  So I can t take that risk  so I m not cycling  I don t walk on my own  I m never on my own  I drive to places  I have other people with me  And that all just impinges on the way I work and what I can do Q  Journalists in the United States benefit from a certain level of protection where we don t necessarily have to think about a lot of these things when we re working in the States  Does your role shift when you re here  and should we be thinking about our role differently A  You say you re in a position of better protection  I think you suffer from a level of complacency  If I were in this place  I would really worry a lot more  The average American   it might not be true for some of you   but when I talk to people in the street  I m amazed by how ignorant they generally are People in Bangladesh are far more politically savvy  Honestly  over here  the issues are far more about houses and mortgages and careers and all this sort of thing and not about the bigger issues  There are not that many people who engage with the world as such  not many people know the rest of the world  The problem here really is we are in a zone of comfort to such an extent that we re insulated from that position  and that to me is a bigger fear If I were here  I would need to work a lot harder to ensure that I was still at the edge  because stepping back is so much easier  And no one worries about it  you re applauded for doing well in your career  you re applauded for having that mortgage  you re applauded for building a house or whatever else  The fact that you ve not done what you were meant to do  that as journalist your position is to be there on the line Honestly  I feel fortunate that I am in a country like Bangladesh as a journalist  because I don t need to look for a cause  I m surrounded by them ImageMr  Alam when he was released from jail in Dhaka last November

CROSBY  Texas WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump signed two executive orders in the heart of the Texas energy hub on Wednesday targeting the power of states to delay natural gas  coal and oil projects as he looks to build support ahead of next year s election Trump s orders direct his Environmental Protection Agency to change a part of the U S  clean water law that has allowed states to delay projects on environmental grounds  New York has delayed pipelines that would bring natural gas to New England  for example  and Washington state has stopped coal export terminals  My action today will cut through destructive permitting delays and denials     what takes you 20 years to get a permit  those days are gone   said Trump  surrounded by workers in hard hats and yellow vests He signed the orders at a training center for petroleum industry workers near Houston  an event sandwiched between fundraising events for the 2020 presidential campaign  Critics vowed to oppose Trump s actions  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the orders were a  gross overreach of federal authority that undermines New York s ability to protect our water quality and our environment   Any attempt to usurp state authority on the projects will be fought  tooth and nail   the Democrat said Chris Stockton  a spokesman for Williams Cos Inc  which has fought Cuomo s denial of its Constitution gas pipeline from Pennsylvania  said the company supported Trump s effort to  foster coordination  predictability and transparency in federal environmental review  The orders direct the EPA to review and update guidance issued during the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama on the so called 401 provision of the Clean Water Act  The measure required companies to get certifications from states before building interstate pipelines and projects approved by the federal government  In 2017  Washington Governor Jay Inslee  a Democrat and 2020 candidate for president  used the provision to block a permit for the Millennium Bulk Terminal  a coal export facility that would have expanded the ability of companies to send Western coal to Asian markets Inslee  who has centered his campaign on tackling climate change  said Trump s orders would put the country on a  fatal path  of unconstrained fossil fuel use and hold back clean energy development  EVERY TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL The orders are part of the Trump administration s  energy dominance  policy to increase oil  gas and coal production  but forcing the EPA changes will take time  A senior administration official told reporters the agency would have to follow normal procedures  including a comment period  and that projects already tied up in litigation  are obviously a much longer term issue   A lawyer with experience in energy regulation in the U S  government said it was unclear how much impact the orders would have  A change in the clean water law s requirement for companies to get permits from the states would have to be made in Congress  said Fred Jauss  a partner at the firm Dorsey   Whitney  Michael Brune  the chief of the Sierra Club  which sues the government frequently  said the group would fight the orders  with every tool at our disposal  One order directs the transportation secretary to propose allowing liquefied natural gas  a liquid form of the fuel  to be shipped in approved rail cars  The orders also give the president the power to issue permits for projects that span international borders  taking that power from the secretary of state  Trump issued a presidential permit last month for the long delayed Keystone XL pipeline to bring crude from Canada Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc supports the orders   focus on enhancing the predictability of the permitting process and the critical importance of investing in energy infrastructure in the U S  and Canada   company spokesman Michael Barnes said  Enbridge had an oil pipeline project from Canada to the United States halted by opposition in Michigan  The orders could also speed projects in Texas  Energy investors vying for permits to build oil export terminals along the Gulf Coast say they have worked closely with Trump officials in a bid to speed regulatory reviews of facilities capable of loading supertankers  U S  and state agencies overseeing permit applications have taken too long to approve projects  the investors said  adding they were worried their projects would miss the most profitable years of the U S  crude export boom  Four energy groups led by Trafigura AG  Carlyle Group  Enterprise Products Partners LP and Enbridge have applied to build terminals in Texas    Reporting by Jeff Mason in Crosby  Texas and Timothy Gardner in Washington  Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington  Collin Eaton in Houston and Jessica Resnick Ault and Scott Disavino in New York  Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney

When the Hungarian State Opera s white cast of singers came together in Budapest earlier this month to revive a production of George Gershwin s opera  Porgy and Bess   they received letters carrying an unusual request  to declare themselves African American According to the Hungarian news website Index  which said it has seen a copy of the letter  the singers were asked to sign a declaration stating that  African American origins and spirit form an inseparable part  of their identity  At least half the group signed  according to Index The letter was from the Hungarian State Opera s general director  Szilveszter Okovacs  who last year defended the company s decision to perform the work with white singers against the wishes of the Gershwin estate  Porgy and Bess   which premiered in the United States in 1935  tells the story of an African American community s struggles with violence and racism  George Gershwin famously turned down companies that wanted to perform the opera in blackface  and his estate stipulates that the work should be performed by an all black cast The letters seemed to be part of a defiant publicity stunt by Mr  Okovacs  who spoke cryptically and evasively with reporters  In an interview with the Hungarian news network ATV on Monday  Mr  Okovacs said that  Hungary does not keep records of skin color   and therefore he couldn t  tell whether the cast suits that requirement  Speaking to another TV network  Euronews  Mr  Okovacs acknowledged the oddity of his request to the singers   If we have to play on absurd grounds   he said of the Gershwin estate s requirements for the performance   we can t do anything but join the field in absurd outfits  Mr  Okovacs added that he was opposed to allowing  the presence of people in a production to be determined by skin color or ethnicity  A spokesman for the Hungarian State Opera declined to comment Sargent Aborn  the chief executive of Tams Witmark  the New York based agents of the Gershwin estate  said in an email on Tuesday that the Hungarian State Opera production was taking place without a license  Hungarian news media reported that the cast had prepared the current performances with photocopied musical scores Mr  Okovacs told The Times last year that the company had signed a contract with Tams Witmark that didn t contain specifics about the singers  ethnicity  Still  when the production premiered  playbills and posters carried a note stating that the production was taking place without authorization and  contrary to the requirements for the presentation of the work  But on Tuesday  Mr  Aborn of Tams Witmark contested that version of events  He said that after the Hungarian State Opera confirmed  in writing that they understood the need to cast black singers to present the work dramatically  a license was issued for the 2018 production   That license has since expired  It subsequently came to our attention that the production was in clear breach   he said  adding that Tams Witmark and the Gershwins were examining legal options Tams Witmark did not disclose the exact wording of the license agreement  But the founder of the Grange Park Opera in England  Wasfi Kani  spoke to The Times of London about the license her company had obtained for a production there this summer  It does not say the singers have to be black but in effect you cannot have white people playing the main roles or the chorus   Ms  Kani said in January   It is the only work in the canon where you have to sign up for this  We are fishing in a very small pool because there are not that many black opera singers  Mr  Okovacs s programing has previously attracted controversy both at home and abroad  His decision last year to stage  Porgy and Bess  with a white cast received international attention  And in June  the Hungarian State Opera canceled some performances of the musical  Billy Elliot  after a government friendly newspaper columnist called it  gay propaganda  But Mr  Okovacs has led the company through an ambitious program of expansion in recent years  under the patronage of Viktor Orban s far right government  On Monday he announced its 2019 2020 season would be on the theme of Christianity  In an article on the pro government news website Origo  Mr  Okovacs wrote that he had chosen to explore this topic because Christian traditions were at the core of European culture   In Europe  even atheists are Christian   he wrote  a phrase that Mr  Orban has also used The company s new season features 21 new productions  six of which are world premieres  Among them will be a work reflecting on the sacrament of marriage  written by Pope John Paul II when he was a bishop in Poland  a new staging of Handel s  Messiah   and an evening of works inspired by gospel music When Index  the news website  posed questions to Mr  Okovacs about his letters to the cast of  Porgy and Bess   rather than answering them  he came back with 22 questions of his own These included  What color is black  all black cast  on the Pantone scale   and  Could 14 nonwhite artists  who are professionally suitable for the opera stage  live in Hungary today   

This article is part of David Leonhardt s newsletter  You can sign up here to receive it each weekday House Democrats may not be able to force President Trump to release his tax returns  But the Democrats can keep reminding Americans that Trump really does not want the public to know what s in those returns As you probably know by now  all other recent presidents  and presidential nominees  voluntarily released their tax information  Trump has not  Now House Democrats are trying to get access to that information and potentially release portions of it to the public Last week  Richard Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  demanded to see six years of Trump s tax returns  citing a 1924 provision in the tax code that gives Congress the power to obtain any citizen s returns  Neal has given the Internal Revenue Service until Wednesday to hand over the returns to Congress  Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Trump has repeatedly said that he would be happy to release his returns publicly  but that s clearly been a lie  One of his excuses has been the false claim that he can t release them because he is being audited by the I R S  And over the weekend  his administration stopped pretending Trump was telling the truth  Democrats will  never  see them  said Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  on Fox News yesterday   Nor should they   Trump s lawyers have said they will fight the request Why is Trump so afraid of letting people see his tax returns The most innocent possibility is that he isn t nearly as wealthy as he has long boasted  and he s embarrassed by the truth  A less innocent possibility is that he has financial ties that could create political problems for him if those ties became public   for example  ties to Russia or other countries to which his foreign policy has been suspiciously friendly The release of the returns would let  Americans decide whether the president is making decisions that benefit his businesses at the expense of American taxpayers   Aaron Scherb of Common Cause  the government watchdog group  has written in USA Today   If Trump has significant debt to banks and or individuals in certain countries  some of which might be adversaries of the United States  we must know because his foreign policy decisions might be compromised  Seeing the president s tax returns isn t a matter of prurient gossip or mere partisan politics  It s a matter of national interest  So long as Trump is fighting the release  Democrats should keep talking about it For more   I don t see how the pres ident can mount any cred i ble de fense on this   Steve Rosen thal  a senior  fel low at the Tax Pol icy Cen ter  told The Wall Street Journal  referring to Neal s request   I sure don t see any le git i mate grounds for the pres i dent to refuse  es pe cially a re quest that s been so care fully con structed on over sight re spon si bil ity  Bloomberg s Tim O Brien   one of the few journalists who s seen some of Trump s tax returns  after Trump sued O Brien over a book years ago   argues that Neal s request doesn t go far enough   Some of the transactions that may interest investigators the most took place around 15 years ago  when Trump  suddenly flush with cash  went on a shopping spree   O Brien writes   It is still curious to me how Trump  who always used to finance his transactions with debt  raised the funds to do all that in the mid 2000s and pay cash  Separately  legislators in New York State are trying to obtain Trump s state tax returns which  likely contain much of the same financial information as a federal return   Jesse McKinley of The Times writes In a February Quinnipiac University poll  67 percent of American voters said Trump should publicly release his tax returns  versus 24 percent who said he shouldn t  Run  Joe  runThe Washington Post s E J  Dionne has a pithy description of why Joe Biden should run for president   He represents important components of the coalition that will have to come together to defeat the president   Dionne writes   He could help Democrats solve a strategic dilemma  how to be tough as nails on Trump while still promising the more harmonious political future that middle of the road voters long for  And if he fails  the ultimate nominee will be far better off for having faced down Biden and not be haunted by the ghost of a candidacy that never was  If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter  you can subscribe here  You can also join me on Twitter   DLeonhardt  and Facebook Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram

JERUSALEM   Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main challenger Benny Gantz claimed victory in Israel s election but early results indicated on Wednesday the veteran right wing leader was on course for a record fifth term Partial results with 95 percent of votes counted showed Netanyahu s Likud party tied with Gantz s centrist Blue and White Party with 35 parliamentary seats each  the Knesset website and Israeli Channel 12 said Though neither party captured a ruling majority in the 120 member Knesset  the partial results put Netanyahu in a strong position to form a coalition government with right wing factions  key to an ultimate victory  It is a night of colossal victory   the 69 year old Netanyahu told cheering supporters in a late night speech at Likud headquarters  while cautioning that a  long night and possibly day  lay ahead awaiting official results Fireworks flared behind him as his wife Sara applauded and kissed him   He s a magician   the crowd chanted If he wins  Netanyahu  69  will be on track to be the longest serving prime minister in Israel s 71 year history  Netanyahu said he had already begun talks with prospective coalition allies Netanyahu  in power consecutively since 2009  has been fighting for his political survival  The closely contested race was widely seen in Israel as a referendum on his character and record in the face of corruption allegations He faces possible indictment in three graft cases  and has denied wrongdoing in all three  According to the partial results  Likud won 5 more seats than in the previous election in 2015 Rival Gantz  59  earlier also claimed victory  citing preliminary exit polls that showed his party had won more seats than Likud  We are the victors   said Gantz  a former military chief fighting his first election   We want to thank Benjamin Netanyahu for his service to the nation   Political analysts cautioned it was too early to be certain of the outcome  with many hours to go before a final tally is in  Ofer Zalzberg  senior analyst with the International Crisis Group  said Likud and Blue and White would have to learn the fate of smaller parties to know whether they had garnered enough support for a coalition  Netanyahu is more likely to establish another right wing government  but we will have to wait and see   he said  NETANYAHU HIGHLIGHTS TRUMP TIESDuring the campaign  the rival parties accused each other of corruption  fostering bigotry and being soft on security Netanyahu highlighted his close relationship with U S  President Donald Trump  who delighted Israelis and angered Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital in 2017 and moving the American Embassy to the holy city last May Two weeks before the election  Trump signed a proclamation  with Netanyahu at his side at the White House  recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war In a rare turn during the race towards the Israeli Palestinian conflict  Netanyahu further alarmed Palestinians by promising to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re elected  Palestinians seek a state there and in the Gaza Strip  with East Jerusalem as its capital During the campaign  Gantz said a government under his stewardship would pursue peace  but stopped short of committing to the establishment of a Palestinian state Commenting on the election  Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said   Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo  They have said no to peace and yes to the occupation  Israeli Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014 A close result in the election would put smaller parties in a powerful position  turning marginal political figures into kingmakers Once the votes are tallied  President Reuven Rivlin will ask parties that have won parliamentary seats who they support for prime minister  He will then pick a party leader to try to form a coalition  giving the candidate 28 days to do so  with a two week extension if needed One factor may be the turnout of voters from Israel s 21 percent Arab minority  Many were angered by Israel s nation state law  passed in 2018  which declared that only Jews have the right of self determination in the country  Netanyahu supported the legislation Netanyahu s party sent monitors equipped with body cameras to a number of polling stations with Arab constituents on election day  Arab politicians condemned the move as voter intimidation   Additional reporting by Rami Ayyub in Rosh Ha ayin  Ron Bousso and Rawan Sheikh Ahmad in Haifa  Rahaf Ruby  Stephen Farrell  Dan Williams and Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem  Editing by Mark Heinrich  Sonya Hepinstall and Michael Perry

GENEVA   The United Nations expressed alarm on Friday about civilian deaths and other developing consequences from an escalating conflict between Myanmar s military  which undertook a brutally violent military campaign against the Rohingya ethnic group  and an insurgent group in a western border region Ravina Shamdasani  a spokeswoman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  said on Friday that the agency believed the violence in Rakhine State had also resulted in destroyed property  arbitrary arrests and abductions in civilian areas  She said that the fighting had displaced over 20 000 people Ms  Shamdasani said that at least seven civilians were killed on Wednesday  when two military helicopters bombed and strafed villagers who were tending cattle and working in rice fields  Eighteen more people were injured  The Myanmar military is again carrying out attacks against its own civilians   Ms  Shamdasani said  adding that the attacks  may constitute war crimes  The attacks are in area of western Myanmar that in 2017 was the site of much of the violence that Myanmar s military perpetrated against the Rohingya  which prompted more than 700 000 members of the ethnic group to flee into neighboring Bangladesh  Myanmar has said that its military was merely responding to attacks by Rohingya militants  but United Nations officials called the actions genocide  and said that top generals should face trial in an international court United Nations Secretary General Antnio Guterres this week appointed Nicholas Koumjian  an American prosecutor with more than 20 years  experience in international criminal justice  to lead a special investigative body tasked with preparing case files for prosecuting the most serious crimes arising from the campaign But the latest violence largely involves a the Arakan Army  a guerrilla force from the Buddhist ethnic group that makes up the majority population in Rakhine State and finds support among those who feel neglected by the central government Arakan Army fighters ambushed border posts in January  and are said to have killed 13 police officers and injured nine more  In response  the Myanmar military deployed thousands of extra troops   reportedly including some of the units involved in the 2017 violence   and launched counterinsurgency operations backed by fighter jets and helicopter gunships It also restricted access to northern Rakhine State  Ms  Shamdasani said that humanitarian aid efforts were struggling to reach those displaced by the violence She added that United Nations officials were also concerned that fighting had moved from the sparsely populated countryside into urban areas  posing a greater risk to civilians The Arakan Army has taken up positions in a number of civilian areas and carried out attacks targeting the police and government officials  Ms  Shamdasani said  We expect the violence to escalate   she added  

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen behind his main challenger in opinion polls ahead of next week s Israeli election but still has an easier path to form a government that would keep him in power for a record fifth term Netanyahu  who has dominated Israeli politics for a generation  is fighting for his political survival against former top general Benny Gantz  a political novice The outcome is unlikely to be decided on election day  when voters cast ballots for party lists  No party has ever won an outright majority in the 120 seat parliament  meaning days or even weeks of coalition negotiations will lie ahead And looming criminal indictments against Netanyahu  who has denied any wrongdoing in three cases of alleged bribery and fraud  could cloud his political future and that of any government he might head  possibly leading to a new election On Friday  the last day polling is allowed  Gantz s centrist Blue and White party was projected to take 30 seats  more than the 26 forecast for Netanyahu s right wing Likud  according to a poll in Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper But the poll also projected a combined total of 63 seats for the parties in Netanyahu s right wing bloc  a slim but workable majority  Other polls showed similar results  The coalition arithmetic for Gantz appears far more difficult Israel s president  Reuven Rivlin  will consult with the leaders of every party represented in parliament and choose whoever he believes has the best chance of forming a coalition  The nominee has up to 42 days to form a government before the president asks another politician to try In the final stretch of the campaign  Netanyahu cautioned his right wing supporters against over confidence   It s a close race between right and left   he told Israel Radio on Thursday Gantz appeared invigorated by the polling numbers on Friday  telling his backers they were  a few meters away from victory   On Tuesday  everything you see here in this country will shift   Gantz told a rally in Kiryat Ekron SHADOW OF CORRUPTIONNetanyahu has fought the campaign under the shadow of the public announcement in February by Israel s attorney general that he intends to indict him No charges have yet been brought and there will be a pre trial hearing at which Netanyahu can challenge any findings  If indicted  he is under no obligation to quit  but he would need coalition partners to stand by him to avert a new election  Netanyahu s supreme and indeed only imperative will be to cobble together an indictment coalition  one that will make it possible for him to continue to serve even after the hearing and after he s indicted   political analyst Yossi Verter wrote in the liberal Israeli daily Ha aretz on Friday That could include efforts  promoted by some Netanyahu loyalists  to pass a law to ban the indictment of a sitting prime minister  Some potential coalition allies have publicly balked at such legislation  including at least one cabinet minister   and potential successor   in Netanyahu s own party Netanyahu s opponents have campaigned hard on the corruption issue  producing posters  car bumper stickers and election rally banners bearing the words  CRIME MINISTER  CAMPAIGN STRATEGYWith Israeli Palestinian peace talks frozen since 2014  personalities and personal attacks have dominated an election campaign that has largely skated over war and peace issues that once dominated Israeli political debate Netanyahu has cast Gantz  a former military chief  as a weak leftist who would endanger Israel s security by giving territorial concessions to the Palestinians Gantz professes a commitment to peace while giving no clear indication whether he would support the Palestinian goal of statehood in territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war Netanyahu has also highlighted his close relationship with U S  President Donald Trump  who overturned decades of U S  policy and international consensus to move the U S  embassy to Jerusalem and recognize it as Israel s capital Netanyahu visited Trump last month  At the meeting  Trump  in what was widely seen as a bid to boost Netanyahu  again broke with long term policy to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  also captured in 1967 In Jerusalem  Hezi Levy  60  a taxi driver  said he backed Netanyahu   The most important thing in the world is that the left will not assume power  God forbid   he said But other voters deplored recent scandals   The focus is on the corruption that s happening politically   said Ayelet Noff  43  a public relations manager from Tel Aviv  a Gantz supporter who said she wanted more attention paid to the economy   Reporting by Rami Ayyub and Stephen Farrell  Editing by Peter Graff

If  at more than a year long  the race to elect the president of the United States is an ultramarathon  Australia s campaign season is a sprint Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia fired the proverbial starting pistol on Thursday  declaring a federal election for May 18 and kicking off a 38 day dash to the ballot box counting today and Election Day  There is so much at stake at this election   Mr  Morrison said at a news conference in Canberra  emphasizing his party s platform focused on economic issues and tax cuts  There is more to do   he added   and a lot has got done  It s still not clear exactly how many days of campaigning will be allowed  the Labor Party leader  Bill Shorten  has called for a campaigning ban on at least two holidays between now and Election Day But clearly  Australia s race will be quick  By contrast  the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States lasted 596 days  counting from the date of the first major candidate s official declaration to Election Day  The 2020 campaign  one of the longest in history  is set to last 1 194 days   the equivalent of more than 30 Australian election seasons The election comes at a critical time for Australia  an American ally  which is torn on important issues such as climate change and how to contend with China s rise On the surface  a shorter campaign period would seem to prevent voter fatigue and limit the extent to which questionable financial contributions can muddy the process  But experts say campaigns of even a few weeks are marred by many of the same problems seen in longer elections Ultimately  a shorter campaign has less to do with perfecting the process and more to do with simply speeding it up What determines a campaign s length The length of a campaign can be boiled down in most democracies to this question  Are you electing a president or a prime minister  Put another way  Are you voting for an individual who you need time to get to know  or are you voting for a legislating party that is headed by a leader with whom you re already familiar Because the parties in the parliamentary system choose their candidates for prime minister   in the case of Australia s main parties  Scott Morrison of the Liberal Party and Bill Shorten of Labor   there is no need for months of vetting  debates or primaries ImagePrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia  center  had to call an election before June CreditSam Mooy EPA  via ShutterstockA 2015 study  analyzing more than 26 000 polls in 45 countries since 1942  found that voters  preferences take much longer to form in a presidential election than a parliamentary one because presidential voters need more time to assess the candidates Parliamentary systems also differ from presidential republics in the frequency with which elections can be called  In a presidential system  the term of office is fixed  and campaigning for the next election effectively starts when the last election ends But in a parliamentary system  general elections can be called more regularly and with less notice  To avoid lengthy gaps without a government  many countries have laws limiting the duration of a campaign How does Australia stack up Australian campaigns last between 33 and 68 days  That s short by American standards but an eternity compared to Singapore  a country that has been governed by the same party for five decades  and which gives voters just nine days to choose a candidate Campaigns in Japan run for 12 days  In France  campaigning before the first round of voting can last no more than two weeks  The campaign period in Canada lasts about 36 days  in Britain five to six weeks and in Israel 101 days Like Australia  those counties all have legally fixed campaign periods According to John Keane  a professor of politics at the University of Sydney and author of  The Life and Death of Democracy   the writers of Australia s Constitution had good reason to limit the length of campaigns The writers feared  that since the House of Representatives would usually not last three years from the time of its first meeting  and since sitting governments and politicians in search of victory might be tempted to string out election campaigns  good government would suffer   Professor Keane said They also worried  he added  that  abuse of power and political discontinuity would get the upper hand  Hence the need to place strict time limits on election campaigns  Why now Members of Australia s lower house of Parliament  the House of Representatives  have to face voters every three years  and the last general election was held in 2016  To meet the time frame  Mr  Morrison had to declare an election before June Mr  Morrison has been in power since August  but this is the first time he will face voters as the head of the Liberal Party  He took office after a party putsch  known as a leadership spill  that ousted his predecessor  Malcolm Turnbull By law  the election cannot coincide with state elections or holidays  and has to take place on a Saturday ImageLawmakers at Parliament House in Canberra in November CreditTracey Nearmy Getty ImagesDoes compulsory voting result in less partisanship Saturday elections and a contracted campaign period are Australian traditions meant to increase voter engagement and turnout  Similarly  Australians are required by law to vote and are fined if they do not Compulsory voting clearly increases participation  but the data is mixed on whether it entrenches partisanship  One 2012 study found that  compulsory voting boosts the likelihood that one will identify with a party and  in turn  the strength of party attachments  But in her book  From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage  How Australia Got Compulsory Voting   Judith Brett  an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University in Melbourne  Australia  argues that voters are increasingly disenchanted with the major political parties More than ever  Professor Brett writes  Australians are splitting their votes between parties in House and Senate elections  Without compulsory voting   she writes   many disillusioned voters would turn away from politics altogether and stop voting  Does a shorter campaign make it harder to buy influence American candidates cannot sustain the lengthy campaign season   or afford costly ads   without raising large amounts of cash  In 2016  Hillary Clinton raised  1 4 billion and Donald Trump raised  957 million It is easy to believe that a shorter campaign would limit the amount of money that candidates need to run  thereby decreasing their opportunities to exploit financing loopholes But  according to Professor Keane   time limits on election campaigns have little to do with the need to dampen financial fraud   If anything   he added   the short election campaigns do the opposite  As in practically every democracy  our elections are awash in dark money  The government provides public financing for the parties  which in theory should limit the impact of moneyed interests  But there are loopholes that allow the parties to accept corporate and private donations with little oversight A study by the Grattan Institute  an independent Australian think tank  found there was no way to account for more than 60 million Australian dollars  or about  42 7 million  donated to political parties in the 2016 17 financial year In the prior fiscal year  which included the 2016 federal election  Grattan found that at least 40 percent of party contributions   154 million Australian dollars   could not be traced to their donors

COLUMBIA  S C    Ernest F   Fritz  Hollings  the silver haired Democrat who helped shepherd South Carolina through desegregation as governor and went on to serve six terms in the U S  Senate  has died  He was 97 Family spokesman Andy Brack  who also served at times for Hollings as spokesman during his Senate career  said Hollings died early Saturday at his home on the Isle of Palms Hollings  whose long and colorful political career included an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination  retired from the Senate in 2005  one of the last of the larger than life Democrats who once dominated politics in the South He had served 38 years and two months  making him the eighth longest serving senator in U S  history Nevertheless  Hollings remained the junior senator from South Carolina for most of his term  The senior senator was Strom Thurmond  first elected in 1954  He retired in January 2003 at age 100 as the longest serving senator in history In his final Senate speech in 2004  Hollings lamented that lawmakers came to spend much of their time raising money for the next election  calling money  the main culprit  the cancer on the body politic   We don t have time for each other  we don t have time for constituents except for the givers      We re in real  real trouble  Hollings was a sharp tongued orator whose rhetorical flourishes in the deep accent of his home state enlivened many a Washington debate  but his influence in Washington never reached the levels he hoped He sometimes blamed that failure on his background  rising to power as he did in the South in the 1950s as the region bubbled with anger over segregation However  South Carolina largely avoided the racial violence that afflicted some other Deep South states during the turbulent 1960s Hollings campaigned against desegregation when running for governor in 1958  He built a national reputation as a moderate when  in his farewell address as governor  he pleaded with the legislature to peacefully accept integration of public schools and the admission of the first black student to Clemson University  This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina s choice  a government of laws rather than a government of men   he told lawmakers  Shortly afterward  Clemson was peacefully integrated In his 2008 autobiography   Making Government Work   Hollings wrote that in the 1950s  no issue dominated South Carolina more than race  and that he worked for a balanced approach  I was  Mister In Between  The governor had to appear to be in charge  yet the realities were not on his side   he wrote   I returned to my basic precept     the safety of the people is the supreme law  I was determined to keep the peace and avoid bloodshed  In the Senate  Hollings gained a reputation as a skilled insider with keen intellectual powers  He chaired the Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee and held seats on the Appropriations and Budget committees But his sharp tongue and sharper wit sometimes got him in trouble  He once called Sen  Howard Metzenbaum  D Ohio  the  senator from the B nai B rith  and in 1983 referred to the presidential campaign supporters of former Sen  Alan Cranston  D California  as  wetbacks  Hollings began his quest for the presidency in April 1983 but dropped out the following March after dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire Early in his Senate career  he built a record as a hawk and lobbied hard for military dollars for South Carolina  one of the poorest states in the union Hollings originally supported American involvement in Vietnam  but his views changed over the years as it became clear there would be no American victory Hollings  who made three trips to the war zone  said he learned a lesson there  It s a mistake to try to build and destroy a nation at the same time   he wrote in his autobiography  warning that America is now  repeating the same wrongheaded strategy in Iraq  Despite his changed views  Hollings remained a strong supporter of national defense which he saw as the main business of government In 1969 he drew national attention when he exposed hunger in his own state by touring several cities  helping lay the groundwork for the Women  Infants and Children  or WIC  feeding program A year later  his views drew wider currency with the publication of his first book  The Case Against Hunger  In 1982  Hollings proposed an across the board federal spending freeze to cut the deficit  a proposal that was a cornerstone of his failed presidential bid He helped create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and write the National Coastal Zone Management Act  Hollings also attached his name to the Gramm Rudman bill aimed at balancing the federal budget Hollings angered many of his constituents in 1991 when he opposed the congressional resolution authorizing President George Bush to use force against Iraq In his later years  port security was one of his main concerns As he prepared to leave office  he told The Associated Press   People ask you your legacy or your most embarrassing moment  I never  ever lived that way      I m not trying to get remembered  He kept busy after the Senate helping the Medical University of South Carolina raise money for the cancer center which bears his name and lecturing at the new Charleston School of Law Hollings  one political defeat came in 1962 when he lost in a primary to Sen  Olin Johnston  After Johnston died  Hollings won a special election in 1966 and went to the Senate at age 44  winning the first of his six full terms two years later Ernest Frederick Hollings was born in Charleston  South Carolina  on Jan  1  1922  His father was a paper products dealer but the family business went broke during the Depression Hollings graduated from The Citadel  the state s military college in Charleston  in 1942  He immediately entered the Army and was decorated for his service during World War II  Back home  he earned a law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1947 The next year  he was elected to the state House at age 26  He was elected lieutenant governor six years later and governor in 1958 at age 36

PARIS BERLIN BRUSSELS   European Union leaders will grant Prime Minister Theresa May a second delay to Brexit but they could demand she accepts a much longer extension as France pushed for conditions to limit Britain s ability to undermine the bloc A  flextension  until the end of the year or until March 2020  under which Britain could leave much sooner if its warring political tribes can find a majority  was shaping up to be the most likely  EU diplomats said  after envoys met in Brussels late on Tuesday to prepare for Wednesday evening s summit with May In a sign of just how far the three year Brexit crisis has sapped British power  May dashed to Berlin and Paris to ask Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron to allow the world s fifth largest economy to put off its divorce from April 12 While it was not immediately clear what Merkel and Macron  Europe s two most powerful leaders  agreed with May  an advance draft of conclusions for Wednesday s emergency EU summit said Britain would be granted another delay on certain conditions  The United Kingdom shall facilitate the achievement of the Union s tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardize the attainment of the Union s objectives   read the draft seen by Reuters  As a full member state of the EU  Britain could in theory exercise a veto on any major policy decision May has asked the EU for a Brexit delay to June 30 but the draft left the end date blank pending a decision by the other 27 national leaders on Wednesday evening in Brussels More than a week after Britain was originally supposed to leave the EU  May  the weakest British prime minister in a generation  has said she fears Brexit might never happen as she battles to get a divorce deal ratified by a divided parliament After her pledge to resign failed to get her deal over the line  she launched crisis talks with the opposition Labour Party in the hope of breaking the domestic deadlock   People are tired and fed up  with Britain s indecision    but what to do   one EU diplomat said   We won t be the ones pushing the UK off the cliff edge  HOW LONG Another EU official involved with Brexit said no European power wanted the chaos that they fear a  no deal  exit would sow through financial markets and the EU 27 s  16 trillion economy  Nobody wants to pull the plug by 13th April   said the official   But for how long   I don t know  And France will ask a lot of questions in Brussels  But as May arrived at the Elysee Palace in Paris to a guard of honor  she was unable to trumpet any breakthrough with Labour Shortly before she landed in Paris  an official in Macron s office said that  in the scenario of an extended delay  one year would seem too long for us  He added that if Britain did delay its exit  it should not take part in EU budget talks or in choosing the next president of the EU s executive commission   and that the other 27 member states should be able to review its  sincere cooperation  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Macron would not veto May s extension but wanted conditions attached  He  Macron  certainly wants to know about conditionality  particularly the issue of the United Kingdom being involved in future  EU  decision making   Varadkar said   STOP BREXIT Earlier in the day  May met Merkel at her riverside Chancellery  a short walk from Berlin s Brandenburg Gate  and departed with a warm exchange of kisses While they discussed Brexit  Germany s opposition liberal FDP party drove an advertising van past the Chancellery with a slogan reading   Dear Theresa May  Just do it  Stop Brexit  Make the most of Europe s opportunities  Several EU diplomats said the 12 month extension proposed by European Council President Donald Tusk  who will chair the Wednesday summit  was unlikely to fly and several capitals had agreed with France that this would be too long  fearing a protracted distraction from other pressing EU business In London  British Solicitor General Robert Buckland said May would  listen carefully  to any constructive suggestions made by the EU on the length of the extension  He conceded that the government might not have managed to ratify an exit deal in parliament before European elections are held on May 23 26 According to the draft conclusions  if Britain did not take part in EU parliamentary elections properly  it would have to leave on June 1  2019  The pound  which has seesawed so much on Brexit news that some investors have stepped away from the sterling market  rose and then dipped on speculation Merkel could offer May a better deal  Germany denied that   GBP  DIVIDED KINGDOMThe 2016 referendum revealed a United Kingdom split over much more than EU membership  and has sparked impassioned debate about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism  empire and what it means to be British Yet nothing is yet resolved Unable to convince enough of her own Conservatives of the merits of her deal to get it passed  May is courting socialist Jeremy Corbyn  whose Labour Party wants to keep Britain more closely tied to the bloc after Brexit Labour s demands include keeping Britain in a customs union with the EU  something that is hard to reconcile with May s desire for Britain to have an independent trade policy  and potentially a second referendum on any deal  After Tuesday s round of talks  Labour said it had not yet seen a clear shift in May s stance  We had further detailed and wide ranging talks with cabinet ministers and officials today   a Labour representative said   We have yet to see the clear shift in the government s position that is needed to secure a compromise agreement  A customs union with the EU  seen as the most likely area for compromise but so far resisted by May s government  was the first item on the agenda for the talks  which were to include finance minister Philip Hammond  Talks resume on Thursday The idea of a softer Brexit is anathema to euroskeptics in May s Conservative party who have helped to defeat her divorce deal three times this year  Meanwhile  British lawmakers on Tuesday approved by a 420 110 margin May s plan to seek to delay Brexit to June 30 while she tries to strike a compromise with Labour The government was forced to hold the vote after parliament passed a law on Monday giving themselves power to scrutinize and make changes to May s request to extend the

The 2020 United States presidential campaign is already in full swing in Latin America  Four hot button issues that helped propel President Trump to the White House in 2016 are already coming into play in his approach with the region  and they are being driven by two parallel electoral strategies  appeals to his political base nationwide on immigration  drugs and trade  and a hard sell directed at South Florida on Cuba and Venezuela Since he announced his candidacy in 2015  Mr  Trump has treated Mexico as a proxy and scapegoat  particularly on immigration and trade  two issues on which he promised a radical policy shift  Calls to build  the wall  on the United States Mexico border became shorthand for a tough  aggressive stance on these issues that reliably rallies and excites Mr  Trump s hard core supporters But closing down the border  as the president threatened to do recently  would hurt both countries and cause irreparable damage to what is arguably the United States  most crucial relationship  On Thursday  under pressure from Republicans in Congress  he backed off that threat  only to issue another one   We re going to give them a one year warning  and if the drugs don t stop or largely stop  we re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products  particularly cars  Until now  President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador of Mexico has done a great deal to accommodate Mr  Trump  including working out an updated Nafta agreement and allowing Central American refugees to remain in Mexico while their asylum claims are being adjudicated  The move to close the border will test the limits of Mr  Lpez Obrador s forbearance  On March 29  the Mexican foreign minister  Marcelo Ebrard  said on Twitter   Mexico does not act on the basis of threats  We are a great neighbor  Perhaps just as outrageous  Mr  Trump also announced that he would cut aid to the three countries of Central America s so called  Northern Triangle    Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras   citing their failure to curb the continuing mass outflow of migrants headed for the United States  This move has led some to speculate that Mr  Trump is seeking to deepen the crises in these countries  which could result in exploding migration flows and that could pose a  real  national security crisis on the United States Mexico border  thus justifying the president s hard line policies and providing a powerful campaign issue It remains to be seen whether Mr  Trump even has the authority to cut off congressionally appropriated funding  or if he ll follow through on these threats  But the announcement understandably left the governments of Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador bewildered  having done everything to accommodate the United States  The Guatemalan and Honduran governments sought to curry favor with the Trump administration by moving  or considering moving  their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem  Mr  Trump s announcement is particularly insulting to El Salvador s incoming president  Nayib Bukele  On a recent visit to Washington  Mr  Bukele unveiled a much tougher policy on Venezuela and pledged to review the outgoing government s decision to break with Taiwan and recognize China   both diplomatic wins for the Trump administration  Moreover  there is evidence that United States assistance is helping reduce migration from El Salvador On the drug question  too  the president is posturing to shore up his political base for the campaign  The Colombian president  Ivan Duque  recently met with Mr  Trump and vowed to pursue a United States backed strategy to bring down rising levels of coca production  But that wasn t enough  Mr  Duque was reportedly taken aback when Mr  Trump told reporters   he  Duque  said how he was going to stop drugs  More drugs are coming out of Colombia right now than before he was president   so he has done nothing for us   The title of an article that ran in the Colombian weekly magazine  Semana  was telling   With Friends Like These  The Colombian president deserves better treatment  Mr  Duque has been the Trump administration s most steadfast regional partner in pressuring the regime in neighboring Venezuela  His government is struggling to cope with over 1 3 million Venezuelans who have fled to Colombia  As the United States presidential campaign picks up steam  United States Colombia ties are in danger of becoming  re narcotized   which would undermine efforts in recent years to broaden the bilateral agenda The Trump administration s approach toward Venezuela and Cuba should be distinguished from issues of nationwide concern such as immigration  drugs  and trade  Still  there is little question that domestic politics  largely focused on South Florida  is a key element helping to shape policy  More ideological factors  advanced less by Mr  Trump himself and more by his national security adviser  John Bolton  and Marco Rubio  the Florida senator  are also relevant  The Trump administration s sustained pressure on the Venezuelan dictatorship  carried out in concert with hemispheric and European allies  has rightly provided badly needed support for a democratic transition to a beleaguered Venezuela  But the United States  agenda in Venezuela is tightly linked to the administration s pursuit of regime change in Cuba  as Mr  Bolton has repeatedly made clear  Though in Latin America there is no love lost for the Cuban regime  the region is more cautious about Cuba than Venezuela  Most Latin Americans consider the past six decades of United States policy toward Cuba  aside from the two year opening under Obama  to be a failure and strongly oppose any new threats and punishments To be sure  infelicitous phrases by Mr  Trump and other senior administration officials like   All options are on the table   and   I wish Nicols Maduro and his top advisers a long  quiet retirement  living on a nice beach somewhere   may draw cheers  help deliver votes  and generate money in a critical swing state in 2020  But they also evoke possible military action and  as a result  risk weakening or dividing the broad coalition that has been forged on Venezuela  To preserve this coalition   a major asset for the United States  Venezuela policy   the Trump administration needs to keep its posturing for electoral purposes in check  Invoking the  socialism  boogeyman in Venezuela as a way to attack the Democratic Party for its health care and New Green Deal proposals shows how the hemisphere s worst crisis could be used in the presidential campaign It would be nave to call for a moratorium on theatrics as November 2020 looms  Playing on domestic politics with Latin American issues may work for President Trump as he pursues a second term  Still  it is crucial not to completely lose sight of the national interest  which means investing wisely in Central America and cooperating closely with Mexico  Mr  Trump needs to stick with the broad coalition on Venezuela  eschew any suggestion of military action there and any reference to regime change in Cuba  These issues should command bipartisan support  If not handled well  they could have consequences for the United States policy in the region for decades to come  RelatedOpinion   Someone Is Always Trying to Kill You April 5  2019Trump Wants to Cut Aid to Central America  Here Are Some of the Dozens of U S  Funded

WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Bernie Sanders unveiled the latest version of his ambitious  Medicare for All  plan on Wednesday  moving the healthcare debate among Democratic presidential contenders to center stage in the 2020 race The Sanders plan  similar to his 2017 proposal that languished in the Senate  would largely eliminate private insurance and shift all Americans into a Medicare based government run healthcare plan that Republicans have criticized as too costly and radical The bill has 14 Democratic co sponsors in the Senate  including four of his presidential rivals   Kirsten Gillibrand  Cory Booker  Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren  The other White House contender in the Senate  Amy Klobuchar  supports universal healthcare and expanding Medicare but has not committed to plans that would eliminate private insurance A similar measure in the House of Representatives has more than 100 co sponsors  The current debate over Medicare for All really has nothing to do with healthcare  it has everything to do with greed and profiteering   Sanders said at a Capitol Hill event to roll out the proposal  where he was joined by Gillibrand  This is a struggle for the heart and soul of who we are as the American people   he said Sanders  an independent senator from Vermont who mounted an unsuccessful 2016 White House run  has turned the proposal  once dismissed as too fringe  into a centerpiece of the Democratic Party s agenda heading into the 2020 White House race At least 10 other Democrats vying for the right to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in 2020 have backed some similar form of government run healthcare  and every Democrat supports taking at least smaller steps toward achieving universal coverage Other prominent Democrats  including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  have urged the party to focus on protecting and strengthening the Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  which Trump and Republicans have vowed to dismantle The Sanders proposal  which has little chance of passage in the Republican run Senate  expands on his old bill to include coverage of home and community based long term care services for people with disabilities Sanders does not put a price tag on the proposal  but would raise revenues to help pay for it through a combination of taxes on employers  individuals  businesses and the wealthy  He suggests that healthcare spending and administrative costs would decrease and costs for consumers would be reduced The liberal Urban Institute estimated the earlier Sanders plan would cost  32 trillion over a decade  with the additional taxes raising about  15 trillion Republicans have criticized the bill as a socialist pipe dream that would be too costly and weaken the U S  healthcare system  They have promised to make it a key election issue in 2020  It s the same tired  debunked logic that Washington  D C   knows best and the American people can t be trusted to decide what s best for themselves and their families   Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said   Reporting by John Whitesidess  editing by Jonathan Oatis

CARACAS  Venezuela   Rival political factions took to the streets across Venezuela on Saturday in a mounting struggle for control of the crisis wracked nation  where U S   backed opposition leader Juan Guaid is attempting to oust socialist President Niclas Maduro It was the first march Guaid has led since Maduro loyalists stripped him of legal protections he s granted as a congressman  opening a path to prosecute and possibly arrest him for allegedly violating the constitution The rallies also follow crippling power failures that left most of the country scrambling in the dark for days and without running water or phone service Guaid tried to channel Venezuelans  ire by calling crowds in the capital to march to the headquarters of the national power utility  Corpoelec  This regime has made big mistakes   said Beatriz Cisneros  a 62 year old opposition supporter  critical of Venezuela s deteriorated petroleum industry  its broken educational system and hospitals that fail to provide basic care   We re fighting for Venezuela to have liberty  Many opposition supporters marched along a sunny main avenue carrying Venezuelan flags  A nun draped the national colors around her shoulders  Another protester carried a sign listing the lack of power  water and other basic services  along with the slogan   Don t get used to it  Meanwhile  crowds of Maduro backers shared coffee and danced as they gathered around a stage blasting music ahead of a march to the presidential palace  Let s fill the streets of Caracas with joy   Maduro tweeted   Together  in an unending mobilization  we ll defend our nation s peace and independence  No more interference  Guaid  35  arose from relative obscurity in January when he was named head of Venezuela s opposition dominated National Assembly and said he was assuming presidential powers to force Maduro from power  He says Maduro is illegitimate due to allegedly fraudulent elections last year He has gained support from Washington and roughly 50 nations  but he has yet to budge Maduro  who maintains control over the government and military and is backed by foreign allies including China  Cuba and Russia Washington on Friday added to pressure on Maduro by imposing financial sanctions on two companies involved in shipping oil from Venezuela to Cuba  along with nearly three dozen ships Guaid  meanwhile  has come under increasing pressure from Maduro s government  which recently jailed his chief of staff and has taken legal actions that could lead to his own arrest  though the administration of President Donald Trump has warned of a strong response if the opposition leader is harmed Amid the Maduro supporters was Ana Margarita Urbina  57  who wore a bright red shirt  the color of Venezuela s socialist party  saying she marched to defend the country she said is under threat from the imperialist United States  We re on a mission   said Urbina   We have a common cause  Our country is our mother     Associated Press writer Christopher Torchia contributed to this report The United States has levied a fresh round of financial sanctions targeting the nation s oil shipments to ally Cuba  aimed at driving a defiant Maduro from power

WASHINGTON   Payments to women who complained of sexual harassment  Accusations of groping  Allegations of a 13 year extramarital affair As President Trump moves ahead with his plan to nominate Herman Cain  a 2012 Republican presidential candidate  for a seat on the Federal Reserve s board of governors  Republican lawmakers are being forced to confront a fresh round of uncomfortable allegations of sexual misconduct against women as the 2020 campaign begins A day after Mr  Trump made the choice of Mr  Cain official  Senate Republicans expressed quiet anxiety over the prospect of another  MeToo minefield even as the White House exalted the decision  President Trump s statement that Herman Cain is  a truly outstanding individual  is a message that the president of the United States is willing to ignore the allegations of a number of women who alleged that Herman Cain either sexually harassed them or had an affair with them   said Gloria Allred  a lawyer who represented two of Mr  Cain s accusers   This message is an insult to women and should be condemned by the Republican Party and all those who care about respect and dignity for women  The choice of Mr  Cain comes as Mr  Trump s other pick to fill an open seat on the seven member Fed board  the conservative economist Stephen Moore  has been under fire for ethical and financial lapses that emerged from his divorce records  In both cases  the White House has publicly backed Mr  Trump s selections despite criticism that he was installing loyalists with questionable credentials in two of the country s top economic policy jobs  I don t buy it  we re not trying to damage the Fed s independence   Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  said on the Fox Business Network on Friday when asked about Mr  Cain But the questions surrounding Mr  Cain  who made his loyalty to the president clear with his creation of a political action committee to combat misinformation about Mr  Trump  go beyond cronyism The sexual misconduct accusations against him first emerged in 2011  when his long shot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination was gaining traction and he was briefly propelled to the top of the polls  He denied the claims  denouncing them as a political hit job that were being circulated by opponents to sink his candidacy Most of the accusations dated from the 1990s and involved employees or former employees of the National Restaurant Association  a Washington trade and lobbying organization  Mr  Cain had served on the association s board when he was the president and chief executive of Godfather s Pizza  a chain of restaurants with headquarters in Omaha  and after resigning from Godfather s  he moved to Washington to become the association s president His behavior toward female subordinates raised concern within the organization  according to former employees  board members and consultants  In interviews  they recalled learning that Mr  Cain had introduced sexual innuendo or questions into conversations with subordinates at the association s offices and events  as well as outside work  At one association conference  they said  he invited a female employee to his hotel room The association paid settlements to two female employees after they accused Mr  Cain of sexual harassment  The settlements included confidentiality provisions barring the women from discussing their complaints publicly Another former employee  Sharon Bialek  accused Mr  Cain of groping and propositioning her in 1997  when she asked for his help in finding employment after she was fired from the association s education foundation  When she protested  he responded   You want a job  right   she said at a news conference in 2011 A few weeks after Ms  Bialek detailed her account  another woman  Ginger White  alleged that she had a 13 year extramarital affair with Mr  Cain that ended shortly before he announced his presidential bid Mr  Cain categorically denied the affair  Ms  Bialek s account  the hotel solicitation and the harassment claims  dismissing them as a campaign of  character assassination  devised to force him to drop out of the race He pledged to push through  but his poll numbers plunged  and he suspended his campaign days later Two years later  after having left the political arena for a career in talk radio  he published a detailed defense on his website  again dismissing the claims  which he called a  dark cloud attached to my reputation that is not consistent with the truth  Joel P  Bennett  a lawyer who represented one of the women who was paid a settlement by the restaurant association  Karen Kraushaar  said times had changed since his former client leveled the accusation   and even since her settlement was made public in 2011   but only to a point  People are even more sensitive about this  and listening  and being sure that women are heard   Mr  Bennett said   But on the other hand  there were very serious allegations against Donald Trump and he was elected president  There were very serious allegations against Brett Kavanaugh  and he was confirmed   he said  referring to the Supreme Court justice He called for the Senate to conduct a  very thorough investigation  of the claims against Mr  Cain as part of any prospective confirmation hearing  The allegations are very serious   Mr  Bennett said   If you have one complaint  it s a  he said  she said  situation  If you have three or four complaints   the expression is where there s smoke  there s fire  Mr  Bennett said he was unsure if Ms  Kraushaar would participate in any congressional investigation  explaining that she had recently retired from a career in the federal government and was considering moving away from the Washington area It is an uncomfortably familiar spot for Senate Republicans  who were confronted with a similar dilemma six months ago after Mr  Trump nominated Mr  Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court  Mr  Kavanaugh  who was accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual misconduct  was eventually confirmed after an excruciating public hearing in which Dr  Blasey testified that he pinned her down and groped her at a party when she was in high school in the 1980s  Mr  Kavanaugh disputed the claims and denied he ever assaulted her The choice of Mr  Cain was viewed as especially perplexing in the immediate aftermath of the selection of Mr  Moore  who is dealing with his own accusations of ethical lapses related to his 2011 divorce  Since Mr  Moore was chosen  it has emerged that he owes  75 000 in federal taxes  interest and penalties stemming from his attempt to deduct child support payments  which are not eligible for a tax break  He was held in contempt of court in 2013 for failing to pay more than  330 000 for spousal support  child support and lawyer s fees to his former wife  Allison Moore While Mr  Cain was defiant amid the downfall of his 2012 presidential bid  the toll that a process can take on a nominee and his family was on display on Friday  as Ms  Moore appeared alone in a Virginia court and tearfully pleaded with a judge to keep her divorce records sealed  This is causing emotional turmoil within my family   Ms  Moore said   I never intended to be made a circus of in front of everybody  The judge declined her request  which had been challenged by multiple news organizations  including The New York Times  and unsealed the nearly 200 page record of the divorce  which detailed the terms of the couple s settlement and the breakdown of their marriage  which began with Mr  Moore s affair According to the unsealed filing  Mr  Moore opened two Match com accounts in 2009 with the intention of meeting other women  In 2010  Mr  Moore started a sexual relationship with a woman he met online  According to the court records  Ms  Moore found bills that showed him pumping gas in the morning near the woman s home and buying an airplane ticket in her name Two years after the divorce was finalized  Mr  Moore still owed his former wife more than  200 000 from their original settlement  plus tens of thousands of dollars in child and spousal support payments he was supposed to be making monthly  When Mr  Moore continued to defy a judge s order to pay the money  the judge appointed a lawyer to sell his house and distribute the proceeds in a way that fulfilled his obligations in the divorce  the court filings show On May 17  2013  the lawyer appeared at Mr  Moore s Virginia home along with four police officers  two real estate agents and a locksmith  The locksmith picked the lock so that the police and the agents could get into the house and prepare it for sale  When Mr  Moore was informed by the lawyer that his house was being sold  he became  argumentative  and said he had already paid his debt to Ms  Moore  Five days later  Mr  Moore paid  150 000 of the debt he owed and said he would get a home equity loan to cover the rest It is unclear whether Mr  Cain or Mr  Moore  who are currently undergoing background checks  could be confirmed if they are formally nominated But people close to the administration said Mr  Trump was eager for a big fight on Capitol Hill  akin to the brawl over the Kavanaugh nomination  that will unite his base and distract from the spate of investigations being undertaken by House Democrats Mr  Trump and some of his staff members believe that stirring drama in the Senate during an election will help foster the impression that Senate Republicans are taking action at a time when Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  plans to do little more than push through judicial nominations  a person close the administration said When asked about Mr  Cain on Thursday  many Republican senators ducked into elevators or onto the trains that run from the Capitol to legislative office buildings  answered calls on their cellphones  or gave noncommittal responses that made it clear the issue was not a top priority  I really don t have an opinion on that   said Senator Patrick J  Toomey  Republican of Pennsylvania  This would be instead of Stephen Moore   Senator Roy Blunt  Republican of Missouri  said shortly after word of Mr  Cain s possible appointment was made public  He was told no   I don t know anything about his past service  so I don t know what to say   Mr  Blunt said It remains unclear if Mr  Cain will pass a background check or if Senate Republicans would actually confirm him  despite his credentials as a Republican businessman who was once the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City For Mr  Cain  a circuslike atmosphere has not been something to shy away from  He parlayed his boomlet in presidential politics into the  Cain s Solutions Revolution  bus tour in 2012 and started hosting a radio show in 2013  He wrote columns for Newsmax and appeared as a commentator on Fox News During the 2016 election  Mr  Trump  who was also a

HOUSTON   U S  Vice President Mike Pence on Friday stepped up efforts to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from office by imposing new sanctions on its oil shipments  and promising  stronger action  against Cuba for helping to keep the regime afloat  Greater efforts to prevent oil revenues from reaching Maduro  including sanctions on Venezuela s finance and oil sectors  were coming  Pence said in Houston before a hand picked audience of 300 people  many from the local Venezuelan community who support Maduro s ouster  The United States will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy  in Venezuela  Pence said at Rice University s Baker Institute for Public Policy  calling oil shipments  the lifeblood of that corrupt regime   The United States and leaders of most nations in the Western Hemisphere consider Maduro s 2018 reelection illegitimate and have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the company s interim president  Maduro dismisses Guaido as a U S  puppet After Pence s speech  the U S  Treasury announced sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Venezuelan state run oil company PDVSA that carry oil to customers outside the region  It also sanctioned two shipping operators and a vessel that delivered oil to Cuba in February and March Pence bashed the island nation s leaders as the  real imperialists  in the Western Hemisphere  adding   The time has come to liberate Venezuela from Cuba  An estimated 50 000 Venezuelans  the second largest expatriate community outside of south Florida  live in Houston  Many of them support U S  efforts to rid Venezuela of Maduro  having fled the socialist politics of former leader Hugo Chavez for a home in Houston s energy industry However  some Venezuelan expatriates in Houston believe tougher actions than Pence s proposals on Friday were needed to replace the government   It s going to take more than economic sanctions   said Andres Carvallo  a former Venezuelan lawyer and journalist who attended the speech  In addition to sanctions  the United States should organize a military coalition of countries to remove the current government  he said  Francisco Monaldi  a Venezuelan native and Latin American energy expert at Rice  said many expatriates had hoped that Pence would deliver a plan to get the Venezuelan military to stop supporting Maduro  It doesn t seem the military is willing to remove support from Maduro   which has proven more difficult than opposition leaders had expected  We want to see more than barking  We want to see action   said Miguel Eljuri  a Venezuelan living in Houston who also once worked for PDVSA  Maria Gonzalez  an economist who listened to the speech  welcomed tougher action  adding her mother in Venezuela lacks water  power and basic supplies  As for the Trump administration s reversal of the U S  opening to Cuba  she said   they do not deserve our help     Reporting by Collin Eaton in Houston  editing by Gary McWilliams and Marguerita Choy  

Good Monday   Want this by email  Sign up here  Pinterest s modest I P O  valuation should worry other unicornsThe digital pin board company disclosed today that its I P O  would value it at less than its last private fund raising round  That s a big warning sign for other tech companies that are poised to go public this year The high range of Pinterest s I P O  would value it at  11 3 billion  below the  12 billion attained from private investors two years ago  In Silicon Valley speak  that s a  down round    something companies generally hope to avoid because it undermines confidence Coupled with early volatility in Lyft s first days of trading  the Pinterest offering suggests that public market investors are wary of maintaining high valuations for tech start ups  especially given that many won t turn a profit for years It comes as a slew of unicorns are preparing to go public  including Uber  whose I P O  was expected to give a valuation as high as  120 billion   the workplace messaging platform Slack and the software company PagerDuty But there s some reason not to panic yet  After initially falling below their I P O  price  Lyft shares bounced back  Other companies have gone on to do well after down rounds  For instance  the file sharing company Box is trading well above its debut price two years after its I P O  And Pinterest could end up pricing its offering higher if investor demand proves robust during its road show More I P O  news  Though many investors are betting against Lyft s newly public stock  the high profile short seller Andrew Left isn t among them

ImageA Facebook ad in London CreditHenry Nicholls ReutersBritain s plan to police the internetThe British government has proposed sweeping new powers to regulate harmful content and false information  recommending one of the world s most aggressive actions to police the internet  Adam Satariano of the NYT reports   A regulator would be given the power to  issue fines  block access to websites if necessary and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content spread on their platforms    Terrorism  inciting violence  encouraging suicide  spreading disinformation and cyberbullying are among the topics that companies would be required to address  The rules would apply to social media platforms  discussion forums  messaging services and search engines   Facebook and Twitter will work with the government  representatives from the companies said  Actions in Britain and elsewhere signal a new era for the internet  Western democracies have largely avoided regulating online communication   Mr  Satariano writes  But governments have become more willing to intervene  as evidence mounts that online actions are having harmful real life consequences by contributing to violence  compromising elections and spreading hateful ideologies   In the United States  where free speech is more of a core value than in other nations  there s been less momentum to regulate internet content   Mr  Satariano adds  But even in America  there is increasing support for new rules Why you don t want a partisan FedPresident Trump is ready to nominate Herman Cain and Stephen Moore   two vocal supporters of his policies   to the Federal Reserve board  Many analysts say such a move would politicize the central bank  Neil Irwin of the Upshot takes a look at what that would mean Historically  Fed appointees have generally been economic experts who kept their political views out of policy discussions Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain wouldn t change much at first  They d hold two of 12 votes on the Fed s Open Market Committee  so their ability to swing other governors would depend on their politicking abilities But over time  the Fed could lose credibility   The United States  role as the global reserve currency   which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight   is built in significant part on the credibility the Fed has accumulated over decades   Mr  Irwin writes The financial world is watching closely   I think it s a very big benefit to the U S  economy and the financial markets that we have a strong and independent Fed  and I hope

TOKYO   Japan s household spending rose less than expected in February and real wages tumbled at the fastest pace in more than three years  raising concerns about the hit to the consumer sector from heightening global uncertainties  The data is likely to be discussed by policymakers worried that risks to the export sector from ongoing trade disputes may discourage firms from raising wages  which in turn would hurt consumption The 1 7 percent year on year increase in household spending was less than the median estimate for a 2 1 percent increase and followed a 2 0 percent increase in January Taken with separate wages data  also released on Friday  the numbers suggested household income may not be strong enough to underpin consumption at a time when exports and output are weakening due to the U S  Sino trade war The data also suggest the government could come under pressure to delay a planned sales tax hike and turn to the Bank of Japan  BOJ  for help in supporting the economy  Labour shortages are not pushing up wages  and you need wages to rise for inflation expectations to rise   said Norio Miyagawa  senior economist at Mizuho Securities  The BOJ is on hold for now  but it may have to come up with something if there is another downside shock to the economy  The growth in household consumption in February was driven by spending on autos and mobile phone charges Inflation adjusted real wages in Japan fell 1 1 percent in February from a year ago  the fastest decline since June 2015 The soft household sector indicators follow signs of similar weakness in the corporate sector Japan s business mood slumped to a two year low in the March quarter  a central bank survey showed on April 1  highlighting the impact the Sino U S  trade war was having on sentiment and economic activity Factories across Japan depend heavily on selling electronic parts and heavy equipment to manufacturers in China  which leaved Japan exposed to tit for tat tariffs between Washington and Beijing The data on consumer spending and wages is likely to raise concerns about the economy  There are still risks to domestic demand  and expectations may heighten for the BOJ to ease monetary policy further The government plans to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October to generate extra revenue for rising welfare costs Some economists and politicians worry that if this plan is not delayed then consumer spending will weaken after the tax hike The BOJ is in a bind over how to manage the economy  Years of heavy money printing and prolonged ultra low rates have dried up the bond market and squeezed profits at banks  prompting Japan s banking lobby to urge the BOJ to rethink its monetary stimulus However  Japan s economic outlook this year is weaker than last year s  which supports the argument that the BOJ will eventually need to come up with some measures to keep already low inflation from slowing   Reporting by Stanley White  Editing by Sam Holmes  

WELLINGTON  New Zealand   Less than a month after 50 Muslim worshipers in the city of Christchurch were fatally shot in terrorist attacks on two mosques  New Zealand passed a law banning most semiautomatic weapons on Wednesday   a measure supported by all but one of Parliament s 120 lawmakers The passage of the bill means temporary restrictions imposed by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern six days after the massacre  to prevent New Zealanders from stockpiling guns before the law went into effect  will now be permanent  The swift action by lawmakers stands in stark contrast to similar efforts in the United States  where nationwide gun control proposals have stalled despite a series of mass shootings in recent years  New Zealand stands apart in its widespread availability of weapons of such destructive nature and force   Ms  Ardern told Parliament on Wednesday   Today that anomaly ends  How to Buy a Gun in 16 CountriesMany Americans can buy a gun in less than an hour  In New Zealand  the process can take weeks or months She said she could not have faced the surviving victims of the Christchurch attack  hand on heart  and told them  our system and our laws allow these guns to be available and that is O K  It is not  The law outlaws military style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles  and violators face five years in prison  Some semiautomatic guns will still be allowed  including  22 caliber rifles with magazines holding fewer than 10 rounds  and shotguns with internal magazines that hold no more than five rounds  All of the weapons used by the Christchurch gunman will be banned  as well as parts and magazines that can convert lower powered guns to higher powered versions In her speech  Ms  Ardern  who leads the center left Labour Party  choked up when she talked about visiting surviving victims at Christchurch Hospital  In addition to those killed  50 people were injured in the attack  None of them had one gunshot wound  In every case they spoke of multiple injuries   Ms  Ardern said   They will carry disabilities for a lifetime  and that s before you even consider the psychological impact  ImageFirearms and accessories at a gun shop in Christchurch CreditJorge Silva ReutersSimilar laws had been recommended to New Zealand s Parliament several times before  but each time they had failed to gain support from lawmakers   including after the mass shooting that had previously been New Zealand s largest  in which a gunman killed 13 people in 1990 This time  the bill quickly sailed through Parliament  Usually in New Zealand  new laws can take around six months to pass after they are introduced  More than 13 000 people submitted opinions to the government   60 percent in support of the ban   and some were invited to speak to lawmakers in a single day of public hearings But while sports shooters and farmers were among those who pleaded for exemptions to the restrictions  lawmakers allowed just two  for commercial pest control businesses and for licensed collectors of guns  or those who want to keep particular guns as heirlooms or mementos  Collectors will be required to remove a part  making the weapons nonoperational  and store that part at a different location Ms  Ardern s center right opponents used their speeches on Wednesday to praise her leadership since the March 15 attacks and voice their support for the changes  Just one  David Seymour  the leader of the libertarian ACT Party  voted against the law ImageAn advertisement for a gun shop in Christchurch CreditAdam Dean for The New York TimesMr  Seymour said he was not opposed to more restrictive gun laws but believed that Parliament had rushed the process   It is not an attempt to improve public safety  it is an exercise in political theater   said Mr  Seymour  who argued that there was a risk of a growing black market in banned weapons Ms  Ardern had dismissed concerns that Parliament was moving too fast   My question here is simple  You either believe that in New Zealand these weapons have a place or you do not  And if you do not  you should be able to agree that we can move swiftly   she said   My view is that an argument about process is an argument to do nothing  Many commentators welcomed the new measures but said work remained to be done to ensure that gun regulations were properly enforced  The government said more measures  including a requirement to register individual firearms  would be in place by the end of the year  We really need to have a system where we understand where all the firearms in New Zealand are   said Chris Cahill  president of the Police Association  a national union for police officers  He added that gun owners should be forced to justify wanting to own large numbers of guns  something he said  hadn t been challenged enough  in the past        g 0411 for web NZGUNSmap box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g 0411 for web NZGUNSmap box  g artboard p     margin 0       g aiAbs     position

The Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan  near the southwest corner of Central Park  is a 44 story building with a mix of luxury condominiums and hotel suites that go for more than  2 500 a night Unit 32G  a two bedroom  1 767 square foot apartment with sweeping views of the park  is owned by an entity called Ecree  which bought the condo in 2014 for  7 million in cash Documents unearthed by the nonprofit group Global Witness show that the purchase was funded by the daughter of the Republic of Congo s president  a longtime target of anti corruption investigators  The funds for the all cash purchase appear to have been siphoned from that country s government  according to a report by Global Witness The purchase took place more than two years before Donald J  Trump became president  Owners of units in the building   1 Central Park West   pay tens of thousands of dollars a year in condo fees to Mr  Trump s company  the Trump Organization A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization  Kimberly Benza  said that Unit 32G had not recently been owned by the Trump Organization and that whoever bought it in 2014 purchased it from an unrelated party  She said the condo fees were for building maintenance purposes  and are not fees paid to Trump for profit  There is no indication that Mr  Trump or his company broke the law  Less than two years after the condo sale  federal regulators started requiring greater disclosures of purchases of certain high end New York properties ImageThe Republic of the Congo s president  Denis Sassou Nguesso  and his wife  Antoinette  in

and former business associate of Mr  Trump s  formerly had his office in that tower Denis Sassou Nguesso  the president of the Republic of Congo  is one of the world s longest sitting heads of state  having been in office for the past 22 years  For roughly a decade  he and his family have been the subject of corruption investigations in France  Authorities there have identified more than 60 million euros of luxury goods and real estate that the Sassou Nguesso family owns in France  The country was a French colony until 1960 The Global Witness report alleges that a Cyprus company belonging to the president s daughter  Claudia Sassou Nguesso  bankrolled the purchase of the Trump apartment in July 2014   The Portuguese newspaper Expresso has previously reported on aspects of the purchase and its connection to the daughter of the president of the Republic of Congo  A spokesman for President Sassou Nguesso and a representative at the Republic of Congo s embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment Global Witness   which is funded in part by the billionaire George Soros s foundation   followed a money trail that began with a Brazilian company receiving a series of lucrative public contracts from the Republic of Congo s government  Money from one of those contracts wound up in the bank account of a company in Cyprus  according to the report  Ownership of the company was transferred to Ms  Sassou Nguesso in July 2013 In January 2014  the Cyprus company received nearly  20 million  apparently in Republic of Congo taxpayer funds  through a contract with the country s government  according to a Portuguese police report reviewed by Global Witness  Six months later  the Cyprus company paid for Unit 32G in the Trump building on Columbus Circle A

France Presse   Getty ImagesLetters cited by Global Witness and reviewed by The New York Times show that a Portuguese businessman  Jos Veiga  wrote reference letters on behalf of the president s granddaughter to the condo association ahead of the sale  He called her  one of my best friends  and said she would be a  valued addition  to the Trump property It is unclear what sort of background check  if any  the Trump Organization did on the purchase financed by Ms  Sassou Nguesso A lawyer for Mr  Veiga  who Portuguese authorities have arrested on suspicion of money laundering  declined to comment According to New York real estate records  the entity used to make the purchase  Ecree  used a Manhattan address at the law firm K L Gates Unlike banks and other financial institutions  United States real estate developers have typically not been subject to rules that require they vet the backgrounds or sources of money of prospective buyers  including looking out for potential money laundering In 2016  in the wake of a series of Times articles on the suspicious funds behind luxury real estate purchases around the country  the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  part of the Treasury Department  started requiring title companies to report all cash purchases of some expensive residential properties in Manhattan and Miami Global Witness called on the Trump Organization to clarify whether it was continuing to receive maintenance fees on Unit 32G   as there is a risk that these companies may be currently enabling money laundering of public funds embezzled by the Congolese president s daughter and benefitting from those illicit funds  Peter Jones  one of the authors of the report  called on the Justice Department to join French law enforcement and consider seizing the apartment because it appeared to have been purchased with embezzled money

event U S  imports of lithium have nearly doubled since 2014 due in part to rising demand from Tesla  SK Innovation Co and others building battery plants in the country  according to the U S  Geological Survey   We need to find ways to more efficiently develop our nation s domestic critical mineral supply because these resources are vital to both our national security and our economy   North Dakota Senator John Hoeven  a member of the Senate s Energy and Natural Resources Committee  said in a statement to Reuters when asked about the meeting  Hoeven and Senator Lisa Murkowski  chair of the Senate s energy committee  have been invited to attend the meeting  Officials from the U S  Department of State  Department of Energy  Department of the Interior and the U S  Geological Survey plan to attend  according to two of the sources As part of the effort  Murkowski is expected to introduce standalone legislation aimed at streamlining the permitting process for lithium and other mines  bolstering state and federal studies of domestic supplies of critical minerals and encouraging mineral recycling  among other topics  according to a source familiar with the matter  Some of those efforts were part of broader energy legislation in prior Congresses that failed  and Murkowski hopes that similar legislation will draw broader attention to the topic  according to the source   Five companies  including Lithium Americas Corp  are developing U S  lithium projects that plan to use new technologies to extract the metal from clays  bromine and even oilfield waste  processes not common elsewhere and considered game changing by some analysts  But not all of them have secured financing  For a graphic  click https   tmsnrt rs 2CXdGWNIf all five come online by 2022 as planned  the country would produce at least 77 900 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent each year  making the country one of the world s largest lithium producers  Lithium development projects have historically faced numerous obstacles  so that production number is far from guaranteed  Creating a domestic electric vehicle supply chain is the perfect blueprint to make America great again   said Jesse Edmondson  chief executive officer of U S  Critical Minerals  a start up firm buying lithium mineral rights in the U S  Southeast Representatives from Tesla  Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co

engages with stakeholders on various supply chain topics  Albemarle Corp and Livent Corp  two U S  based companies that mine lithium in South America  also plan to attend  as do executives from the handful of lithium mines under development in the United States  according to the sources  We are looking forward to participating in a forum with policy makers and industry participants who are focused on ensuring the U S  remains a leader in the development of the electric vehicle industry   said Paul Graves  CEO of Livent  which has said it is eyeing expansion opportunities Albemarle  which operates the only existing lithium mine in the United States  declined to comment The one day meeting will be divided into morning workshops focused on financing and permitting obstacles  with one on one afternoon meetings between regulators and industry executives  according to the sources   We re trying to make sure policymakers have an understanding of this complex situation   said James

support that   Asa Hutchinson  the governor of Arkansas  told Reuters  Hutchinson and some other U S  officials want U S  lithium projects to stand alone without financial support from the government  a potential impediment as financiers often look for even tacit government support before investing in new  unproven technologies  There s a real opportunity in the electric vehicle supply chain if the United States wakes up   said Jonathan Evans  president of Lithium Americas  which is developing a lithium project in Nevada expected to open by 2022   Reporting by Ernest Scheyder  editing by Amran

There are two countries that I ve been professionally  emotionally and intellectually involved with my entire journalism career   the United States and Israel  I ve never been more worried about both  because President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are essentially the same person  and they pose the same threat to their respective nations They are both men utterly without shame  backed by parties utterly without spine  protected by big media outlets utterly without integrity  They are both funded by a Las Vegas casino magnate  Sheldon Adelson  They are both making support for Israel a  Republican   cause   no longer a bipartisan one  And they each could shoot an innocent man in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Avenue and their supporters would say the victim had it coming As a result  they are each free to cross red lines that their predecessors never dared to  Which is why I believe that four more years of Netanyahu  which is almost certain after Israel s election on Tuesday  and six more years of Trump  which is a real possibility  will hasten the emergence of an America and an Israel where respect for civility  democracy  an independent judiciary and independent media are no longer examples for others to follow  Instead  both countries will be cautionary tales of how precious are the norms and institutions that bind a democracy  and how easily they can be undermined by leaders who will tell any lie  smear any competitor and wink at any extremist to stay in power Netanyahu s first order of business will be to strike an agreement with his potential coalition partners  most of them far right  pro settler parties  in which  as Haaretz reported  those parties will agree to create legislation that gets rid of the multiple indictments for corruption looming in Bibi s future   and in return he will agree to annex West Bank settlements to Israel  And Trump will somehow go along  maybe as part of his own peace plan  It is going to be a dirty business  for sure But what else could we expect  The parallels between Trump and Netanyahu are now deep and broad Bibi has openly embraced a racist  anti Arab Israeli party and racist  anti Arab rhetoric  unlike any previous Israeli prime minister  At the same time  he has steadily been erasing the Green Line that separated Israel from the West Bank and its 2 5 million Palestinians   with the help of Trump s ambassador to Israel   making it increasingly unlikely that Israel will ever separate itself from that area and increasingly likely that it will become a binational state in which Jews will enjoy rights that Palestinians will be denied Meanwhile  Trump is increasingly turning America into a banana republic  firing cabinet officials and senior bureaucrats who refuse to carry out his impulsive orders  which are often illegal and mostly related to preventing legal and illegal immigration or asylum requests along the Mexico United States border  Trump prefers to govern through  acting   cabinet secretaries   he has fired their bosses and not replaced them   who are much more vulnerable to his whims and more accepting of his more than 10 000 lies and falsehoods since taking office Bibi  for his part  prefers to simply hold multiple portfolios  For a good chunk of his last term he was prime minister  defense minister  foreign minister and health minister Both men have no close friends  The one major difference between them is that Bibi is very smart  an avid reader and a deft tactician in managing relations with Israel s neighbors and big powers  such as America  Russia  India and China  Trump is clever but probably has not read a book in years  He gets his information from Fox News and other right wing media  and rather than playing Vladimir Putin  has been played by him Both Trump and Netanyahu are being investigated for serious financial improprieties  Israel s attorney general has recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on charges of fraud  bribery and breach of trust in three corruption cases Trump has been cleared by the special counsel on charges of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election  but he remains under investigation  as Reuters noted  on  issues including his businesses and financial dealings  personal conduct  charitable foundation and inaugural committee    Five close Trump aides have already admitted to crimes  mostly financial  or been convicted Neither man is interested in being a leader for all their people  Each has chosen to rule by dividing his people  not uniting them  They each just want to win by 50 01 percent  by using fear of the outsider and drawing cultural or religious distinctions between their citizens to garner just enough votes to squeak by Bibi s strategy was to demonize Israeli Arabs  and Trump s was to demonize Muslims and Mexicans and immigrants from what he called  shithole   countries  Both men have rebuilt their parties around themselves and their personal politics  and both believe that as long as they can hold their bases by stoking enough fear and cultural division  they can win   and they re willing to sacrifice any values or norms to do so Neither man is entirely wrong about the world around him  America does have an illegal immigration problem that Democrats have not taken seriously enough  Israel has real enemies like Iran and its proxies  But Israel s external enemies are well deterred  The existential threat to Israel is internal   that it will annex the West Bank with its Palestinian population and look to the world as an apartheidlike South Africa My critique of both men is that they consistently try to use these real threats for political gain   to feed fears  rather than to think creatively about how to defuse them  Because for Bibi to think imaginatively about how to separate from the West Bank and for Trump to think creatively about how to defuse our immigration problem with a coherent national strategy would require each to disappoint or confront the extreme ultranationalists who form the core bases of their support  Neither has the courage or the desire to do so ImageA supporter of the Likud party waved a Trump flag on election night in Tel Aviv CreditRonen Zvulun ReutersIndeed  Netanyahu has gone so deep into the gutter that in this last election he agreed to partner with a small  racist  anti Arab Israeli party   a party so vile that the Israeli Supreme Court barred its leader from running  In response  Netanyahu s allies immediately threatened to gut the Supreme Court if they win  I don t have to tell you where Trump has gone in indulging white supremacists Bibi will go down in history as the Israeli leader who concretized the distinction between  Israelis   and  Jews    noted Bernard Avishai in a smart essay in The New Yorker   The menace  Netanyahu has implied  is not just the Arabs but what might be termed Israeliness   a legal and cultural identity available to any citizen who participates in Hebrew speaking civil society  including the 20 percent who are Arab   While Benny Gantz  Bibi s opponent in the recent election  has argued that  broadly defined   Israeli identity is increasingly plausible for  among others  young  middle class Arabs  who accounted for more than 16 percent of students in bachelor s degree programs in 2017    that is not Netanyahu s view  Netanyahu s version  in contrast    Avishai explained   is a state essentially reserved for Jews  including those in the diaspora  who can prove their Jewishness by either rabbinical certification or maternal descent   one that is democratic only in the sense that Jews constitute the majority  the general will of Jews necessarily prevails  and non Jews are in the state by sufferance  not really by right   That is why Netanyahu passed the recent Nation State Law  which stipulated that Israel is  the national home of the Jewish people  in which it fulfills its natural  cultural  religious and historical right to self determination   However much American Jews   and traditional  secular American Jewish supporters of Israel    may try to shield Netanyahu  it is increasingly clear that he is at odds with their democratic standards  which are already under assault    Avishai concluded   American Jews  like Israeli voters  have choices to make    Is Israel a state for Jews or for all its citizens Trump has dabbled in the same kind of tropes  He may not say it explicitly  but his whole worldview  evident from his dog whistles  is that real Americans are primarily white Judeo Christians   certainly not Muslims   and that all black or brown immigrants are suspect ImagePresident  Trump met with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White House in March CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesFinally  both Trump and Bibi worship only one thing   raw  naked power  and they are not afraid to exercise it  Bibi is convinced that if Israel is strong militarily  economically and technologically  the world will bend to its will and beat a path to its door  The Palestinians will surrender  the Arabs will deal with Israel under the table  and China  India and Russia will all come to buy Israeli software  And so far he has been right  Bibi is convinced that liberal American Jews are worthless  that they ll soon disappear via intermarriage and that the country s Orthodox Jews and evangelical Christians will be powerful enough to do Israel s bidding in Washington Trump too has an obsession with raw power  his favorite insult is to call someone  weak    He lives by the credo  Never apologize  no matter how foul your actions or how big your lie  Just stand firm and everyone will eventually bend your way  It has worked for him too  But at what long term costs for both societies Trump is replacing the entire logic of American foreign policy since World War II   that more global integration and stronger global rules and institutions will make for a more prosperous world  and if America pays a little more than others for that we will reap far more benefits because we are the world s biggest economy   with a philosophy of competitive nationalism For Trump  all the global institutions built after World War II   NATO  the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund  the World Trade Organization  the United Nations   are just tools for small countries to rip off America or stick it to Israel  Trump actually wants the European Union to crack up  because he thinks that if the United States just negotiates with every nation bilaterally  it will be able to impose asymmetrical trade agreements on them So have no doubts  Four more years of Netanyahu and six more years of Trump won t just change America and Israel  It will change the world   and not for the better The Times is committed to

When Cass Sunstein was a young law professor  he happened to come across an older male professor talking to a young female student in a hallway  To Sunstein s astonishment  the professor was stroking the student s hair Sunstein later went up to her and said   That was completely inappropriate  He shouldn t have done that   The student brushed him off   It s fine  He s an old man  It s really not a problem  Thirty minutes later the same student appeared in his office  in tears   He does that all the time   she cried out   It s horrible  My boyfriend thinks I should make a formal complaint  but I don t want to do that    I don t want to make a fuss  In his new book   How Change Happens   Sunstein uses this story to make a few points  First  sometimes people s private reactions differ from how society tells them they re supposed to react to a given situation  Second  if you give people permission to express how they really feel  they will sometimes take you up on it  Third  if there is mass dissonance between how people feel they re supposed to act and their actual feelings  then you ve got a situation ripe for radical and sudden social change Sunstein s book is illuminating because it puts norms at the center of how we think about change  A culture is made up of norms   simple rules that govern what thoughts  emotions and behaviors are appropriate at what moment  It s appropriate to be appalled when people hit their dogs  It s inappropriate to ask strangers to tell you their income Most norms are invisible most of the time  They re just the water in which we swim  We unconsciously absorb them by imitating those around us  We implicitly know that if we violate a norm  there will be a social cost  maybe even ostracism From time to time  a norm stops working or comes into dispute  People are slow to challenge a broad norm  because they don t want to say anything that might make them unpopular  But eventually some people notice that  actually  there are a lot of people who secretly think a certain norm is wrong or outdated  When this happens  permission is granted to go public with your private thoughts  More and more people speak up and you get rapid  cascading change  There used to be a social penalty for supporting gay marriage  Now there s a social penalty for not supporting it Sunstein points to the importance of  norm entrepreneurs   people who challenge old norms and create new ones  I d add that there are at least five different kinds of norm shifters  though often one person can perform several of these roles Namers  These are people who describe the context in some new way  They describe the reality around us in a way that makes visible what had previously been invisible or taken for granted  Charles Dickens made the poor visible to Victorian England Confrontationalists  Social movements move forward by declaring disgraceful things that had formerly been acceptable  segregation  littering  sexual harassment  etc  They wake people up to the ways an old norm is disgraceful by actively and visibly confronting it  The civil rights movement had a strategy aimed at creating a soap opera every day  Do something every day that forces the segregationists to display their own hatefulness and the unjustness of their norms  This is how you rouse people Illuminators  If confrontationalists tear down old norms  illuminators lift up new ones  They do this by showing how cool and just the norm breakers are and thus encourage others to copy them  The 1960s radicals violated all sorts of norms  but it was illuminators like Ken Kesey  Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin who created the counterculture identity  This is who we are  This is the story we are all a part of  This is how we behave Conveners  These are people who organize gatherings for those who want to shift the same norm  These gatherings embolden change agents by reminding them   There are a lot of us   They sponsor specific actions you can do to embody new norms  Everybody should recycle Celebrities  When famous  good looking or cool people embrace a norm shift  you get a mass cascade  That s when you win over all the people who may not be intrinsically interested in the cause  they just know that this is how the cool people think and act  so they want to do it  too We re living in a moment when norms are in maximum flux  Donald Trump has smashed through hundreds of our established norms and given people permission to say things that were unsayable just a decade ago  Especially in politics  the old rules of decorous behavior no longer apply But we all have the power to create cultural microclimates around us  through the way we act and communicate  When a small group of people shift the way they show approval and disapproval  it can shift the social cures among wider and wider circles  Suddenly  revolutions  The whole school of fish has shifted course in rapid ways that would have astounded us beforehand The Times is committed to

THE HAGUE   Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Friday that Britain s request to delay Brexit until June 30 needs to be  clarified  before or at a summit of European Union leaders next week before EU can grant a postponement  Theresa May s letter raises many questions  which need to be discussed   Rutte told reporters   We hope for more clarity from London before next Wednesday  Rutte said he held out hope that talks between the May s Conservatives and the opposition Labour party to try to agree a cross party approach to Brexit could give more clarity about the way forward  We need to give the British parliament and government the maximum chance in the run up to Wednesday to make clear how they would want to use an extension   Rutte said  And otherwise  we need to see whether we can get that clarity on Wednesday night by talking to May  knowing that a delay only makes sense if we understand the reason for it     Reporting by Stephanie van den Berg and Bart Meijer  Editing by Kevin Liffey  

WASHINGTON   The Justice Department s internal watchdog intends to complete by May or June his investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry  including whether law enforcement officials abused their powers in surveilling a former Trump campaign aide  Attorney General William P  Barr told lawmakers on Tuesday The department s inspector general  Michael E  Horowitz  has been examining how law enforcement officials obtained a warrant in October 2016 to wiretap Carter Page  a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign with links to Russia  Mr  Horowitz s investigators have also asked witnesses about informants that the F B I  turned to in the early stages of the investigation  according to people familiar with his inquiry  The office of the inspector general has a pending investigation of the FISA process in the Russia investigation   Mr  Barr said in testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee  using shorthand for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act   I expect that will be complete in probably May or June  I am told  So hopefully we ll have some answers from Inspector General Horowitz on the issue of the FISA warrants  A spokesman for Mr  Horowitz declined to comment on the timing of the expected report  But the inspector general has previously confirmed that he was looking into the early stages of the Russia inquiry  including wiretap applications  informants and whether any political bias against Mr  Trump influenced investigative decisions Mr  Horowitz s findings could once again upend the Justice Department and F B I   which have been at the center of a political firestorm since the 2016 presidential election over their handling of separate investigations into both Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server and ties between Russia and the Trump campaign  The highly anticipated results of the Russia inquiry are due to be made public  within a week   Mr  Barr said on Tuesday In the Russia investigation  Republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the Page warrant because the application relied in part on Democratic funded opposition research compiled into a dossier by Christopher Steele  a former British intelligence officer who was also an F B I  informant At issue is whether the F B I  and Justice Department made any misrepresentations to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court when seeking the warrant  or if they should have flagged any concerns about the credibility of the information in the application during renewals  If the inspector general finds fault with the F B I   it could help validate Republican accusations that the Russia investigation was politically motivated Mr  Trump s allies have sought to reduce the inquiry to the problematic Steele dossier and to portray the Page wiretap application as its central feature  However  the bureau opened the counterintelligence investigation into Russia s election meddling   including scrutinizing links to the Trump campaign   based on other information  and without the dossier And the Page wiretap was only a small part of the broader Trump Russia investigation  The inquiry involved more than 2 800 subpoenas  nearly 500 search warrants and about 500 witness interviews  Mr  Barr wrote in a letter to Congress describing the conclusions of the coming report by Robert S  Mueller III  the special counsel who took over the investigation in May 2017 Law enforcement officials were also granted three renewals of the wiretap from the surveillance court  Rod J  Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general and a Trump administration appointee  signed the last renewal application  which was granted in June 2017 As part of his investigation  Mr  Horowitz is scrutinizing the F B I  s relationship with Mr  Steele  who provided the politically charged information to the agents trying to determine whether any of Mr  Trump s associates were secretly working with the Russian government s campaign to meddle in the 2016 election Top F B I  officials received the Steele information in September 2016 as they were debating whether to obtain the secret warrant to surveil Mr  Page  Among claims that Mr  Steele compiled from sources was that Mr  Page secretly met a Russian official promising compromising information about Hillary Clinton during a visit to Moscow in July 2016   an accusation Mr  Page has denied Critics have argued that the court should have been explicitly told that the research was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign  arguing that the court did not know that the information had potentially biased origins Justice Department practice in filling out applications for secret wiretaps is to avoid naming Americans or American organizations  and the application contained a lengthy footnote alerting the court that an unnamed person who commissioned Mr  Steele s research was  likely looking for information to discredit  Mr  Trump s campaign The footnote went on to explain to the court that Mr  Steele had  provided reliable information to the F B I   in earlier investigations and that based on that history  the bureau believed his latest information was  credible  The inspector general has also been examining Mr  Steele s contributions to previous F B I  s investigations  according to the people familiar with the inquiry  Investigators for Mr  Horowitz have asked about his role in helping the bureau investigate corruption at FIFA  the governing body of world soccer  suggesting that one focus of his is whether the bureau exaggerated Mr  Steele s previous history with the bureau in its application to wiretap Mr  Page One of the debates surrounding the F B I  s use of information from the Steele dossier in the application is whether it was all crucial to meeting the standard for eavesdropping on Mr  Page s phone calls and emails Asked whether he would have signed off on submitting the application if it did not contain that allegation  James A  Baker  who was the general counsel of the F B I  when it first sought permission to wiretap Mr  Page  called the allegation about Mr  Page s visit to Moscow in 2016  an important  part of the factual case for surveillance  I am not going to sit here and say that there wouldn t have been probable cause or that there would have been probable cause without the dossier   Mr  Baker told lawmakers in the fall who were scrutinizing law enforcement officials  actions during the 2016 election  according to a  transcript of his testimony released on Tuesday But  he also said   there were other things in that application that to me were alarming  as well  Another F B I  lawyer involved in obtaining the warrant  Sally Moyer  told the same committees in October that it was  a close call  but  I think we would have gotten there on probable cause even without the Steele reporting   a transcript of her testimony showed In publicly released documents  the F B I  said it had decided to end its relationship with Mr  Steele in November 2016 after he spoke to the news media about his work for the F B I  after bureau officials had asked him not to do so The inspector general is also scrutinizing another early source of information for the Russia investigation  the people said  Mr  Horowitz s investigators have been asking questions about the role of Stefan A  Halper  another F B I  informant  and his prior work for the bureau Agents involved in the Russia investigation asked Mr  Halper  an American academic who teaches in Britain  to gather information on Mr  Page and George Papadopoulos  another former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser However  Mr  Halper also had additional contacts with other Trump officials that have raised concerns about his activities  In one instance  Mr  Halper reached out to Sam Clovis  a Trump campaign aide  it was not clear whether Mr  Halper had the F B I  s blessing to contact Mr  Clovis Mr  Halper s contacts have prompted Republicans and the president to incorrectly accuse the F B I  of spying on the campaign  Mr  Page has also said he met with Mr  Halper in mid July 2016  about two weeks before the Russia investigation was opened In addition  the inspector general is examining Mr  Steele s contacts with Bruce Ohr  a Justice Department official  according to the people familiar with the inquiry  Mr  Ohr  an expert on Russian organized crime and himself a frequent target of Mr  Trump s ire  spoke with Mr  Steele several times after the F B I  terminated its relationship with the former British spy  and relayed information from those conversations to the bureau Mr  Barr  who was sworn in two months ago  also said that as he was awaiting the outcome of that inquiry  he was studying the F B I  s decision in 2016 to begin investigating ties between Russia and Mr  Trump s campaign   trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016   he said

Welcome to 2019  where it takes just 19 hours for a faked homemade video of Joe Biden to travel from the keyboard of a pseudonymous  memesmith  to the president of the United States  The video  which splices footage from Mr  Biden s recent apology for unwanted touching of several women with older footage of Mr  Biden  ricocheted around the pro Trump corners of the internet  First on Twitter  then across Reddit forums  before getting picked up by White House director of social media Dan Scavino  Donald Trump Jr  and  finally  the president  who appended the caption  WELCOME BACK JOE   WELCOME BACK JOE  pic twitter com b2NbBSX3sx  Donald J  Trump   realDonaldTrump  April 4  2019 The video has been viewed  31 million times and counting and forced Mr  Biden to respond in a tweet   I see that you are on the job and presidential  as always   Yep  a grainy  edited parody clip of the former vice president that s made to look as if he s kissing his own neck and creepily massaging himself will now be forever preserved by the Presidential Records Act  It s a perfectly unbelievable and dispiriting artifact of our fractured and chaotic political media ecosystem  where politicking is conducted

and what you can do about it  The entire event is at once silly  trivial  offensive and  thanks to Donald Trump s Twitter feed  something we re now begrudgingly made to pay attention to  The same goes for the video s creator  a stay at home dad in his mid 30s  who goes by the pseudonym  CarpeDonktum   As his handle indicates  the meme creator is purposefully outrageous and yet  seemingly now has an indirect line to the Oval Office  And his elevation   from a Kansas City keyboard warrior to right wing internet fame as the president s unofficial meme maker   is a telling example of how the internet has fully blurred the lines between meme posting and business of politics  It s definitely an organic process   CarpeDonktum told me over the phone shortly after Mr  Trump tweeted his video   Dan Scavino follows me on Twitter  but there s no formal relationship there between me and the president  If there s something I want to make sure  Scavino  sees  I ll wait for him to post a tweet and try to be the first to reply  linking to what I want to show   He said that he doesn t get paid for any of his videos  other than his Patreon crowdfunding account and occasional YouTube ad revenue  and has no relationships to outside politicians Back in February  Mr  Trump tweeted out a CarpeDonktum video  mocking liberal members of congress during the State of the Union speech  The video  set to the tune of R E M  s  Everybody Hurts   was removed from the president s account for copyright violations  sparking outrage in pro Trump spheres over allegations of censorship  The controversy bolstered CarpeDonktum s reputation among the  MAGA crowd   If a political campaign wanted to hire me to do viral marketing stuff for them  that could be interesting   he mused  I asked if he d work on a Trump 2020 campaign   It depends on the specifics   he said CarpeDonktum started making memes  like countless other online Trump supporters  after spending time on Reddit s The Donald forum  The forum has come under scrutiny for alleged instances of harassment and sometimes hosting content alleged to be from white nationalist personalities or communities  CarpeDonktum denied such behavior went on in the forums His first public meme was posted in the summer of 2017  when Mr  Trump tweeted an infamous gif made by a Reddit user depicting the president body slamming a wrestler whose face had been replaced by CNN s logo  He argues that the nod from Trump and the fallout after the tweet encouraged a race on the pro Trump internet to create the most elaborate meme to troll mainstream media organizations   That s when the game changed   he said   and memes went from being crummy images to these high fidelity ones  Since  CarpeDonktum said he s gone from creating the videos frame by frame in Microsoft s Paint program  to using the expensive  high powered motion graphics software  Adobe After Effects  Last year he won a  10 000 meme contest hosted by the conspiracy site Infowars and now said that he gets more than dozen requests per day to make bespoke political memes  While he said he doesn t  need or care about the money  he expressed hope that his information warfare tactics could someday lead to something more   like a job doing viral marketing for political candidates According to their creator  it s no fluke that the videos caught the eye of the president  he tailors them to an older generation of internet users  The elaborate memes feature footage from old Looney Tunes cartoons or depict Mr  Trump as a cowboy from an old John Wayne style Western  slapping a man with a CNN or MSNBC logo across its head   It s boomer humor   he said of his style of videos   I m not a boomer  But that brand of humor is most easily shareable by lots of people  So  I stay away from real violence  or overly sexualized stuff so it appeals to the largest amount of people   The strategy works  The videos share extremely well among an aging Trump supporter contingent who are prolific and aggressive posters of misinformation and hyperpartisan content on platforms like Facebook  They also make the rounds on Fox News   Sean Hannity is going to play the video tonight   he told me  a short clip ran early in his Hannity s broadcast    Some kids that are 18 can retweet it and so can some grandma in Wisconsin  It s slightly edgy but universal  Though his videos are dressed up using cartoons or slapstick humor  all of them center on the incendiary  offensive and hyperpartisan themes of Mr  Trump s politics  the wall  anti media sentiment  making fun of Hillary Clinton and other Democrats   And CarpeDonktum  who described himself as  an entertainer  who  wants to make people laugh   is not above engaging in all caps Trumpian politics  which includes angrily tweeting at liberal politicians   His desire not to reveal his name suggests that he s aware that those outside Trumpland find his content toxic   I m not shy about this stuff but I don t advertise it   he said   If I were to go to a party I wouldn t introduce myself as the  Trump meme guy from Twitter   That CarpeDonktum s online musings or personal life should be picked apart is controversial in its own right  At first glance  it feels silly  maybe even wrong  to elevate him  He s not a politician  He s a Reddit user wielding far right  Dad humor   He s not a public figure  save a few Infowars appearances and Persicope live stream videos where he films himself talking while he makes lunch for his children But at a time when our politics is programmed by what s viral on Twitter  CarpeDonktum appears   stupefyingly as it might seem   to have something approaching power in MAGAland  It appears he senses it  too   All of the memes and stuff like that   he said   That s the future of political advertising    The 30 second spots on TV aren t the way to market anymore  The stuff online that people dismiss as memes   that s the way to motivate people   he added   It s the viral political marketing of the future   In theory  his story is a perfect realization of the utopian understanding of the utopian promise of the internet  a truly democratic system of communication where anyone  anywhere can create things and get them seen by important people   even the president  But in keeping with our current political moment  that utopian vision is used for vapid  divisive ends  The reality  as we should all know by now  is darker and a whole lot dumber  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or

Israel s parliamentary election on Tuesday brings an end to a neck and neck campaign that saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  the veteran politician of the Israeli right and one of the country s longest serving leaders  facing the strongest challenge in years  Mr  Netanyahu s tenure has been marked by a collapse of peace talks with the Palestinians  confrontation with Iran  armed conflict with Hamas  and hostility toward what he views as plots to isolate and delegitimize the Jewish state But Mr  Netanyahu has also overseen an era of healthy economic growth and stability  thawed relations with Sunni Arab leaders and expanded Israeli trade ties in Africa  Latin America and Asia   Read more on Mr  Netanyahu s ties with President Trump that have emboldened him to take policy risks  The prime minister is entangled in corruption scandals that could lead to his indictment  And he faces stiff competition from a new rival  Benny Gantz  the leader of a trio of former generals who could end Mr  Netanyahu s 10 uninterrupted years as prime minister But Israeli elections are complicated and unpredictable  with many parties vying for votes and at times forming opportunistic

White alliance  a coalition named for the colors of the Israeli flag  slightly ahead of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  a dominant force on the Israeli right for decades Their policy stances are similar  a reflection of how Israeli politics have moved increasingly to the right under Mr  Netanyahu  But while Mr  Gantz has sought allies from across the spectrum  Mr  Netanyahu has reached out to the far right to strengthen his prospects for a parliamentary majority  He even has promised to begin extending sovereignty over the occupied West Bank  which the Palestinians want for a future state  if he is re elected The Blue and White leaders are drawing on their military backgrounds to counter Mr  Netanyahu s contention that only he can protect Israel  Mr  Gantz and his colleagues have also focused on the corruption accusations against Mr  Netanyahu  his biggest vulnerability  to press their case that new leadership is needed They have attracted backing from smaller centrist parties  And what remains of the left leaning opposition has thrown its support behind Mr  Gantz for prime minister  The Labor Party would be likely to recommend Mr  Gantz for the premiership after the election What makes this election different Mr  Netanyahu could be indicted  Israel s attorney general announced last month that he planned to bring charges of bribery  fraud and breach of trust  A final decision on charges is likely by year s end  Under the current law  Mr  Netanyahu  if re elected  would not have to resign until a final conviction  although new legislation or public pressure could force him to step down  Mr  Netanyahu has described the charges as a baseless partisan witch hunt  But with a first sitting prime minister to be charged  Israel would be entering uncharted legal and political terrain The uncertainty has worked against Mr  Netanyahu in the prelude to the vote   The attorney general s report has done something that has never happened in Israel s 70 year history  and that is that a prime minister is under a legal cloud   said David Makovsky  an expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  The election also is the first time that three former heads of the army  the Israel Defense Forces  have united to run for office  The Blue and White alliance is led by Mr  Gantz and two other veteran generals  Gabi Ashkenazi and Moshe Yaalon They have teamed up with a well known centrist party  Yesh Atid  led by Yair Lapid  a former journalist  television host and finance minister  Mr  Gantz has agreed to hand off the prime minister position to Mr  Lapid after two and a half years if their parties win  While Mr  Netanyahu has a strong record of defending Israel  the Blue and White alliance s military credentials have made it more difficult for him to attack Mr  Gantz and his colleagues as weak on security   The question is  will it neutralize the advantage that Netanyahu has accrued over his previous four terms of being  Mr  Security    Mr  Makovsky said   He s said the words Israelis want to hear   I ll keep you safe    How does the voting work Voters cast ballots for parties  not individual candidates  to fill seats in the 120 member Knesset  or Parliament  The seats are divided proportionally based on the percentage of the vote each party receives  Any party that wins 3 25 percent or more of the vote gets at least one seat  If parties don t pass that threshold   and many smaller parties do not   their votes won t be counted  That will raise the share of seats given to the other parties  If one party were to win at least 61 seats  it would be entitled to form a government  But this has never happened in Israeli politics  So once the seats have been apportioned  parties try to cobble together coalitions that control a majority of seats  ImageAn election billboard for the New Right party  with which Likud is expected to align CreditDan Balilty for The New York TimesWhat might those alliances look like Polls have suggested that Likud and Blue and White will each get about 30 seats   meaning both will be seeking alliances with smaller parties  Likud is expected to align with a  right wing party known as the New Right  and with an extreme right alliance known as the Union of Right Wing Parties  which includes Jewish Power  widely criticized as an extremist  anti Arab racist party  Potential Blue and White coalition partners include the Labor Party and the leftist Meretz Party  among others  Read about the Palestinian rapper who is  urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes by boycotting the elections  Will the outcome of the vote be clear immediately Probably not  The president  Reuven Rivlin  has the discretion to give the party leader with the best chance of forming a majority coalition the first opportunity  Typically  but not always  that opportunity goes to the leader of the party with the most votes  who then has 42 days to try  If that party leader fails  the president turns to another to attempt to create a coalition  So it could take a few months It also is possible that the Likud and the Blue and White coalition would join forces and create a national unity government  In theory  Mr  Rivlin could offer both Mr  Gantz and Mr  Netanyahu this opportunity and they could take turns as prime minister Mr  Gantz has rejected that idea  vowing that he will not sit on a government with Mr

Israel They represent nearly a fifth of the country s 5 8 million eligible voters  which could give the four Israeli Arab parties a potential kingmaker role  But these parties have never joined a governing coalition in Israel  And some Israeli Arab voters have vowed to boycott the election  partly in protest of a new law pushed by Mr  Netanyahu declaring Israel as the  nation state of the Jewish people   Critics have called the law racist and undemocratic What about Palestinians in occupied territory They are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote in the election  About 4 75 million Palestinians fall into this category  according to the Institute for Middle East Understanding  an American nonprofit educational group that promotes Palestinian viewpoints Could the election affect a potential peace plan Still steeped in secrecy  President Trump s long anticipated plan to resolve the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is not much of an issue in the election  Nevertheless  it could be affected Jared Kushner  Mr  Trump s son in law  who has been leading the administration s efforts to draft the plan  said it would not be made public until after the election Many Palestinians already have dismissed the plan   whatever it may contain   because they see Mr  Trump as siding with Israel  But the plan also faces a threat from the parties of the Israeli extreme right  which see any concessions to the Palestinians as unacceptable  If Mr  Netanyahu needs those parties to form a coalition  Mr  Trump s peace plan may be doomed However  if Blue and White wins or forms a national unity government with Likud  that could make way for possible cooperation with the Trump administration on a plan  David M  Halbfinger  Isabel Kershner and Herbert Buchsbaum

PARIS   French President Emmanuel Macron wants to declare April 7 as a national day of commemoration of the Rwandan genocide  his Elysee office said in a statement on Sunday The presidency made the announcement as the Rwandan government started commemorations marking the 25th anniversary of the genocide against Tutsi and moderate Hutus  raising the curtain on a three month remembrance period The French president will not attend official commemorations of the massacre on Sunday  He will be represented by Herv Berville  a Tutsi survivor of the genocide who is a member of French parliament from Macron s ruling party Rwandan President Paul Kagame has accused Paris of being complicit in the bloodshed in which Hutu militias killed around 800 000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus While Paris has acknowledged mistakes in its dealings with Rwanda  it has repeatedly dismissed accusations that it trained militias to take part in the massacre The statement on Sunday did not give further details on how the anniversary would be marked in France  French high schools will start teaching the Rwandan genocide from September 2020 Separately  Macron has appointed researchers to carry out a two year investigation into the role of the French army in the genocide   Reporting by Dominique Vidalon  Editing by Keith Weir  

WASHINGTON   Democrats in the House of Representatives are gearing up to issue subpoenas to try to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election and President Donald Trump s actions related to the inquiry The question is  how successful will they be Attorney General William Barr  who has broad authority under Justice Department regulations to decide how much of Mueller s report to release  sent lawmakers a four page letter on March 24 explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  and has promised to release the nearly 400 page report by the middle of this month  with some parts blacked out  or  redacted  That has not satisfied Democrats  who control the House  The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over the complete report  without redactions  as well as underlying evidence Here is an explanation of the legal hurdles Democrats must clear in their subpoena effort  important judicial precedents and Barr s rationale for keeping parts of the report confidential CAN CONGRESS SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH Yes  Committees of the House and Senate possess the power to issues subpoenas for documents held by the executive branch or other subjects in investigations  Under the U S  Constitution  Congress is a co equal branch of the federal government alongside the executive branch and judiciary If Barr refuses to comply with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to obtain the full report and underlying investigative material  the House could vote to hold him  in contempt  and turn to the courts to enforce the subpoena  Legal experts said that process could take years  Barr s  principal conclusions  letter said Mueller s inquiry did not establish that Trump s campaign team conspired with Russia  Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the Republican president committed obstruction of justice but also did not exonerate him  Barr subsequently concluded that Trump had not engaged in criminal obstruction The letter provided scant details of the findings  though Trump immediately claimed  complete and total exoneration   The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over Trump s presidency  House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into Trump  who is seeking re election in 2020 A situation analogous to the current subpoena fight unfolded during the presidency of Trump s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama  In 2012  the House  then controlled by Republicans  subpoenaed internal Justice Department documents related to a failed federal law enforcement operation to track illegal gun sales  dubbed  Fast and Furious   Obama s attorney general  Eric Holder  refused to comply  The House voted to hold him in contempt  marking the first time in U S  history that Congress took such action against a sitting member of a president s Cabinet The Justice Department later turned over thousands of pages of documents but the matter was not resolved until after Obama left office  with a settlement reached in 2018 WHY DID BARR NOT SIMPLY RELEASE THE WHOLE REPORT Barr told lawmakers in a March 29 letter that he was making  redactions that are required  before releasing the Mueller report  He cited four reasons for redactions  protecting secret grand jury proceedings  safeguarding intelligence gathering sources and methods  shielding material that could affect ongoing investigations  and protecting information that would unduly infringe on personal privacy and reputations Grand juries are groups of citizens who meet in secret and decide whether to authorize criminal indictments or demands for evidence sought by prosecutors  U S  law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret  though there are exceptions that let Congress  and even the general public  see it Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege  which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government WHAT LAWS AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS APPLY Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight Under U S  law  grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret  But if a grand jury matter involves  grave hostile acts of a foreign power  or other intelligence information  the information can be shared with appropriate government officials  The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr  Leon Jaworski  a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal  produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings H R  Haldeman  who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff  sought to block that information from Congress  citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr  The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington  which ruled 5 1 against Haldeman  The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation  and noted that the Democratic led House Judiciary committee had taken  elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials   The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office  Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment  If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material  a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play  Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski  citing executive privilege  The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court  saying the president s interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary s need for evidence   Reporting by Jan Wolfe  Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder

BANGKOK   Thailand s first general election since a 2014 army coup has been touted by the ruling military junta as a return to democratic rule  but two weeks after the vote  results are still unclear and allegations of manipulation are mounting Since the March 24 vote  figures linked to a  democratic front  of opposition parties say they have come under increasing pressure from police and the military The Election Commission has also indicated it would use a complex allocation formula for 150  party seats  in the House of Representatives in a way that would likely dilute the opposition alliance s seats in the 500 seat lower house The Election Commission has said it won t announce even provisional winners of the 150 party seats until May 9  saying it needs time to order by elections and vote recounts as well as to disqualify candidates who broke election laws But critics say the time gap allows the military royalist establishment to manipulate results and disqualify opponents of the pro army Palang Pracharat party that seeks to keep junta leader Prayuth Chan ocha in power as an elected prime minister  The leading opposition Pheu Thai party  made up of loyalists to army ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  sees the delays and legal actions as an attempt to deny the  democratic front  enough seats in the House needed to block the main junta linked party from unrestrained lawmaking power  After the election     the majority of the people feels a sense of hopelessness and distrust for the election process   said Pheu Thai s secretary general  Phumtham Wechayachai  People are talking about the Election Commission s part in supporting the extension of power by the National Council for Peace and Order   he said  using the junta s formal name The Election Commission s secretary general  Jaroongwit Phumma  told Reuters the body is not helping the pro military party  The election commission is neutral and adheres to the law  We don t take sides or help one particular party   Jaroongwit said Palang Pracharat said it does not gain any advantages over opposition parties   It s completely false to say that the election commission is helping Palang Pracharat  This is an attempt to discredit us   the party s deputy spokesman Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana told Reuters  SEDITION CHARGEHowever  opposition figures say they are being targeted Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  the leader of the youth oriented Future Forward Party which did surprisingly well in the vote  was charged on Saturday with sedition on a junta complaint dating back to 2015   a case that could see his party disbanded  Online campaigns have also cast Thanathorn as anti monarchy  a serious crime in Thailand  where the monarchy is revered without question  Thanathorn denies being against the monarchy and all charges against him  It s the establishment s desire to stir hatred  fear  and mistrust among the people  creating legitimacy for the military to take over and stay on   Thanathorn said last week Winthai Suvaree  a spokesman for the junta  said the charges against Thanathorn were not aimed at weakening the opposition and were  entirely unrelated to current political events   ABNORMAL ELECTION  The rules of the election were written in the 2017 junta backed constitution  which critics said were aimed at ensuring military influence in Thai politics Among the new provisions is that the Senate  the 250 seat upper house of parliament appointed by the junta  must approve the prime minister in a combined vote with the House  which previously solely voted on the premier That means the junta backed party and its allies have to gain only 126 seats in the House to install Prayuth as prime minister  while the opposition would need 376 votes for their potential candidate Still  days after the March 24 vote  the  democratic front  claimed through its own calculations that it would gain at least 255 House seats   not be enough to form a government but potentially allowing it to block the military backed party from having free rein Last week  however  the election commission indicated the complex formula to calculate allocation of the 150  party list  seats will round up decimals to give seats to 11 small parties although their popular votes did not meet a previously described threshhold required to earn even one seat  This is an

LONDON   The World Health Organization  WHO  on Wednesday said it had reconvened an expert panel to consider whether an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo constitutes a public health emergency of international concern The panel  which first met on this issue in October 2018  will also give updated recommendations on how global health officials should manage the outbreak  the WHO said in a statement from its Geneva headquarters At least 740 people have died among the more than 1 100 infected in this epidemic  which began in August 2018 Declaring the outbreak a  public health emergency of international concern   or PHEIC  would ramp up the international response with a formal alert that puts governments on notice and helps to mobilise resources and research The WHO said that while the outbreak is contained to the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri  efforts to bring it under control in these urban areas have been hampered by security and access problems  As a result  it said  Ebola transmission has increased in some areas   Though the risk of spread within the country and to neighbouring countries is very high  the risk remains low globally   the WHO statement added The emergency panel s meeting will take place on Friday April 12 and its decision will be published late the same day   Reporting by Kate Kelland  Editing by David Goodman

Federal officials said Tuesday that they had dismantled a  1 2 billion Medicare scheme that spanned continents and ensnared hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting elderly and disabled patients Under the scheme  which the authorities described as one of the largest health care frauds in United States history  doctors prescribed back  shoulder  wrist and knee braces that were not needed  prosecutors said  Twenty four people were charged  according to the Justice Department  These defendants   who range from corporate executives to medical professionals   allegedly participated in an expansive and sophisticated fraud to exploit telemedicine technology meant for patients otherwise unable to access health care   Brian Benczkowski  the assistant attorney general for the department s criminal division  said in a statement Some of the accused were owners of durable medical equipment companies that paid kickbacks and bribes to doctors to write prescriptions for braces that were medically unnecessary  according to the authorities An international telemarketing network with call centers in the Philippines and Latin America would reach out to Medicare beneficiaries  persuading them to get the free or low cost braces  The doctors would sometimes write prescriptions without speaking to the patient  The defendants took advantage of unwitting patients who were simply trying to get relief from their health concerns   Craig Carpenito  the United States attorney for New Jersey  said in a statement   Instead  the defendants preyed upon their weakened state and pushed millions of dollars  worth of unnecessary medical devices  which Medicare paid for  and then set up an elaborate system for laundering their ill gotten proceeds  The defendants laundered the proceeds through international shell companies and used the money to buy exotic cars  yachts and luxury real estate around the world  the authorities said Prosecutors brought charges related to the payment of bribes  illegal kickbacks  money laundering and conspiracy to commit health care fraud against people in California  Florida  New Jersey  Pennsylvania  South Carolina and Texas The individuals charged included the chief executives or employees of five telemedicine companies  the owners of dozens of durable medical equipment companies and three licensed medical professionals  the Justice Department said In Florida  Willie McNeal IV  the owner and chief executive of two telemedicine companies  hired health care providers and then paid them to prescribe braces for Medicare beneficiaries regardless of whether it was medically necessary  according to an indictment  Mr  McNeal would then receive illegal kickbacks in exchange for ordering those braces  the indictment said Mr  McNeal  42  facilitated the submission of fraudulent Medicare claims worth nearly  250 million  the government said  If convicted  the government demanded that Mr  McNeal forfeit the profits obtained from the illegal kickbacks and any property that was purchased with those proceeds  including 10 properties in Florida John Lauro  a lawyer representing Mr  McNeal  said in a phone interview on Tuesday that he could not comment on the specifics of the allegations but that he was disappointed by the Justice Department s decision to arrest Mr  McNeal with  no advance warning  or opportunity to explain himself  They simply arrested without asking any questions or giving the client the opportunity to talk about the telemedicine business model   Mr  Lauro said In a case out of South Carolina  more than a dozen companies owned by Andrew Chmiel  43  billed Medicare for more than  200 million as part of a scheme to sell medically unnecessary equipment  according to an indictment  The indictment listed three properties  six cars and nearly two dozen bank accounts as subject to forfeiture if Mr  Chmiel is convicted Mr  Chmiel s lawyer said he was reviewing the indictment  but did not immediately comment on the charges The alleged scheme was investigated by the F B I  and the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general  and is being prosecuted by the Justice Department  The I R S  and 17 United States attorney s offices also took part in the crackdown  

WASHINGTON   U S  job openings dropped to an 11 month low in February and hiring decreased  which could partially explain a sharp slowdown in job growth during that month Still  the labor market remains a pillar of support for the economy amid signs that activity was easing because of the fading boost from a  1 5 trillion tax cut package and the effects of interest rate increases over the last few years  The economy is also facing headwinds from slowing global growth and the United States  trade war with China  The February job openings data reinforced that the labor market weakened in February but there isn t any cause for concern   said Ryan Sweet  a senior economist at Moody s Analytics in West Chester  Pennsylvania  Job openings  a measure of labor demand  tumbled by 538 000 to a seasonally adjusted 7 1 million  the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey  or JOLTS  report on Tuesday  The drop was the biggest since August 2015  The level was the lowest since March 2018 Vacancies in the accommodation and food services industry fell by 103 000 jobs in February  There were 72 000 fewer job openings in the real estate and rental and leasing sector  Job openings in the transportation  warehousing and utilities sector dropped by 66 000 Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 33 000 jobs in February  the fewest since September 2017  The near stall in job gains was partially blamed on colder weather and also viewed as payback after robust increases in December and January  Job growth picked up in March  with the economy creating 196 000 positions  the government reported last Friday WORKERS STILL SCARCEThe drop in job openings in February likely does not change the theme of labor shortages in the economy  A survey of small businesses published on Tuesday found that just over a fifth of owners reported difficulties finding qualified workers as their  single most important business problem  in March According to the survey from the NFIB  39 percent of small business owners reported job openings they could not fill in March  Thirty three percent said they had openings for skilled workers and 14 percent have vacancies for unskilled labor Economists expect monthly job growth to average roughly 150 000 this year  stepping down from 223 000 in 2018   There are still millions of help wanted signs out there in the country so we hesitate to revise our outlook for the labor market overall   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York  The dive in job openings in February pushed down the vacancies rate to 4 5 percent from 4 8 percent in January  Hiring fell to 5 7 million in February from 5 8 million in the prior month  The decrease in hiring was led by the construction sector  where hiring fell by 73 000  Hiring in the nondurable goods manufacturing industry dropped by 33 000 in February  Hiring by state and local government education departments fell 22 000 The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs was little changed at 3 5 million in February  keeping the quits rate at 2 3 percent for a ninth straight month  The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence  The worker reluctance to switch jobs is despite the tight labor market conditions that are steadily driving up wages  This is not as many quits as you would expect in such a tight labor market  when workers are in higher demand   said Nick Bunker  an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab   Though perhaps this isn t surprising in the short term given that the ratio of unemployed workers to job openings has been rising  Layoffs increased in February  lifting the layoffs rate to 1 2 percent from 1 1 percent in January  There were increases in layoffs in the professional and businesses services  and healthcare and social assistance sectors in February    Reporting By Lucia Mutikani  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci  

Pregnant women who work night shifts may have an increased risk for miscarriage Researchers studied 22 744 pregnant Danish women  tracking their work schedules and hospital admissions for miscarriage using government databases The study  in Occupational   Environmental Medicine  found that after eight weeks of pregnancy  women who had worked two or more night shifts during the previous week had a 32 percent increased risk of miscarriage compared with women who did not work nights  Working only one night shift a week did not significantly increase the risk The study adjusted for maternal age  previous miscarriages  smoking  socioeconomic status  body mass index and other factors The lead author  Dr  Luise Moelenberg Begtrup  a postdoctoral researcher at Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen  said that this is an observational study that does not prove causality  and that it has to be replicated in other studies and in other populations  Most of the women in this study were health care workers Why this happens is not known  but irregular sleep may affect production of the hormone melatonin  which is thought to play a role in maintaining optimal function of the placenta  We are not recommending that you should avoid night shifts entirely   Dr  Begtrup said   But organizing them properly is important  Our data was very strong  and my recommendation at this time would be only one night shift a week for pregnant women   

President Trump s declaration that Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a foreign terrorist organization is the first time the United States government has designated a part of another country s military as that type of threat  In doing so  Mr  Trump took broad aim at a pillar of the Iranian state  which exerts enormous influence in politics and the economy as well as in Iran s internal and external military policies Mr  Trump said the Revolutionary Guard Corps  actively participates in  finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft  The Iranian government has used the Guard Corps internationally to create  train  arm and sometimes plot strategy for paramilitary forces and nonstate actors in other countries  Iran s adversaries have accused elite Guard Corps units of having plotted and sometimes carried out assassinations in foreign countries Since many businesses are linked to the Guard Corps   it is thought to have ties to companies that do more than  20 billion worth of business annually  according to estimates by British and American research groups   the sanctions could touch many businesses outside Iran Iran s enemies  notably Israel and Saudi Arabia  which have long feared the power of the Guard Corps  welcomed Mr  Trump s announcement  But those who have relied on Iran s help  including Iraq  worried about how the new sanctions might make even more fraught its balancing act between the United States and Iran Who are the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Founded in the early days of the 1979 Iranian revolution that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power  the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps started as a military force assigned to safeguard the new government and Mr  Khomeini  who as supreme leader was Iran s most powerful theological and political figure  The Guard Corps reported directly to Mr  Khomeini and later to his successor  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  so its power cannot easily be checked by Iran s other institutions Since its founding  the Guard Corps has vastly expanded and now constitutes one of the three main branches of Iran s armed forces  along with the army and the police The Guard Corps has more than 125 000 active duty personnel and controls a paramilitary force known as the Basij  according to a survey by the International Institute for Strategic Studies  a British research group  The Basij often has been used to repress antigovernment protesters  according to Iranian dissidents and others The Guard also has specialists in ballistic missile technology and asymmetric warfare  along with its own air force  navy and intelligence service  Critics accuse the Guard s intelligence operatives of tracking down anyone deemed an enemy of the state ImageMembers of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps protecting Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Qom  Iran  in 1979 CreditMichel Lipchitz Associated PressHow is the Guard different from other parts of the military While the army defends Iranian territory  the Guard was set up to safeguard against internal uprisings and threats from ideological opponents  within or outside the country  Guard members view themselves as keepers of Iran s revolutionary flame The Guard is best known for the power it projects outside Iran in making foreign policy through training militias in foreign countries and undertaking operations such as fighting the Islamic State  the Sunni extremist militant group regarded as a terrorist organization by virtually all countries The Guard also differs from other branches of the armed forces in the strong influence it wields over who gains political power  The Guard controls directly and indirectly billions of dollars in contracts in construction  electricity and engineering  as well as in other strategic fields such as telecommunications and media  Many large companies are either tied to individuals in the Guard or run by former members What is the Guard s Al Quds Force The most elite members of the Guard are in the Al Quds Force  numbering a few thousand  whose work is focused mostly outside Iran  Its members are believed to carry out clandestine operations including assassinations  and are experts in asymmetric warfare  They have trained nonstate actors in foreign countries including Hamas in the Palestinian territories  Hezbollah in Lebanon  and Shiite militias in Syria and Iraq The Al Quds Force was designated as a supporter of foreign terrorist organizations  including the Taliban and others  more than 10 years ago by the Treasury Department What attacks have been linked to the Al Quds Force They include an attempted assassination of the Saudi ambassador to Washington  the attempted assassination of an Israeli diplomat in New Delhi  and the capture and killing of five American military personnel by an Iraqi militia in a 2007 attack in Karbala  Iraq  The Al Quds Force also is thought to have initially supplied and then helped train Iraqis to manufacture roadside bombs that could destroy armored vehicles used by American soldiers in Iraq What else do Guard Corps members do Increasingly they exercise power domestically through their businesses and propaganda wings  which not only own media companies but are also are active in Iranian universities  While involved in business of all kinds  Guard Corps members focus on those that have strategic implications  according to analysts at the London based International Institute for Strategic Studies ImageMaj  Gen  Qassim Suleimani is the powerful leader of the Quds Force CreditOffice of the Iranian PresidencyWho leads the Revolutionary Guard Corps The top commander is Maj  Gen  Mohammad Ali Jafari  He has held the position since 2007  Equally powerful  but perhaps with a higher profile  is the Quds Force leader  Maj  Gen  Qassim Suleimani General Suleimani is regarded as a hero in Iran  and perhaps a future leader of the country  He has been credited with having made some of the earliest liaisons between Iraqi organizations that opposed Saddam Hussein and Iran During the 1980 88 Iran Iraq war  he forged alliances with the Shiite Badr Organization of Iraq and with Kurdish leaders from different parties General Suleimani has been especially active in Iraq since 2014 when the Iraqi Army collapsed in the face of aggressive adherents of the Islamic State who seized Mosul and other cities  He helped to organize young Iraqi Shiite fighters who rallied to fight the Islamic State and ultimately  along with American air support and Special Operations forces  helped Iraq regain control over its territory Nonetheless  the United States has long considered General Suleimani a dangerous threat  And General Suleimani has not been shy about publicly rebuking the Trump administration Last July  when President Trump warned Iran not to threaten the United States  General Suleimani dismissed his warning in a speech as  cabaret style rhetoric

The United States military evacuated its small contingent of troops from the Libyan capital on Sunday as rival militias raced to stop the forces of an aspiring strongman  Gen  Khalifa Hifter  from taking control of the city Forces under the command of General Hifter made a surprise advance on the outskirts of the capital  Tripoli  on Thursday  setting up a battle with a coalition of armed factions from the region around the city   the grand prize in a chaotic eight year fight for control after the ouster of the dictator Muammar el Qaddafi during the Arab Spring revolts Tripoli is the northern African country s financial hub  receiving the income from sales of Libyan oil  housing the central bank and paying the salaries of soldiers and other public employees across the country By Sunday morning  both sides had begun attacking from the air  using the small and primitive air forces at their command  but the exact targets and extent of the damage could not be immediately determined The United States State Department  which previously joined a call by several countries for restraint from both sides  shifted on Sunday to urging General Hifter to pull back  We oppose the military offensive  by his forces  and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Sunday night   Forces should return to the status quo ante positions  General Hifter  75  already has at least loose control over most of eastern Libya  as well as important parts of the southern desert  His forces  advance on Tripoli this past week has now put him in striking distance of fulfilling a five year old vow to reunite Libya Some analysts  however  say that he has extended his supply lines so far that without a quick victory  he could be forced into a humiliating retreat ImageGeneral Hifter  center  at a military parade in Benghazi last year CreditAbdullah Doma Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesGeneral Hifter s forces appeared to have maintained control of the defunct international airport since Friday evening  putting them within 17 miles of the Mediterranean coast and Tripoli s central square Residents of Tripoli said that the two sides had spent the days mobilizing and deploying their forces  with a more pitched battle expected on Sunday  By afternoon  residents reported that the coalition of Tripoli area militias was fighting to drive General Hifter s forces out of the town of Aziziya  about 20 miles southwest of Tripoli The United Nations mission in Libya called on Sunday for a humanitarian truce for two hours later in the day to evacuate the wounded from Aziziya  the area around the airport and another location By night  General Hifter s forces appeared to have advanced slightly on one front while falling back slightly on another  About 20 people had died and about 25 others were wounded  according to tallies by the Libyan Red Crescent Representatives of the United Nations mission in Libya said on Sunday that it remained active in Libya and had not evacuated  But the United States military personnel left by boat on Sunday morning  according to a resident who provided photographs of the ship as it departed The United States military s Africa Command said in a statement that its mission in Libya had included providing support to diplomatic efforts  as well as  counterterrorism activities   The security realities on the ground in Libya are growing increasingly complex and unpredictable   Gen  Thomas D  Waldhauser of the Marine Corps  the head of United States Africa Command  said in the statement   Even with an adjustment of the force  we will continue to remain agile in support of existing U S  strategy  Libya collapsed into a patchwork of city states after the ouster of Colonel Qaddafi  Each city established its own militia and multiple militias competed for control of the two largest cities  Tripoli in the west and Benghazi in the east  In Tripoli  some of the dominant militias have also profited from extortion  migrant trafficking and other illegal activities  according to residents and United Nations observers General Hifter  a former officer in Colonel Qaddafi s army  once sought to lead a coup against him and then lived in Virginia as a C I A  client  He returned during the uprising against Colonel Qaddafi in 2011  and from a base in eastern Libya  he has received extensive backing from Egypt and the United Arab Emirates  both of which have sought to restore some version of the old authoritarian order as a way to stabilize the country ImageForces loyal to Libya s United Nations backed unity government in Tajura  a coastal suburb of Tripoli  the capital  on Saturday CreditMahmud Turkia Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesIn more recent years  France has provided military assistance in the hope that General Hifter could help stop the free flow of migrants and extremists through the Sahara to the south  and Russia has helped him print currency in order to restore liquidity to the economy in areas under his control The United States has publicly backed the attempts of the United Nations to set up an alternative government in Tripoli that may unify the warring factions  But without any significant military force of its own in the country  the United Nations backed government has remained dependent on local militias for security  And General Hifter has not shown any willingness to submit to civilian authority The advance of his forces toward Tripoli has brought together a new coalition to stop him  including several militias based in the city  as well as powerful brigades from the cities of Misrata  on the coast  and Zintan  in the mountains to the west Analysts say that the next phase of the battle may turn on the question of whether that coalition holds together or any of its components break ranks to strike an accommodation with General Hifter The United States military has sought to remain neutral between the United Nations  so called Government of National Accord  or G N A   on one hand  and General Hifter s forces  which he calls the Libyan National Army  or L N A   on the other  We don t want to get in front of the diplomatic effort  and we want to maintain our neutrality   General Waldhauser explained in remarks to the news media at a security conference in Munich in February   because it s very  very important that we don t  all of a sudden  back one side that turns the other way  The Libyan militias  change allegiances quite regularly   General Waldhauser continued   And so our U S  position has always been and continues to be to support the G N A  But at the same time  you know  Hifter and the L N A  are a factor there  and whatever solution comes to pass is going to involve the L N A  and Hifter  To prepare for all possibilities  General Waldhauser said   we support the G N A  but we have lines of communications open with others   including General Hifter On Sunday  the State Department said that  the administration at the highest levels has made clear its deep concern about fighting near Tripoli  It added   All involved parties should urgently de escalate the situation  which is endangering civilians and undermining prospects for a better future for all Libyans

BRUSSELS   The European Union  which does more than 1 5 billion euros a day in two way trade with China  came late to the industrial  political and security threats China poses  For a long time  Europe saw China as another Japan  only with some human rights issues But with the outspoken ambitions of the Chinese leader  Xi Jinping  and continuing battles over technology transfer  closed markets and industrial espionage  that is changing On Tuesday  the European Union and China met in Brussels for their 21st annual summit  The challenge for Europe is to forge a united front in the face of a China that only last month it labeled an  economic competitor  in critical industrial fields and a  systemic rival  politically The mood is certainly tougher now  especially after Italy last month became the first Group of 7 country to join China s vast Belt and Road project  which the French analyst Franois Heisbourg described as  China s own concept on how to organize the global space  In difficult negotiations  the Europeans had a hard time finding agreement on a joint statement with the Chinese that is serious about substance  They succeeded up to a point  but the commitments made by China are more about further talks than specific actions Donald Tusk  the European Council president  pointed to China s agreement to discuss reform of the World Trade Organization s rules on industrial subsidies  which he termed a  breakthrough  But Jean Claude Juncker  who leads the bloc s bureaucracy as president of the European Commission  said tartly that  progress is slower than we like   The Europeans did succeed  by threatening not to sign a joint statement  in getting a promise to conclude a long discussed bilateral investment deal by the end of 2020  which would improve market access  and a promise to limit forced technology transfers ImageThe port of Trieste  Italy  could benefit from a new economic accord between Italy and China CreditNadia Shira Cohen for The New York TimesBut a senior European official also pointed to a statement finally reached after the last summit  in Beijing in July  which was full of promises not delivered  especially on issues like investment ground rules and market reciprocity  which are sources of tension now If anything  there has been backsliding and more vivid violations of human rights  like the detention of foreigners and the settlement camps for Uighurs Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China  who led the delegation to Brussels  defended China s practices while insisting that Beijing  follows W T O  rules   He said China was  ready to work with the E U  and others for consensus and have discussions on reform    emphasizing that the two sides  have common interests on many issues   If China is now a  systemic rival   the joint statement did not reflect that new view  but tried to preserve a sense of partnership  said Theresa Fallon  director of the Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies in Brussels The joint statement  she said   also highlights the E U  s preferred approach of dialogue and cooperation with China and is a contrast to President Trump s more assertive approach  Last month  President Emmanuel Macron of France said that the European Union had finally woken up to China   China plays on our divisions   he said   The period of European navet is over  But the bloc was slow to respond to Belt and Road  just as it was slow to react to China s effort in 2012 to sow divisions on the Continent with its  16 plus 1  initiative   itself and 16 Central and Eastern European nations

And already countries with significant financial ties to China  like Greece and Italy  have blocked European consensus on resolutions condemning Chinese behavior  China will attempt to use every opportunity  including the E U  China Summit  and the 16 plus 1 meeting in Croatia  to pit Europeans against each other and against the United States    said Jamie Fly  the director of the Asia and Future of Geopolitics Programs for the German Marshall Fund in Washington   It would be foolish and shortsighted to take the bait   he added Avoiding that may not be easy  President Trump sees the

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  ALBANY   In an attempt to work around the White House  Democratic lawmakers in Albany are trying to do what their federal counterparts have so far failed to accomplish  to obtain President Trump s tax returns Albany lawmakers are seeking state tax returns  not the federal ones at the heart of the current standoff in Washington  But a tax return from New York   the president s home state  and the headquarters of his business empire   could likely contain much of the same financial information as a federal return Under a bill that is scheduled to be introduced this week  the commissioner of the New York Department of Taxation and Finance would be permitted to release any state tax return requested by leaders of three congressional committees for any  specific and legitimate legislative purpose  The bill is the most recent proposal from New York lawmakers trying to cast light on the president s personal finances and business dealings  but it could also open the Democratic majorities in the Legislature to charges of politicizing state law to embarrass the president ahead of his expected re election campaign State Senator Brad Hoylman  a Manhattan Democrat who is sponsoring the legislation  defended the bill  saying it is designed to be  a safety valve for any attempt by the White House to block the Congress from doing this at the federal level   We re creating a parallel track   Senator Hoylman added The bill would amend current state laws that generally prohibit such private tax information from being released  and would cover a broad range of filings  including personal income taxes  corporation taxes and real estate transfer taxes The bill s expected introduction on Monday comes even as the I R S  and Treasury Department in Washington are deciding whether to comply with a request last week from the House Ways and Means Committee chairman  Representative Richard E  Neal of Massachusetts  for access under a provision of the federal tax code to six years of his federal returns by April 10 Mr  Trump s personal lawyer called the effort by Mr  Neal a  gross abuse of power    an opinion that was seconded by the White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  who said on Sunday that Democrats would  never  see the president s tax returns  It remains unclear if the federal tax collecting agencies will share that view But with New York having a Democratic controlled Legislature  and a Democratic governor  Andrew M  Cuomo  some officials see a route to bypassing such arguments  And Mr  Hoylman said he anticipates broad support for the congressional request bill among lawmakers in New York  one of the nation s bluest states Mr  Cuomo  a third term Democrat who has repeatedly criticized Mr  Trump  did not respond to requests for comment about the bills seeking the release of state tax returns  The White House declined to comment on the proposal Republican leaders were furious at the idea that New York officials would potentially allow Democrat led committees to see the returns  This is a bill of attainder  aimed at one person   said Ed Cox  the chairman of the New York State Republican Party  adding that the maneuver was  outrageous politics   aimed at increasing Mr  Cuomo s political prospects Still  it was not clear whether the leaders of the State Senate or the State Assembly would immediately embrace such a bill  similar measures stalled in the Assembly during the last legislative session Mr  Hoylman said he believes the new bill s narrow focus may ease concerns about the mass release of personal information about political figures that had caused other legislative attempts in Albany to force the release of Mr  Trump s taxes to be sidelined  Previous efforts had also faced opposition from Republicans in the State Senate  who lost their majority in that chamber after a disastrous 2018 election cycle Under the new proposal  the release of tax information would require a formal request by a congressional committee  and would come only after other efforts to obtain federal tax information through the Treasury Department had failed ImageDemonstrators marched past Trump Tower in Manhattan during an April 2017 protest to demand that President Trump release his tax returns CreditLucas Jackson ReutersMr  Hoylman s bill is one of at least three proposed in recent years that seek the release of Mr  Trump s state tax returns  including legislation that he co sponsored with Assemblyman David Buchwald  a Westchester County Democrat That earlier bill  known as the New York Truth Act  would require the state Department of Taxation and Finance to release five years of income tax returns from eight officials  if they earn income in New York   the president  vice president  New York s two United States senators  and four statewide elected officials  including the governor and the state attorney general Most of those officials currently release or give access to their tax returns  but Mr  Buchwald said the Truth Act bill is the  most tangible  best opportunity to produce the president s tax return   Obviously  when someone fills one of these higher offices  they have to meet a higher standard   Mr  Buchwald said  adding that such state returns would reveal  worldwide income  as well as potential conflicts of interest  I think it s a good general principle for us to be promoting   Mr  Buchwald said  The bill  first introduced in 2017  now has enough co sponsors to pass the Assembly and Senate A third bill  also sponsored by Mr  Hoylman  would require candidates for president and vice president to reveal their past tax returns in order to appear on primary and general election ballots  Similar efforts are also being considered in more than a dozen other states  including California and New Jersey Daniel Hemel  an assistant professor at the University of Chicago who teaches tax law  said that the New York state Legislature could authorize the release of Mr  Trump s state returns  but that knotty legal issues are at play as well  particularly because of federal laws protecting tax information  For instance  if New York were to release federal return information that is contained within the state tax return  Mr  Hemel said  the Internal Revenue Service  could conceivably cease cooperation with the state  Still  Mr  Hemel added  the I R S  would face  legal and practical obstacles if it tried to retaliate against New York   and that  there is a lot of information on Trump s state tax return that is not federal return information   including New York s adjusted gross income and his state taxes Under the bill to be introduced on Monday  the chairperson of three committees   the Senate Finance Committee  the House Ways and Means Committee  and the Joint Committee on Taxation   could request tax returns from the New York tax department Each would have to submit written requests for the information  and such requests would also have to follow a request to the United States Department of Treasury Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  said that Mr  Hoylman s bill was a way to access the same information that his colleagues in Congress have been seeking  The state return  presumably  has to match the federal return   he said  adding   It just makes the work of the federal committee  that has a legitimate reason to look into this  a little easier to see the complete picture  He added that the bill would be  a pretty quick  workaround to White House opposition to releasing the president s tax returns   It would help vindicate the rule of law   Mr  Nadler said Mr  Cuomo  who gives the media access to his annual tax returns every April  though he does not allow reporters to make copies   has expressed support for the increased release of such information by candidates for statewide and legislative office  But a proposal to do just that was not included in the final budget negotiations Mr  Hoylman said that the bill to be introduced on Monday was narrowly crafted to prevent  fishing expeditions  by federal lawmakers  This would be a very rare  but very important  use of the state s power   he said

What s in a mushroom burger  Or a veggie sausage Perhaps worried that you may be confused  some epicures at the European Parliament have proposed a new rule  If a product does not contain meat  it cannot be called a burger or a sausage or a steak The proposed amendment was passed by the body s agricultural committee this week as part of a voluminous revision of the European Union s Common Agricultural Policy Eric Andrieu  a French Socialist member of the European Parliament  introduced the proposal  but suspicions remained that the meat lobby was behind the idea  Environmentalists said the suggested labeling rules were an effort to undermine the growing demand for plant based foods  We didn t support the proposal   said Molly Scott Cato  a British member of the European Parliament from the Green Party   We don t see any problem with calling a veggie burger a veggie burger  Mr  Andrieu  who could not be reached to comment  told The Guardian that the meat lobby had nothing to do with the amendment and that he was attempting to add some common sense to food labeling  We felt that steak should be kept for real steak with meat   he said  warning that  a lot of creativity  would be needed to come up with new names for vegetarian products   People need to know what they are eating  Some news accounts of the proposed rule reported on a search for new names  including  vegetable protein tubes  and  veggie disc  Dairy producers were the first to allege that competitors selling plant based foods were using misleading labeling such as  tofu butter  or  veggie cheese  and they won a 2017 ruling from the European Court of Justice that reserved the names of dairy products for foods with an animal source  As part of its vote last week  the agricultural committee added to the dairy restrictions with a rule that would ban the use of phrases like  yogurt style  or  butter substitute  for plant based products The proposal about meat labeling was opposed by a coalition of environmental and animal rights groups  There is no evidence of consumer confusion   Greenpeace  Humane Society International and other groups wrote in a letter dated April 1   On the contrary  consumers purchase these items because they do not contain meat or dairy  The proposal must still pass the full European Parliament  which will not take it up until after elections in May  It would then have to be negotiated and agreed on by the Council of Ministers before becoming law  according to Neil Corlett  a European Parliament spokesman Whether the proposal is a maneuver by the meat lobby or simply an attempt by the French to assert food traditions  the proposal reflected a certain defensiveness by the meat industry as more and more people reduce their meat consumption  Ms  Scott Cato said  There was no consumer demand for this   she said  adding that she would continue to oppose the amendment as  an attempt by the meat industry to make life harder for people  who prefer vegetarian diets In the United States  there has been a push by the dairy industry to require the Food and Drug Administration to enforce labeling rules for milk as more Americans switch to  alternative milks   which come from any number of plants   Pea milk  anyone   Nobody thinks their almond milk comes from a cow   said Michele Simon  the executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association in San Francisco As for efforts in some states to come up with labeling for plant based meat substitutes  there was no confusion there either  she said   People are happily buying these products not thinking they are beef   she said Ms  Scott Cato pointed to the breakout success of vegan sausage rolls this year introduced by Greggs  a British bakery chain  in January  as evidence that more people are eating vegetarian dishes   and that they know what is in them  It s not like anybody bought a vegan sausage roll and asked where is the pig   she said  

Gen  Khalifa Hifter  the Libyan militia leader now threatening to capture the capital  thought he had a deal His troops had reached an agreement with local militia leaders on Thursday to roll into the coastal city of Zawiya without firing a shot  putting his forces just west of the capital  Tripoli But another Zawiya faction evidently had other ideas  and early Friday morning they surrounded and captured more than 100 of General Hifter s fighters along with their weapons   again  without firing a shot  according to local residents and video footage A day after his surprise advance to the outskirts of Tripoli  General Hifter s drive on Friday slowed nearly to a halt  suggesting that a prolonged and murky battle may lie ahead A coalition of rival militias dug in to stop him  and the reversal at Zawiya offered a stark reminder of the mercurial nature of alliances among the armed groups that have overrun Libya since the Arab Spring in 2011   including both those lined up behind General Hifter and those standing against him Secretary General Antnio Guterres of the United Nations had arrived in Libya this week expecting to help convene peace talks among those rival militias  Instead  he met on Friday with General Hifter and announced afterward that he was leaving with  a deep concern and a heavy heart   I still hope it will be possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli   Mr  Guterres said in an unusually plaintive statement   Whatever happens  the U N  will remain committed  and I will remain committed  to support the Libyan people  General Hifter   a 75 year old former officer in the army of Col  Muammar el Qaddafi who broke with him to become a C I A  client   announced in 2014 that he intended to restore order as a new strongman It took him three years to defeat a coalition of Islamist militias for control of just the eastern city of Benghazi  But he received heavy support from Egypt and the United Arab Emirates  and later from Russia and France  After taking Benghazi he relied on a combination of superior resources and local deal making to establish loose control over much of the eastern part of Libya General Hifter initially portrayed himself as battling against political Islam in all its forms  But he has also struck alliances with certain Saudi style ultraconservative Islamist militias as well  muddying any sense of a battle between secular and religious forces Now  beginning on Thursday  his forces have launched a similar campaign aimed at capturing Tripoli  The city has been under the ostensible rule of a powerless United Nations sponsored unity government and under the practical control of various autonomous militias  Many are also engaged in extortion  migrant smuggling and other criminal activities  and some have had ties to powerful regional militias in the cities of Zintan and Misrata With those forces now forming a loose alliance to stop General Hifter  Tripoli residents raced to stock up on food and fuel in anticipation of a prolonged struggle  Lines outside fuel stations stretched for 100 yards  and drivers often waited more than an hour and a half to fill up their tanks There were reports of scattered fighting in several places outside the city on Friday  But unusually heavy rain on Friday afternoon flooded streets and slowed troop movements In the most significant shift in the battle lines  General Hifter s forces announced that they had occupied Tripoli s defunct international airport  destroyed by fighting in 2014  One resident confirmed in a telephone interview that General Hifter s troops had taken the area  which is less than 30 miles from the central square of the city But some local militia members appeared to be massing for an attempt to recapture the area  By the end of the night the interior minister of the United Nations backed government said on television that it had been retaken already  Flat and open terrain makes it difficult to defend  and the airport changed hands often in battles over the past eight years  This is going to be slow   said Emad Badi  a London based Libya scholar who is tracking the fighting   We are going to see more shifting alliances  and any location you control  you might not control it for more than day   he said  recalling the capture of General Hifter s forces at Zawiya  

FORT LAUDERDALE  Fla    The families of some of the victims of the mass shooting last year in Parkland  Fla   filed 22 lawsuits on Wednesday accusing the local school district and sheriff s office of negligence and seeking potentially millions of dollars in damages as compensation The lawsuits claim that the Broward County Public Schools failed to keep students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School safe in spite of warning signs that the shooting suspect  Nikolas Cruz  a former student  had threatened violence against the school community  Mr  Cruz  now 20 and corresponding with pen pals while in jail  faces the possibility of the death penalty in the attack  in which 17 people were killed and 17 others wounded on Feb  14  2018  This is a life sentence for me   Mitchell Dworet  who lost his 17 year old son  Nicholas  said at an emotional news conference in Fort Lauderdale  Fla   that was called to announce the lawsuits  Mr  Dworet s younger son  Alexander  was injured in the shooting Mr  Dworet s lawyer  Michael Goldfarb  said at least part of any damages eventually received by the Dworet family would go toward a charitable foundation it created in Nicholas s name Many frustrated Parkland residents have accused local government of failures before and during the deadly shooting  and those filing the new lawsuits said they hoped the litigation would help hold officials to account  Over the past 14 months  as Parkland students  began a national youth movement against gun violence  some of the victims  families focused on the school district and the sheriff s office  They led a successful push to oust the sheriff  Scott Israel  and an unsuccessful attempt to have the schools superintendent  Robert W  Runcie  fired  To our family  and our son  this lawsuit will bring some accountability   said Lisa Olson  whose son  William  was shot in both arms  Speaking through tears  she called every day since the shooting  a struggle   My son didn t go to school today   she said   He couldn t  And we have many days like that now  Lawsuits have become a sad routine following the country s deadly mass shootings  with victims  families pursuing a variety of strategies to try to receive compensation  force the adoption of safety measures and hold private and public entities responsible  That includes lawsuits against gun manufacturers  which have been seen as uphill court battles Recently  families from the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown  Conn   employed a legal approach previously used against the cigarette industry to pierce the shield that has protected the gun industry in the past  and going after how gun manufacturers marketed an assault rifle The F B I  identified 27 active shooter incidents in the United States last year  according to a report the bureau published on Wednesday  The episodes  which spanned 16 states  killed 85 people  None was deadlier than the Parkland shooting The lawsuits filed on Wednesday on behalf of 12 of those killed in the shooting and 10 others who were injured claim that the Broward County Sheriff s Office failed to try to stop the gunman during the rampage  The sheriff s office declined to comment  citing the pending litigation Scot Peterson  a sheriff s deputy at the time and the only armed police officer at the school on the day of the shooting  remained outside the building as the attack took place  Mr  Peterson  who retired in the days after the massacre and has maintained that he was unsure of the gunman s location  is named as a respondent in the lawsuits along with the sheriff s office  the school district and an unarmed campus security monitor  Andrew Medina Mr  Medina saw Mr  Cruz get out of an Uber ride with a large bag and walk into the school  but did not confront him or call for a lockdown  an investigation showed  He lost his job last summer Henderson Behavioral Health  a local clinic that treated Mr  Cruz  is also named in the lawsuits Mr  Cruz confessed to the police  and his public defenders said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence  But prosecutors rejected that deal  so Mr  Cruz pleaded not guilty and now awaits trial on charges of murder and attempted murder  No trial date has been set Records released this week by the Broward County state attorney s office showed that while in jail  Mr  Cruz has been corresponding with pen pals   a woman in Britain and her brother   telling her that he envisions a life after prison in which he would get married  have children and name the boys Kalashnikov  Makarov and Remington  after the gun manufacturers  At the same time  Mr  Cruz acknowledged that he could die by lethal injection  Its kind of what I want but I m unsure of myself so I m just letting people save me from myself  saving me from something that I can never return from   he wrote on Oct  13 in a handwritten letter to the woman  identified as Miley  who created a Facebook group for supporters of Mr  Cruz  Maybe I should get the death penalty   he wrote in another letter   I just want love  The letters  dating from October and November  include stick figures holding hands and smiley faces with hearts  Mr  Cruz has also written to Miley s brother  identified as Liam One issue in the Florida lawsuits is how local governments  their former employees and the clinic may be liable for compensating the shooting victims  A sovereign immunity law protects any single victim from collecting more than  200 000 in damages from the government without approval from the State Legislature  Those claims bills can take years to pass In an effort to avoid such a lengthy process for the Parkland families  State Senator Lauren Book  a Democrat  filed legislation this year establishing a rare compensation fund that would set aside  160 million in public funds for the 34 victims of the Stoneman Douglas shooting  But the bill  which has yet to get a hearing  appears unlikely to be approved before the annual session is scheduled to end on May 3  This is a huge  huge  huge undertaking in the amount of time that we had to work on this   Ms  Book said   It is not an easy lift  Lawyers for the families said on Wednesday that they suspected that the school district had hired a lobbying firm  GrayRobinson  to lobby against the compensation fund  But both Ms  Book and the district said the accusation was not true  the district said it retained the firm for exactly the opposite purpose  to lobby for the fund s creation  At no time has the District or GrayRobinson lobbied against the compensation fund   Kathy Koch  a spokeswoman for the district  said in a statement The state continues to investigate the shooting  At the same time that the families announced their lawsuits on Wednesday  a commission that has already identified a range of failures on the part of local officials met to review additional issues  including whether public schools in general underreport criminal and safety incidents  and the manner in which victims  families in Parkland were told by the authorities that their loved ones had died  

BUCHAREST   Mergers in Europe s fragmented banking sector are necessary to make the sector more resilient as the euro zone seeks to protect itself from future crises  France s finance minister told Reuters in an interview Bruno Le Maire  who joined President Emmanuel Macron s centrist government in 2017 despite coming from the ranks of France s conservative Republicans party  said banking sector consolidation was needed alongside a single regulatory supervisor and more integrated capital markets  I consider that today European banks are still too fragmented and we need banking consolidation   Le Maire said in Bucharest  where he was attending a meeting of EU finance ministers  Speaking with Reuters over dinner at an upmarket restaurant in the Romanian capital  Le Maire declined comment on specific deals  The biggest operation underway currently is a possible tie up between German lenders Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank Despite persistent speculation  sometimes involving French banks  there have been few cross border bank mergers in recent years in Europe  even though the European Central Bank has repeatedly urged consolidation  which it believes would ensure that credit flows to where it is needed most Le Maire  who has attended some of France s most prestigious schools and held numerous senior posts in government  said the euro zone needed to finalise in coming months plans for a backstop for banks saddled with bad loans  and better integrate capital markets notably by agreeing to harmonise insolvency laws   a sensitive issue for some countries  If euro zone member states are not capable of taking certain steps forward in the coming months  we risk weakening the euro and seeing new fractures emerge in the euro zone   Le Maire said Policymakers like IMF chief Christine Lagarde have warned that the euro zone s financial sector remains dangerously exposed to shocks if it does not quickly complete reforms designed to keep risks contained Le Maire also wants the euro zone to quickly thrash out plans for a shared budget aimed at encouraging convergence among the euro zone s economies  In particular  details on its governance and how it sits in relation to the broader EU budget remain to be hammered out  ECONOMIC DIVERGENCE The euro zone will not survive growing economic divergences between member states  We have to equip ourselves with the instruments to reduce the divergences   he said  France  along with Germany  has championed the idea of a euro zone budget  but has had to scale down its ambitions in the face of resistance from the Dutch  The Netherlands has rejected the idea that the budget has a capacity to help member states facing economic shocks  fearing this would mean transfers from richer to poorer countries With EU parliament elections due in May  the staunchly pro Europe minister weighed into the debate about the future of the Union this week with a book warning that Europe must guarantee it does not fall behind China and the United States on technological progress  or risks being dominated by them Le Maire  who alongside Germany s economy minister in February released an industrial policy manifesto calling for increased investment in technology research  revised antitrust and state aid rules and stronger defences against foreign takeovers  said EU state aid rules needed to be more flexible He said approval of aid for projects had to come much more quickly  otherwise companies would look beyond Europe to meet their needs   Speed is of the essence     There are companies that need technology and they are going to get it where they find it  The minister has also called for an overhaul of antitrust rules after the European Commission blocked the planned merger of the rail businesses of Siemens and Alstom  seeing such tie ups as necessary to build European champions  What do we want tomorrow for our telecommunications  our trains  our banks or our cars  I want that in all these fields we keep our European  industrial  capacities  which has to happen through consolidation    Reporting by Leigh Thomas  Editing by David Holmes  

LONDON   Two weeks before Britain was originally scheduled to leave the European Union  Jeremy Corbyn  the leader of the opposition Labour Party  was asked on television whether Britain should stay or go  He refused to answer The question came again  and again  and again  and then one last time  He still refused to answer  I want us to have a serious relationship with the E U    he said  gliding past the in or out question that has consumed Britons for the better part of three years But now  with the Conservative government and Labour in talks to devise a deal they can both support  and with yet another deadline looming  Mr  Corbyn s tightrope walk may be near an end Until now  his studied ambiguity has largely held his party together while the Conservatives have crumbled  But having accepted Prime Minister Theresa May s offer to negotiate  he will likely face uncomfortable choices if Mrs  May softens her stance and tries to tempt him with a credible compromise  She s dipping Jeremy Corbyn s hands in the blood  if you like   said Alan Wager  a research associate at The U K  in a Changing Europe  a research organization   That s what Theresa May is aiming to do here  The talks broke off on Friday  with Labour leaders demanding that Mrs  May show greater flexibility  They resumed Monday evening  and Downing Street said the parties would meet again Tuesday But Mr  Corbyn had cautioned that to succeed the  talks have to mean a movement  and so far there s been no change in those red lines  The dilemma for Mr  Corbyn is evident To satisfy Labour members  any agreement he reaches with the prime minister on the terms of Britain s split from the European Union  or Brexit  will have to be accompanied by a public vote on the deal and an ironclad guarantee that it will not be altered by any successor to Mrs  May  Anything less would invite a tidal wave of anger from pro European members of his party ImageOpponents to Britain departing from the European Union demonstrating outside Parliament in London on Monday CreditDaniel Leal Olivas Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesYet  holding out for a second referendum would alienate a significant minority of Labour voters who support leaving the bloc   as well as Labour lawmakers who fear being seen as the party that thwarted Brexit  The much more challenging phase he s into now is making a positive decision in one direction or another and holding that coalition together as it moves from being against something to being in favor of something   said Tom Kibasi  the director of the Institute for Public Policy Research  a liberal research organization Whatever the outcome of cross party talks  Mr  Corbyn s apparent hope that Brexit would eventually fade away in favor of domestic issues looks increasingly misguided  Years of negotiation will follow even if a deal is reached  and there are already signs that voters who backed Labour in 2017 are defecting to smaller and more overtly anti Brexit parties Mrs  May made it more difficult to reach an agreement with Labour when she promised hard liners in her party that she will resign once a deal is reached  That would leave any plan in the hands of her successor and make Mr  Corbyn the only party leader defending a largely unloved compromise in a future general election That would be a difficult position for Mr  Corbyn  a left wing outsider who is known better as a campaigner on social and economic issues than as a political tactician  His official preference has been to negotiate a soft Brexit deal that keeps Britain tied to European economic structures  Corbynism depends on a moral claim to be above normal politics   Glen O Hara  a historian at Oxford Brookes University  said   As soon you get your hands dirty with normal compromise  Corbynism fails  The minimum requirement for a compromise would be Mrs  May agreeing to Labour s demand that Britain remain in a European customs union  Britain would not charge tariffs on European products under such a plan  preserving reasonably frictionless trade in goods with the bloc  Britain s biggest trading partner But any such plan would be enshrined in a nonbinding part of Mrs  May s Brexit deal  the so called political declaration  meaning a successor to Mrs  May could try to undo it in favor of a more complete split from Europe At the same time  Mrs  May faces a convulsion in her own party if she accedes to Labour s demands  with hard line pro Brexit Conservative lawmakers threatening new attempts to oust her ImageThe Labour Party leader  Jeremy Corbyn  speaking in the House of Commons last week CreditUK Parliamentary Recording Unit EPA  via ShutterstockParliament on Monday night passed a bill requiring Mrs  May to seek an extension of the next Brexit deadline  on Friday  to avoid a no deal exit  She had already asked European leaders for a delay until June 30  but lawmakers could try to force her to seek a longer postponement  Mrs  May planned to talk with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Tuesday and then to meet with President Emmanuel Macron of France to try to nail down their support for an extension For Mr  Corbyn  the outlook is not exactly rosy  His favorability ratings are historically low  and he has been buffeted by new accusations that his party allies have dithered when people complain about anti Semitic comments by Labour members Only two months ago several Labour members of Parliament  angered by Mr  Corbyn s equivocation over Brexit and his response to concerns about anti Semitism  broke off to start their own group That seemed to get Mr  Corbyn s attention  and for the first time he backed a second public vote on Brexit  in some circumstances  Some analysts said this was out of character for Mr  Corbyn  a leader who made his reputation as an inflexibly left wing backbench member of Parliament  but that it has paid dividends  He s been surprisingly flexible   Mr  O Hara  of Oxford Brookes University  said   His team has managed to stay so indistinct  and talk to both sides of the debate for so long  just to let the government fall apart  Why would you let your enemy off the hook instead of letting them blow themselves up  Since the Brexit referendum in 2016  Mr  Corbyn  a lifelong skeptic of the European Union  has attracted deep suspicion from those who want to remain in the bloc  who make up the majority of Labour s membership  But senior Labour officials have impressed upon Mr  Corbyn the political advantages of opposing Brexit and supporting a second public vote The party s pro European faction is becoming increasingly confident that he will commit   if he does finally support any compromise   to their position  I think what we re seeing now is the walls are closing in on Corbyn   said Lara Spirit  a founder of a campaign by young people for a second referendum   There is just nothing in it for Corbyn to facilitate a Tory Brexit  Mr  Kibasi  of the Institute for Public Policy Research  said Mr  Corbyn s Euroskepticism had proved to be a political boon  leaving him disentangled from the emotional attachments that might have led another party leader to step into the fray rather than let the Conservative party unravel  He s not clouded by affections for the E U  or its institutions  and in a sense that gives him the ability to think clearly about the best ways to destabilize the government   he said  

ImageCreditIllustration by Alvaro Dominguez  Photographs by Getty ImagesSYDNEY   One Saturday in March  in the suburbs north of Sydney  around three dozen people gathered on a lawn outside a smallish two bedroom apartment They were taking part in an idiosyncrasy of the Australian economic system  Here  selling a home tends to be an almost festive gathering  in which potential buyers show up for an auction and neighbors stop by to watch the spectacle   and quietly calibrate how much their own homes might be worth On this muggy day  almost all of the assembled crowd turned out to be gawkers  only four people actually raised their bidding paddles at any point  After bidding opened at 750 000 Australian dollars  about  532 000 in the U S    the action started slowly  Twice  it seemed to be petering out as the auctioneer  Andrew Robinson  nearly banged his final gavel  only to be extended with one more bid  Finally a young couple whose agent lobbed in a 930 000 Australian dollar   661 000  offer won the day  It reflected a wheezing Australian housing market  Prices have fallen since the country s banks tightened lending standards in mid 2018 and the Chinese government made it harder for its citizens to buy property abroad  Not too long ago  the number of interested parties might have been double  Twelve to 18 months ago  it would have sold for 1 1 million   said Mr  Robinson  with Belle Property  as he packed up his gavel and papers and prepared to head to his next auction on a day he would conduct eight of them   There was more of a frenzied atmosphere  more people bidding who just didn t want to lose out  I had flown 16 000 miles not to study economic malaise  but its opposite  the remarkable resilience of the Australian economy  which has gone nearly 28 years without a recession  The government  with elections to take place next month  recently announced an expected surplus in the next budget year  Surely this grand economic success story would hold lessons for the United States and the rest of the world  right Yet instead of giddy enthusiasm  what I found in Sydney was a pervasive sense of caution and wariness   and not just involving real estate  though housing does loom large in discussions about the economy  In conversations with Australian businesspeople and college students  economists and government officials  I detected no sense of triumphalism An entire generation of young adults has grown up without experiencing a protracted downturn  But in Australia  as I came to learn  nobody really acts as if they re the stars of an unprecedented three decade success story  They re aware that the good times could end  The mood is more practicality than pessimism  America is on the verge of its own economic milestone  The current expansion is on track to reach its 10th birthday this summer  which would also put it on record as the nation s longest streak without a recession During the decade I ve spent chronicling that growth as an economics writer  a persistent whisper has been  How long can it go  The run has been uneven  underwhelming and repeatedly on the verge of unraveling  including scary moments in 2010  2015 and this past December  Seemingly every commentator without a good clich blocker has referred to it as  long in the tooth  Even the language of economics suggests that an end to the good times is inevitable  If you re going to call it the  business cycle   things can t just keep getting better forever  Some of history s great economic thinkers have theorized that downturns are as essential to the workings of the economy as the seasons are to agriculture Is Australia a unique case  a beneficiary of some good economic luck that cannot be replicated in the rest of the world  Or is the nation onto something  and are there lessons in economic policy that are applicable everywhere When I landed there in mid March  in the waning days of the Australian summer  that s what I hoped to figure out Good luck and good policyAsk Australian economists about this golden run  and almost all will say it has been driven partly by good luck and partly by good policy The luck part can t be minimized  Beneath the ground of large stretches of Australia are the iron ore and coal that have been the raw materials behind China s long economic boom  Above ground lies the wheat and cattle that have helped feed China s rapidly growing middle class population ImageA commuter on a ferry in Sydney last month CreditRyan Pierse Getty ImagesChina s growth  in other words  has created a tailwind that has boosted Australia s economy for much of this period  And if the Chinese economy ever truly tanks  even the most skilled policymakers in Australia will have a hard time preventing a recession But China s gravitational pull can explain only so much  For one thing  other countries nearby have had recessions  some severe  in recent decades  And there are a long list of policy choices that enabled the long Australian boom even as otherwise similar economies sank One episode is particularly telling  In 1997  an East Asian financial crisis walloped the economies of countries like South Korea  Thailand and Indonesia  These nations were major buyers of Australian exports  The value of the Australian dollar started to fall on global currency markets  putting the expansion at risk only six years in On the other side of the Tasman Sea  New Zealand s central bank responded to the same problem by raising interest rates  After all  a falling New Zealand dollar indicated a lack of confidence in the currency and implied that inflation would soon rise At the Reserve Bank of Australia  by contrast  officials concluded that the falling value of the Australian dollar reflected shifting economic fundamentals that were ultimately healthy   part of how the Australian economy could adapt to faltering demand from East Asia Rather than raise interest rates to try to prevent a falling currency  they viewed a falling currency as the key to navigating the peril   by making Australian exports more competitive in the United States and Europe  for example  The government was uncomfortable if the exchange rate went too low  because it looked like a sign of no confidence   said Malcolm Edey  who was the central bank s head of economic research at the time   We had a good monetary framework in place  we stuck to it  and we didn t panic when the exchange rate moved around along the way  Sure enough  New Zealand fell into recession in 1997 and 1998  while Australia endured only a period of subpar growth  Good policy  it turns out  has a way of creating good luck  And it wasn t the only time Boring banking and avoiding the global financial crisisIf you had looked around the world circa 2006  you would have seen a number of countries where housing prices had soared into potential bubble territory  including the United States  Britain and Australia But two years later  while the United States and Britain were in a severe recession and financial crisis  Australia experienced only a single quarter of contraction  Why the difference The answer seems to be how the financial industries of those countries were structured and regulated  To understand that better  I sought out a tutor  one who turned out to have an unlikely background  David Morgan  a former child actor and professional Australian Rules Football player who later became one of the country s leading bankers After a wave of deregulation in the 1980s  Australian banks took on ever more risky lending  especially for commercial real estate  and got into new business lines overseas in which they had no obvious competitive advantage  When that asset bubble popped and a recession arrived  the banks came near failure  and there was a wholesale firing of top bank executives It was a matter of  going through the furnace  and coming out tempered by experience   said Mr  Morgan  who was chief executive of Westpac  one of Australia s major banks  during the crisis   We were adamant that we would go into the next shock with the least risk and the most resilience   and would not engage in any more offshore frolics  The banks   with prodding from regulators   reformulated themselves to take a more conservative and domestically focused approach to lending  After that near death experience  there remained the  Big Four  banks that together control about 80 percent of deposits  they are not allowed to merge with each other The banks also did not engage in the kind of expansionist strategy that had gotten them in trouble in 1991  They did not open huge offices in Hong Kong  London or New York  nor get in the business of creating the complex mortgage securities that were the nexus of the financial crisis Good regulation was part of it   They were good quality regulators  the public sector was getting good people   Mr  Morgan said  Both major political parties have tended to be tough on banks  and there is a single powerful regulator rather than a patchwork of them as in the United States But just as important was the sense among bank leaders that they would need to be ready when the next downturn came It s not as if Australia s banks are perfect actors  A royal commission established to examine the industry found widespread misconduct  including abuses of customers  in a report issued this year  But they have focused on lending to Australians  especially for home mortgages  and held those loans on their own books  No doubt Australia has missed out on some opportunities by not hosting the big  complicated banks that operate worldwide and do more sophisticated forms of finance  Sydney does not have the concentration of high paying finance jobs that London and Hong Kong do But having a conservative  domestically focused  highly concentrated banking system meant that Australia wasn t stuck importing other countries  financial contagions when crises hit During the global financial crisis  Australia suffered from plummeting demand for its products  But a nicely designed fiscal stimulus   combined with a falling Australian dollar and an assist from aggressive stimulus by China   helped the country regain its footing rapidly and avoid the mass economic pain found in so much of the world The pessimism of 2019If there s anyone you would expect to be bullish  it might be the young adults entering the work force  who have never lived through a recession  But among them   as with other Australians who don t occupy the halls of government or financial power   you find angst and uncertainty rather than boom time optimism  I think there will be a recession within the next 10 years   said George Ye  25  who is studying for a master s degree in data science at the University of Sydney   I feel like sentiment is  we might have gotten to a peak  Things have gone so well for so long that the things we need to buy are getting more and more expensive   especially housing   I think the generation of people born 10 years prior to me are much more confident than I am   I m pessimistic   said Freya Zemek  24  an employee at the university   I think we re probably looking at a recession in 2020  Consumer confidence isn t very high  The signs aren t looking great  and I think it s the sort of tightrope situation where we could be next for a recession  It s only a matter of time  Nothing goes on forever  Housing especially seems to be in the opposite of a sweet spot  It s still too expensive  especially in booming Sydney and Melbourne  for young people  Yet the prices are well below those from a couple of years ago  leaving recent buyers sitting on paper losses But just maybe  the contrast between a pessimistic mood and a long record of economic success isn t as contradictory as it may seem Are recessions really necessary In November 1990  the Australian treasurer  and later prime minister  Paul Keating described a painful downturn then underway as  the recession we had to have  His point was that excesses in a lending and credit boom  combined with high inflation  meant that the Australian economy needed the wrenching experience of a downturn to rid itself of those excesses  It was also a horrible political gaffe  a comment that went over poorly in a country then burdened with an 11 percent unemployment rate But the question of whether he was right is profound   one that economists can still debate ImageAt a house auction in Sydney  This is the typical way a home is sold in Australia  It is marketed for a few weeks  then registered bidders gather to make an offer CreditNeil IrwinThe great economic thinker Joseph Schumpeter argued that recessions served an essential purging mechanism enabling a society to become richer over time  Through business failures  capital is redeployed to emerging high growth industries  In this thinking  recessions play a cleansing effect  clearing the way for the future Hyman Minsky  another 20th century economist  argued that long periods of financial stability could breed complacency  The longer a nation goes without a downturn  the more risky behavior will build up in the economy  making the eventual downturn worse Those theories sound plausible  Data to support the case is a little harder to find  In fact  there is some evidence that recessions actually cause lasting damage to a country s economic potential   that they hurt  rather than help   by thrusting people out of the work force unnecessarily and causing their skills to atrophy  Research shows that people who enter the work force during a recession take a hit to their earnings even decades later There have also been long periods when the Minskyite story has seemed not to apply  notably in the decades after World War II in the United States  I think Australia s experience shows that you don t need recessions to clean out the system  but it does show that what you need is strong  clear policy settings from governments   said James Pearson  the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry   There is a risk  and I think we re seeing it in Australia today  that a prolonged period of economic growth without recession can lead to complacency both among policymakers and the electorate  But that brings us back to the slowing housing market  and the general sense of pessimism that sneaks into conversations about the economy in Australia  especially among the young Maybe the real reason Australia has made it so long without a downturn is an absence of complacency  No one is brimming with overconfidence that all is well and always will be  What has happened in the last 27 years is a series of shocks  each of which  thanks to policy and luck  we were able to overcome   said Stephen Grenville  the former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and now a fellow at the Lowy Institute   That s the nature of the economy we re in now   an economy with shocks plus flexibility  It isn t the absence of bad stuff happening in the economy that has kept Australia growing for so long  It is the nation s economic flexibility and policymakers  rejection of complacency So maybe the pessimism isn t a paradox at all  And maybe we would be more worried about Australia s economic future if house prices had kept soaring toward unsustainable highs  or if young people had made economic decisions with a sense of reckless invincibility and engaged in borrowing and spending behaviors accordingly The Australian experience is evidence that the  business cycle  is a misleading way to think about economic growth  Recessions aren t like thunderstorms  an inevitable  random event that may be violent but provide much needed water to crops Maybe recessions are more like car crashes  They may never be completely eliminated  but making the right choices can make them rarer and less damaging when they do happen In trying to learn the lessons of Australia  that may be the biggest of them all  There will always be bad things that happen in an economy  The best way to keep them from causing the mass pain that accompanies a recession is to combine sound policy  a flexible and dynamic economy and   perhaps most important   just the right amount of fear  

BERLIN   Investor morale in the euro zone improved in April to hit its highest level since November  helped by signs of an upswing in China  a survey showed on Monday The Sentix research group said its investor sentiment index for the euro zone rose to  0 3 from  2 2 in March  Analysts had expected a reading of  2 1 A sub index of expectations improved for the straight third month  reaching  4 3  its highest level since May last year  However  the current situation weakened for the eighth month in a row  slumping to 3 8  its weakest level since February 2015 The economic situation in the euro zone remains fragile  said Sentix  but with expectations rising  the momentum of the decline is slowing   With the exception of the tiresome Brexit discussion  the fact that this is being achieved seems to lie less in the hands of the Europeans themselves than in the further development of the two economic heavyweights China and the USA   said Sentix Managing Director Manfred Huebner The impact of credit expansion measures taken by the Chinese government were already being seen  he said  adding   It is the conclusion of the negotiations in the trade dispute with the USA that should set further impulses   A separate index measuring investor morale in Germany fell to 2 1  its lowest level since August 2012  Expectations for Germany rose for the third straight month to  6 0 A sub index measuring current conditions fell for the sixth month to 10 5   a development that Huebner described as worrying  It would be positive if Germany did not rely on China and the USA alone but sought to make its own contribution to economic stabilisation  Sentix surveyed 936 investors from April 4 to 8   Reporting by Madeline Chambers  Editing by Michelle Martin  

How s this for a state of emergency  An entire region of the country takes up armed resistance against the federal government  brazenly murdering and raping its African American citizens in a decades long campaign of terror that subverts and then rewrites the law More dire  certainly  than an invasion of criminal migrants at the border  And it actually happened The shockingly violent  depressingly predictable backlash in the American South to the end of slavery  and to the attempt to make freed slaves equal members of society  is the central concern of  Reconstruction  America After the Civil War   a four hour PBS series written and narrated by Henry Louis Gates Jr   It shows in two hour installments  on Tuesday and on April 16  Among the many lacunae in Americans  knowledge of their own history  our hazy notions of Reconstruction and its overthrow   essential to an understanding of so much in our own times  from the civil rights movement to today s mirror like rise of white nationalism   may be the most damaging  Many people  if they have any sense of the era at all  came by it through  Gone With the Wind  or  even more grievously   The Birth of a Nation  So Gates s series is a great service  especially in its first two hours  which cover the years from the end of the Civil War  with the initial enthusiasm and promise of Reconstruction  to the contested election of Rutherford B  Hayes in 1876  which essentially ended the federal government s efforts to enforce Reconstruction in the South The project mostly hews to the standard PBS history format  with a large cast of scholars and writers   more than 40   talking over antique photographs and documents  with the occasional impressionistic recreation of events and snippets of gospel and ragtime  But it also incorporates contemporary images of violence and protest  and it is distinguished by Gates s onscreen presence  talking to the camera while strolling through the story s locales and interviewing inheritors of the struggle Without hitting us over the head  the series continually brings out connections and correspondences between then and now  One of the first great fruits of Reconstruction is the establishment  in the 14th Amendment  of birthright citizenship  now under attack   Convict leasing  institutionalizes the unwarranted jailing of African American men and women to provide labor for plantations that no longer have slaves  Techniques like poll taxes and literacy tests are quickly invented to suppress the black vote  Fake news  campaigns alleging the rape of white women are used to incite and justify the indiscriminate killing and lynching of black men  Minstrelsy and blackface powerfully reinforce notions of white supremacy  Overwhelming efforts in the South to rewrite history and take slavery out of the Civil War narrative lead to the proliferation of Confederate monuments  and thus  more than a century later  to pitched battles and murder in Charlottesville  Va   The series s second two hours   which cover subjects like the Jim Crow system  the Ku Klux Klan  W E B  DuBois  the creation of the N A A C P  and the ascendance of black popular culture   are engrossing but less urgent  To cover so much ground  they settle into a more anecdotal  great person approach   For a more detailed look at some of the stories in this period  seek out the invaluable documentaries of Stanley Nelson  like  The Black Press  and  Tell Them We Are Rising  Historically Black Colleges and Universities   both streaming online  It s conceivable that  Reconstruction  could be criticized for being one sided   for not finding someone to defend the romantic view of Confederate history  or to make the contemporary case that white Americans are economically and culturally victimized  It would be a baseless criticism from the point of view of scholarship or principle  One thought  though  The series s accounts of violence against African Americans tend to have an abstract feeling  and some direct insight into the racist mind set could help to communicate its full force  Reconstruction  chooses to tell its story soberly and quietly  From the beginning  it silently establishes a predominant visual motif  photographic portraits of African Americans  singly and in groups small and large  in fields  yards and forest clearings  on church lawns  school steps and front porches  Their subjects look directly into the camera  proudly and  to the modern eye  accusingly  The succession of images insists on their dignity and humanity at a time when these qualities were brutally denied  a point made explicitly late in the series in a segment on the importance of photography in the African American community Their descendants continue to make that same case  Half of the 40 plus historians Gates has assembled are black  Calmly dissecting white America s unceasing claim that they aren t intelligent or civilized enough for full citizenship  those scholars are the irrefutable answer  still in plain sight after 400 years  

WASHINGTON   As a religious gay man who believes his party has ceded discussion of religion and spirituality to Republicans  Pete Buttigieg  a Democratic candidate for president  is talking about God and sexuality in an unconventional way  He is using the language of faith to confront the Christian right on territory they have long claimed as their own Mr  Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   has provoked a backlash from conservatives in the last few days after questioning the moral authority of evangelicals like Vice President Mike Pence who remain silent about President Trump s personal conduct yet disapprove of same sex marriages and oppose gay rights  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  Though many conservatives were initially reluctant to engage Mr  Buttigieg because they feared it would only add to his growing stature as a 2020 contender  they jumped on his latest comments  Some suggested he was attacking the vice president to further raise his profile  Others challenged Mr  Buttigieg s understanding of Christianity and accused him of smearing the religious convictions of the very people he wants to win over A devoted Episcopalian who fluidly quotes Scripture and married his husband  Chasten  in a church service last year  Mr  Buttigieg is making the argument that marriage is a  moral issue   In a speech on Sunday to the Victory Fund  a group that supports gay  lesbian  bisexual and transgender politicians  he said his relationship had made him  more compassionate  more understanding  more self aware and more decent  He then directly addressed Mr  Pence  as one man of faith talking to another   And yes  Mr  Vice President  it has moved me closer to God  This is not the domain where social conservatives and gay rights advocates are used to doing battle  In the decade and a half since same sex marriage became a galvanizing issue for both sides  the national debate has largely focused on the tension between civil rights and individual freedoms Mr  Buttigieg has reframed it in religious terms  raising questions about God  morality  sexuality and intolerance that depart from the familiar left right fault lines  That quickly caught the attention of Republicans and conservative media commentators  who tried to cast his remarks as an unprovoked attack on faith abiding Christians Karen Pence  the vice president s wife  insisted Tuesday that her husband has no quarrel with Mr  Buttigieg   I don t think the vice president does have a problem with him   she said in an interview with Fox News radio   I think in our country we need to understand you shouldn t be attacked for what your religious beliefs are   she added  noting that the speech was probably  helping Pete to get some notoriety  Mr  Buttigieg  who has been mayor of South Bend since 2012  had a friendly working relationship with Mr  Pence while Mr  Pence was governor of Indiana  They toured factories together and occasionally exchanged text messages ImageMr  Buttigieg has reframed the fight over gay rights in religious terms  raising questions about faith  tolerance and morality that depart from the familiar left right fault lines CreditBizuayehu Tesfaye Las Vegas Review Journal  via Associated PressBut Mr  Buttigieg has cited Mr  Pence s support for legislation that made it easier for religious conservatives to refuse service to gay couples as a reason he decided to come out publicly in 2015 Mr  Pence s office responded to Mr  Buttigieg s comments this week by releasing an old video clip in which he praised the mayor as a  dedicated public servant and a patriot   Mr  Buttigieg s ramped up attacks on Mr  Pence have miffed the vice president  who has privately told allies that if Mr  Buttigieg had questions about his religious beliefs  he could have asked him at any time during their friendship The issue followed the vice president to the United Nations on Wednesday  where reporters shouted questions at him about whether being gay was a choice  Mr  Pence walked away without answering In an interview with CNBC that aired Thursday  Mr  Pence addressed Mr  Buttigieg s criticism by saying that the mayor  knows me   and suggested that repeated questioning of his beliefs were a way for Mr  Buttigieg to gain traction in a crowded field  My family and I have a view of marriage that s informed by our faith   Mr  Pence said   But that doesn t mean that we re   that we re critical of anyone else who has a different point of view  The reaction from other conservatives has been less measured  A Fox News host  Todd Starnes  accused the mayor of wanting  to shove evangelical Christians into the closet  Erick Erickson  an evangelical blogger  said that Mr  Buttigieg s comments about religious conservatives who support Mr  Trump suggest that he  would be O K  with using the government to persecute Christians   After Mr  Buttigieg spoke about his beliefs in an interview with USA Today  Mr  Erickson wrote a blog post headlined   Mayor Pete Buttigieg Apparently Thinks Jesus Would Be Okay With Beastiality    Mr  Buttigieg actually said nothing on that subject  though he did quote a favorite Bible verse   And when you pray  do not be like the hypocrites  for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others   Mr  Buttigieg has provoked a mixture of concern  derision and faint admiration from conservatives  Some built him up early as an undeniable but stealth force in the race  Rush Limbaugh warned his listeners that someone as articulate  personal and seemingly reasonable as Mr  Buttigieg would be a strong opponent  Ben Shapiro  the writer and podcast host  argued that he was the candidate who could most likely beat Mr  Trump   Really  He s not crazy  he s from the Rust Belt  he served in Afghanistan   Mr  Shapiro wrote on Twitter But this week provided a moment of clarity on the right  and the backlash was a reminder of how galvanizing religion and homosexuality can be when evangelicals and other conservatives of faith are convinced that their values are under attack  This sentiment  which was stoked by Mr  Trump and his allies in the Christian right in 2016  was a major factor in the president s huge margins with white evangelicals  Eighty one percent voted for him  compared with 16 percent for Hillary Clinton Indeed  if Mr  Buttigieg continues to gain in the polls  it could prompt the religious right to draw attention to numerous comments he has made about evangelicals and Mr  Trump    the hypocrisy is unbelievable   he said on NBC s  Meet the Press  this week   as conservatives did after Mrs  Clinton called Trump voters a  basket of deplorables  ImageMr  Buttigieg and Mike Pence in 2015  when Mr  Pence was governor of Indiana  Mr  Buttigieg has challenged the moral authority of evangelicals like Mr  Pence who disapprove of same sex marriages CreditRobert Franklin South Bend Tribune  via Associated PressRalph Reed  the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition  said Mr  Buttigieg s approach struck him as odd given how so much of his message has been focused on unity and restoring the Democratic Party s relationship with voters who are more religious and conservative   It seems to me the solution to that is not to attack the faith of anyone else  whether it is the president  the vice president or anyone else   Mr  Reed said   The solution should be to talk about their own faith  Mr  Buttigieg s words suggest that he will spend little effort trying to entice any of the president s most loyal religious supporters  But by pushing the discussion of homosexuality and marriage toward morality and the Bible  he is opening a door to voters of faith who are turned off by the dominance of the Republican Party s far right but are not yet convinced they could vote for a Democrat That approach would be similar to the one Barack Obama took in 2008 when he received 26 percent of the white evangelical vote  Mr  Trump s approval rating among white evangelicals has remained high   69 percent as of January  according to the Pew Research Center  But that has slipped 9 points since his inauguration Some evangelical Christians say that the fracture over Mr  Trump within their community runs so deep that the desire for an alternative   especially one like Mr  Buttigieg  who is so temperamentally different from the profane  brash and unpredictable president   will remain strong Pete Wehner  an evangelical who worked in the George W  Bush White House and has split with his community and his party over Mr  Trump  said the way Mr  Buttigieg speaks with ease and familiarity about Christianity is a trait many voters will find to be a welcome contrast with the president  It s not a foreign language to him like it is to Donald Trump  so you re not going to get  Two Corinthians  from him   Mr  Wehner said  referring to Mr  Trump s flub of the Bible book properly referred to as  Second Corinthians   He speaks about faith in a way that is largely nonthreatening and not filled with anger   Mr  Wehner added   That is a real opening  But the unflagging devotion that most white evangelicals have for the president suggests that many will be far more concerned with policy results like conservative Supreme Court justices than with electing someone who speaks their language  The relevant question for Mr  Buttigieg is whether there is a critical mass of those who are wavering  Mayor Pete could not have hoped to capture conservative Christian voters or moderate Christian voters at any point in modern American history   until now   said Jonathan Merritt  an evangelical author and speaker who disagrees with the decision by evangelical political leaders to stand by the president Mr  Merritt  who believes the taint of hypocrisy has turned many young evangelicals like him away from traditional leaders  said he remembers growing up in the South when antipathy toward President Bill Clinton and his personal conduct was running hot The line he remembers seeing and hearing over and over  he said  was  character matters

NEW YORK   The March floods that punished the U S  Midwest have trapped barrels of ethanol in the country s interior  causing shortages of the biofuel and helping to boost gasoline prices in the western United States The historic floods have dealt a series of blows to large swaths of an ethanol industry that was already struggling with high inventories and sluggish domestic demand growth  The ethanol shortages are one factor pushing gasoline prices in Southern California  including Los Angeles  to the highest in the country  and they could top  4 a gallon for the first time since 2014  according to tracking firm GasBuddy Benchmark price for ethanol used in most supply contracts initially jumped on news of the floods but has been hobbled by rising waters around the Chicago hub that have halted barges and sales  That stands in contrast to prices on the coasts  which rose dramatically   drawing in heavy imports from Brazil  the main U S  ethanol competitor  The floods inflicted billions of dollars in damage to crops and homes in the U S  Midwest  and knocked out roughly 13 percent of ethanol capacity  U S  ethanol is made from corn and required by the government to be blended into the country s fuel supply to reduce emissions  While some ethanol plants were flooded  the primary effect of the rising waters was to shut rail lines that serve as the main arteries for corn and ethanol deliveries  Ethanol prices on the coasts spiked due to shortages  but Midwest producers have been unable to take advantage because of washed out rail lines  market sources told Reuters   Unfortunately for anyone who was impacted by logistics issues it was a double whammy  You couldn t capture the rally   said one trader  At Chicago s Argo terminal  the nation s main ethanol pricing hub  the cash price for ethanol fell for an eighth straight session last week to  1 29 a gallon  the longest downward skid since April of last year  according to Oil Price Information Service  which does daily assessments  Initially  fears of widespread plant outages boosted that benchmark  but plants proved more resilient than expected  continuing to produce despite logistical challenges  U S  ethanol inventories were at 24 million barrels for the week ended March 29  just off a record hit a week earlier  according to U S  Energy Information Administration data  Chicago s price acts as the benchmark for millions of barrels bought and sold via longer term supply contracts each day  While that price faltered  ethanol prices at the coast have surged  helping plants owned by Pacific Ethanol Inc and White Energy in California and Texas to take advantage of higher prices  Ethanol delivered into Los Angeles typically trades at 20 cents a gallon higher than Chicago  but that premium rose to as high as 50 cents a gallon  traders said  The price in New York Harbor was at roughly double normal levels  traders said The tight ethanol supplies  along with refinery outages  boosted retail gasoline prices and led to some gas station shutdowns in the West as blenders there lacked the ethanol needed to blend with gasoline to make fuel that meets government regulations  Gas prices in Arizona averaged  2 89 per gallon on Monday  17 percent higher than last month  according to the American Automobile Association  Prices were even steeper in California at  3 80 a gallon  well above the national average of  2 74 a gallon Cash prices in the state s physical market suggest further increases  In Los Angeles  spot gasoline on Monday was offered 10 cents a gallon higher from where it traded on Friday  putting it at a premium of 69 cents a gallon above the NYMEX futures benchmark   Ultimately  Los Angeles could get close to seeing that average at  4 a gallon   Patrick DeHaan  head of petroleum analysis at tracking firm GasBuddy  said  adding that much of that increase will come because of refinery outages in the state  At least one county in California has already surpassed  4 a gallon  The highest recorded average price for the state was  4 67 a gallon  in October 2012  according to AAA  The high coastal prices attracted barrels from the biggest U S  competitor  Brazil  Overall ethanol imports to the United States totaled 558 279 barrels in March  the most seasonally since 2013  according to Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data  Most of the imports during the month came from Brazil  according to the tracking data   Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Stephanie Kelly  additional reporting by Erwin Seba  Editing by Lisa Shumaker and David Gregorio

From the Altai Mountains to the Pacific Coast  logging is ravaging Russia s vast forests  leaving behind swathes of scarred earth studded with dying stumps The culprit  to many Russians  is clear  China Since China began restricting commercial logging in its own natural forests two decades ago  it has increasingly turned to Russia  importing huge amounts of wood in 2017 to satisfy the voracious appetite of its construction companies and furniture manufacturers  In Siberia  people understand they need the forests to survive   said Eugene Simonov  an environmentalist who has studied the impact of commercial logging in Russia s Far East   And they know their forests are now being stolen  Russia has been a witting collaborator  too  selling Chinese companies logging rights at low cost and  critics say  turning a blind eye to logging beyond what is legally allowed Chinese demand is also stripping forests elsewhere   from Peru to Papua New Guinea  Mozambique to Myanmar ImageMore than 120 companies and factories have opened in Manzhouli to capitalize on the wood trade  which has skyrocketed since China restricted timber in its natural growth forests CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesIn the Solomon Islands  the current pace of logging by Chinese companies could exhaust the country s once pristine rain forests by 2036  according to Global Witness  an environmental group  In Indonesia  activists warn that illegal logging linked to a company with Chinese partners threatens one of the last strongholds for orangutans on the island of Borneo Environmentalists say China has simply shifted the harm of unbridled logging from home to abroad  even as it reaps the economic benefits  Some warn that the scale of logging today could deplete what unspoiled forests remain  contributing to global warming At the same time  China is protecting its own woodlands Two decades ago  concerns about denuded mountains  polluted rivers and devastating floods along the Yangtze River made worse by damaged watersheds prompted the Communist government to begin restricting commercial logging in the nation s forests The country s demand for wood did not diminish  however  Nor did the world s demand for plywood and furniture  the main wood products that China makes and exports It is one thing for Chinese demand to overwhelm small  poor nations desperate for cash  but it is another for it to drain the resources of a far larger country  one that regards itself as a superpower and a strategic partner to China The trade has instead underscored Russia s overreliance on natural resources and provoked a popular backlash that strains the otherwise warm relations between the countries  two leaders  Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping Protests have erupted in many cities  Members in Russia s upper house of parliament have assailed officials for ignoring the environmental damage in Siberia and the Far East  Residents and environmentalists complain that logging is spoiling Russian watersheds and destroying the habitats of the endangered Siberian tiger and Amur leopard  What we are doing now in Siberia and the Far East is destroying what is left of the original intact forest landscapes   said Nikolay M  Shmatkov  director of the forestry program for the World Wildlife Fund in Russia  The group has documented the destruction using satellite images over a period that coincides with the Chinese logging boom in the country  It s not sustainable   he said ImageMatryoshka Square in Manzhouli  named after the Russian nesting dolls  The square contains hundreds of

economic transformation over the last four decades has driven its demand  It is now the world s largest importer of wood   The United States is second   It is also the largest exporter   turning much of the wood it imports into products headed to Home Depots and Ikeas around the world The total value of China s timber imports   rough logs  timber or wood pulp   has increased more than 10 times since China began restricting logging at home in 1998  reaching  23 billion in 2017  the highest ever  according to IHS Markit s Global Trade Atlas The government extended a regional ban to the rest of the country at the end of 2016  It now allows commercial logging only in forests that have been replanted  a policy that environmentalists say other countries should emulate The problem is that many have not  and Chinese companies have pursued these opportunities More than 500 companies operate in Russia now  often with Russian partners  according to a report by Vita Spivak  a scholar on China for the Carnegie Moscow Center  Russia once delivered almost no wood to China  it now accounts for more than 20 percent of China s imports by value  If the Chinese come  nothing will be left   Marina Volobuyeva  a resident of the Zamensky region south of Lake Baikal  told a television channel after a Chinese company secured a 49 year lease to log in the area Russia sells such logging concessions at prices that vary by region and type of wood  but on average  they cost roughly  2 a hectare  or 80 cents an acre  per year  according to Mr  Shmatkov of the World Wildlife Fund  That is far below the cost in other countries In 2017  China imported nearly 200 million cubic meters of wood from Russia Artyom Lukin  a professor of international studies at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok  noted that government corruption  criminality and the lack of economic development in Siberia and the Far East have also made the crisis worse  In many rural areas of the Russian Far East and Siberia  there are few other ways to make money  or to make a living  than stripping natural resources of the vast surrounding forests   he said ImageThe border crossing at

of the wood from Russia crosses the border in Manzhouli  a former nomadic settlement that became a junction in the Trans Siberian Railway at the turn of the 20th century  The trade has transformed what was once a sleepy border town into one of China s main hubs for wood processing and production In the last two decades  more than 120 mills and factories have sprung up  They process raw or rough cut lumber into plywood  and manufacture veneer panels  laminated wood  doors  window frames and furniture The factories cover dozens of acres on the city s edge and have created more than 10 000 jobs in a city of 300 000 people  according to a municipal official New construction has made the city an architectural homage to Russian culture  Many buildings have features like onion domes  There is even a replica of St  Basil s Cathedral that is a children s science museum  and a hotel in the shape of what officials claim is the world s largest matryoshka  or nesting doll Zhu Xiuhua s career has traced the arc of the Russian trade Now 50  Ms  Zhu moved to Manzhouli when China began restricting logging  She began brokering imports from Russia  then in 2002 began to seek the rights to log Russian forests directly  Four years later  she founded the company she owns today  the Inner Mongolia Kaisheng Group  one of the city s biggest Ms  Zhu now oversees three factories in Manzhouli  as well as concessions to log 1 8 million acres of Russian forests near Bratsk  a city next to Lake Baikal  and to transport them to China   We are growing every year   she said When pressed  she declined to discuss her concessions in detail  but according to the company s website  she had invested  20 million in Russia by 2015  China s official Xinhua News Agency estimated the conglomerate s assets at  150 million in 2017 In Ms  Zhu s view  the trade is a classic case of supply meeting demand  She described it  perhaps overconfidently  as enduring The next step will be to seek more concessions westward   Krasnoyarsk   she said  using first the Mandarin version of the name before pronouncing it in Russian   You could not log all of it in 100 years   she said ImageZhu Xiuhua built

control where and what kinds of trees are logged  and the United States extended the Lacey Act in 2008 to ban the import of wood obtained illegally anywhere  but such regulations are difficult to enforce In some countries  like the United States and Canada  logging is strictly policed  but Chinese companies often exploit lax oversight elsewhere and log in protected forests  according to officials and environmentalists In Russia  logging commonly encroaches on areas outside the allotted boundaries and companies that export wood to China are known to falsify records Logging without contracts is also common  while arsonists are suspected of having set fires to forests  because scorched trees can be legally culled and sold In 2016  the United States Justice Department accused Lumber Liquidators of illegally importing hardwood flooring that was mostly made in China using timber illegally harvested in Russia s Far East Accusations of corruption have stirred public anger in Russia  A question on the extent of illegal logging prompted an acerbic response from Mr  Putin in his annual news conference in December  He called Russia s forestry industry  a very corrupt sector  ImageThe booming trade with Russia has transformed Manzhouli  which was once a sleepy border town  Much of the architecture has Russian features  while many shops and restaurants advertise in both languages  catering to tourists and traders CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York Times Barbaric Deforestation Protests against logging   and Chinese logging in particular   have erupted across Siberia and the Russian Far East  They have stoked ethnic tensions along a border that extends over 2 600 miles between Russians and Chinese who had long had mutual suspicions shaped by political and cultural differences One protest last May in Ulan Ude  a regional capital near Lake Baikal  resulted in scuffles with the police and eight arrests   Stop the barbaric deforestation   a sign declared The issue has become so politically volatile that in January the head of Russia s forestry service  Ivan Valentik  faced pointed questioning in the upper house of parliament  which does not usually challenge Mr  Putin s government directly He defended the concessions  but also sought to shift blame to the Chinese companies for not fulfilling their contracts   by  for example  replanting forests  He suggested that Russia could be forced to end direct sales of timber to China In China  the State Forestry and Grassland Administration did not respond to written questions  Officials have previously pledged that Chinese companies would adhere to local laws and be mindful of the environmental impact Ms  Zhu initially said she did not worry about the protests inside Russia since everything her company did was done according to Russian laws  After the latest round of public hearings in Moscow  however  she sounded less sanguine  Russia is changing now   she said by telephone  and then declined to answer any more questions  

WASHINGTON   In a White House where no secret is safe for long  one development has remained stubbornly confidential   the contents of a Middle East peace plan authored by President Donald Trump s advisers Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt With Trump having delighted Israelis and angered Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital in 2017 and moving the American Embassy to the holy city last May  a U S  brokered peace deal may seem farther away now than when talks collapsed five years ago Then on Wednesday  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re election  only days after proposing to annex Jewish West Bank settlements  traditionally viewed as illegal by much of the world  The Trump administration has yet to comment on the election eve remarks Aides expect Trump to release the plan once Netanyahu forms a government coalition  and officials say that despite criticism of the administration s moves to date  the plan will demand compromises from both sides That the peace plan has remained a secret is remarkable in a White House where drafts of executive orders  confidential conversations and internal deliberations all find their way to the front pages  Kushner and Greenblatt have limited the plan s distribution over the two years they have been crafting it  It has been kept secret  to ensure people approach it with an open mind  when it is released  a senior administration official said Only four people have regular access   Kushner  Greenblatt  U S  Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Kushner aide Avi Berkowitz  the official said Trump is briefed regularly on the contents but is not believed to have read the entire document of dozens of pages  He is briefed if something interesting is happening or there is an idea they want to run by him   the official said Kushner  a New York real estate developer and husband of Trump s daughter Ivanka  and Greenblatt  a former lawyer for Trump  joined the process knowing little about the tortured  decades long path in search of Arab Israeli peace  Their proposal addresses such core political issues as the status of Jerusalem  and separately aims at helping the Palestinians strengthen their economy Cloaked in secrecy is whether the plan will propose outright the creation of a Palestinian state  the Palestinians  core demand  On Wednesday  Trump s secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the plan would be presented before too long but  when asked  declined to say whether the administration favored a two state solution  long the basis of Middle East peacemaking Not even Trump  who is known to blurt out news whenever he feels like it  has dribbled out details of the peace plan because of the sensitivity He tells his Middle East envoys   If you guys can get this done you re going to be the greatest negotiators in history   said a senior White House official   YOUR CHILDREN S FUTURE When Kushner and Greenblatt began developing their plan in 2017  they asked the parties to look to the future and describe an outcome on each issue that they could accept rather than get locked into historical stances  two officials said  You can t let your grandfather s conflict hold back your children s future  was their message to both sides  one official said Palestinians reject Trump s pro Israel policies  The extremist and militaristic agenda  led by Benjamin Netanyahu  has been emboldened by the Trump administration s reckless policies and blind support   said PLO Executive Committee Member Hanan Ashrawi U S  Vice President Mike Pence  Pompeo and White House national security adviser John Bolton are all kept up to date on the peace plan  but have kept a hands off approach to it  deferring to Kushner  two other officials said The secrecy maintained by Kushner and Greenblatt  even as they refine and polish the plan  has posed something of a challenge for Gulf governments  who want to know the details before committing resources to a Palestinian fund Kushner and Greenblatt toured Gulf states in February to promote the economic part of the plan and get opinions about it  without providing a detailed view of the contents of the more crucial political section One of their stops was in Qatar Qatari Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Lolwah Al Khater  speaking to a small group of reporters in Washington recently  gave no indication that Kushner and Greenblatt provided much in the way of details on the political plan when they visited  I don t think it s still set in stone   she said Dennis Ross  a longtime Middle East envoy and now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  said the U S  team still has  a lot of work to do to make sure that Arab leaders aren t surprised by what s going to be presented  and they need to see it in writing  not verbally  But he said secrecy at this point is understandable  Holding something very close makes sense and it s not taken as a negative by the parties  because in the end  if the content isn t leaking out  it also makes sure that what would be controversial doesn t create an immediate firestorm  There s a logic to that   Ross said   Additional

JERUSALEM   There are more than a few reasons to dislike Benjamin Netanyahu  He can be smug and vindictive  He can be ruthless when going up against political enemies  He is likely to be indicted on corruption charges related to three separate cases  which  if they are accurate  indicate that he is greedy  vain and manipulative And yet last night  this dislikable prime minister appears to have won his fifth   yes  fifth    term in office  If he forms a government in the coming weeks  as he is expected to  Mr  Netanyahu will surpass Israel s founder David Ben Gurion as the country s longest serving prime minister  How is this possible To be fair  this was a close race  The main opposition party  Blue and White  is expected to get as many seats in the Knesset as Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party  The coalition that he forms will probably have little more than the minimum 61 seats behind it Given Mr  Netanyahu s unsavory qualities  many people were intent on defeating him  Just a few months ahead of the election  Blue and White  a new centrist alliance led by three decorated generals and a former security minister  came together with little purpose other than to present an alternative to Mr  Netanyahu  who has been in power since 2009  They campaigned fiercely   but civilly  At rallies  General Benny Gantz  the head of Blue and White  made it a habit to thank the prime minister for his service to the nation  this was a mirror image of Mr  Netanyahu s and Likud s name calling and personal attacks  But civility and centrism weren t enough to carry the day Mr  Netanyahu may be cynical but he doesn t rig elections  He wins fairly  often against great odds  including  this time  the coming indictments against him and an understandable fatigue with his decade old leadership  not to mention various other inter  and intraparty squabbles  But he seems to have succeeded again this time for the same reason he has dominated Israeli politics for most of the past 25 years  because when it comes to Israel s national security  he is a leader with strategy and vision  And that is what many voters want RelatedMore from Opinion on Israel s electionOpinion   Hagai

during his first term as prime minister  Mr  Netanyahu rejected the assumptions underlying the peace process with the Palestinians  At the time this was considered daringly right wing  Today  it is considered common sense in Israel  including by Mr  Netanyahu s political rivals  Likewise  Mr  Netanyahu was one of the first politicians to recognize Iran as the main threat to Israel s survival  and fought fiercely in international forums to get the world s attention to this problem  Today  this view is also widely appreciated across the Israeli political spectrum The list goes on  In 2005  he warned that withdrawing Israeli troops from Gaza would end in disaster   and it did  He successfully resisted eight years of the Obama administration s pressure to offer concessions to the Palestinians  He quickly forged an alliance with President Trump that has already proved to be of great benefit to Israel  In two years  Mr  Trump has moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  withdrawn from the nuclear agreement with Iran  recognized Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights  and on Monday  designated Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization Blue and White tried to make this election a referendum on Mr  Netanyahu  Its campaign focused largely on the prime minister s personal failings  the corruption accusations against him  and exhaustion with his leadership  But in Israel  security trumps all other issues   A poll ahead of the election found voters rated security as their No  1 concern  Blue and White thought that by placing former Israel Defense Forces chiefs of staff at the top of the party list  it could counter Mr  Netanyahu s image and experience as a defender of Israel  diplomatically and militarily  But the public still showed that it trusts the incumbent more Has Mr  Netanyahu ever been wrong when it comes to security  The truth is  many Israelis will find it hard to think of an example  And this goes not just for voters for the Likud party  or even the right wing parties that are expected to join Likud in the next government  but even for Blue and White  which largely echoed Mr  Netanyahu s positions on important foreign policy and national security questions Those Israelis who do want Mr  Netanyahu gone   and yes  there are many   want him gone because of his personality  his coarsening of Israeli political discourse  his pettiness and  maybe  his corruption  Those Israelis who want Mr  Netanyahu to stay   and the election makes clear that there are many   want him to stay despite those same characteristics  They can forgive the prime minister for often being a small man  because they appreciate him as a great leader The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters

NEW YORK   New York state officials told food growers and processors in mid December that they had the state s blessing to produce and sell tea and chocolates laced with CBD  the cannabis derivative reputed to ease anxiety and other ills without marijuana s high But since then  New York City health inspectors have seized thousands of dollars worth of CBD infused food and drinks at the Fat Cat Kitchen and other local cafes and restaurants  and warned owners to stop selling them or face penalties  The crackdown came just weeks after federal law explicitly made CBD legal across the country The New York City crackdown highlights the inconsistencies that have emerged in federal  state and local rules governing CBD  bewildering the small but growing number of businesses selling edibles in New York and other states   I m trying to be compliant with the law  but no one seems to be fully aware of what the law is and isn t   said C J  Holm  the owner of the Fat Cat Kitchen  which touts CBD coffee and cookies on a sidewalk chalkboard Consumer interest in CBD tinctures  topical creams and edibles has grown in recent years in step with the piecemeal legalization of marijuana  which is now permitted as either a medical or recreational drug in 33 states while still banned by the federal government In 2018  U S  consumers spent an estimated  300 million on CBD food and drinks  according to a report by Cowen Washington Research Group  The Coca Cola Company and other food giants have expressed interest in the sector The 2018 Farm Bill  enacted in December  was intended in part to clear up the legal status of CBD by legalizing cannabis extracts derived from strains of the plant  known as hemp  that contain very low concentrations of THC  the main psychoactive compound in marijuana  But the law also created new confusion for businesses wanting to sell CBD food or drink  For some  it is impossible to follow one set of regulations without being in breach of another  In New York  for example  officials at the state Department of Agriculture issued guidance in December saying it was legal to sell  CBD tea    chocolates with CBD drizzle  and other CBD edibles  so long as the products are made and marketed as dietary supplements  which are governed by more stringent standards than ordinary food But the department also warns that doing this will run afoul of rules issued by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  which said it was unlawful to add CBD to food or to market it as a dietary supplement  That is because the agency  for the first time last year  had approved a drug that contained CBD as the active ingredient  New York City health inspectors have taken the FDA rule seriously  At the Fat Cat Kitchen  Holm was startled when a health inspector impounded her CBD powder  honey  snacks and raw cookie dough in February  Similar scenes played out at four other eateries in the city Soon afterward  Holm and other restaurateurs received a letter from the department saying inspectors would resume the seizures after July 1 It is unclear whether the city s Health Department will allow cafes and restaurants to sell CBD edibles even as a dietary supplement  despite New York state officials saying such products are legal  When asked  Michael Lanza  a Health Department spokesman  repeated the department s position that it is following the FDA ban on CBD food and drink in any form  An FDA spokesman declined to comment on New York s regulations Colorado  Maine and other states have attempted to clarify the status of CBD laced edibles by passing laws allowing the addition of CBD to food  The FDA has said it may make an exception for CBD  allowing it as a food additive or dietary supplement even though it is now a listed drug  It will hold a public forum on the issue in Maryland on May 31 With the conflicting rules and at best haphazard enforcement  Holm and other CBD vendors say they are pressing ahead  devising their own strategies that they feel are at least a gesture toward compliance Igor Yakovlev  who stirs CBD into honey on New York s Staten Island  prints a disclaimer on each Beezy Beez Honey jar stating that the FDA has not  evaluated or approved  his product Holm  in consultation with a lawyer  noted that the FDA bans CBD being added to food for  interstate commerce   and reasons she is fine to sell CBD coffee so long as the extract is produced and processed in New York  It is so confusing because you can ask three different attorneys and get three different answers   said Allan Gandelman  a farmer in Cortland who founded the New York Cannabis Growers and Processors Association earlier this year   So you decide you re going to blaze a path forward  and produce a product that customers really want  and go for it until the government gets its act together    Reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York  Editing by Frank McGurty and Dan Grebler  

ATHENS   Greece s potential next prime minister  Kyriakos Mitsotakis  says he plans to unblock privatizations  cut taxes and enact meaningful reforms to attract investment  increase state efficiency and make the pension system viable  With opinion polls putting him more than 10 points ahead of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras  the conservative leader is confident an EU election next month will prove to be a springboard to winning a national vote expected by the autumn  We ll be implementing them  reforms  not because they are part of a program but because we truly believe that they are necessary to make the Greek economy more competitive   Mitsotakis told Reuters from the headquarters of New Democracy  Greece s main opposition party  By implementing reforms  he says Greece can persuade its lenders  who still monitor the economy even after it officially exited its 280 billion euro financial crisis bailouts  to lower their targets and convince investors that it is out of the woods The 51 year old scion of a powerful family of politicians considers Greece s post bailout primary surplus targets  too high   but says that they must be respected  at least in the short term   Greece tapped international bond markets with a 10 year bond earlier this year  its first such issue in a decade  But at 18 percent the unemployment rate remains the highest in the euro zone and so is its debt  standing at 180 percent of output  The economy is not the only issue for a future Greek leader to grapple with Mitsotakis maintains deep reservations at the deal brokered by the leftist government recognizing the neighboring state with the name North Macedonia  Skopje should not expect an automatic entry pass into the European Union now the name dispute is resolved  Mitsotakis said With many Greeks still struggling with the effects of creditor mandated austerity though  the upcoming elections will undoubtedly become a referendum on how firebrand leftist Tsipras  elected in 2015  handled the crisis Mitsotakis camp is already on a war footing ahead of the EU parliamentary vote on May 26  People come and go from his office  adorned with paintings  pictures of his family and his late father   a former prime minister   books  a model ship named  Leadership  and a stuffed toy lion People who know him say an unflappable demeanor denotes an attention to detail  a workaholic who came in as an outsider to win the party leadership in 2016  Greece emerged from the third bailout nine months ago  But Mitsotakis says it has not turned a corner   it is just comparatively better than 2015  when he says bungled negotiation tactics by Tsipras s government almost got it thrown out of the euro zone  Tsipras says he had no other option but to accept it   VICIOUS CIRCLE The economic monitoring framework includes meeting an annual primary budget surplus   excluding debt servicing costs   of 3 5 percent of GDP until 2022   Once we deliver the reforms  I think that would be the right time to discuss the primary surpluses   he said  Apart from pushing hard on  emblematic investments   such as a real estate project at the former Athens airport and a Chinese investment at Greece s largest port in Piraeus  his gameplan includes cutting corporate tax to 20 percent from 28 percent and tax on dividends to 5 from 10 percent within two years The middle class is overtaxed  he said   They ve taken more money out of people s pockets than it was necessary so I plan to return some of it back to people and to the corporations   Greece sees growth at 2 5 percent this year  But Mitsotakis said the country needed at least 4 percent economic growth  to convince everyone that it has broken out of the vicious circle   At the end of the day what is going to make our debt sustainable is if Greece is going to move to a different growth trajectory   he said Mitsotakis s party stridently opposed the deal recognizing the ex Yugoslav Republic as North Macedonia  a view shared by many believing the name claimed by the northern state is an appropriation of Greek culture and heritage  Although we don t like the agreement we ll respect it   the leader said   But we ll work to improve aspects or consequences of the agreement that are currently not in our interest  For years  the wrangle has stopped the small state from joining NATO and the EU  North Macedonia is expected to join the alliance in 2020  But joining the EU  which includes each member state approving a candidate s compliance in various policy areas  is a longer process  I don t think anyone should expect Greece to agree to open and close chapters when there are still outstanding issues which have not been addressed by the agreement   Mitsotakis said   Of course we fully retain the right to block this process if we think that our national interests are not met    Reporting by Renee Maltezou and Michele Kambas  Editing by Alison Williams

ISTANBUL   President Tayyip Erdogan s losses in local elections have dented investors  hopes that Turkey will adopt painful reforms they say are needed to stabilize the economy as he moves to shore up his political base Erdogan s Islamist rooted AK Party  AKP   in power nationally since 2002  lost control of the capital Ankara and the business hub Istanbul in the March 31 polls  initial results showed  The AKP has demanded recounts in both cities Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak  who is Erdogan s son in law  is expected this week to announce to jittery foreign investors the structural reforms he hopes will revive an economy plagued by high inflation and a fragile currency  State owned Anadolu news agency said the announcement would be on Wednesday After a currency crisis last year that saw the lira lose nearly 30 percent of its value  economists say Turkey needs to make long term commitments to increase exports  relieve debt laden companies and free up the central bank to do its job Erdogan  who campaigned hard ahead of the vote  said on election night the AKP would now refocus on the economy But many analysts are skeptical about the chances for a comprehensive reform plan  especially after the elections  and fear the AKP will opt instead for short term stimulus measures that fail to tackle  and may even exacerbate  deeper weaknesses  The AKP base want more pro growth measures  they want more fiscal measures  they want lower inflation  It is exactly what they  the AKP  did before the elections and it will have to continue if  Erdogan  wants to remain popular   said Guillaume Tresca  senior emerging markets strategist at Credit Agricole   I would not expect concrete reforms  it will be just words  BOOM AND BUSTAt the heart of Turkey s economic malaise is years of cheap foreign funding that drove a construction driven boom  Once the lira collapsed  firms could not pay off debts and that exposed their lenders and employees to default and bankruptcy As the economy tipped into recession last year  the lira stabilized and inflation dipped a bit from a 15 year high of 25 percent  offering some relief But a series of ad hoc measures have stoked investors  concerns that Turkey is not fully committed to letting its currency float freely or to allowing the central bank to keep interest rates high   at 24 percent since September   for as long as needed to bring inflation down from 20 percent  To help hard pressed Turks this year  the government launched discount fruit and vegetable stands and extended tax cuts on some goods  To tackle a lira meltdown last month  it ordered banks to choke off lira funding to a London foreign exchange market and tapped into central bank reserves   It looks like the Erdogan instinct is to survive   said Nihat Bulent Gultekin  a former Turkish central bank governor and now a professor at the University of Pennsylvania  I don t think they have any long term objectives  It would require a constant focus on the economy for an extended period of time  HARD TO SWALLOWAlbayrak has given few details of the coming reforms  saying only that they would address a wide range of issues The lira has settled down in recent days after its pre election volatility and analysts say Albayrak s reforms will help determine whether volatility returns   The market expects concrete measures to address economic imbalances accompanied by a specific timetable   said Piotr Matys  emerging markets forex strategist at Rabobank Moody s said  the credibility and effectiveness  of reforms will be key to Turkey s credit profile  which the ratings agency downgraded in August   There is a risk that the government will embark on even more expensive stimulus programs as it begins to recognize the extent of the economic downturn   it said  Investors and economists say Ankara needs a plan to recapitalize banks dealing with corporate restructuring and non performing loans  which could more than double this year  It should also boost competitive export sectors such as auto and textile manufacturing in order to lower its annual current account deficit  which leaves the economy reliant on speculative foreign inflows  they say  We need to provide the right training and the right subsidies to the right sectors   Selva Demiralp  professor at Istanbul s Koc University  The reforms would take time and  there will be a price to pay because when the production structure is changing some people will be unemployed   she said That may be hard to swallow for Erdogan and Turks in general who would not welcome a recession that lasts beyond the second half of 2019  when economists currently expect a return to growth  Unemployment has already risen above 13 percent  Although an unlikely option for Erdogan  who has repeatedly said Turkey does not need the International Monetary Fund  Matys of Rabobank said the reforms should ideally be overseen by the IMF to restore investor confidence   A PowerPoint presentation  by Albayrak  with slides claiming that the economy is rebalancing quickly and a few bullet points may not prove sufficient to restore confidence among investors   he said

HONG KONG   A political party led by the president of the Maldives appeared to have won decisively in parliamentary elections over the weekend  a result that may help him restore political freedoms in a strategically important country with an authoritarian past The president  Ibrahim Mohamed Solih  had won a resounding victory in presidential elections last September  But parts of his party s agenda have been stymied because some of its allies in a governing coalition are aligned with a former strongman leader  Abdulla Yameen  who has been widely accused of corruption and repression The Maldives  a chain of islands southwest of India  has traditionally fallen within New Delhi s sphere of influence  Yet it also stretches across maritime routes that are crucial to China  and Beijing has recently spent hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure projects in the Maldives Critics have warned of the Maldives falling prey to  debt trap diplomacy   meaning that it could be pressured to offer security concessions to China as repayment for large loans  Some politicians  as well as Western and Indian diplomats  have warned that a growing dependence on China could be a threat to the country s sovereignty Some political analysts saw the victory last year for Mr  Solih  who has been skeptical of China s influence  as good news for India s interests  On Sunday  a news article in The Economic Times  an Indian newspaper  described the parliamentary rout by Mr  Solih s Maldivian Democratic Party as a  shot in arm  for New Delhi in its  neighborhood  Still  Constantino Xavier  a foreign policy fellow at Brookings India in New Delhi  said the  lure of cheap and easy money  made it likely that the Maldives s relationship with China would deepen   despite everything that leaders will say in public   In the long term  the natural tendency of any leader in the Maldives will be to increase ties with China   he said   China has that financial power to deliver quickly and effectively  Preliminary results from the vote on Saturday showed that the Maldivian Democratic Party was on track to win more than two thirds of the 87 seats in the country s parliament  the local news media reported on Sunday  It needs just 44 seats to become the first party to secure a parliamentary majority since the Maldives held its first free election in 2008 Other parties won fewer than seven seats each on Saturday  according to The Maldives Independent  a local news site Past elections in the Maldives have been marred by accusations of widespread irregularities  Mr  Yameen was accused of rigging the presidential election last year by forcing employees of state owned companies to vote for his party  stacking the election commission with loyalists  locking up opposition leaders and canceling voter registrations But Transparency Maldives  an election watchdog  said in a statement on Sunday that the previous day s vote had been  transparent and generally well administered  Mr  Solih said in a statement over the weekend that the country s people were the election s  biggest winners   That our campaign was issue oriented and not based on hatred and narrow divisions is a win for our young democracy   he said   That our government did not hinder those candidates with whom we did not agree is a big win for the country  The Maldives made international headlines last winter when Mr  Yameen  the president at the time  set off a political crisis by declaring a state of emergency and sending troops to surround the Supreme Court  The move came the week after the court overturned criminal convictions against nine of Mr  Yameen s opponents One of them was a former president  Mohamed Nasheed  a member of the Maldivian Democratic Party who was then living in exile in London  Mr  Nasheed  who returned to the Maldives in late 2018  was ineligible to run in the September election because he had been sentenced to prison under the Yameen government Mr  Solih ran for president in Mr  Nasheed s place On the campaign trail last year  Mr  Solih pledged to restore democratic freedoms if he won  including rolling back an anti defamation law that Mr  Yameen had introduced as a tool for locking up opponents The anti defamation act was repealed two months later  But Mr  Solih s party has struggled in recent months to carry out other parts of its agenda For example  even though Mr  Solih has promised to investigate the 2014 disappearance of Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla  a prominent journalist critical of Mr  Yameen  a party in the Maldivian Democratic Party s governing coalition refused in February to call a vote on a bill about recovering stolen assets and investigating unresolved murders Mr  Yameen  the former strongman president  was recently imprisoned over a graft scandal involving the country s tourism board  He denies the accusations and was released on bail in late March  days before the parliamentary elections  

LONDON   After months of grueling political perma crisis  Brexit is taking its toll on the British political establishment   not least the small patch of grass opposite parliament that has become a makeshift home to the world s media Parliamentary authorities have decreed that the media encampment   the source of thousands of Brexit despatches broadcast all over the globe   be temporarily dismantled next week to allow the downtrodden turf to be repaired  An email sent to media outlets this week said urgent action was needed to re turf and reseed damaged areas  preserve the grass in the less damaged parts  and maintain flowerbeds Normally reserved for occasional major political events like general elections and budget announcements  the number of broadcasters based on the green has become a barometer of the state of the nation  The more cameras  the bigger the drama For the last few months the area has been packedInside parliament  Prime Minister Theresa May s government teeters on the brink of collapse  Brexit has been delayed and the fate of the world s fifth largest economy rests in the hands of the 650 lawmakers elected to sit there Outside  TV channels have built elaborate two tier studios  radio stations have bunkered down inside white tents and presenters speaking languages from Arabic to Italian have jockeyed for a camera shot with a backdrop of parliament  All that has turned College Green   a normally grassy area less than the size of four tennis courts   into a piebald muddy patchwork in need of a break But with Brexit far from resolved and an insatiable appetite for news of the country s biggest political crisis in more than 70 years  the respite will only be temporary  Parliament  which owns the land  said the closure was expected to last seven days  After that  regular access will be allowed again  should the circumstances justify it     Reporting by William James and Tom Scally  editing by Stephen Addison  

A few days ago  the artist Andres Serrano was making final choices for  The Game  All Things Trump   his installation of 1 000 items marketed  branded  or autographed by the current president that opens Friday in Manhattan s Meatpacking District It is a museum grade project  with quality frames  custom vitrines  careful lighting  It covers two floors  with a mezzanine bar that will operate during the two month run  an heirloom from a lineage of nightclubs  including Lotus  that once occupied this space on West 14th Street  Near the bar  Mr  Serrano had set up a blackjack table rescued from the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City  boxing jackets from big ticket bouts  and a case of colognes   Success by Trump   The issue was with the mannequins  Each wore Trump Taj Mahal security guard uniforms  authentic  and a Make America Great Again cap  There were 11  standing on either side of a very large print of Mr  Serrano s photograph of Donald Trump  made in 2004 as part of the artist s  America  portrait series  that dominated the back wall  Someone had lifted the right arms of the mannequins in a wave  or salute  and the question was whether they should stay that way Huddled with his wife  Irina  and the head of the installation team  Mr  Serrano invited this reporter to advise  What first came to mind was  well  the Nazi salute  but the arm positions   too high  too loose   weren t right  It could be Hail to the Chief   Mr  Serrano observed Salute or not  the mannequins gave off a distinct militia energy  Either way  I ventured  both friends and foes of the president would find substance for debate  And people who want to hate me or love me will also find a story   Mr  Serrano said  He decided to lower the arms  Keep it neutral Signs and wonders  Mr

years ago  On May 17  1989  after the work s presence in an exhibition drew national attention  an apoplectic Sen  Al D Amato tore up the catalog on the Senate floor The fracas over Robert Mapplethorpe s planned  then banned  Corcoran Gallery show followed almost immediately  It led to the first Congressional proposal to defund the National Endowment for the Arts   a move that Mr  Trump s budget proposals have again put on the table In later photography series  Mr  Serrano focused on Ku Klux Klan members in their robes  cadavers in a morgue  and close up images of human  his own  and animal feces  Mr  Serrano s most recent New York show  in Fall 2017 at Jack Shainman Gallery  was titled  Torture   It depicted antique torture instruments  stylized poses of bodies in torment  and portraits of survivors from Sudan and Northern Ireland Now  with Mr  Trump in his sights  Mr  Serrano is playing it coy  Donald Trump is all things to all people   he told me in his Greenwich Village apartment recently  under the gaze of his ample collection of European church statues from the medieval to the Baroque periods  I make art about very basic things  life  death  religion   he said   After a while it occurred to me  what s the most important thing right now  Donald Trump  That epiphany  about a year ago  sent Mr  Serrano on a mission  which he conducted largely on eBay  spending long hours locating and then bidding on Trumpiana Image Piss Christ   1987  cibachrome  plexiglass  wooden frame  Exhibited in Virginia in 1989  it helped launch a culture war  CreditAndres SerranoHis efforts turned up gold coated bottles of Trump Vodka  boxes used to package Trump Steaks  and a fake dollar bill showing Hillary Clinton behind bars Mr  Serrano found a legal document pertaining to

Tarzan and Jane composition of a party invitation poster from 1994  celebrating the  Lord of the Financial Jungle   and announces on a 1990 New York Post cover the  BEST SEX I EVER HAD  Mr  Serrano said he d love it if the president saw the project  He has bought short advertising slots on a spectrum of cable shows   Sean Hannity  Rachel Maddow  Don Lemon  Morning Joe   to run a 15 second video

Mr  Serrano  a New Yorker and  at age 68  just four years younger than the president  it sounded like a compliment   It s possible that Donald Trump expresses a lot of things that many people might feel but don t express   Mr  Serrano said   Racism  It s an issue  And sexism  misogyny  they re all issues concerning Donald Trump  I gave the show a chance  I didn t hate it  At points it feels like it s about to present an argument  The vitrine of Trump University material  with someone s real diploma amid the workbooks and videos promising wealth through trading in foreclosures  is haunting  the human pain and exploitation intrudes here Elsewhere  it s a fun house  But the boxes of  Trump  The Game   a Monopoly like product with the tagline   It s not whether you win or lose   It s whether you win   on their own do little to advance what we have come to know about our present situation ImageA collection of Donald J  Trump signature collection ties CreditMolly Matalon for The New

burn it  and Andrey Molodkin  whose latest project asks visitors to donate blood that  pumped into a machine  activates an audiovisual installation By that standard  Mr  Serrano s composite Trump portrait seems tame But had he gunned for outrage  he would probably have fallen short  by now Mr  Trump s reign is itself the provocation  Mr  Serrano s installation reminds us how relentlessly the president made his legend  but it rings mostly nostalgic  a throwback to times when the poison was merely latent Of course  it was never just that  Also 30 years ago  on May 1  1989  Mr  Trump was running his full page advertisement in The New York Times  The New York Post  The New York Daily News  and New York Newsday  demanding the death penalty for the Central Park Five  since exonerated   a position he has never disavowed That particular Trump signed artifact does not appear in Mr  Serrano s installation  The artist conceded that it never hit his radar at the time  I wasn t aware of his

WASHINGTON   U S  Vice President Mike Pence met with his Brazilian counterpart Hamilton Mourao at the White House on Monday to discuss sanctions and diplomatic efforts aimed at increasing the pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to exit In his first ever talks with Mourao  Pence aimed to encourage the former Brazilian general to use his experience and influence to urge Venezuelan military leaders   as well as China and Russia   to pull back on their support of Maduro  a White House official said The United States and most other Western countries have backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido  who declared himself interim president in January  arguing that Maduro s 2018 re election was illegitimate Maduro   who is backed by Russia and China and retains control of state functions and the country s military   has called Guaido a puppet of the United States Guaido has offered amnesty to members of the military who took his side  but the top brass largely has stuck by Maduro Mourao  who was a defense attache in Caracas   has a very unique perspective  when it comes to helping convince Venezuelan military leaders to switch sides  the White House official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  He speaks with a unique credibility from within the region as a senior political leader with a military background  That voice is very important  and he is using that voice to advance the cause   the official said Mourao is also well positioned to confront Russia and China over their support of Maduro  since Brazil is a partner with the nations in the BRICS group of largest emerging markets economies  the official said The United States sanctioned state owned PDVSA in January  a move aimed at cutting Maduro s government off from oil revenues  and has also sanctioned Venezuelan banks  shipping companies and individuals connected to Maduro The White House would like allies like Brazil to take similar economic measures to isolate Venezuela  the official said   Reporting by Roberta Rampton  Editing by Alistair Bell

WASHINGTON   Playing migrants for laughs in a speech to lobbyists and donors  President Donald Trump characterized people trying to get into the U S  as a horde of beefy men who fake hard luck stories so softies in the immigration system will let them in His shtick caused plenty of amusement at the Republican Jewish Coalition event Saturday but it was a far cry from the reality of the masses at the border The speech capped a week of unreal political rhetoric as Trump retreated on two broad fronts  the border and health care  and offered tortured explanations for doing so  He also got his family history wrong and drew a link between wind power and cancer that has not been proved Here s a look back IMMIGRATION TRUMP  describing asylum seekers as  people that look like they should be fighting for the UFC  Ultimate Fighting Championship   They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place   coaching them to say  I am very fearful for my life  I am very worried that I will be accosted if I m sent back home   Trump then mimics U S  officials   Oh  give him asylum  He s afraid  He s afraid   And he adds   We don t love the fact that he s got tattoos on his face  That s not a good sign     speech Saturday to the lobbying group THE FACTS  Figures from his own administration tell a different story than Trump s mocking tale  Those coming are increasingly families and children  Among them are thousands who get a chance for a life in America because they make a compelling case that they risk persecution in their home countries Last month  Homeland Security s immigration statistics office released its latest annual report on the flow of asylum seekers and refugees  covering 2017  Among those who came from Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras and applied for asylum at the border  56 percent were unaccompanied children  The percentage was the same the year before and higher in 2015 Altogether  Homeland Security granted the asylum applications of more than 26 500 people in 2017  Almost one third were children  Nearly half were women  Close to two thirds were married Additionally  the Justice Department granted asylum to more than 10 500 people who were already in the country and made their case for refuge in their deportation hearings    TRUMP   If they put one foot on our territory  if they start climbing a fence and they re on the Mexico side  welcome to the United States  Think of it  It s the craziest thing     speech Saturday THE FACTS  It s not that simple  What is lost in Trump s rhetoric is that it is legal to come to the border and ask for asylum  As for those who sneak illegally into the U S  and get caught  they  too  are entitled to apply for asylum As the Homeland Security report states   Generally  any foreign national present in the United States or arriving at a POE  port of entry  may seek asylum regardless of immigration status  Whether they ask at the border or after sneaking into the U S   most don t get it    TRUMP  on why he is pulling back on sealing the U S  Mexico border   Because Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days  They re apprehending everybody  Yesterday they apprehended 1 400 people  The day before was 1 000  And if they apprehend people at their southern border where they don t have to walk through  that s a big home run  We can handle it from there  It s really good     remarks to reporters Friday TRUMP   Before that they never did anything     remarks to reporters Thursday THE FACTS  Trump is describing a Mexican crackdown on Central American migrants that has not materialized  He s also wrong in saying that Mexico did nothing about the problem until he threatened to close the border Mexico markedly tightened migration controls during the Obama administration  Mexico also detained more than 30 000 foreigners in the first three months of this year  before Trump accused Mexican officials of doing  NOTHING  Mexico reports that its interception and detention of migrants from the south are  about average  in recent months  Over the first three days of April  it apprehended 1 259 foreigners   not 1 000 or more a day  as Trump claimed  There is no very substantive change   said Mexico s foreign secretary  Marcelo Ebrard   I don t know what  Trump  was referring to  Ebrard said   What Mexico is doing as far as the review of the southern border   well  it s the same thing it has been doing     TRUMP   The Flores decision is a disaster  I have to tell you  Judge Flores  whoever you may be  that decision is a disaster for our country  a disaster     remarks at a meeting with local officials in Southern California on Friday THE FACTS  There s no Judge Flores involved  Jenny Flores was 15 year old native of El Salvador who was held in what her advocates said were substandard conditions in the 1980s  contending she was strip searched in custody and housed with male adults  They launched a class action lawsuit on behalf of migrant children in the country illegally  Her mother was a housekeeper in the U S  who feared deportation if she picked up her daughter The case worked its way to the Supreme Court  which sided with the government and against the girl s advocates  But the case gave rise to an agreement in 1997 setting conditions for the detention of migrant children and the codifying of those conditions in law a decade later  It generally bars the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days and guides how they are to be treated    HEALTH CARETRUMP   This will be a great campaign issue  I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported  as usual  in the  nytimes  but only after the Election when we take back the House etc     tweet Wednesday THE FACTS  That s misleading at best A week earlier  Trump stirred expectations of an ambitious health care effort when he said that if the Supreme Court strikes down  Obamacare     we will have a plan that s far better   He promised  the Republican Party will become the party of great health care  But Trump soon found that the party in Congress had no appetite for yet another attempt to replace President Barack Obama s health law in the near future   nor does it have a plan  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   told reporters Tuesday  describing their conversation a day earlier   He did say  as he later tweeted  that he accepted that and that he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign  So Trump backed down and postponed any replacement until after an election more than 18 months away McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Monday s private call between the two  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   according to that person  That night  Trump tweeted as much    TRUMP   Republicans will always support pre existing conditions     tweet Wednesday MICK MULVANEY  acting White House chief of staff   Every single plan that this White House has ever put forward since Donald Trump was elected covered pre existing conditions  Every single plan that Republicans in the House voted on in the previous Congress covered pre existing conditions  Every single plan considered by the Senate covers pre existing conditions  The debate about pre existing conditions is over  Both parties support them and anyone telling you anything different is lying to you for political gain     interview March 31 on ABC s  This Week  THE FACTS  Trump and his chief of staff s sweeping statements about the GOP commitment to protect people with pre existing medical conditions are misleading  The Republican health insurance proposals would not have protected those patients as broadly as the Obama era law and could have led to significantly higher rates or gaps in coverage for people with chronic illnesses The Obama health law requires insurers to take all applicants  regardless of medical history  and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones  It also requires standard benefits such as pregnancy  maternity and newborn care and mental health treatment  The trade off was that the law also mandated that everyone have insurance  including healthy people  whose premiums helped insurers cover the costs of the very sick The GOP health overhaul plans in Congress eliminated the mandate that everyone have insurance and sought to protect people with pre existing conditions to a degree  But the Republican legislation would have given states leeway to vary the premiums that insurers charge based on health and other factors  That might make coverage unaffordable for people with serious or pre existing health conditions For instance  the Republican plans would have allowed insurers to charge older people at a 5 to 1 ratio compared with young people  higher than the law s 3 to 1 ratio  and given states authority to allow insurers to use health status as a factor in setting premiums for people who have had a break in coverage and are trying to get a new individual policy The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found the GOP plans over time would raise premiums for people with health problems because healthy people would be more likely to take their chances going uninsured    WIND POWERTRUMP   If you have a windmill anywhere near your house  congratulations  Your house just went down 75  of value  And they say the noise causes cancer     remarks at Republican fundraising dinner Tuesday THE FACTS  The sound from wind farms has not been proved to cause cancer Trump has had it out for wind power since turbines were proposed off the coast of Scotland within sight of his golf resort near Aberdeen   He unsuccessfully fought the project  He has ascribed a variety of evils to wind power over the years  usually with scant evidence  while praising coal  a well documented cause of health problems  The American Cancer Society is unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer   the organization said after Trump s latest remarks While some recesses of the internet have long tried to sound alarms about  wind turbine syndrome   several studies have found no evidence of serious health issues Trump actually misidentified his target  Wind turbines produce energy  Windmills mill grain and flummox Don Quixote     PUERTO RICOTRUMP   Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane  more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before     tweet Tuesday HOGAN GIDLEY  White House spokesman   The fact is  they have received more money than any state or territory in history for a rebuild     interview Tuesday with MSNBC THE FACTS  The money Puerto Rico has received for hurricane relief is nowhere close to  91 billion  Nor is the amount provided greater than for any other hurricane that has struck the U S According to the White House  Trump s  91 billion estimate includes about  50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades  along with  41 billion already approved  But actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed more slowly from federal coffers  about  11 billion so far Even if the  91 billion figure eventually comes to fruition  it would not be the most ever provided for hurricane rebuilding efforts  Hurricane Katrina  which hit Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states in 2005  has cost the U S government more than  120 billion    TRUMP  on Puerto Rico   The pols are grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA     tweet Tuesday THE FACTS  Trump appears to suggest Puerto Rico is not part of the U S  as he criticizes its territorial government for taking  from USA   He does not criticize other Americans for taking  from USA  Gidley  speaking on MSNBC  called the notion that Trump was referring to Puerto Ricans as noncitizens  absolutely ridiculous   But in the same interview Gidley had referred to Puerto Rico as  that country   When pressed about his wording  Gidley said it was a mistake and he meant to say  territory  Puerto Ricans are Americans    TRUMP S FATHERTRUMP  arguing that Germany should spend more on its own military budget   I have great respect for Angela  and I have great respect for the country   he said  referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel   My father is German  right  was German  and born in a very wonderful place in Germany  and so I have a great feeling for Germany  but they re not paying what they should be paying     remarks Tuesday with NATO s secretary general THE FACTS  Trump is confusing his father and grandfather Trump s father  Fred  was born in New York City  The president s grandfather  Friedrich  was born in Germany Friedrich Trump immigrated to the U S  in 1885 at the age of 16  arriving in New York before moving to the western parts of the U S Trump has messed up his family history in this way several times  Last year  he said both his parents were born in what became the European Union  Only his Scottish mother was    VOTER TURNOUTDEMOCRAT BETO O ROURKE   The state saw young voter turnout up 500  over the last midterm election     various campaign events in recent weeks THE FACTS  Voter turnout by people under 30 did not jump nearly that much last year  Texas did see a large increase in those young voters  though More than 1 million young voters cast a ballot in the 2018 midterm election  a 234  increase from the 2014 midterm elections  according to voting data from the Texas secretary of state s office Initial reports suggested young voter turnout increased as much as 508  during early voting in Texas when compared with early voting in 2014  according to data released by a political consulting firm a week before the 2018 election O Rourke spokesman Chris Evans acknowledged his candidate used those figures without making the distinction that they represent an incomplete portion of early votes cast   not total turnout in the election Overall  voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election increased 77  in Texas over 2014 totals    CENSUSTRUMP   Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question  Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together     tweet Monday THE FACTS  Trump s disdain for conducting the once a decade census without a citizenship question is not shared by his own Census Bureau researchers  Nor is it consistent with the many operations of government and business that make billions of dollars in spending decisions as well as policy decisions based on the most accurate possible count of the U S  population According to January 2018 calculations by the Census Bureau  adding a citizenship question to the decennial census form would cause lower response rates among noncitizens  leading to an increased cost to the government of at least  27 5 million for additional phone calls  visits to the home and other follow up efforts to reach them  The Constitution requires a count every 10 years of  the whole number of persons in each state   long understood to include all residents of the U S The count goes to the heart of the U S  political system  It s used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House and how the electoral votes that decide presidential elections are distributed  Civil rights groups and states with higher shares of immigrant populations such as California and New York cite a significant harm to the political rights of minority groups if a citizenship question in the decennial census dissuades immigrants from participating  resulting in diminished representation in the U S  House The census also shapes how 300 federal programs distribute more than  800 billion a year to local communities  according to an analysis by the GW Institute of Public Policy at George Washington University  Communities and businesses depend on it  as well  in deciding where to build schools  hospitals  job training centers  grocery stores and more The GW institute s analysis of the effects of an undercount on five programs administered by the Health and Human Services Department  for instance  found that 37 states lost a median of  1 091 in the 2015 budget year for each person missed in the 2010 census    Associated Press writers Colleen Long  Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar  Michael Biesecker  Jill Colvin  Andrew Taylor and

Many Americans are critical of the Electoral College  an attitude that seems to have intensified since Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election despite losing the popular vote  These critics often make two arguments  first  that electing the president by direct popular vote would be preferable in a democracy  and second  that the Electoral College has disreputable origins  having been put into the Constitution to protect the institution of slavery Defenders of the Electoral College often counter that it was designed not to help maintain slavery but for other reasons  many of them still relevant  such as to balance the power of big states against that of small states   Even some critics of the Electoral College have made this argument  Both sides are misguided  There are legitimate reasons to keep the Electoral College system  odd and creaky though it may be  but we must accept the fact that it does have deep roots in efforts by the founders to accommodate slavery The Electoral College was not mainly designed to balance big states against small states  It certainly did not have that effect  Eight of the first nine presidential elections were won by candidates who were plantation owners from Virginia  then America s biggest state  Only three candidates from small states have ever been elected president  Zachary Taylor  Franklin Pierce and Bill Clinton As James Madison made clear at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 in Philadelphia  the big political divide in America was not between big and small states  it was between North and South and was all about slavery  So  too  was the Electoral College at the founding  both in its original incarnation in 1787 and in the version later created by the 12th Amendment  which was adopted in 1804 Behind closed doors at the Constitutional Convention  when the idea of direct presidential election was proposed by the Northerner James Wilson  the Southerner James Madison explained why this was a political nonstarter  Slaves couldn t vote  so the slaveholding South would basically lose every time in a national direct vote  But if slaves could somehow be counted in an indirect system  maybe at a discount  say  three fifths   well  that might sell in the South  Thus were planted the early seeds of an Electoral College system Some have argued that direct election was doomed because the Philadelphia delegates disdained democracy  Behind closed doors these elites did indeed bad mouth the masses  as do elites today   But look at what the framers of the Constitution did  rather than what they said  They put the Constitution itself to a far more democratic vote than had been seen before  They provided for a directly elected House of Representatives  which the earlier Articles of Confederation did not do   They omitted all property qualifications for leading federal positions  unlike almost every state constitution then on the books So why didn t they go even further  providing direct presidential election  Because of Madison s political calculation  Direct election would have been a dealbreaker for the South  For a while  having members of Congress elect the president emerged as a possible alternative  but this idea  too  would have been pro slavery for the same reason  Thanks to the three fifths clause  slave states got extra votes in the House  just as in the Electoral College system that was finally adopted When George Washington left the political stage in the mid 1790s  America witnessed its first two contested presidential elections  Twice  most Southerners backed a Southerner  Thomas Jefferson  and most Northerners backed a Northerner  John Adams   Without the extra electoral votes generated by its enormous slave population  the South would have lost the election of 1800  which Jefferson won It is true  as some have noted  that some Northerners manipulated the vote in that election to their advantage  but that does not erase the ugly fact that the South had extra seats in the Electoral College because of its slaves  When the Constitution was amended to modify the Electoral College after 1800  all America had seen the pro slavery tilt of the system  but Jefferson s Southern allies steamrollered over Northern congressmen who explicitly proposed eliminating the system s pro slavery bias As a result  every president until Abraham Lincoln was either a Southerner or a Northerner who was willing  while president  to accommodate the slaveholding South  The dominant political figure in antebellum America was the pro slavery Andrew Jackson  who in 1829 proposed eliminating electors while retaining pro slavery apportionment rules rooted in the three fifths clause   in effect creating a system of pro slavery electoral vote counts without the need for electors themselves Today  of course  slavery no longer skews and stains our system   and maybe the Electoral College system should remain intact  The best argument in its favor is simply inertia  Any reforms might backfire  with unforeseen and adverse consequences  The Electoral College is the devil we know But we should not kid ourselves  This devil does indeed have devilish origins RelatedOpinion   Sean WilentzThe Electoral College Was Not a Pro Slavery PloyThere is a lot wrong with how we choose the president  But the framers did not put it into the

Last May  an elderly man was admitted to the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital for abdominal surgery  A blood test revealed that he was infected with a newly discovered germ as deadly as it was mysterious  Doctors swiftly isolated him in the intensive care unit The germ  a fungus called Candida auris  preys on people with weakened immune systems  and it is quietly spreading across the globe  Over the last five years  it has hit a neonatal unit in Venezuela  swept through a hospital in Spain  forced a prestigious British medical center to shut down its intensive care unit  and taken root in India  Pakistan and South Africa Recently C  auris reached New York  New Jersey and Illinois  leading the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add it to a list of germs deemed  urgent threats   Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  The man at Mount Sinai died after 90 days in the hospital  but C  auris did not  Tests showed it was everywhere in his room  so invasive that the hospital needed special cleaning equipment and had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles to eradicate it  Everything was positive   the walls

window shades  the ceiling  everything in the room was positive  C  auris is so tenacious  in part  because it is impervious to major antifungal medications  making it a new example of one of the world s most intractable health threats  the rise of drug resistant infections ImageDr  Shawn Lockhart  a fungal disease expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  holding a microscope slide with inactive Candida auris collected from an American patient CreditMelissa Golden for The New York TimesFor decades  public health experts have warned that the overuse of antibiotics was reducing the effectiveness of drugs that have lengthened life spans by curing bacterial infections once commonly fatal  But lately  there has been an explosion of resistant fungi as well  adding a new and frightening dimension to a phenomenon that is undermining a pillar of modern medicine  It s an enormous problem   said Matthew Fisher  a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London  who was a co author of a recent scientific review on the rise of resistant fungi   We depend on being able to treat those patients with antifungals  Simply put  fungi  just like bacteria  are evolving defenses to survive modern medicines From Times InsiderCandida Auris  The Fungus Nobody Wants to Talk AboutThe medical community is usually eager to discuss public health issues  But the rise in drug resistant microbes is cloaked in chronic secrecy April 8  2019Yet even as world health leaders have pleaded for more restraint in prescribing antimicrobial drugs to combat bacteria and fungi   convening the United Nations General Assembly in 2016 to manage an emerging crisis   gluttonous overuse of them in hospitals  clinics and farming has continued Resistant germs are often called  superbugs   but this is simplistic because they don t typically kill everyone  Instead  they are most lethal to people with immature or compromised immune systems  including newborns and the elderly  smokers  diabetics and people with autoimmune disorders who take steroids that suppress the body s defenses Scientists say that unless more effective new medicines are developed and unnecessary use of antimicrobial drugs is sharply curbed  risk will spread to healthier populations  A study the British government funded projects that if policies are not put in place to slow the rise of drug resistance  10 million people could die worldwide of all such infections in 2050  eclipsing the eight million expected to die that year from cancer ImageDr  Johanna Rhodes  an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London   We are driving this with the use of antifungicides on crops   she said of drug resistant germs CreditTom Jamieson for The New York TimesIn the United States  two million people contract resistant infections annually  and 23 000 die from them  according to the official C D C  estimate  That number was based on 2010 figures  more recent estimates from researchers at Washington University School of Medicine put the death toll at 162 000  Worldwide fatalities from resistant infections are estimated at 700 000 Antibiotics and antifungals are both essential to combat infections in people  but antibiotics are also used widely to prevent disease in farm animals  and antifungals are also applied to prevent agricultural plants from rotting  Some scientists cite evidence that rampant use of fungicides on crops is contributing to the surge in drug resistant fungi infecting humans What You Need to Know About Candida AurisC  auris is a mysterious and dangerous fungal infection that is among a growing number of germs that have evolved defenses against common medicines  Here are some basic facts about it April 6  2019Yet as the problem grows  it is little understood by the public   in part because the very existence of resistant infections is often cloaked in secrecy With bacteria and fungi alike  hospitals and local governments are reluctant to disclose outbreaks for fear of being seen as infection hubs  Even the C D C   under its agreement with states  is not allowed to make public the location or name of hospitals involved in outbreaks  State governments have in many cases declined to publicly share information beyond acknowledging that they have had cases All the while  the germs are easily spread   carried on hands and equipment inside hospitals  ferried on meat and manure fertilized vegetables from farms  transported across borders by travelers and on exports and imports  and transferred by patients from nursing home to hospital and back C  auris  which infected the man at Mount Sinai  is one of dozens of dangerous bacteria and fungi that have developed resistance  ImageA projection of the C  auris fungus on a microscope slide CreditMelissa Golden for The New York TimesOther prominent strains of the fungus Candida   one of the most common causes of bloodstream infections in hospitals   have not developed significant resistance to drugs  but more than 90 percent of C  auris infections are resistant to at least one drug  and 30 percent are resistant to two or more drugs  the C D C  said Dr  Lynn Sosa

patients who contract C  auris die within 90 days  according to the C D C  Yet the world s experts have not nailed down where it came from in the first place  It is a creature from the black lagoon   said Dr  Tom Chiller  who heads the fungal branch at the C D C   which is spearheading a global detective effort to find treatments and stop the spread   It bubbled up and now it is everywhere  Candida AurisA deadly  drug resistant fungus is infecting patients in hospitals and nursing homes around the world  The fungus seems to have emerged in several locations at once  not from a single

Disease Control and Prevention  Emerging Infectious Diseases  Emerging Microbes   Infections  Clinical Infectious Diseases  Journal of Infection  Mycoses  Doherty Institute  Image from Kazuo Satoh et al   Microbiology and Immunology No need  to tell the publicIn late 2015  Dr  Johanna Rhodes  an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London  got a panicked call from the Royal Brompton Hospital  a British medical center in London  C  auris had taken root there months earlier  and the hospital couldn t clear it   We have no idea where it s coming from  We ve never heard of it  It s just spread like wildfire    Dr  Rhodes said she was told  She agreed to help the hospital identify the fungus s genetic profile and clean it from rooms Under her direction  hospital workers used a special device to spray aerosolized hydrogen peroxide around a room used for a patient with C  auris  the theory being that the vapor would scour each nook and cranny  They left the device going for a week  Then they put a  settle plate  in the middle of the room with a gel at the bottom that would serve as a place for any surviving microbes to grow  Dr  Rhodes said Only one organism grew back  C  auris It was spreading  but word of it was not  The hospital  a specialty lung and heart center that draws wealthy patients from the Middle East and around Europe  alerted the British government and told infected patients  but made no public announcement  There was no need to put out a news release during the outbreak   said Oliver Wilkinson  a spokesman for the hospital Image Somehow  it made a jump almost seemingly simultaneously  and seemed to spread and it is drug resistant  which is really mind boggling   said Dr  Snigdha Vallabhaneni  a fungal expert and epidemiologist at the C D C CreditMelissa Golden for The New York TimesThis hushed panic is playing out in hospitals around the world  Individual institutions and national  state and local governments have been reluctant to publicize outbreaks of resistant infections  arguing there is no point in scaring patients   or prospective ones Dr  Silke Schelenz  Royal Brompton s infectious disease specialist  found the lack of urgency from the government and hospital in the early stages of the outbreak  very  very frustrating   They obviously didn t want to lose reputation   Dr  Schelenz said   It hadn t impacted our surgical outcomes  Read the next article in this seriesIn a Poor Kenyan Community  Cheap Antibiotics Fuel Deadly Drug Resistant InfectionsApril 7  2019By the end of June 2016  a scientific paper reported  an ongoing outbreak of 50 C  auris cases  at Royal Brompton  and the hospital took an extraordinary step  It shut down its I C U  for 11 days  moving intensive care patients to another floor  again with no announcement Days later the hospital finally acknowledged to a newspaper that it had a problem  A headline in The Daily Telegraph warned   Intensive Care Unit Closed After Deadly New Superbug Emerges in the U K    Later research said there were eventually 72 total cases  though some patients were only carriers and were not infected by the fungus  Yet the issue remained little known internationally  while an even bigger outbreak had begun in Valencia  Spain  at the 992 bed Hospital Universitari i Politcnic La Fe  There  unbeknown to the public or unaffected patients  372 people were colonized   meaning they had the germ on their body but were not sick with it   and 85 developed bloodstream infections  A paper in the journal Mycoses reported that 41 percent of the infected patients died within 30 days ImageOutside the Royal Brompton Hospital near London  By June 2016  the hospital had seen at least 50  proven or possible  cases of C  auris  and decided to shut down its intensive care unit for 11 days to address the contamination CreditTom Jamieson for The New York TimesA statement from the hospital said it was not necessarily C  auris that killed them   It is very difficult to discern whether patients die from the pathogen or with it  since they are patients with many underlying diseases and in very serious general condition   the statement said As with Royal Brompton  the hospital in Spain did not make any public announcement  It still has not One author of the article in Mycoses  a doctor at the hospital  said in an email that the hospital did not want him to speak to journalists because it  is concerned about the public image of the hospital  The secrecy infuriates patient advocates  who say people have a right to know if there is an outbreak so they can decide whether to go to a hospital  particularly when dealing with a nonurgent matter  like elective surgery  Why the heck are we reading about an outbreak almost a year and a half later   and not have it front page news the day after it happens   said Dr  Kevin Kavanagh  a physician in Kentucky and board chairman of Health Watch USA  a nonprofit patient advocacy group   You wouldn t tolerate this at a restaurant with a food poisoning outbreak  Health officials say that disclosing outbreaks frightens patients about a situation they can do nothing about  particularly when the risks are unclear  It s hard enough with these organisms for health care providers to wrap their heads around it   said Dr  Anna Yaffee  a former C D C  outbreak investigator who dealt with resistant infection outbreaks in Kentucky in which the hospitals were not publicly disclosed   It s really impossible to message to the public  Officials in London did alert the C D C  to the Royal Brompton

TimesComing to AmericaIn the United States  587 cases of people having contracted C  auris have been reported  concentrated with 309 in New York  104 in New Jersey and 144 in Illinois  according to the C D C The symptoms   fever  aches and fatigue   are seemingly ordinary  but when a person gets infected  particularly someone already unhealthy  such commonplace symptoms can be fatal The earliest known case in the United States involved a woman who arrived at a New York hospital on May 6  2013  seeking care for respiratory failure  She was 61 and from the United Arab Emirates  and she died a week later  after testing positive for the fungus  At the time  the hospital hadn t thought much of it  but three years later  it sent the case to the C D C  after reading the agency s June 2016

Asian one most common here  It killed a 56 year old American woman who had traveled to India in March 2017 for elective abdominal surgery  contracted C  auris and was airlifted back to a hospital in Connecticut that officials will not identify  She was later transferred to a Texas hospital  where she died The germ has spread into long term care facilities  In Chicago  50 percent of the residents at some nursing homes have tested positive for it  the C D C  has reported  The fungus can grow on intravenous lines and ventilators Workers who care for patients infected with C  auris worry for their own safety  Dr  Matthew McCarthy  who has treated several C  auris patients at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York  described experiencing an unusual fear when treating a 30 year old man  I found myself not wanting to touch the guy   he said   I didn t want to take it from the guy and bring it to someone else   He did his job and thoroughly examined the patient  but said   There was an overwhelming feeling of being terrified of accidentally picking it up on a sock or tie or gown  ImageDr  Tom Chiller  head of the fungal branch at the C D C   It is a creature from the black lagoon   he said of C  auris CreditMelissa Golden for The New York TimesThe role of pesticides As the C D C  works to limit the spread of drug resistant C  auris  its investigators have been trying to answer the vexing question  Where in the world did it come from The first time doctors encountered C  auris was in the ear of a woman in Japan in 2009  auris is Latin for ear   It seemed innocuous at the time  a cousin of common  easily treated fungal infections Three years later  it appeared in an unusual test result in the lab of Dr  Jacques Meis  a microbiologist in Nijmegen  the Netherlands  who was analyzing a bloodstream infection in 18 patients from four hospitals in India  Soon  new clusters of C  auris seemed to emerge with each passing month in different parts of the world The C D C  investigators theorized that C  auris started in Asia and spread across the globe  But when the agency compared the entire genome of auris samples from India and Pakistan  Venezuela  South Africa and Japan  it found that its origin was not a single place  and there was not a single auris strain The genome sequencing showed that there were four distinctive versions of the fungus  with differences so profound that they suggested that these strains had diverged thousands of years ago and emerged as resistant pathogens from harmless environmental strains in four different places at the same time  Somehow  it made a jump almost seemingly simultaneously  and seemed to spread and it is drug resistant  which is really mind boggling   Dr  Vallabhaneni said ImageThe C D C  in miniature  In the United States  two million people contract resistant infections each year  and 23 000 die from them  according to the official C D C  estimate CreditMelissa Golden for The New York TimesThere are different theories as to what happened with C  auris  Dr  Meis  the Dutch researcher  said he believed that drug resistant fungi were developing thanks to heavy use of fungicides on crops Dr  Meis became intrigued by resistant fungi when he heard about the case of a 63 year old patient in the Netherlands who died in 2005 from a fungus called Aspergillus  It proved resistant to a front line antifungal treatment called itraconazole  That drug is a virtual copy of the azole pesticides that are used to dust crops the world over and account for more than one third of all fungicide sales A 2013 paper in Plos Pathogens said that it appeared to be no coincidence that drug resistant Aspergillus was showing up in the environment where the azole fungicides were used  The fungus appeared in 12 percent of Dutch soil samples  for example  but also in  flower beds  compost  leaves  plant seeds  soil samples of tea gardens  paddy fields  hospital surroundings  and aerial samples of hospitals  Dr  Meis visited the C D C  last summer to share research and theorize that the same thing is happening with C  auris  which is also found in the soil  Azoles have created an environment so hostile that the fungi are evolving  with resistant strains surviving This is similar to concerns that resistant bacteria are growing because of excessive use of antibiotics in livestock for health and growth promotion  As with antibiotics in farm animals  azoles are used widely on crops  On everything   potatoes  beans  wheat  anything you can think of  tomatoes  onions   said Dr  Rhodes  the infectious disease specialist who worked on the London outbreak   We are driving this with the use of antifungicides on crops  Dr  Chiller theorizes that C  auris may have benefited from the heavy use of fungicides  His idea is that C  auris actually has existed for thousands of years  hidden in the world s crevices  a not particularly aggressive bug  But as azoles began destroying more prevalent fungi  an opportunity arrived for C  auris to enter the breach  a germ that had the ability to readily resist fungicides now suitable for a world in which fungi less able to resist are under attack The mystery of C  auris s emergence remains unsolved  and its origin seems  for the moment  to be less important than stopping its spread ImageAn empty hospital bed at Mount Sinai CreditHilary Swift for The New York TimesResistance and denialFor now  the uncertainty around C  auris has led to a climate of fear  and sometimes denial Last spring  Jasmine Cutler  29  went to visit her 72 year old father at a hospital in New York City  where he had been admitted because of complications from a surgery the previous month When she arrived at his room  she discovered that he had been sitting for at least an hour in a recliner  in his own feces  because no one had come when he had called for help to use the bathroom  Ms  Cutler said it became clear to her that the staff was afraid to touch him because a test had shown that he was carrying C  auris  I saw doctors and nurses looking in the window of his room   she said   My father s not a guinea pig  You re not going to treat him like a freak at a show  He was eventually discharged and told he no longer carried the fungus  But he declined to be named  saying he feared being associated with the frightening infection Ana Harrero contributed

If you haven t filed your tax return yet  time is getting short  But you aren t alone in procrastinating The number of individual tax returns received by March 29 was down more than 1 percent from the same time last year  the Internal Revenue Service reported  and the size of the average refund declined by 0 7 percent  to  2 873 The decline may be because taxpayers are still trying to understand the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017  which made sweeping changes in tax forms  brackets  rates and deductions  This is the most complicated tax season ever   said Ross A  Riskin  a certified public accountant and an assistant professor of taxation with the American College of Financial Services The I R S  is estimating that it will receive more than 14 6 million extension requests this year  or nearly one in 10 filers  That would be the largest number of requests ever received in a year  an I R S  spokesman  Eric Smith  said Many filers paid less federal income tax over all in 2018 because of the new law  Mr  Riskin said  But because of revisions to tax withholding tables  some people had less tax withheld from their paychecks over the course of last year  That meant they received the benefit incrementally  in slightly higher paychecks  rather than in a juicy  lump sum refund Some filers in high tax states  meanwhile  have found they owe more than they expected because of new limits on deductions for state and local taxes   the so called SALT cap   including for real estate taxes  In personal finance  The new Equifax boss wants the credit bureau to do better  We had some questions  Some people may have heard reports about smaller refunds or of filers having to write checks for balances due  and postponed their own filing  said Cindy Hockenberry  director of tax research and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals But now  the filing deadline is fast approaching  Tax Day is April 15 for people in most parts of the country  though it s April 17 in Maine and Massachusetts  Because of the changes in the federal tax law  people who haven t filed yet may want to hire a professional preparer unless they have a simple return  said Mark Luscombe  principal federal tax analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax   Accounting  But as the deadline approaches  Mr  Luscombe cautioned  some tax advisers may suggest that filers opt for an extension so they can devote adequate time to completing the return Filers can obtain an automatic extension  which gives another six months to file  by submitting Form 4868 But an extension to file doesn t include an extension to pay  You must make your best estimate of what you owe and pay by the April deadline or face interest costs and penalties There s always the option of using a do it yourself software program  including those available for income eligible filers through the federal government s  free file  program  The latest I R S  statistics show self prepared returns up about 2 percent over last year Ms  Hockenberry said one reason for the increase in self prepared returns is that the standard deduction has doubled under the new tax law  meaning that fewer people are seeking advice about itemizing  Also  she said  many consumer tax software programs now offer filers the option of speaking with a professional for an extra fee TurboTax  for instance  offers TurboTax Live  which lets users ask questions of a C P A  or an enrolled agent Consumer Reports advised caution this year  however  after one of its reporters tried four online commercial tax products and encountered flaws like outdated information and incomplete advice  The nonprofit group said it could not endorse any of the major D I Y  products  without some reservation   and concluded that it  may be a better option  to use a professional this year  especially if you have a complex return or own a business The I R S  has a directory of tax professionals  including certified public accountants  lawyers and enrolled agents  who are federally licensed tax preparers Fees for professional tax preparation vary widely  by location and by the complexity of the return  The National Association of Tax Professionals found in its 2018 fee study that the average cost for an individual return was about  217 People who want in person assistance but can t afford to pay a professional may be able to find free local help through programs like AARP Foundation Tax Aide and the federal government s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program Last year  the AARP program helped with the filing of more than 2 5 million returns Tax Aide sites offer no cost free return preparation from I R S  certified volunteers who specialize in helping older and low  to moderate income filers  Some locations accept walk ins but others require an appointment  so it s best to check by calling after you find a location online  said Lynnette Lee Villanueva  vice president of AARP Foundation Tax Aide If you re planning on calling the I R S  help line with questions  the I R S  notes that wait times will only increase as the deadline approaches  Call volume is highest early in the week  so wait times are likely to be especially long on April 15 because it falls on a Monday  said Mr  Smith  the agency spokesman People tracking refunds  he said  are encouraged to use the I R S  s  Where s my refund   tool  available online or via a mobile app Here are some questions and answers about tax filing season What if my tax refund was smaller than I expected A small refund is generally a good thing because it means you accurately estimated the amount of tax you were supposed to pay during the year  But if you prefer to use a refund as a sort of forced savings plan  you can have more money withheld from your paycheck during the year by filing an adjusted Form W 4 with your employer  The fewer  allowances  you claim on the form  the more tax is withheld from your paycheck  potentially leading to a bigger refund next spring The I R S  offers an online withholding calculator as part of its  paycheck checkup  tool and tax software programs like TurboTax offer free tools as well What if I underpaid my taxes in 2018 Because of the change in the withholding tables  the I R S  is giving a break to many taxpayers who underpaid their taxes last year  Typically  you ll owe a penalty if you paid less than 90 percent of the tax owed  either through paycheck withholding or by making quarterly estimated tax payments  But last month  the agency said it would reduce the threshold to 80 percent  down from the 85 percent announced in January  The change applies just to the 2018 tax year If you want to have more tax withheld to avoid writing a check next year  you should do so soon since more than three months of 2019 paychecks have already been issued  Ms  Hockenberry of the tax professionals association said Is there any way to reduce my 2018 taxes at this point There are still a few options left to help reduce your tax bill for 2018  like contributing to an individual retirement account  Ms  Hockenberry said  Contributions to traditional I R A s may be deductible  depending on your income  and can be made for the 2018 tax year until the April filing deadline  Fidelity Investments said that last year  about a third of contributions to its I R A s were made in the three weeks before the tax deadline You may also contribute for 2018 to a health savings account until the tax filing deadline  The accounts  however  are available only to people with specific high deductible health insurance plans  so make sure your plan qualifies

ABUJA   Nigeria has suspended mining in the restive northwestern state of Zamfara  a presidential aide and the police chief said on Sunday  amid concerns that illegal miners were connected to a surge in banditry  The suspension underscores the breakdown of security in a part of the country where the military  police and state security forces have been deployed in recent weeks to tackle criminal gangs behind a spate of killings and kidnappings   The federal government has ordered the suspension of all mining activities in Zamfara State with immediate effect   said presidential aide Bashir Ahmed in a tweet  Security forces in Nigeria  which has Africa s biggest economy and whose security is central to regional stability  are already stretched tackling a decade long Islamist insurgency in the northeast and communal fighting between farmers and herders over dwindling land Nigeria has largely untapped deposits of minerals including gold  tin and zinc  Some 80 percent of mining in Nigeria is carried out on an artisanal basis and gold in Zamfara is routinely smuggled out of the country illegally to neighboring Niger and Togo A statement issued by Nigeria s police chief said the move followed intelligence reports that  clearly established a strong and glaring nexus between the activities of armed bandits and illicit miners   Zamfara is the state worst hit by the uptick of violence that has killed dozens of people since the start of the year  The surge began last year  when it prompted the deployment of the air force and 1 000 security personnel to the state  In the last few weeks joint operations between security agencies have been launched focusing on the northwestern states of Zamfara  Kaduna and Katsina  as well as the western states of Kogi  and Niger  Banditry has plagued the northwest for years  particularly around Zamfara state and neighboring Kaduna state  although the recent spate of kidnappings and killings in the northwest has put the region in the public eye  President Muhammadu Buhari  a retired general and former military ruler  secured a second term in February  He partly campaigned on a vow to improve security    Reporting by Felix Onuah and Alexis Akwagyiram in Lagos  Editing by Catherine Evans  

TEL AVIV   It was a referendum on him and he nailed it  Nobody can take that away from Benjamin Netanyahu  This summer  in his fifth term  he will surpass David Ben Gurion as the longest serving Israeli prime minister  Enough said His victory contains a warning for any Democrat still imagining that the 2020 election will bring an easy victory over Donald Trump  The Netanyahu playbook will be President Trump s next year  Gather nationalist and religious voters in your camp  add in a strong economy  dose with fear  sprinkle with strongman appeal  inject a dash of racism and victory is yours   whatever indictments are looming It s not that this could happen  It will happen  absent some decisive factor to upend the logic of it  Netanyahu is savvier than Trump  but they share a shrewd assessment of how to control and manipulate the politics of spectacle  as well as a fierce determination to stay out of jail  They campaign ugly Exactly a century ago  Ben Gurion said   Everyone sees the difficulty of relations between Jews and Arabs  but not everyone sees there is no solution to that question   Netanyahu s solution is by now clear  He is a true believer in Greater Israel and will not give up one inch of the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River  There will be no Palestinian state on his watch  Period Many Israelis  weary of the chimera of a two state peace  thank him for that   as they thank him for a strong economy  Trump s support and a sense of stability  Netanyahu is a formidable politician adept in using hate and fear  the strongest currency in contemporary politics His victory was personal but it was also structural  Israel now has a structural majority of the right  This will almost certainly enable Netanyahu to form a right wing government  even though his Likud party appeared tied with the Blue and White party of his upstart challenger  Benny Gantz  each winning 35 seats The Gantz performance was remarkable  It demonstrated the deep disquiet of liberal Israel over Netanyahu the King  But in the end Gantz took more votes from the left   the Labor Party and Meretz   than from the right  As Avi Scharf  editor of the English edition of the liberal daily Haaretz  put it to me   Israel s founding left is totally obliterated  The structural majority of the right is composed of the ultra Orthodox  the settler movement  Mizrahi Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent  nationalists of various stripes and Russian immigrants like the one who recently told my friend Shlomo Avineri  a political scientist   I don t want to live under Putin  but I want my leader to be like Putin  Netanyahu never passes up a photo op with Vladimir Putin  any more than he does with Trump   A different league   one of his campaign ads said  Netanyahu was able to project presence among the superpowers  His base loved it  Trump s base loves him  unswervingly  The president is not structurally assured of victory in 2020  but he is structurally within sight of it That Netanyahu is facing indictment on bribery and other charges proved no obstacle to Likud increasing its seats to 35 from 30 in 2015  In the near term  Israeli politics   and its democracy   will hinge on Netanyahu s attempts to secure immunity from prosecution while in office  He may make acquiescence to such legislation a condition for coalition partners joining the government  It will not be pretty  We could see a coup d tat against democracy  something very dangerous   Tom Segev  a prominent historian  told me For now  Israelis seem prepared to shrug  The not with a bang but a whimper conclusion to the Mueller report reinforced a feeling that the cloud of corruption that has hung around Netanyahu for years should not be taken as proof of it In the longer term  Israeli politics will turn to the question of annexation  At the last minute  to shore up the right  Netanyahu promised to start annexing the West Bank if he won another term  The United Right and other extreme parties will not let him forget it Still  there is no reason to take Netanyahu at his word  He made himself kosher with the Obama administration through his Bar Ilan speech of a decade ago supporting a Palestinian state  only to do nothing to favor one and everything to block one Annexation could see the same fate because it s problematic  Netanyahu is happiest in the gray zone where Israel controls millions of Palestinians without having to confront the question of whether they vote or are granted Israeli citizenship  He does not want to jeopardize good relations with Egypt and the Saudis  He s quite happy with a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that once saw itself in the role of leading the way to a Palestinian state but has become the feeble enabler of Israel s gray zone domination Netanyahu s annexation decision may hinge in the end on the long incubated Trump plan for Israel Palestine  It s said to exist  Maybe it really does  God knows  The fact that strong pushback from the United States on partial annexation is no longer assured says it all  The rightist nationalist wave has yet to crest The Times is committed to publishing a

MADRID   The administration of President Jair Bolsonaro is considering a dramatic change in the council that oversees Brazil s environmental policy  replacing a broad based panel of independent voices with a small group of political appointees  according to documents obtained by The Associated Press Activists say they fear the move  which reflects Bolsonaro s oft stated skepticism about environmental organizations  could lead to more deforestation and less oversight in the nation that holds about 60  of the vast Amazon rainforest  which scientists see as crucial for efforts to slow global warming and for the world climate systems A policy roadmap drafted by Bolsonaro s transition team before he took office Jan  1 proposes a decree creating a  government council  to replace Brazil s National Council of the Environment  which has almost 100 members  including representatives of independent environmental and business groups  The new body would consist of five presidential appointees plus Environment Minister Ricardo Salles  who is one of the authors of the plan The documents  first published by the Brazilian Climate Observatory environmental group  were obtained and verified by the AP Brazil s Environment Ministry did not reply to a request for comment Part of the transition plan has already come into force  The country s forestry service  aimed at promoting  knowledge  sustainable use and widening of forestry coverage   was transferred to the Agriculture Ministry on Bolsonaro s second day in office  On the same day  the Agriculture Ministry was given the power to determine the limits of indigenous lands  rather than Brazil s official indigenous rights agency As a congressman and candidate  Bolsonaro often questioned the reality of climate change and cast environmental groups as foreign influenced meddlers restraining Brazil s economic growth by holding back mining and agriculture   stances that resemble those of U S  President Donald Trump  who before taking office described the U S  Environmental Protection Agency as a  disgrace  that largely should be dismantled The authors of Bolsonaro s transition plan say the current Environment Council  known as CONAMA  is a  confusing  body that  acts emotionally  without due technique  being subjected to ideological interference  In another transition team document  lawyer Antonio Fernando Pinheiro Pedro argues that CONAMA s decisions have led to  the emission of norms and standards that are far from reality  In an interview shortly after his election  Bolsonaro complained that it could sometimes take a decade to get an environmental license   That will not continue   he said While officials haven t yet formally proposed the smaller council  there has already been increased friction over CONAMA  Security guards blocked alternate members of the council from joining the main meeting at a March 20 session in the capital of Brasilia  breaking a long tradition of wide open debate in Brazil s top environmental council Carlos Rittl  executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory  which includes several nonprofit groups  said he believes that chaotic meeting was  more evidence that the plan  for a smaller council  is indeed being implemented   Deforestation ended 2018 on the rise  It is on the rise in 2019  but we haven t heard a word from the minister about that  We have heard about limiting the access to civil society so we can t have a fair discussion   Rittl said Former Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero speculated the new administration may have delayed creating the new council due to public anger over the collapse of a mine dam near the city of Brumadinho in January that killed at least 223 people  with 70 still missing Ricupero noted that Bolsonaro s chief of staff suggested closing the environmental ministry during the campaign  but said that the powerful agribusiness lobby is afraid such a move would damage trade and has prevented any such move  Then Brumadinho showed that our problem is not excessive care in environmental licensing   it is the lack of it   Ricupero said He added that hopes Bolsonaro would engage with environmentalists have not come to pass Bolsonaro recently defended his environmental ideas at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  saying that Brazil  is the country that most preserves the environment  and that  those that criticize us actually have a lot to learn from us  The Bolsonaro transition plan also suggested closing the federal agency that oversees conservation zones such as national parks and biological reserves and issues fines for violation of environmental laws there  Many of those penalties are never paid  but several Brazilian agribusiness leaders have complained about them over the years Pinheiro Pedro  the transition team lawyer  wrote that the agency should be folded into the Environment Institute  which enforces other environmental legislation and aims to promote the sustainable the use of natural resources  He said the two have  the same objective  and streamlining environmental governance is key to  avoid international interference  Rittl  of the Brazilian Climate Observatory  said he believes that change would reduce oversight in key areas by diluting the focus of regulators Environmentalists also took umbrage at the language used in the transition documents  though the tone echoes Bolsonaro s own pronouncements The plan says NGOs involved in climate change discussions are  uncontrollable organisms  that need to be stopped so the system is  closer to ministerial control   It also contends Brazil s environmental governance is crafted to give jobs to political appointees  describing that as  a risk to national sovereignty  Emilio Bruna  a tropical ecologist focused on the Amazon who is based at the University of Florida  said the transition plan shows the  worst fears  about Bolsonaro s presidency  are starting to come true   Scientists are not only concerned about the government not creating new protected areas  but also the downgrading of existing protections in the rainforest   he said   There was already a culture of impunity  but now it s being reinforced     Associated Press science writer Christina Larson and EPA reporter Ellen Knickmayer in Washington contributed to this report  

DINARD  France   International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney will help lead a British Canadian push to defend journalists from attacks and restrictions around the world  ministers said on Friday She was named co chair of a legal panel that will draw up proposals to counter laws that hinder reporters  Those with a pen in their hand should not feel a noose around their neck   the British Lebanese barrister told an event on the issue at a G7 meeting of foreign ministers in France More than 60 journalists were killed in 2018 according to Reporters Without Borders  more than half of them targeted deliberately  with the murder of Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi in particular drawing international condemnation Britain s foreign minister  Jeremy Hunt  told the event that democratic states needed to make it  an international taboo of the highest order  to murder  arrest or detain journalists for doing their jobs Hunt  who appeared alongside his Canadian counterpart Chrystia Freeland  also named Clooney as his special envoy on media freedom  When journalists are not able to question those in authority  hold them to account  freely and with impunity then you start a slippery slope to the closed societies that none of us want to see growing in influence   he said Last year  Clooney joined the legal team representing two Reuters journalists who were convicted under Myanmar s official secrets act and sentenced to seven years in prison On Friday  she said only one in ten countries enjoyed a free press The legal panel  she added  could propose reforms of national laws that run counter to international standards  such as blasphemy legislation  and encourage governments to give journalists more consular protection abroad  The proposals will not be legally binding While Khashoggi s death sparked global outrage  human rights groups criticized the meek response of many Western capitals  many of which cited the importance of trade relations for not adopting a tougher stance with Saudi Arabia    Additional reporting by John Irish and by Rachel Cordery in London  Editing by John Irish and Andrew Heavens  

LONDON   When executives from Saudi Aramco  the giant oil company in Saudi Arabia  pitched prospective investors on the company s first international bond offering last week  they were shown the red carpet everywhere In central London  investors crowded into a room at the upscale Corinthia Hotel to hear details of the deal  In New York  Jamie Dimon  the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase  made a rare appearance to talk up the bond sale All signs are that investors are eager for any piece of Aramco they can get   despite concerns about how closely its fortunes are tied to its owner  the government of Saudi Arabia  and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Prince Mohammed s connection to the murder of a prominent journalist and dissident  Jamal Khashoggi  caused a storm among politicians and members of the media  Yet demand for Aramco bonds has topped  60 billion  said a person briefed on the matter who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the deal   far surpassing the company s initial goal of selling about  10 billion worth of debt  The company s bankers are expected to set the price of its bonds on Tuesday The bond sale will help finance Aramco s  69 billion purchase of another Saudi state controlled company  the petrochemical maker Saudi Basic Industries Corporation  The deal will end up raising cash for the country s sovereign wealth fund  which owns a majority stake in Sabic  as the chemical company is known ImageConcerns about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman s level of intervention in the company s affairs persist  but haven t dampened investor enthusiasm CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesSince at least 2016  Prince Mohammed  the kingdom s de facto ruler  has had big plans for Aramco  the oil rich country s economic jewel  He wants huge sums to invest in Western technology companies like Uber  part of his effort to wean the Saudi economy off its dependence on oil Yet Saudi Arabia s oil wealth is the only realistic source for financing this transition When his initial plan to take Aramco public ran into difficulties last year  Prince Mohammed turned to the Sabic deal as an alternative way to raise money  But Aramco officials have indicated the public offering was only postponed  not canceled  and could still take place If so  the recent meetings with investors may prove a kind of dress rehearsal  An intense  yearslong preparation for the I P O  helped make the bond sale possible  At one point  around 60 bankers and other professionals occupied a floor at Aramco s headquarters in Dhahran  preparing the oil giant s raw numbers for reports that could be shown to potential investors and poring over still unresolved issues including where to list the company  according to an adviser who worked on the deal The bond sale is being closely watched not least because of the cloud that has lingered over Saudi Arabia since the murder of Mr  Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year  Intelligence agencies in the United States and other Western countries have concluded that the crown prince ordered the killing But that controversy has not scared off major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley  which are leading the offering  and other banks in supporting roles  JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment  To the extent that Mohammed bin Salman has become persona non grata in the West doesn t make Saudi Arabia persona non grata   said Chas W  Freeman Jr   a former United States ambassador to Riyadh In early April  Aramco released a prospectus showing it was the world s most profitable company in 2018  with  111 billion in net income and very little debt  Analysts at Moody s Investors Service gave the company a strong credit rating of A1  the same as the Saudi government  Had Aramco been an independent company  it would have earned a higher rating  Moody s said ImageAn employee of Standard Oil played golf in Jidda in an image taken in the early 1940s  Aramco was founded by Standard Oil of California CreditBob Landry The Life Picture Collection  via Getty ImagesThat has made the bond offering a hot ticket for investors  The more someone doesn t need money  the more we want to give it to them   Reza Karim  an assistant fund manager for emerging market debt at Jupiter Asset Management  said in an interview Some analysts said that Aramco s history   it was founded by Standard Oil of California   and reputation as a Western style business in the staunchly conservative kingdom made it attractive to international investors Its enclaves in the eastern part of the country   where American geologists first discovered oil in the 1930s   resemble American suburbs  with baseball diamonds  movie theaters and themed restaurants  In these walled off areas  women go without head coverings and hold serious jobs in areas like computer science and geology at the company  A lot of people and a lot of institutions have a very favorable view of the Aramco leadership   Helima Croft  an analyst at RBC Capital Markets  said   They look on it as a center of enlightenment and progress in Saudi Arabia  Yet there is a worry   both inside and outside the company   that the Sabic transaction  and an eventual I P O   could foreshadow further interference by the crown prince and his associates  For much of the company s history  the royal family had largely left Aramco s operations to a succession of professional managers  But the danger of royal intervention has risen  analysts say  because the crown prince and his father  King Salman  are no longer ruling the country by consensus as their predecessors did Though the royals have traditionally been wary of wrecking Saudi Arabia s profit machine  the current Saudi leaders seem willing to tinker with Aramco  according to Jim Krane  a Persian Gulf expert at Rice University s Baker Institute for Public Policy  I see this as a process of realigning Aramco and the kingdom to cope with an uncertain future for oil  rather than a political raid on the kingdom s cash cow   he said

WASHINGTON   U S  Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday a Democratic bid to restore the 2015 net neutrality rules is  dead on arrival in the Senate  The U S  House of Representatives on Tuesday debated a Democratic plan to reinstate the Obama era rules and overturn a December 2017 decision by the Federal Communications Commission to reverse the rules and hand sweeping authority to internet providers to recast how Americans access information Late Tuesday  the House opted to delay a vote on the measure and a series of amendments until Wednesday because of an unrelated issue over a separate budget measure The net neutrality bill mirrors an effort last year to reverse the FCC s order  approved on a 3 2 vote  that repealed rules barring providers from blocking or slowing internet content or offering paid  fast lanes  The reversal of net neutrality rules was a win for internet providers such as Comcast Corp  AT T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc  but was opposed by companies like Facebook Inc  Amazon com Inc and Alphabet Inc On Monday  the White House told Congress that if the bill were approved  President Donald Trump s advisers would recommend he veto it  The White House  strongly opposes  the measure that would  return to the heavy handed regulatory approach of the previous administration   it said in a statement The bill would repeal the order introduced by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  bar the FCC from reinstating it or a substantially similar order and reinstate the 2015 net neutrality order  The House will also consider a series of amendments Representative Mike Doyle  a Democrat  said Tuesday the bill  puts a cop on the beat to make sure our internet service providers aren t acting in an unjust  unreasonable or discriminatory way  Republicans called a bid to restore internet protections akin to a  government takeover of the internet  and said it would open the door to the FCC eventually setting internet rates or imposing new taxes on internet service similar to levies on cable or telephone service  Democrats say polls show Americans overwhelmingly back net neutrality and want protections that providers will not interfere with their internet access   Reporting by David Shepardson  Additional reporting by Amanda Becker  Editing by Dan Grebler and Lisa Shumaker

One evening in 1996  as the Yankees clinched their first World Series in 18 years  Donald J  Trump was presiding over a masquerade ball at his sprawling Westchester County estate Mr  Trump intended to convert the home  a limestone mansion called Seven Springs  into a golf club  and he had recruited one of the county s best connected lawyers to help him do it  Albert J  Pirro Jr  The costume party was a lavish fund raiser for Mr  Pirro s wife  the Westchester district attorney  who greeted dozens of masked guests in her own striking get up Jeanine F  Pirro had dressed as Queen Isabella of Spain  I was at the ballgame with George Steinbrenner  and it was great  just great   Mr  Trump told an attendee at the time   But this is just great  too  At the time  Ms  Pirro seemed destined for political stardom  Her fiery style had earned her a spot on the national TV circuit as a pundit on the O  J  Simpson case  The New Yorker was preparing a fawning profile  complete with Helmut Newton portrait  A run for lieutenant governor was in the offing  a United States Senate seat not out of the question But fates diverged for the luminaries in the room that night  Mr  Trump never got that golf course  though he eventually found success in bigger endeavors  Mr  Pirro would go to jail for tax evasion  tailed by rumors about Mafia ties and revelations that he fathered a child out of wedlock And Ms  Pirro fell to earth  Though she was never charged  her husband s crimes damaged her political hopes  a Senate run in 2005 collapsed after she stumbled over her announcement speech  Later  she admitted to trying to wiretap Mr  Pirro s yacht to catch him in an affair   The couple are now divorced   She scratched out a second act in daytime TV  hosting a low rated courtroom show with C list guests like Joey Buttafuoco  Another series   You the Jury   was canceled after two episodes And yet Ms  Pirro  67  is in the midst of a late in life renaissance   as improbable and as polarizing as any of the twists in her unusual career Banished to a Siberia time slot   Saturday at 9 p m    Ms  Pirro has used an unrelenting defense of President Trump to put her weekly Fox News show   Justice With Judge Jeanine   at the heart of the national political conversation Stymied in her hopes for a Senate seat  she now has a direct line to the president  Her thunderous monologues calling for the imprisonment of federal prosecutors  or accusing the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  of treason  attract a devoted audience   not least in the West Wing  where Mr  Trump  a regular viewer  urges his millions of Twitter followers to tune in  She was in the right place at the right time with the right approach  and she s taken advantage of it   said Rudolph W  Giuliani  the president s lawyer and a frequent guest  who shared a table with Ms  Pirro at Mr  Trump s 2005 wedding to Melania Knauss ImageMs  Pirro at Trump Tower in 2017  She has offered President Trump unflagging support CreditHilary Swift for The New York TimesDespite the Saturday time slot  Ms  Pirro averages an audience of more than two million viewers an episode  That s more than the average number of people who watch the MSNBC host Chris Hayes on weeknights   Saturday Night Live  parodied her on  Weekend Update  last month The president has taken notice   I like being on air with your beautiful ratings   Mr  Trump told Ms  Pirro when he called in for a chummy interview in October  one of three he has granted the host If  Meet the Press  is aimed at the Washington establishment   Justice With Judge Jeanine  is red meat for the Make America Great Again set   Judge Pirro has understood the MAGA movement since Day 1   said Corey Lewandowski  Mr  Trump s former campaign manager Her reputation among pro Trump conservatives has only grown since March  when she was suspended by Fox News after questioning the patriotism of Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota  asking on air if the Muslim lawmaker s religious beliefs undermined her loyalty to the United States  The remark prompted protests at Fox headquarters and a rare intramural rebuke by the network  which renounced her comments Ms  Pirro has a history of remarks deemed Islamophobic  declaring in 2015 that  we need to kill them  the radical Muslim terrorists hellbent on killing us   But if the suspension was meant as punishment  it served only to supercharge her support from Mr  Trump  who tweeted a rallying cry   Bring back  JudgeJeanine Pirro  Ms  Pirro never apologized  When she made her return on March 30  her show drew 2 56 million viewers  beating the competition on ABC and CBS For those who view Ms  Pirro as a camera hungry opportunist   an accusation that has followed her from her days as a local prosecutor  when she sought out appearances with national TV hosts like Geraldo Rivera   her recent success is evidence of a willingness to bend principles for fame  I couldn t imagine many of those comments coming from the person I knew   said Mayo Bartlett  a lawyer who served under Ms  Pirro as an assistant district attorney   After 9 11  there were a lot of anti Muslim and anti Arab hate crimes  and I had the green light from her to prosecute those cases  We stood with that community when they were really being targeted  A daughter of Lebanese American parents  Ms  Pirro was raised Catholic in blue collar Elmira  N Y  Her mother was born in the United States  but spent much of her childhood in Beirut  where she later met Ms  Pirro s father  a veteran of the United States Navy  after World War II  I learned to fight from my mother   Ms  Pirro wrote in a 2003 memoir   She impressed upon me throughout my childhood that I had to fight for myself  and I had to help those who were not strong enough to fight for themselves  Inspired by  Perry Mason   Ms  Pirro dreamed of becoming a prosecutor  eventually starting one of the country s first domestic violence prosecution units  She was a centrist Republican in deep blue New York  praised by Democrats like Geraldine Ferraro ImageMs  Pirro in 2006 during her campaign for attorney general  a race she lost CreditLouis Lanzano Associated PressNow the Council on American Islamic Relations is calling for Ms  Pirro to be fired  Ibrahim Hooper  the group s communications director  pointed to the arrest last week of a man who threatened to kill Ms  Omar  Ms  Pirro  he said   contributes to the toxic atmosphere in which that kind of violent behavior rises to the surface  Ms  Pirro declined to be interviewed for this article  In response to Mr  Hooper s comment  Fox News referred to its prior statement condemning Ms  Pirro s remarks about Ms  Omar  the Muslim lawmaker On the air  Ms  Pirro has echoed comments from her past  particularly when she attacks the investigation into possible ties between Mr  Trump and Russia  which she recently called  the biggest scandal in American history  bar none  In 2006  under investigation for bugging her husband s boat  she called the inquiry a  witch hunt   During Mr  Pirro s trial in 2001  she denounced prosecutors for  a desperate attempt by them to bring me in this wherever they can  Although Ms  Pirro signed the couple s joint tax return  she maintained she was unaware of her husband s misdeeds  His trial dredged up embarrassing details about the Pirros  spending  like a  1 800 wrought iron pen for Ms  Pirro s two Vietnamese potbellied pigs  Wilbur and Homer Fox News started  Justice With Judge Jeanine  in 2011  The show got a boost in 2015 from  The Jinx   the popular HBO documentary about the real estate scion Robert Durst  As district attorney  Ms  Pirro reopened an investigation into the disappearance of Mr  Durst s first wife  Though she never brought charges  Ms  Pirro later trailed Mr  Durst to his murder trial in Texas and spoke on TV so frequently about the case that she earned a gag order from the judge Ms  Pirro s book  He Killed Them All  Robert Durst and My Quest for Justice  was called a gift to Mr  Durst s defense lawyers by her critics  who faulted her attacks on investigators involved in the case  Relatives of Mr  Durst s slain wife challenged some of the book s claims  And the co author  Lisa DePaulo  sued Ms  Pirro  saying the host forced her to perform menial tasks and tried to include material that she knew to be untrue   The lawsuit was dismissed last month  On Instagram  Ms  Pirro presents a sunnier view of her life  She poses with her standard poodle  Sir Lancelot  and offers glimpses of her Westchester estate  which is outfitted Trump style with imported marble  David Hebert  who served as a spokesman and assistant district attorney under Ms  Pirro  said in an interview that Ms  Pirro rose from setbacks  like a phoenix  and wished that critics knew her as  generous  kind  thoughtful   We did a lot of work in the district attorney s office reaching out to people who are disadvantaged and disenfranchised  to women and children and immigrants   recalled Mr  Hebert  who is now the city manager of Oakland Park  Fla   We made a special point of communicating on a regular basis with people who were not legal that they should not fear law enforcement  On Saturday  Ms  Pirro opened her Fox News program by lamenting the number of immigrants attempting to enter the United States   One hundred thousand in one month  brought in just this past month   she declared   That s what I just said   100 000 in one month  That s bigger than the town that I grew up in  In an interview  Mr  Giuliani was asked if he thought it unseemly for Ms  Pirro  a former prosecutor  to describe Justice Department leaders as potential traitors plotting a coup  Who better to criticize them   Mr  Giuliani replied   than someone who knows how it s done   

Facebook said on Monday that it would ban several far right groups and figures in Canada  including Faith Goldy  who ran for mayor of Toronto last year  as part of the company s widening crackdown on users who espouse white nationalism and other forms of hate The company  which owns Instagram  said the ban would also be applied to the Canadian Nationalist Front and its leader  Kevin Goudreau  the Aryan Strikeforce  the Wolves of Odin  and the Soldiers of Odin and one of its offshoots  the Canadian Infidels In a statement  Facebook said Ms  Goldy  Mr  Goudreau and the banned groups had violated its community standards  which include a prohibition on  organized hate   The individuals and organizations we have banned today violate this policy  and they will no longer be allowed a presence on our services   the company s statement said   Our work against organized hate is ongoing and we will continue to review individuals  pages  groups and content against our community standards  Attempts to reach Ms  Goldy  who has denied being a white supremacist  were unsuccessful on Monday  But she responded to the decision with a mixture of anger and pride on Twitter  I have committed no crime   she wrote on Twitter   My only fault has been loving my country and citing statistics  Later she posted a video of herself lounging in a hot tub overlooking a beach while she mocked Facebook  calling the company  so terrified and so weak that they are going out of their way to ban and to censor little old me who just quotes census data from my kitchen table  Monday s decision comes two weeks after Facebook strengthened its ban on white supremacist content by also prohibiting material billed as white nationalist and white separatist  It previously viewed those three categories as distinct  which drew criticism from civil rights groups Rights groups in Canada began calling for Facebook to bar Ms  Goldy  who had earlier been barred from Airbnb and the fund raising website Patreon  soon after the new policy on white nationalism was announced Evan Balgord  the executive director of the Canadian Anti Hate Network  called her  the most public face of the alt right neo Nazi movement in Canada  and said her removal was  a litmus test  for Facebook s new policy  Here in Canada  when we heard about the policy on white nationalists they were going to put in place  the first thing that came to mind was  If this is going to be meaningful to any extent  then the most obvious person they should remove from the platform is Goldy   Mr  Balgord said But Mr  Balgord said he was disappointed that Facebook had not taken action against other groups  including the Quebec based Atalante Qubec and Fdration des Qubcois de Souche  He said they posed a bigger threat to public safety than the groups banned on Monday  They have group members with criminals records  they are explicitly neo fascist  they march around in the streets  It is neo Nazi stuff   he said   Faith Goldy and these other groups are the tip of the iceberg  Ms  Goldy rose to prominence working for The Rebel Media  a far right Canadian outlet that fired her after she appeared on a podcast hosted by the neo Nazi website The Daily Stormer following the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville  Va  Ms  Goldy used social media to build a political brand based on disdain for multiculturalism  liberalism and nonwhite immigration  which she has described as a threat to the country s  European Canadian identity  She is a proponent of the white genocide conspiracy theory  which contends that liberal elites are plotting to replace white Christians with Jews and nonwhites Her pugilistic style won her some admirers in the United States  including the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and Representative Steve King of Iowa  who endorsed her in the Toronto mayoral race and approvingly described her on Twitter as  pro Western Civilization and a fighter for our values  But her flame throwing persona did not help her in the mayoral race  where she was largely shunned  A television station refused to air her campaign ads  she sued and was ordered to pay the station s legal fees after her lawsuit was dismissed   She was not invited to participate in a September debate  so she jumped onstage and was removed by the police In the end  she garnered just 3 4 percent of the vote in October  Mr  Balgord said she had alienated many on the Canadian far right during the campaign by making overtures toward members of the Jewish Defense League  She was courting their support because they are on the far right  but for a lot of people in the neo Nazi movement that is a line you can t cross   he said

countries are those assessed to have a high risk of both petty and grand corruption  less stable regimes and low availability of public information and business intelligence   Risk Advisory explains   Turkmenistan faces the world s largest corruption challenges  followed by Libya and Somalia  Those three are also the hardest countries in which to obtain reliable data   The industries most affected

administration has proposed imposing tariffs on  11 billion worth of imports from the European Union  to punish the bloc for providing what it says are unfair subsidies to Airbus  the WSJ reports The W T O  says European subsidies to Airbus have harmed the U S   according to the office of the U S  trade representative  an argument that it has made since 2004  The new tariffs   which would affect

runaway success  Despite concerns about the Saudi government  investors are leaping at the chance to invest in the giant oil company  Stanley Reed and Michael de la Merced of the NYT report The order book for the bond sale has surpassed  85 billion  according to Bloomberg  Aramco had initially planned to sell about  10 billion worth of debt to help finance its  69 billion takeover of Sabic  a Saudi chemical producer Aramco executives got the red carpet treatment everywhere they went to hawk the bond offering last week  In London  prospective investors crowded into the upscale Corinthia

dominant   The more someone doesn t need money  the more we want to give it to them   Reza Karim of the fund manager Jupiter Asset Management told the NYT But some analysts worry about Aramco s future  Both the Sabic deal and a push to take Aramco public are being driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  a change to the historical norm in which the Saudi royals basically left the company alone   The crown prince plans to use the proceeds to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil  How investigators could pursue legal action against BoeingAircraft manufacturers like Boeing rarely face a criminal investigation over plane crashes  But Peter Henning of DealBook asks  What federal criminal laws are investigators looking at as they pore over Boeing s records    One statute they may consider is the federal false statements law  The broad statute is used when a company provides information to a federal agency like the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the safety of a plane and makes it a crime to provide an agency with  any materially false  fictitious  or fraudulent statement or representation      The criminal investigation may also examine a statute that  makes it a crime to  knowingly and with intent to defraud  falsify or conceal a material fact about an aircraft part  or to make  any materially fraudulent representation  about a part  It can be applied to conduct outside the United States so long as the company is organized under the laws of this country    And  if there is evidence of fraud and not just false statements  the Justice Department could also pursue a wire fraud case   There is danger in any criminal investigation because even the hint of possible misconduct could have significant consequences as it tries to deal with the fallout from crashes of its best selling aircraft  More  It isn t just anti stall software in the 737 Max jet that may need updating  And investigators still have questions about how the pilots of the doomed

Time finally ran out for Kirstjen Nielsen  President Trump s beleaguered secretary of homeland security The terms of Ms  Nielsen s departure are unclear  She met with the president on Sunday evening to discuss continuing problems at the southern border  At the conclusion of the meeting  Mr  Trump announced on Twitter that Ms  Nielsen  will be leaving her position  and he thanked her for her service  implying he had asked her to step down  Ms  Nielsen issued a formal letter of resignation  saying it was the  right time for me to step aside   Considering the long simmering tensions between the president and Ms  Nielsen  the most surprising thing about her departure may be that it didn t happen months ago She was said to have become increasingly insecure in her job in recent weeks  as Mr  Trump repeatedly railed about the chaos at the border and pushed for dramatic action  including reinstating his policy of separating migrant families at the border and closing legal ports of entry  The president grew impatient with Ms  Nielsen s insistence that federal law and international obligations limited her actions  In recent days  including in the hours immediately after the secretary s resignation  he repeatedly fumed that  our country is full   It s no secret that Mr  Trump had a problem with Ms  Nielsen  whom he considered  weak  on matters of border security  The president and Stephen Miller  his hard line immigration adviser  have long grumbled privately about the secretary s insufficiently brutal approach to the surge in migrant families across the border  Last May  stories surfaced about Mr  Trump berating her in front of the entire cabinet for failing to stop the crossings  In her letter released on Sunday  Ms  Nielsen noted   For more than two years of service beginning during the Presidential Transition  I have worked tirelessly to advance the goals and missions of the Department  This is hardly something to brag about  Whatever the secretary s personal views  and no matter how impossible her job  she was the face of some of the administration s most poorly conceived and gratuitously callous policies  At best  she was complicit and  yes  rather weak Ms  Nielsen s response to her boss s displeasure and abuse was often both morally anemic and strategically incoherent  Last summer  as Republicans and Democrats   and much of the American public   protested the administration s practice of tearing migrant children from their parents at the border  Ms  Nielsen rushed to defend the policy  Scratch that  She insisted  repeatedly and bizarrely  that the administration had no such policy  even as her agency was enforcing and justifying it   We do not have a policy of separating families at the border   she said on Twitter in June   Period   She repeated as much to Congress as recently as March  But the grim repercussions of this nonpolicy are still being felt  Just on Friday  in a court filing  federal officials said it could take up to two years to identify possibly thousands of migrant children taken from their families beginning in July 2017 Not that immigration was the only issue on which Ms  Nielsen floundered  On the critical question of Russia s meddling in the 2016 elections  she was even less lucid  At times  she seemed to support the intelligence community s findings that the Kremlin had been up to no good  Other times  she supported the view that Russia had not favored Mr  Trump in the election  Her every utterance seemed intended to obfuscate rather than to clarify Ms  Nielsen s departure is part of a broader purging in her department  Two days before meeting with the secretary  the president withdrew his nomination for the next head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency  saying that he wanted to go in a  tougher direction   On Monday  the White House confirmed that Randolph Alles  the head of the Secret Service  was on his way out as well  The general counsel for Homeland Security  John Mitnick  and the head of Citizenship and Immigration Services  L  Francis Cissna  are expected to soon follow  For now  Ms  Nielsen s acting replacement will be Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection  This leaves Homeland Security without a top official at either of its critical immigration agencies  It comes as the swell of migrant families across the border pushes the system toward collapse  Possible successors being discussed include Rick Perry  the secretary of energy  and Ken Cuccinelli  the former attorney general of Virginia Whoever takes Ms  Nielsen s place  it seems likely that greater influence will be exerted by Mr  Miller  who inspires and reinforces Mr  Trump s harshest impulses on immigrants and immigration  As the president becomes increasingly agitated about the border situation  Mr  Miller is said to be aggressively pushing to stock the administration with like minded hard liners  In addition to being a longtime critic of Ms  Nielsen  Mr  Miller is thought to have played a role in the withdrawal of the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead ICE and the impending departure of Mr  Cissna  The House speaker  Nancy Pelosi  a Democrat  said of Ms  Nielsen s departure   It is deeply alarming that the Trump administration official who put children in cages is reportedly resigning because she is not extreme enough for the White House s liking  The plan is for Ms  Nielsen to continue through Wednesday to help with an  orderly transition    I share the president s goal of securing the border   she said Monday morning   I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border  If Ms  Nielsen is inclined to perform one last act of public service  she should come clean about the costs of the policies she enforced over the past year and a half  not only to the desperate migrants seeking a better life in the United States  but also to the thousands of employees of her department charged with carrying out an inhumane and ineffective agenda  RelatedKirstjen Nielsen Resigns as Trump s Homeland Security SecretaryApril 7  2019Kevin McAleenan  Top U S  Border Enforcement

JERUSALEM   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re election on Wednesday  with religious rightist parties set to hand him a parliamentary majority and his main challenger conceding defeat With more than 99 percent of votes counted   ballots cast by soldiers at military bases will be tallied over the next two days   Netanyahu s conservative Likud party looked likely to muster enough support to control 65 of the Knesset s 120 seats and be named to head the next coalition government It would be Netanyahu s record fifth term as premier In a televised statement  Yair Lapid  number two in the centrist Blue and White party led by former general Benny Gantz  said   We didn t win in this round  We will make Likud s life hell in the opposition  U S  President Donald Trump  who Netanyahu featured on campaign billboards to highlight their close relationship  phoned to congratulate him on his re election  the Israeli leader said  adding that he thanked his American ally for  tremendous support for Israel  Netanyahu tweeted that Trump had called him from Air Force One  The president was on a flight to Texas Trump told reporters at the White House that Netanyahu s re election improved the chances of peace between Israel and the Palestinians   He s been a great ally and he s a friend  I d like to congratulate him on a well thought out race  A team led by Trump s adviser and son in law Jared Kushner has been working on an Israeli Palestinian peace plan  but it has not disclosed details  Palestinians  angered by what they see as Trump s pro Israel bias  have called it a non starter Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said on Twitter he would begin meeting next week with political parties that won parliamentary seats to hear who they support for prime minister At the sessions  which Rivlin said would be broadcast live  to ensure transparency   he will then pick a party leader to try to form a coalition  giving the candidate 28 days to do so  with a two week extension if needed The close and often vitriolic contest was widely seen in Israel as a referendum on Netanyahu s character and record in the face of corruption allegations  He faces possible indictment in three graft cases  and has denied wrongdoing in all of them Despite that  Netanyahu gained four seats compared to his outgoing coalition government  according to a spreadsheet published by the Central Elections Committee of parties that garnered enough votes to enter the next parliament   It is a night of colossal victory   the 69 year old Netanyahu told cheering supporters in a late night speech at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv after Tuesday s vote   He s a magician   the crowd chanted as fireworks flared and Netanyahu kissed his wife Sara  Earlier that night  Gantz had claimed victory Tel Aviv Stock Exchange main indexes were up nearly 1 percent in late trading on Wednesday  displaying confidence in a veteran prime minister who has overseen a humming economy and blunted various security threats  including from Syria  Netanyahu was now poised to become  in July  the longest serving Israeli prime minister  overtaking the country s founding father  David Ben Gurion  That could be scuppered if criminal charges are filed and force his removal Israel election graphic   https   tmsnrt rs 2D916UvIMMUNITY An indictment decision would follow a review hearing where Netanyahu can be expected to argue he should be spared in the national interest  Some analysts predict he may try to pass a law granting himself immunity  as a sitting leader  from trial During the campaign  the rival parties accused each other of corruption  fostering bigotry and being soft on security Israel s 21 percent Arab minority saw its parties lose seats  Voters blamed divisions between Arab factions which had united in the previous election  disillusionment  and a voting boycott campaign rooted in dismay at the 2018  nation state  law declaring that only Jews have the right of self determination in Israel In Taybeh  an Arab town  Hadash party official Hosam Azem  52  said   Arabs who don t vote  most of them don t do it for ideological reasons   just because they don t think their vote will have an impact   he said During the campaign  Netanyahu sought to tap into Trump s popularity among Israelis  who delighted in his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital in 2017 and transfer of the U S  Embassy to the holy city last May from Tel Aviv  Two weeks before the election  Trump signed a proclamation  with Netanyahu at his side at the White House  recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war In a rare turn during the race toward the Israeli Palestinian conflict  Netanyahu further alarmed Palestinians by pledging to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re elected  Palestinians seek a state there and in the Gaza Strip  with East Jerusalem as its capital This pre election promise from Netanyahu was widely seen as an attempt to draw right wing votes rather than a change of policy  But with Trump s moves on Jerusalem and the Golan  the prime minister may feel emboldened to advocate annexation  Commenting on the election  Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said   Israelis have voted to preserve the status quo  They have said no to peace and yes to the occupation  The last round of U S  brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014  Trump is expected to release his administration s Middle East peace plan after the election  If it includes Israeli concessions to the Palestinians  Netanyahu s probable far right coalition allies will probably object    Additional reporting by Dan Williams  Ron Bousso and Maayan

WASHINGTON   After denying allegations last month that United States airstrikes had killed civilians in Somalia  the American military said on Friday that an April 2018 attack left two people dead The announcement comes after Gen  Thomas D  Waldhauser  the head of Africa Command  ordered a review of all airstrikes conducted in Somalia since 2017 The internal assessment was prompted by pressure from lawmakers and an Amnesty International report released last month that found evidence of  five  strikes in Somalia that had killed more than a dozen civilians The two civilians were killed in an April 2018 airstrike against the Islamist extremist group Shabab near El Buur  a town in central Somalia  In a statement on Friday  Africa Command said it  found credible evidence  of the deaths shortly after the strike  but the casualties were not reported to senior officials until last week The airstrike was not mentioned in the Amnesty report  Because of the reporting error  U S  Africa Command was not informed of the assessment s conclusion   and subsequently the information was not reported to external authorities  such as the host nation and Congress   the military statement said It called the mistake an  isolated occurrence  and said the error was  being addressed  Last month  Africa Command rejected the conclusions in the Amnesty report   Our assessments found that no Africom airstrike resulted in any civilian casualty or injury   it said in a statement It was not the first time Africa Command  based in Germany  had misreported events in conflict zones After an October 2017 ambush in Niger that left four American soldiers dead  Africa Command officials were initially unable to clarify what type of mission an 11 man Green Beret team was undertaking when it was confronted by Islamic State fighters In a statement on Friday  Amnesty called the new findings in Somalia an important  first step  but criticized the American military s reporting process for civilian casualties  We still need new investigation procedures  and all cases of civilian casualties we have documented reinvestigated   the statement said Because of the presence of Shabab fighters in contested areas  Defense Department officials acknowledged that it was difficult to verify civilian casualties from airstrikes  and said they often relied on overhead surveillance and communication intercepts to verify what happened on the ground In recent years  the Shabab has grown and spread across Somalia  The group pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda in 2012  In 2017  President Trump gave the American military more authority to strike Shabab fighters

DINARD  France   When Jeremy Hunt sat down on Friday with rights lawyer Amal Clooney to advocate better protection for journalists  Britain s foreign minister was at pains to stress its enduring importance on the world stage Why  given the chaos of Brexit  should anyone pay attention at a time when the country was struggling to run itself  reporters asked him  Be in no doubt the United Kingdom will continue to play a leading role championing democratic values around the world   Hunt batted back on the sidelines of a G7 summit   That s what we ve always done and that s what we always will do   With Britain anxious to assert its influence and broker new trade deals globally as it prepares to leaves the world s biggest trading bloc  Hunt in October set out plans to expand its diplomatic cadres after years of budget cuts The government in London plans to hire nearly 1 000 more diplomatic staff  open new embassies and boost language training   just as allies and close EU partners France and Germany are creating joint embassies and cutting diplomacy budgets  France and Germany are pretty much on the same wavelength with some small differences  but Britain is dominated by internal questions   said Dominique Moisi  special adviser at the Paris based IFRI think tank  Last week in New York  Hunt s French and German colleagues announced a  Multilateralism Alliance  without him just as Paris handed over the presidency of the United Nations Security Council to Berlin Britain remains a nuclear power and a permanent member of the U N  Security Council  and flexed its muscles on Thursday by calling for an emergency meeting at the Council to discuss an escalating power struggle in Libya  On Friday  French diplomats sought to downplay the idea of London losing clout as it splits from Europe  I don t think they will lose influence  They re having these difficulties and we talk about  Brexit  all the time with them   a senior French diplomat said   I d say the British will be even more active at the G7  NATO and other institutions  We work extremely well with them  have common priorities and they still have same positions as the Europeans  That may be so  but Hunt was set to leave the G7 meeting on Friday night  a day early  after a bilateral meeting with France s Jean Yves Le Drian to discuss    Brexit    Reporting by John Irish  editing by Richard Lough and John Stonestreet  

Felicity Huffman  the Hollywood actress  on Monday laid out a list of failings  Yes  she had paid a college counselor  15 000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter s SAT test  And yes  it had backfired miserably  turning what Ms  Huffman said had been an effort to help her daughter into a betrayal of her  I am ashamed   Ms  Huffman said  announcing that she will plead guilty to a federal crime  part of a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by prosecutors in Boston In the statement issued by Ms  Huffman  she said she wanted to apologize to her family  friends and colleagues  and especially  she said   to the students who work hard every day to get into college  and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly  Ms  Huffman was one of 50 people charged in a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud unveiled last month by federal prosecutors in Boston  On Monday  prosecutors said that 14 people   13 parents and one coach   would plead guilty in the case  Dates for the formal pleas in court had yet to be set Ms  Huffman said that her daughter had been unaware of the cheating   prosecutors say a proctor corrected her test answers after she had left  And Ms  Huffman acknowledged that  in an attempt to assist her daughter  she had ultimately hurt and betrayed her  This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life   she said   My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty  The case prosecutors have laid out centers on a college consultant  William Singer  whom Ms  Huffman and the other parents hired to guide them through the application process  According to prosecutors  Mr  Singer specialized in boosting students  chances through fraud  He bribed test administrators to allow cheating on college entrance exams and bribed college coaches to designate his clients  children as recruits to teams for which they were not actually qualified  Mr  Singer cooperated with prosecutors and has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges A total of 33 parents were charged in the case  Some have made clear they will fight the charges  while others may still be debating what to do  Ms  Huffman is the highest profile parent to admit wrongdoing in the case so far The actress Lori Loughlin and her husband  the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli  were also charged and were not among those who prosecutors said on Monday would plead guilty  The government has said that the couple conspired with Mr  Singer to pay  500 000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits to the women s crew team  even though neither actually rowed crew  Ms  Loughlin has lost some professional opportunities as a result of the charges   most notably  the Hallmark Channel said that it would stop development of shows that feature her It is not clear what impact Ms  Huffman s acknowledgment of guilt will have on her career  She has roles in several coming movies and television series  including playing the prosecutor Linda Fairstein in the mini series  When They See Us  about the so called Central Park Five  five black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of beating and raping a female jogger in Central Park in 1989 Prosecutors said that Ms  Huffman and most of the other parents would plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud  The charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison  but it is unclear how much time  if any  Ms  Huffman and the other parents will receive Their sentences may be affected in part by how much money each is alleged to have paid to Mr  Singer and others as part of the scheme  Ms  Huffman s payment of  15 000 was among the smallest  according to court documents  Ms  Huffman s and the 12 other parents  sentences are also likely to be lighter as a result of their pleading guilty and not making the government go to trial In addition to the parents  prosecutors said on Monday that one of several coaches charged in the case  Michael Center  the former head coach of men s tennis at the University of Texas at Austin  would also plead guilty to the same crime  Prosecutors said that Mr  Singer paid Mr  Center  60 000 in cash and directed  40 000 to the University of Texas tennis program in exchange for Mr  Center designating the son of one of Mr  Singer s clients as a recruit for the tennis team  even though he was not a competitive tennis player and did not ultimately play on the team Two parents  Bruce and Davina Isackson of Hillsborough  Calif   have also agreed to cooperate  prosecutors said  The Isacksons were accused of paying Mr  Singer  600 000 to bribe athletics officials in order to secure their two daughters  admission to U C L A  and U S C  as athletic recruits  and to cheat on their younger daughter s ACT According to the criminal complaint against Ms  Huffman  her husband  William H  Macy  was also involved in the  15 000 payment to Mr  Singer  For reasons that are unclear  Mr  Macy was not charged The number of students who have been punished as a result of the investigation is also growing  Last week  Stanford announced that it had expelled a student who had falsely claimed in her application to be a competitive sailor and had vacated the credits that she had already accumulated  The student s name has not been made public  The former Stanford sailing coach  John Vandemoer  has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering and has acknowledged accepting donations to his sailing program from Mr  Singer in exchange for agreeing to use recruiting slots for Mr  Singer s clients The student whom Stanford expelled  the daughter of a client of Mr  Singer s  was not actually recruited as a sailor  but after she was admitted  Mr  Singer directed  500 000 to Stanford s sailing program  

This article has been updated to reflect news developments  Iran recently observed the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution  but few Iranians beyond the regime s elites celebrated it  The reason for this lack of enthusiasm among ordinary Iranians is no mystery  By any reasonable measure  the revolution has failed to deliver the just and prosperous society that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and other revolutionary leaders promised the Iranian people in 1979 These days  Iran s ruling theocracy is best known for oppression  corruption and mismanagement at home  and ghastly sectarian warfare abroad  Through its Shiite militias  the clerical regime has fueled violence and death in Lebanon  Syria  Iraq  Afghanistan  Yemen  and well beyond  Iran s support for Hezbollah and Hamas has enabled deadly cross border attacks into Israel  This proxy network has allowed Iran to project power well beyond its borders  But a combination of the regime s own financial mismanagement and strong American sanctions is clearly straining Iran s allies  On Monday  in an effort to further raise the pressures on Iran s regime from outside  we designated its Revolutionary Guards Corps a terrorist organization Within Iran s own borders  the  79 revolution is largely a spent force  Mosque attendance has collapsed  with the Revolutionary Guards reporting that even during holy days the faithful stay away  Those seeking to become clerics are few in number  an astonishing condemnation by the religious working class  who traditionally have supplied most of the clerical students and been the backbone of the regime  The country s brain drain and capital flight is constant Today  the revolution belongs primarily to the regime s hypocritical elite  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei s Setad hedge fund  worth tens of billions of dollars  was supposed to be a charity  but it now seizes property from Iranians to sustain the regime  The Revolutionary Guards have become a state within a state  developing a stranglehold on many parts of the economy  Iran s foreign minister speaks to the world on his Twitter account while his regime outlaws Twitter Isn t it time for the Iranian government to leave 40 years of failure and mismanagement behind  Isn t it time to abandon the policies that have kept the people of Iran and the United States apart since 1979 Like the United States  Iran has a vibrant society that wants to be integrated with  not isolated from  other nations  Iranians living in the United States and around the world thrive  But Iranians aren t thriving in their own country The peoples of the United States and Iran should have diplomatic ties  We can foresee a new American Embassy in Tehran issuing visas to tourists  business travelers  and teachers  There should also be direct flights from Tehran to New York or Los Angeles  Before the revolution  America was Iran s second largest trading partner  It should be again  Before the revolution  50 000 Iranian students were studying in American universities  Renewed relations would open the door to tremendous opportunities One day soon  the brightest minds in our countries could work to solve problems for the Iranian people  With open relations between the United States and Iran  together we could reduce Tehran s severe air pollution  build homes that withstand earthquakes in Kermanshah  deliver new medical treatments to veterans of the Iran Iraq war  and restore water to Lake Urmia and the Zayandeh River America stands ready to engage an Iranian government with mutual respect  in pursuit of mutual interests  But in order to make this opening possible   in order to normalize ties and enjoy all the benefits that would follow   the regime must first decide that it wants to be a normal country and not a revolutionary cause A peaceful Iran would augur well for a more peaceful Middle East  But after 40 years many nations have become desensitized to Iran s violence and have lost the ability to imagine a peaceful Iran  Such low expectations do a great disservice to the cause of peace  and especially to the Iranian people  who want a better life It is time for nations to restore basic demands on Iran to behave like a normal  peaceful nation  end the pursuit of nuclear weapons  stop testing ballistic missiles  stop sponsoring terrorist proxies and halt the arbitrary detention of dual citizens  The regime should invest in its own people instead of bankrolling dictators  terrorists  missiles and militias  Thanks to regime subsidies  the average Hezbollah combatant makes two to three times what an Iranian firefighter is paid I have heard diplomats tell me these fundamental changes are unrealistic  Is it somehow more realistic to accept the status quo of Iran exporting sectarian violence at will and creating a Shiite corridor of control  Is it more realistic to watch the regime forcibly try to bend all of Iranian society to conform with tenets of the Islamic Revolution If nations choose not to hold this regime to the same standard as all other nations  we must expect more of the same violence abroad and oppression at home  The Iranian people  including women who are denied even their most basic dignity  are pressuring the regime from inside  They want nations to support them with pressure from outside  That is the best and most probable path to promote peace and to secure the rights and freedoms the Iranian people deserve and were promised in 1979 While it is ultimately up to the Iranian people to determine the direction of their country  the United States  in the spirit of our own freedoms  will support the long ignored voice of the Iranian people  Other nations should join this effort  The next 40 years of Iran s history would be marked then not by repression and fear  but by freedom and fulfillment for the Iranian people Brian H  Hook is a former director of the State Department s Office of Policy Planning The Times is committed to publishing a

MANILA   Bracing for life after Brexit  British hospitals badly need more nurses like Filipino Jobie Escalona  but she twice flunked a mandatory English language test that asked her to write up the merits of immigration and computer education in school The 23 year old Escalona  with three years experience in a private hospital in Manila  lost almost 3 months salary paying nearly  600 to sit the tests Fed up  she was ready to give up on Britain and try Canada  one of several other countries short of nurses  until her father persuaded her to take the test a third time  I was already losing hope   she told Reuters  Finally  in January last year  she passed  having at last got a subject she felt comfortable writing about in the tough written section of the test Asked to compare team and individual sports  Escalona had little trouble   I was able to relate to it because I am a swimmer  But  her tortuous experience doesn t bode well for Britain s chances of adequately filling alarming staffing gaps in its healthcare services With Brexit looming  the supply of nurses from European Union countries has almost dried up  with lots going home  And of the many foreign nationalities employed in Britain  Filipinos made up the largest number  with 10 719  according to a parliamentary paper      As of June last year  16 percent of nursing jobs in hospitals and community health services were held by foreigners   nearly a quarter of whom were Filipinos Britain is already facing a shortage of 40 000 nurses  and once it leaves the EU  if it ever happens  the gap could widen to 50 000  enough to staff more than 40 small to medium sized hospitals  according to a report commissioned by the Cavendish Coalition  a group of health and social care organizations OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE      The staffing crisis is increasing Britain s dependency on hiring from low cost countries like India and the Philippines  where English is widely spoken  yet the language test has proved to be a major obstacle Philippine recruitment firm Louis International Manpower Services has received 1 000 job orders for nurses since 2015  It has only filled a quarter of them    It is not because of the lack of applications  but the English test   said Lilibeth Villas  documentation officer at the firm   We have applicants who were interviewed in 2015  but they have not passed the test yet  Run by the British Council  IDP Education and Cambridge Assessment  the International English Language Test System  IELTS  gauges applicants  ability to speak  listen  read and write  and is used by employers around the world Questions in the academic written section asks candidates to write short essays on diverse subjects  Examples given on the IELTS website included interpreting graphs on changes in radio and television audiences  and gender variations between full and part time students  and discussing the pros and cons of nuclear technology and of regulating car ownership Many candidates clearly find the weighty topics too daunting Febin Cyriac  a business development manager at Envertiz Consultancy  a British healthcare recruitment firm that specializes in bringing in nurses from overseas  started a petition in change org in 2014 that asked UK regulators to relax their IELTS scores  Working as a nurse himself  Cyriac said there are a good number of Indian or Filipino nurses with many years of experience working in Britain  but who are only working as assistant nurses in the National Health Service  NHS  and nursing homes  IELTS is the only barrier for them to practice as a nurse in the UK   said Cyriac  himself a nurse working in Britain Still  the number of Filipinos in the NHS has risen by almost a third in the last two years  according to British government figures Late last year  the pass mark for the writing section was lowered  but there are no immediate plans to make further changes to the test standards  said Andrea Sutcliffe  Nursing and Midwifery Council  NMC  Chief Executive and Registrar  We will continue to carefully monitor the impact of the recent changes  This change is part of a wider review of our overseas registration processes aimed at making it more straightforward and user friendly for people with the right skills and knowledge to join our register in a timely way   Sutcliffe said  There is an Occupational English Test  OET   more suited to medical professionals  that foreign nurses can take  If they pass that test they would still have to sit the IELTS  but they would be eligible for a lower pass mark  The OET is more expensive  however  making it unattractive for low paid nurses A London based recruitment agency visited Manila recently to find nurses for Cambridge University  East Surrey and Royal Cornwall Hospitals  while there have also been recent hiring drives for hospital trusts in Oxford  Hull and Dudley     Germany  Japan  the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are the other countries hiring Filipino nurses  said Bernard Olalia  head of the government s Philippine Overseas Employment Administration          In January alone  Olalia s office received 1 000 job orders for nurses from Saudi Arabia  There are a lot of markets for our Filipino nurses   Olalia said  adding that it was understandable if they took jobs in places where the requirements were easier to fulfill Filipino nurses who were recruited in the 1990s did not have to take the language tests  yet they are still in the NHS and providing good service  said Reydeluz Conferido  who was until recently the labor attache to the Philippines embassy in London While there  Conferido called on British officials to review the requirements placed on overseas nurses to see whether they were serving the correct purpose or creating an artificial barrier  If you really want these nurses  you would do something about your standards   he said   Additional reporting by Andrew MacAskill in LONDON

MADRID   A painting from Peru on loan to the Prado Museum here captures an extraordinary moment in Spain s colonization of the Americas  The anonymous 18th century canvas portrays the wedding of an Inca princess and a conquistador  witnessed by Inca royals in gold regalia  and black cloaked Spanish clerics Behind the apparent harmony lies a tale of defeat and devastation  Yet the union the painting depicts also signals the birth of a mixed culture  whose art is only now receiving its due  This is the first time we re showing a painting from colonial America   Miguel Falomir  the Prado s director  said in a telephone interview  The Prado owns  between 15 and 20  paintings made in Spain s former colonies  he said  but they are kept by the ethnographic Museum of the Americas  They have never been shown alongside European old masters For centuries   we ve considered this art as second class   Mr  Falomir said   That  thank God  has changed   The Marriages of Martn de Loyola to Beatriz usta and Juan de Borja to Lorenza usta de Loyola   an oil painting of the Cusco school of art  was made during the Viceroyalty of Peru  Starting in 1542  the viceroys ruled large stretches of South America in the name of the Spanish king for almost three centuries  until Peru declared independence in 1821 It was a time of feudal exploitation and forced religious conversion  but also of cultural flourishing  Local artists learned to paint in styles popular in Europe  introducing Peruvian landscapes  maize  guinea pigs and parrots into biblical scenes  and blending Renaissance  baroque and Incan symbols The main wedding  in the foreground of the painting  is between the niece of the last Inca rebel  Tupac Amaru  and the Spanish captain who defeated him  Their marriage in 1572 followed her uncle s execution in Cusco  the Spanish occupied Inca capital  The second wedding  tucked in a corner  shows the couple s daughter marrying in Spain almost 40 years later  suggesting a distortion of time and space The painting  which combines European and Amerindian perspectives  is on loan to the Prado from the Pedro de Osma Museum in Lima  Peru  through April 28  Its display in Spain s national museum during the institution s 200th anniversary year suggests an important shift in the way Latin American colonial art is seen in Spain And it has coincided with a call by President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador of Mexico for an apology from the King of Spain and the Pope  for atrocities against indigenous peoples during the Spanish conquest of Latin America  The headline grabbing move  rejected by the Spanish government  shows that imperial history remains bitterly divisive  on both sides of the Atlantic But art could help re examine the conquest s 500 year legacy with newfound respect  instead of rancor or political posturing Pedro Pablo Alayza  the director of the Pedro de Osma Museum in Lima  said by phone that  art is of course a way to understand what happened in the colonial period   Colonial history is traumatic   he said   But we can t go ahead into the future if we don t think again about our past  The Prado is one of 12 major museums and galleries in Spain that opened shows of Peruvian art in February  in parallel with ARCOmadrid  the annual art fair  where Peru was guest country  These exhibitions provide what Fietta Jarque  their coordinator  called a  crash course in Peruvian art  ImageAmauta  a shortlived but influential journal founded in the 1920s  fostered a spirit of openness and exchange between Latin America s indigenous and Hispanic cultures CreditJose Sabogal Museo de Arte de Lima  Peru  via Reina Sofia  MadridSpanish audiences will rediscover a chapter that is missing from their own history  she added  In Spanish schools they barely learn about three centuries of common culture   said Ms  Jarque  a Peruvian critic and curator who lives in Spain  She said a  sense of guilt for the conquest  was partly to blame The traces and techniques of pre Columbian art were not wiped out by Spanish rule and remain  raw material  for Peruvian artists  according to Sharon Lerner  the contemporary art curator at the Lima Museum of Art For instance  the gigantic pre Incan land drawings and ceramic designs explored in  Nasca   an exhibit at the Telefnica Foundation through May 19  helped inspire the modernist artists on show through May 27 in  The Avant Garde Networks of Amauta   at the Reina Sofia museum That exhibition shows how the Latin American artists and intellectuals of Amauta  a short lived but influential journal founded in Peru in the 1920s  opened up to Amerindian culture But Sandra Gamarra  an artist from Peru  said in a telephone interview that people s minds were still shaped by past thinking  The colonial system is still alive in Peru   she said   The idea of race  of different levels of humanity  is in our culture  We learn to see through categories  and through art  Ms  Gamarra s sepia like family portraits  which were on show at the ARCOmadrid art fair  are painted in iron oxide and modeled on colonial era paintings depicting the offspring of interracial unions  In those so called caste paintings  people were classified  criollo  American born to European parents   mestizo  Spanish and Amerindian   mulato  Spanish and African   and so on  showing Spanish colonial society as acutely race conscious  yet rife with miscegenation Image Cosmovisin Aimeni  by Santiago Yahuarcani  is on show in the  Amazonas  exhibition at the Matadero Madrid Creditvia Matadero MadridA legacy of stratification lives on in Peru  Mr  Alayza  of the Pedro de Osma Museum  said that  diversity is both a source of the country s richness and its problems with racism  But  he added   to understand each other is the main goal  Partly to this end  the Peruvian Culture Ministry has tentatively begun supporting contemporary art  The Madrid shows are driven by independent curators  but the government of Peru is supporting the exhibitions as part of a cultural program in the lead up to the 200th anniversary of the country s independence  in 2021 Shows like  Amazonas   an exhibition at Matadero Madrid through May 5  which places video installations next to hallucinogenic paintings evoking the spirit world  reflect how attitudes in Peru are changing Felix Lossio  an official with the Peruvian Culture Ministry  said that only a few years ago   Amazonian artists whose mother tongue is not Spanish sharing space with urban artists from Lima would have been unthinkable   We wouldn t have recognized this as contemporary art  but exotic craft   he said Like the painting of the Inca princess and the conquistador  which the Prado now appreciates for its artistic value  the complex aesthetics of Peru s indigenous art are gaining admirers  Despite the cataclysm of conquest  that world  and its art  never entirely vanished  

THE ISLAND OF SEA WOMEN By Lisa See Jeju is her home  an island known for Three Abundances  wind  stones and women   Thus begins Lisa See s newest novel   The Island of Sea Women   which is set on a Korean island and draws on the centuries long history of the haenyeo  female divers who have effectively created a matrifocal society   they are the breadwinners of their families  while their husbands take on the domestic duties of cooking the meals and raising the children  After her nonfictional debut   On Gold Mountain   and a series of three mysteries  all of See s subsequent novels have been historical  yet history never seems to be her main focus  Instead  underlying all of See s work is the theme of female friendship  Throughout her oeuvre  which spans periods from the 19th century to the mid 20th and backdrops from Shanghai to San Francisco  See excels at exploring the bonds between women  whether friends or family Much like her last novel   The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane   which explored the lives of the Akha hill tribe and the tea trade in the remote Yunnan province through the lenses of a mother and daughter   The Island of Sea Women  tells its own story through the friendship of Young sook  the daughter of the head haenyeo diver  and Mi ja  the orphaned daughter of a Japanese collaborator  See s vivid prose and thorough research together bring to life the seafaring existence of these women   The boat dipped and swayed in the light chop  I attached my bitchang to my wrist and grabbed my net and tewak  A light wind blew  and I began to shiver  I was feeling pretty miserable  The narrative alternates in time between 2008   when an aging Young sook sits on a beach sorting algae  fielding the incessant questions of onlookers   Are they scholars  journalists or documentarians   she wonders   her life having been transformed into a kind of living diorama   and her early childhood years  starting in 1938 during the Japanese occupation of Korea  which began nearly 30 years earlier  In her depictions of the harsh colonization  the power of See s words shines through   We hated the Japanese  and they hated us    They d killed Grandmother s parents  and she called them chokpari   cloven footed ones  Mother always said that if I was ever alone and saw colonists  whether soldiers or civilians  I should run and hide  because they d ruined many girls on Jeju  The girls  friendship begins to fray when their marriages are arranged  beautiful Mi ja s to the wealthy son of a Japanese collaborator who lives in the more urban Jeju City rather than the hardscrabble countryside  Young sook s a humbler marriage to a neighbor boy  Jun bu  As in many of See s plots  we have little hope that the men will bring happiness  Mi ja quotes a proverb that all but guarantees bad times ahead   When a woman gets married  she has the best food for three days  That must last her a lifetime  ImageAbuse of male power is indeed as much a through line in See s fiction as are female bonds   by bosses  fathers  brothers  husbands  lovers  See s heroines are uniformly resilient in facing these misdeeds  although she does allow rare periods of marital bliss between Young sook and Jun bu   Sometimes we went to the water s edge  Sometimes we strolled through the olles  Other times we d climb an oreum  stare out at the view  talk  and sometimes do nighttime activities in the broad daylight  See s meticulous research is perhaps most apparent in the magical  strange passages when Young sook and Mi ja  both married and pregnant  go for  leaving home water work   a k a  contract diving jobs  in Vladivostok   The moment of submersion into that cold seemed to calm my baby  put him to sleep  freeze him in place  As the months passed and our bellies grew  water offered new comforts  As soon as I was submerged  my aches were massaged  and the weight of my baby was buoyed  I felt strong   Mi ja gives birth on the job  climbing out of the water only to deliver her son on the deck  and once Young sook s daughter is born they take care of the infants together during breaks on the boats  the cradles tied to the rocking deck Less successful are See s treatments of larger historical moments  during which the characters are often reduced to mouthpieces for exposition  On the heroines  return from Vladivostok to Jeju City  dockworkers clunkily inform them of the impending Allied invasion   Ten Japanese army divisions are here   many of them hiding  In caves  In lava tubes  And in special bases they ve built into the cliffs right at the shoreline  The second half of the novel chronicles the largely unknown  horrific violence of the 4 3 Incident  named for the date it began  April 3  1948  three years after Japan surrendered occupation of Korea   in which a communist insurgency was suppressed by the United States installed government and the police in a campaign that killed tens of thousands of people  See dramatizes atrocities committed by the military during the Bukchon massacre in a harrowing scene in which Young sook loses both the majority of her family and her friendship to Mi ja This is not the only passage in which the narrowness of the novel s focus  solely on this one friendship  underserves the importance of the events that are its backdrop  At the outbreak of the Korean War  in 1950  the United States had command of the South Korean military but stood aside  documenting the bloodshed but not defending civilians  South Korea s call for  pre emptive apprehension  of suspected communist insurgents  as well as its subsequent 50 year denial of the war crimes  has chilling parallels to more recent and current wars  The National Committee for the Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju Incident has laid blame on both the American and Korean militaries Historical fiction can be as political and as pertinent to today s world as it is illustrative of the world it depicts  As of 2019  neither government has yet made good on their promises of reparations to the victims of Jeju  See s thoughtful and empathetic book sheds necessary attention on this largely ignored event  

PARIS   The middle class is shrinking in developed economies as increases in workers  wages have failed to keep up with the rising cost of housing  education and healthcare  the OECD said on Wednesday Most people in the 36 member nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development are part of the middle class  which the OECD defines as households with income between 75 and 200 percent of the national median However  the number has slowly declined from 64 percent in the 1980s to 61 percent now in OECD countries for which data was available  the Paris based policy forum said in a report entitled  Under Pressure  The Squeezed Middle Class  The middle class has shrunk with each generation with 68 percent of baby boomers   those born between 1942 and 1964   belonging to the middle class when they were in their twenties compared with 60 percent for millennials  born between 1983 and 2002 The OECD put the decline of the middle class down in part to their largely stagnating earnings as median incomes rose a third less than the average income of the richest 10 percent over the last 30 years Meanwhile  costs have risen much faster than inflation for some of the key pillars of middle class life like housing  which the OECD said had risen three times faster than household median income over the last two decades  Middle class households were also forking out more for education and healthcare At the same time  workers have faced growing job insecurity  made even worse in recent years by the rise of automation  which the OECD said now threatened one in six middle class jobs  Against that backdrop  more than 20 percent of middle class households spend more than they earn  leaving them increasingly turning to debt to finance their lifestyles  Today the middle class looks increasingly like a boat in rocky waters  Governments must listen to people s concerns and protect and promote middle class living standards   OECD head Angel Gurria said in a statement To improve the lot of the middle class  the OECD recommended investment in training to boost their earnings potential and more collective bargaining to ensure good wages The OECD also suggested shifting the tax burden from labour income to income from capital and capital gains  property and inheritance  while also making income taxes more progressive   Reporting by Leigh Thomas  Editing by Hugh Lawson

PARIS   Louis Vuitton owner LVMH on Wednesday set a high bar for rival luxury goods companies all trying to capitalise on Chinese demand for high end handbags and clothing  as sales growth at the conglomerate picked up pace in the first quarter  Some luxury manufacturers are struggling more than others to hold onto their all important Chinese clients  who make up over a third of industry sales and are increasingly spending on high end wares at home rather than overseas  LVMH   which cited a  buoyant environment  at the start of the year and said all regions were experiencing  good growth    has been one of the big beneficiaries of thriving appetite among younger Chinese shoppers for branded goods  It did not break down its performance by country on Wednesday  with more details due on a Thursday conference call with analysts  But it had previously flagged enduring demand in China in the first weeks of January  even against the backdrop of a slowing economy  The French conglomerate  which owns other labels like Christian Dior in fashion or Krug in champagne  was boosted by a strong performance in its leather goods unit  while sales of spirits like cognac improved from a quarter earlier  Group revenues rose 16 percent to 12 5 billion euros  10 77 billion pounds  in the period  up 11 percent on a like for like basis  which strips out currency swings and the impact of acquisitions or disposals  That beat analyst forecasts and marked an acceleration from the 9 percent growth notched up a quarter earlier Its performance bodes well for peers who derive much of their profits from high margin handbags  and which have also proved a hit with consumers in recent years  like Kering s Gucci or Birkin bag maker Hermes  Yet the gap is also growing among brands benefiting from a strong presence in mainland China  and those trying to catch up there as the Chinese government looks to fuel more domestic spending by cutting VAT or import duties  Jeweller Tiffany has flagged a spending slowdown among Chinese tourists in the United States  while Prada noted a slowdown among this clientele in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter  as the weaker yuan and the backdrop of a Beijing Washington trade war also took its toll  LVMH shares closed up 2 45 percent on Wednesday before the results were published  at 329 8 euros per share   just shy of a recent record high of 337 5 euros hit earlier this month    Reporting by Sarah White and Pascale Denis  editing by David Evans and Alexandra Hudson

WASHINGTON   U S  House of Representatives Democrats on Tuesday canceled a planned floor vote on legislation to set federal spending levels for next year after the party s left wing demanded more money for domestic programs It was an awkward moment for Democrats  who won control of the House from Republicans in last November s congressional elections  but now appear unable to unify liberals and moderates around a budget plan  The House vote had been planned for Wednesday and would have been the first step in negotiations with the Republican led Senate over spending levels Republicans  when they led the House  had similar difficulties  Over the years  Congress has frequently failed to pass a budget blueprint  It was only the opening salvo in what could be a long running battle over spending levels and priorities  especially given Republican President Donald Trump s calls for deep spending cuts to non defense programs and differences over border security policy Such disagreements can sometimes lead to standoffs like the one that resulted in a 35 day partial government shutdown that ended earlier this year House liberals were unhappy because the pending Democratic legislation  based on a plan approved by the Budget Committee  had set spending caps for fiscal year 2020 with  664 billion in defense spending  higher than domestic discretionary spending at  631 billion The liberals sought  33 billion more for domestic spending  But if that were added in  there was a danger not enough moderate Democrats would back the legislation  aides and lawmakers said   We fundamentally disagree with leadership      It s the first time Democrats are back in control  that was our opportunity to put parity between defense and non defense   said Representative Mark Pocan  a Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus  Education  infrastructure and healthcare are really the issues that we ran on last November  and we re just trying to get the  Democratic  caucus to do that   Pocan said Democratic leaders said talks with the Senate could still go ahead and they inserted provisions in another measure that passed on Tuesday allowing House appropriators to start work on individual spending bills Democrats said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be meeting Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to try to reach a spending agreement  If we can do that  that s the best way to do it  because then the Senate will agree to it   said House Majority leader Steny Hoyer  adding that hopefully  McConnell could then get the White House to agree   Reporting by Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan  Editing by Peter Cooney  

WICHITA  Kan    Kansas must pay legal feels arising from its efforts to stop publication of notebooks kept by the lead investigator into the murders of a Kansas family chronicled in Truman Capote s book  In Cold Blood  The Kansas Court of Appeals ruled last week that the state must pay more than  168 000 to attorneys representing the investigator s son and a literary memorabilia dealer in Seattle  KCUR reported  The Kansas Bureau of Investigation and Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt sued in 2012 to prevent the publication or selling of notes from Harold Nye  who led the KBI s investigation into the killings of the Herb Clutter family in 1959 in Holcomb  Kansas  Capote s book drew international attention to the murders The state argued that Nye s material belonged to Kansas because he was a state employee  Kansas officials also argued that the Clutter family s privacy concerns justified blocking their release Shawnee County District Judge Larry Hendricks in 2012 granted the state s request for a temporary order blocking the sale or publication of the notebooks  But he reversed himself in 2014   saying the notes  publication or sale were protected by the First Amendment and the Kansas Constitution  He also ordered the state to pay legal fees to Nye s son  Ronald  and Gary McAvoy  an author and literary memorabilia dealer McAvoy said during the litigation  the state argued that Harold Nye  was a liar and thief   In that process  they said many nasty things about him that were completely untrue in order to swing the court in their favor   For me  it s not about the money   McAvoy said in a phone interview   It s the righting of an injustice  They dragged Harold Nye s good name through the mud in the process  Not only was it wrong and unfair  it was almost like win at any cost on their part  A spokesman for the Kansas Attorney General s office declined to comment on the appeals court ruling Harold Nye kept the case files at his home  Hendricks ruled in 2014 that Ronald Nye s constitutional right to publish the material outweighed the government s desire to keep its investigative records confidential  Harold Nye worked for the Kansas bureau from 1955 until his retirement in 1975  he was its director from 1969 to 1971 McAvoy used the notebooks to write a book on the Clutter killings   And Every World Is True   which was published recently and contains a forward and material from Ronald Nye Herb Clutter  his wife and two of their four children were bound and gagged and shot to death at their farm in near Holcomb  The killers  Richard Hickock and Perry Smith  were arrested six weeks after the murders and eventually executed  

PARIS   French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said that after three months of public debate it was that clear tax cuts must be speeded up to quell the widespread anger over high living costs that has fueled anti government protests In an act of political theater on Monday  Philippe was presenting the findings from two million online contributions and 10 000 hours of town hall debates that President Emmanuel Macron must now digest and respond to with policy moves Four broad needs emerged  the prime minister said  renewing ties between Paris and the regions  making the political process more relevant for citizens  responding better to climate change  and easing the tax burden  The debate clearly shows us in which direction we need to go  we need to lower taxes and lower them faster   Philippe said in a speech in the Grand Palace in Paris Planned increases to a fuel tax prompted five months of  yellow vest  protests nationwide and the worst rioting Paris has witnessed since the 1968 student uprising  though the discontent swiftly turned into a broader backlash against inequality and an aloof political elite More violence in mid March reminded Macron that putting his reform agenda back on track would not be easy and the unrest could damage his party s European election campaign The  yellow vests  remain an amorphous group with varied demands  including higher salaries  better public services  and more power for voters on policy decisions Tight public finances mean Macron has limited wriggle room  The French have understood     that we cannot lower taxes if we don t lower public spending   Philippe said The debates reinvigorated Macron  who rolled up his sleeves and held forth for up to seven hours at a time with high school students  mayors and working mothers  as well as intellectuals and philosophers  Polls showed only a tentative recovery in Macron s weak popularity  so the stakes are high for him and his prime minister New policy measures are yet to be decided and could be put to a plebiscite  The option of a referendum   which has the advantage of responding to the yellow vests  demand for more people s votes   remains on the table Nonetheless  Ingrid Levavasseur  who pulled out of leading a  yellow vest  list for the European elections because of internal divisions within the movement  doubted the debates would produce meaningful reform  I count myself among the skeptics   she told Reuters  Additional reporting and writing by Richard Lough  Editing by Giles Elgood

struggled to convince analysts and financial investors that it has an adequate replacement Suboxone film is used by people recovering from opioid dependency  Indivior used a telephone program to connect patients to doctors that the company  knew were prescribing Suboxone and or other opioids in a careless and clinically unwarranted manner   the indictment said Slough  England based Indivior said that  an adverse verdict may have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial position and outlook   A court hearing is scheduled for May 6 and the company plans to plead not guilty to the charges  a spokesman said   FALSE STATEMENTS Indivior shares crashed to an all time low and wiped out over 550 million pounds   720 million  in market value  They closed down 71 6 percent at 30 05 pence  Close to 100 million shares changed hands  roughly 40 times the 30 day daily average volume Reckitt Benckiser was not charged  but the indictment said the illegal behavior began before it spun off Indivior in 2014  It refers to Indivior s owner until then as  Company A   Reckitt shares slumped 6 5 percent to the bottom of London s blue chip FTSE 100 index  erasing many of the gains made in 2019 after three tough years The indictment said that executives of  Company A  made or approved  false statements  that the film version of Suboxone was safer to have around children than the discontinued tablet   even though they knew the primary reason for the discontinuance was to delay FDA approval of generic Suboxone   This indictment is not against RB Group Plc or any other group company and we currently have no additional or new information in respect of this matter  apart from what has been publicly issued by the Department of Justice and Indivior Plc   Reckitt  owner of Durex condoms and Lysol cleaners  said in a statement on Wednesday It referred investors back to a previous statement that it was recognizing a provision of  400 million relating to the issue but that its final cost could be substantially higher  The provision is in case Reckitt should itself be indicted  as the company has indemnification against liabilities arising from charges against Indivior  a spokeswoman said  Reckitt was just starting to regain investor confidence after a series of one off problems including a safety scandal in South Korea  a failed product launch  a cyber attack and a manufacturing glitch  Its chief executive Rakesh Kapoor  who oversaw several acquisitions and divestitures with the aim of turning Reckitt into a global consumer healthcare company  will retire this year  even though a major undertaking   splitting Reckitt into two business units   is unfinished  Kapoor took the reins at Reckitt in September 2011  Many of the allegations in the indictment relate to activities before this period  when Reckitt s CEO was Bart Becht  who took Benckiser public in 1997 and merged it with Reckitt   Coleman two years later  Reuters could not immediately reach Becht for comment on Wednesday  The potential penalty against Indivior is triple the annual revenue it made last year  or slightly more than the total revenue the company made from Suboxone film from 2010 to 2014  Indivior had net cash of  681 million at the end of the year Jefferies analysts said in a note   The headline potential penalties are severe but a settlement is also still possible  Last year  Indivior said it was in  advanced discussions  with the U S  Department of Justice about a possible resolution but none has emerged  Indivior has spent the last two years fighting multiple legal battles and patent disputes in the United States with companies including Dr Reddy s  Teva and Mylan to block them from launching generic versions of Suboxone film  RECKITT FEARSReckitt s spin off of Indivior in 2014 and the 2017 sale of Reckitt s food unit  let Reckitt focus on expanding its consumer health business  which targets ageing populations and those interested in health and wellness in the West and rising incomes in developing markets  In addition to concern about Reckitt s liability  investors on Wednesday worried about a possible spillover effect on Reckitt s infant formula business  The company had previously flagged implications including  potential criminal indictment of the group or employees  with reputational impact  distraction and potential debarment which could theoretically extend  to its infant formula business  The business  which sells Enfamil formula  derives a portion of its sales from government contracts in the United States supplying a program to support low income parents However  Reckitt said on Wednesday any risk to the infant formula business was theoretical and seen as  highly unlikely and only a remote possibility     1   0 7640 pounds   Reporting by Justin George Varghese and Martinne Geller  Additional reporting by Nate Raymond in New York and Thyagaraju Adinarayan in London  Editing by Keith Weir

In the current election cycle  bets on moderation have few takers  Leading Democratic candidates are supporting bold progressive policy initiatives that are supported by liberal primary voters but may prove to be a tough sell to the general electorate  President Trump and his Republican allies will certainly try to use these initiatives against their Democratic rivals  They have in fact already begun to do so A number of Democratic presidential candidates  for example  are calling for the elimination of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and they have declared themselves in favor of such multibillion dollar programs as Medicare for all and a Green New Deal  Growing numbers are supportive of reparations to compensate black Americans for the costs of slavery and segregation Why are these candidates willing to buck political tradition and heighten the risk of defeat on Nov  3  2020 Here is one answer  from Julie Wronski  a political scientist at the University of Mississippi Democrats contain much more heterogeneity across social groups than the more homogeneous white  Christian conservative Republican Party  To the extent the Democratic Party needs to entice and accommodate African Americans  Latinos  environmentalists  etc  as voters  their candidates need to start embracing boutique policies for these groups that may not align with a general election  median voter  model of espousing moderate national policies The issue of reparations illuminates the heterogeneity of the Democratic electorate  There are two surveys on reparations  a May 2016 Marist Poll and a July 2018 poll by the liberal group Data for Progress  Both produced similar results The Marist survey found overwhelming opposition among whites in response to the question As a way to make up for the harm caused by slavery and other forms of racial discrimination  do you think the United States should or should not pay reparations  that is  should or should not pay money to African Americans who are descendants of slaves Whites were opposed 81 15  Latinos were split  with 46 percent in support and 47 percent opposed  African American voters support reparations  58 35 The Data for Progress survey found sharp partisan divisions on the issue of reparations  Democrats supported reparations across the board  whites 37 8 to 30 5 percent  blacks 58 5 to 15 0 percent  Hispanics  49 9 to 18 3 percent  Independents were opposed  41 0 to 22 8 percent  Republicans were decisively in opposition  77 1 to 8 9 percent Among all voters  opposition to reparations was nearly twice as large as support  47 1 to 26 4 percent For the Democrats running for president  African American backing is crucial both in the primaries and in the general election Nationally  black voters in 2016 cast about one of every four ballots in Democratic primaries  In four states  African Americans cast the majority of votes  71 percent in Mississippi  61 percent in South Carolina  54 percent in Alabama and 51 percent in Georgia ImageSenator Elizabeth Warren posing for photos with diners at The Senator s Place  a restaurant in Cleveland  Miss  CreditAndrea Morales for The New York TimesLet s look at another progressive initiative  In August 2018  AP NORC asked voters if they support or oppose  abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement  known as ICE   41 percent opposed abolition and 24 percent supported it Medicare for all and the Green New Deal pose a subtler dilemma for Democratic candidates  In the abstract  voters are supportive  the problems arise when the same voters are told key details  including costs The best example of this is Medicare for all  In March  a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that a majority supported  a national health plan or Medicare for all plan   56 39  but support vacillates in both directions depending on how the program is portrayed If  for example  Democrats posit that Medicare for all would eliminate health care premiums and reduce out of pocket costs  support rises to 67 percent with 30 percent opposed Conversely  if Republicans succeed in portraying the program as leading to delays in getting medical treatment  or to the elimination of current private coverage  or to higher taxes  support collapses to the mid 20s and mid 30s  with opposition shooting up to the 60 to 70 percent range Bold progressive stands may be risky in general elections  but recent research suggests that policy radicalism pays off in primaries In a forthcoming paper   Policy Over Party  Comparing the effects of candidate ideology and party on affective polarization   Yphtach Lelkes  a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania  reports that voters in primary elections prefer candidates who are willing to take more extreme positions  Partisans are reacting most favorably toward ideological extremists   Lelkes wrote in an email In fact  moderates are punished for the policies  Extreme politicians in the vein of Mike Lee and Elizabeth Warren  are rated roughly 20 25 points higher  on a 0 to 100 scale  by party identifiers than ideologically moderate politicians in the vein of Susan Collins and Joe Manchin  These effects are even larger among ideologically extreme respondents   the kind that vote in primary elections Lelkes conducted experiments that asked participants to rate a number of hypothetical candidates  including a moderate Democrat  an  ideologically extreme  liberal Democrat  a moderate Republican and an  ideologically extreme  conservative Republican He found that the most ideologically committed voters   who are disproportionately represented in primaries and caucuses   strongly preferred more extreme candidates The impact of policy cues was particularly strong among respondents who themselves held strong policy positions  If a respondent was told that candidate held extreme in party views  ideologically extreme respondents registered feeling thermometer ratings 35 89 points warmer than ideologically neutral respondents Lelkes s conclusion If we are to decrease affective polarization in the United States  we need politicians that are politically moderate  Unfortunately  voters prefer politicians of their own party that are politically extreme  This incentivizes extreme political candidates  which will only exacerbate current tensions There are dangers for both parties is these trends  Lelkes argues  citing a 2015 study of House elections   What Happens When Extremists Win Primaries   by Andrew Hall  a political scientist at Stanford Hall found that when a more extreme candidate beats a moderate in the primarythe party s general election vote share decreases on average by approximately 9 13 percentage points  and the probability that the party wins the seat decreases by 35 54 percentage points Gallup data shows the steady ascendance within Democratic ranks of self identified ideological liberals and a parallel decline in the share of Democrats who say they are moderate or conservative  From 1973 to 2018  as I have noted before  the percentage of Democrats who say they are liberal has grown from 25 to 51 percent  while the share of moderates has fallen from 48 to 31 percent  and the share of conservatives has dropped from 25 to 13 percent A 2014 Pew study showed a steady process of ideological consolidation among both Republicans and Democrats since 1994  although consolidation accelerated most rapidly on the left The share of Democrats who are liberal on all or most value dimensions has nearly doubled from just 30 percent in 1994 to 56 percent today  The share who are consistently liberal has quadrupled from just 5 percent to 23 percent over the past 20 years In a reflection of their importance in primaries   consistently liberal  Democrats turned out in elections at a 70 percent rate  compared with 47 percent for  mostly liberal  Democrats and 41 percent for Democrats with  mixed views   according to Pew data These and other trends  according to Lee Drutman  a senior fellow at the liberal New America think tank  represent the changing the mind set of the Democratic electorate  In an email  Drutman wrote Two related dynamics are operative  One  Democratic voters have moved to the left in response to Trump  and are eager for policies that signal transformative change  not just incrementalism  There is no return to normalcy  because the past is now seen as more flawed This dynamic has intensified because the most engaged Democrats  Drutman writes have bought into an argument that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 because she was too incrementalist  and had she gone a little bolder and promised something more exciting than her competence and experience  she might have won The second dynamic  Drutman continued  is thatin a crowded field  candidates are seeking to distinguish themselves with grass roots energy  A very effective way of generating grass roots energy is attaching to transformative changes these policies signal  Incrementalism and moderation doesn t generate much excitement among the activists or in coverage from journalists who are responsible for driving candidate buzz in these early stages In a similar analysis  John Sides  a political scientist at George Washington University  argues thatOn race and immigration in particular  I think Trump is pushing Democrats to the left  To be clear  Hillary Clinton was already to Obama s left even in 2016  But I think Trump s rhetoric and agenda has made conservative positions on race and immigration even more anathema to Democrats Sides also pointed out that the incentives for Democratic candidates have shifted It used to be the case that Democratic candidates had to moderate on racial issues to maintain a Democratic coalition that included both blacks and some racially conservative whites  But the Democratic coalition has changed  it is increasingly made up of not only nonwhites but whites who espouse racially liberal attitudes In an argument elaborating on a point made by Drutman  Edward Carmines  a political scientist at Indiana University  made the case that the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton fostered the shift to the left If a moderate policy agenda cannot guarantee electoral victory why downplay your leftward policy orientations in the unlikely event that it will jeopardize your electoral success Carmines added Trump s success has reinforced this perspective  He won with a very right wing policy agenda  Perhaps a left wing set of proposals can lead Democrats to similar success Carmines believes that  both of these premises are mistaken and could very well lead Democrats to electoral defeat when victory is within sight  Leonie Huddy  a political scientist at Stony Brook University  argues that the liberal tilt of the Democratic candidates is  in fact  a rational political strategy   There is real change afoot with the most recent generations   she wrote  citing a Pew study released in January Young Republicans are especially different from older Republicans and the Democratic Party is likely to regard such findings as an invitation to poach more liberal young Republicans Strong partisans  however  Huddy writes   are unlikely to defect from the party in 2020 regardless of its issue agenda   and political independentsare younger  on average  than partisans  Appealing to young voters thus makes political sense when it comes to the general 2020 presidential election ImageSenator Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally in North Charleston  S C CreditTravis Dove for The New York TimesGary Jacobson  a political scientist at the University of California San Diego  has a somewhat different take on the changing character of the Democratic electorate and the party s presidential candidates The candidates  Jacobson wrote by email   are playing to their activist base whose enthusiasm helped produce their House victory in 2018  He warned  however  that  leaning left does carry risks  there are not enough liberals  or progressives  if you prefer  to form a majority nationally or in the Electoral College  In contemporary presidential campaigns  according to Jacobson the tricky thing is that in an era of extremely high party line voting  turnout becomes enormously important  Trump has proven to be a great mobilizer of Democrats  but they still have to consider how enthusiastic ordinary Democrats will be about their nominee Trump  Jacobson noted  willtry to mobilize his base by ranting about  socialism  and of course some potential Democratic candidates will be more vulnerable to that charge than others The strategic choices facing prospective Democratic nominees are  in the view of Lynn Vavreck  a political scientist at U C L A   even more complex and subtle than those described by Jacobson Taking very liberal stands on contested issues  she wrote me might not pose  significant risks  if you think your minimum winning coalition of voters is made up of people who either share your preferences on these things  or for whom these policies are not pivotal in their vote decision She elaborated There are people for whom these issues are important  but for whom there s no position a Democrat could take that would make them decide not to vote for that Democrat  There are other people  presumably  for whom these issues are so important and their preferences so intense  that any Democrat who takes a position far from their own is a Democrat for whom they won t vote  It depends which type of people you think are in your winning coalition as to whether you stake out positions on these things Matthew Nisbet  a professor of communication  public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern and editor in chief of the journal Environmental Communication  addressed only the support for a Green New Deal by some Democratic candidates  His view is pessimistic In an email  he wrote The Green New Deal has done damage to the Democratic Party s chances heading into the 2020 elections  while hurting efforts to build momentum on behalf of climate and energy policy options capable of passing during an era of enduring divided government In an article in the spring edition of Issues in Science and Technology  Nisbet contends that the goal of Green New Dealersis not to broker cross alliances between the center right  center left  and left wing  drawing on the best ideas that those factions can offer  but rather to build progressive power In an interesting development  the momentum behind the more radical Democratic agenda has turned both Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi into defenders of the party s old guard Pelosi  who has been trying with mixed success to tamp down the left wing of the House Democratic caucus  recently described her views on Medicare for all in an interview with The Washington Post At first she said   I m agnostic  Show me how you think you can get there   But then she cautioned So we ll have hearings  again  let s see what it is  Right now it s a  30 trillion price tag  What do people get for that in terms of care  and what do they pay for that along the way Implicit in her comment is the belief that  30 trillion is not acceptable to the American public Obama  speaking at a town hall in Germany earlier this month  warned of the dangers of uncompromising ideology for the progressive wing of his party One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States   maybe it s true here as well   is a certain kind of rigidity where we say   Uh  I m sorry  this is how it s going to be   and then we start sometimes creating what s called a  circular firing squad   where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues  And when that happens  typically the overall effort and movement weakens For the moment  both Obama and Pelosi are having minimal influence as far as the leftward thrust of the Democratic presidential nomination goes Three years ago  Trump threw out conventional wisdom and went on to win the nomination and the presidency  Maybe  this time around  Democrats can gamble successfully on a similar strategy and win  Or maybe not  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you

CAIRO   Mohamed Abu Amer  a landscape gardener  was working in downtown Cairo when national security agents took him away on Feb  6  2018  his family said For almost six months Amer s family waited for news of the 37 year old father of two  Their messages to the Public Prosecutor and the Interior Ministry  which oversees the police and the national security agency  went unanswered Then on July 31  the ministry announced on its Facebook page that Amer was among five terrorists killed in a shootout earlier that day when police approached their hideout 40 km north of Cairo  Amer was wanted for the murder of a national security agent  the statement said It s a version of events his family doesn t buy  Amer was no terrorist and he died in the custody of the state  not in a gun battle  his relatives insist   I know that what they are saying is untrue   said a relative   He was with them for six months  Amer was one of 465 men killed in what the Interior Ministry said were shootouts with its forces over a period of three and a half years  a Reuters analysis of Interior Ministry statements has found  The announcements reviewed by Reuters appeared on the ministry s social media or were published by the state news agency The killings began in the summer of 2015  In June that year  Islamist militants had assassinated Egypt s chief prosecutor  Hisham Barakat  an ally of President Abdel Fattah al Sisi  Sisi responded with a sweeping anti terrorism law that shielded the police and military from prosecution for the proportionate use of force  Human rights groups say it was the start of a brutal crackdown  A researcher at an Egyptian organization that documents human rights abuses said police embarked on a spate of  extra judicial killings knowing that no one will hold them accountable  In 108 incidents involving 471 men  only six suspects survived  according to Interior Ministry statements from July 1  2015 to the end of 2018  That represents a kill ratio of 98 7 percent  Five members of the security forces were killed  the statements said  Thirty seven were injured The Interior Ministry issued crime scene photographs with some of the statements  They showed bloodied bodies with assault rifles or shotguns on the ground beside them  Almost all of the statements said arms and ammunition were recovered at the scene  Some said Islamic State flyers were found But in interviews with Reuters  the relatives of 11 of the dead men contradicted the official accounts  Their sons  brothers or husbands had been plucked by police or national security agents from the streets or their homes and disappeared  they said  in some cases for several months  Then came news of their deaths in an Interior Ministry Facebook post or statement The families said none of the young men carried arms  But some were supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood  a movement that was outlawed in 2013 after Sisi led the military in toppling Egypt s first Muslim Brotherhood president  Mohamed Mursi Reuters showed three forensic experts mortuary images of two of the 11 dead men  These specialists cast doubt on the Interior Ministry s account of the two men s deaths Three witnesses to one deadly encounter   the shooting of two members of the Muslim Brotherhood  Mohamed Kamal and Yasser Shehata  in a Cairo apartment block in 2016   disputed the Interior Ministry s report of a gun battle with its forces  There was no exchange of fire or gun fight  these witnesses said The U S  State Department s latest annual report on human rights in Egypt  released in March  said abuses included arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government or its agents  forced disappearances and torture  The United States  nevertheless  has unfrozen  195 million in military aid to Egypt which it had previously withheld in part because of concerns over Egypt s human rights record  U S  officials reason that security cooperation with Egypt is important to U S  national security Kate Vigneswaran  senior legal adviser at the International Commission of Jurists  Middle East and North Africa program  said the killings described by Reuters could  constitute extrajudicial executions  a serious crime under international law   Evidence that victims were shot at close range would  indicate that the use of lethal force was not a response to a legitimate threat  but rather premeditated and deliberate conduct by the security forces to execute individuals outside the protection of the law  Kevin Jon Heller  associate professor of public international law at Amsterdam University  said if the victims were civilians   this would be the classic crime against humanity of murder  killing civilians as part of a widespread or systematic attack  The Egyptian government didn t respond to questions for this article  Reuters provided officials with a detailed account of its analysis of the Interior Ministry statements and other findings of this article  They had no comment A ROAD TRIPCousins Souhail Ahmed and Zakaria Mahmoud had no connection with the Muslim Brotherhood or any political organization  their family said  In July 2017 the men  both in their twenties  set off from their homes in the Nile city of Damietta for a holiday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh The 600 km road trip would take them southwards from Damietta  close to the Mediterranean  along the Suez Canal and then the Gulf of Suez  For Ahmed  a student  it was a rare adventure  Hurt in a car crash a few years earlier  he still walked with a limp and stayed at home much of the time  a relative said Ahmed called home a few hours into the trip and told his mother that they had stopped to get sugarcane juice as they headed for a checkpoint in Ismailia province  on the Suez Canal  It was the last time the family heard from them Five days later  the Interior Ministry announced in a Facebook post that the cousins were among four Islamist militants killed in a shootout when security forces approached their hideout in an Ismailia village on July 15  Relatives found the bodies of the men at a mortuary in the town of Ismailia the next day The families of the two young men say the government s version of events makes no sense  They are not Brotherhood supporters at all   said the relative  They  were not supporters of anyone   Ahmed  was like all young men  he dreamed to marry at a young age and have a family   Mahmoud was a carpenter Reuters showed photographs and video of the bodies to three forensic experts   Professor Derrick Pounder  a pathologist who has consulted for Amnesty International and the United Nations  and two other international experts who declined to be identified  All three cast doubt on the Interior Ministry s account that the deaths were the result of a shootout Mahmoud had three gunshot wounds to the head  One bullet entered beside his right nostril and exited just below his lower lip   That would place the shooter overlooking  above and to the right of the victim if the victim was standing  which would seem unlikely in an exchange of gunfire   Pounder said   A more likely scenario is that the victim was kneeling with the shooter standing close on the right side  The two other gunshot wounds were to Mahmoud s forehead  almost symmetrically placed just below the hairline to the left and right  which suggested final  coup de grace shots   according to Pounder Authorities said in the statement the cousins were part of a  group of fugitive terrorists  and died in a single incident   As soon as security forces approached them  they were surprised by gunshots in their direction which they dealt with  resulting in the killing of four terrorist elements   the Interior Ministry said Yet the cousins  bodies exhibited different stages of decomposition  Mahmoud s death appeared to have been very recent  the experts said  but Ahmed had died 36 to 48 hours before the images were taken  There were no obvious ante mortem injuries or gunshot wounds to Ahmed s body and no obvious cause of death  Pounder said   THERE WAS NO SHOOTOUT From July 1  2015 to Dec  31  2018  the Interior Ministry issued statements reporting the deaths of 465 men  almost all of them suspected militants  in gun battles with its forces  That compared with just five such deaths in the first half of 2015  before the murder of Barakat  the chief prosecutor The Interior Ministry statements were strikingly similar  In every instance  the ministry said its forces approached or raided the hideout of the terrorists or criminals having secured an arrest warrant or taken  all legal measures   The terrorists or criminals opened fire  and security forces responded Most of the dead men were in their 20s  the youngest was 16  the oldest was 61  The Interior Ministry classified 320 of the slain men as terrorists and 28 as criminals or drug dealers It said 117 were members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood  Founded in Egypt in 1928  the Muslim Brotherhood spread its political activism and charity work across the Middle East in the decades that followed  But in recent years countries including Egypt and Saudi Arabia have cracked down on its activities  declaring it a terrorist group  The Brotherhood  which insists it is a peaceful movement  has largely gone underground Around a quarter of the deaths reported by the Interior Ministry  104  were in the North Sinai region that borders Israel and Gaza  and where Egypt is battling an insurgency by Islamist militants The Interior Ministry statements didn t name 302 of the dead men  nor did they give precise locations for many of the shootings  Many were in remote desert or mountain areas  Reuters managed to speak to three witnesses to one incident in a Cairo apartment in 2016 The Interior Ministry announced on Oct  3  2016  that its forces had killed a Muslim Brotherhood leader and his aide in a raid on the apartment  The ministry said Mohamed Kamal  61  a member of the group s leadership council  and Yasser Shehata  47  shot at police and died when officers returned fire Reuters asked three neighbors about the events of that evening  None of them had seen or heard a gun fight  A woman living nearby said the only shots came several hours after police had entered the apartment  A person who was in the apartment block was adamant   There was no shootout  A lawyer speaking on behalf of the two men s families told Reuters an official autopsy showed the two men were shot in the head  Reuters was not able to independently verify the autopsy conclusion Some Interior Ministry statements were accompanied by crime scene photographs  These included the aftermath of a shooting in November 2018  The Interior Ministry said security forces killed 19 men in a shootout in the desert  west of Minya  Upper Egypt  The ministry said the dead were members of a cell responsible for a deadly attack on Christians two days earlier Forensic expert Pounder reviewed 20 of the photographs  He said 11 of the bodies appeared to have been moved after death  He pointed to blood and drag marks in the sand  Depressions in the sand suggested two of the men were shot while in a kneeling position  he added  Photos of other bodies were inconclusive An Egyptian judicial source said some police felt the courts were too slow  which led some officers to take justice into their own hands   They call it  prompt justice    he said  Police often moved weapons and other objects at the crime scene to cover up executions  the source said   The police are the ones who gather the information  and there is no way they will cooperate in collecting evidence that would incriminate their colleagues  Reuters analysis of the Interior Ministry statements showed that deadly shootouts often followed an attack by Islamist militants  For example  in December 2018  a day after the deadly bombing of a Vietnamese tourist bus in Giza  the ministry announced that its forces had killed 40 people in three separate incidents Gamal Eid  a human rights lawyer and founder of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information  said Egypt was trapped in a lethal cycle of extrajudicial killings and revenge attacks   The more extrajudicial killings take place  the more there will be desire for revenge   he said A member of the state funded National Council of Human Rights  George Ishak  said   There is a state of panic because of terrorism  but it shouldn t be like this  This fear has to stop  A VERDICT OVERTURNEDIn 2013  Khaled Emam  a 37 year old weightlifting trainer  was sentenced in absentia to one year in jail for taking part in anti government protests  his family said  To avoid arrest  he moved with his wife and two sons into an apartment in Cairo s southeastern Mokattam district  away from the family home Emam was snatched from the street in June  2017  his family said  when he was fetching medicine for one of his sons  Witnesses told his family that masked men leaped from a minibus and grabbed him The family filed a complaint with the local police and wrote to the authorities asking for information  They got no response Then  on Oct  2  2017  the Interior Ministry issued a statement that its forces had killed three men in a shootout in a graveyard  It named two of them   both friends of Emam  Two security sources confirmed to Reuters that Emam was also killed At Cairo s Zeinhom mortuary  a relative found his body  It was bruised and showed signs of torture  the relative said   There were injuries around his joints  his arms were detached from his shoulders  Half of his lower jaw was missing along with several of his upper teeth  One week after Emam s death  an appeals court overturned the guilty verdict and his one year jail term  the relative said  The family hasn t filed a complaint about Emam s death for fear of reprisal   I know that I will not get justice   the relative said   Reporting by Reuters staff  additional reporting

WASHINGTON   Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts raised more than  6 million in the first quarter of the year  her campaign said on Wednesday  trailing some Democratic rivals but exceeding the campaign s worst case fears after some early fund raising troubles and the departure of her finance director Ms  Warren received more than 213 000 contributions from more than 135 000 donors  with an average donation of  28  her campaign said  She also had a strong finish to the quarter  The campaign raised more than  1 4 million during the last week of the quarter from more than 50 000 donations  exceeding its goal of 35 000 donations The numbers offer the most detailed window into the financial outlook of Ms  Warren s campaign  which had  to this point  released little information about its ability to raise funds  Ms  Warren has raised eyebrows   and won supporters   for her decision to swear off high dollar fund raising events and rest her campaign s hopes on small dollar donations The figures on donations came after her campaign put out urgent warnings that fund raising was critical to perceptions of Ms  Warren s strength  And  while better than some had feared  they still left her trailing some key rivals  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race   I won t sugarcoat it  We were outraised by some other candidates in the presidential primary this first quarter   Roger Lau  her campaign manager  wrote in an email to supporters on Wednesday afternoon Based on figures released by campaigns so far  she trails far behind the fund raising leader in the Democratic field  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  who raised  18 2 million  as well as Senator Kamala Harris of California  who raised  12 million  She is also behind former Representative Beto O Rourke of Texas  who raised  9 4 million  and Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   who raised more than  7 million Ms  Warren and campaign advisers have made clear that they did not expect to match the fund raising prowess of Mr  Sanders and Mr  O Rourke  the two other major candidates who have eschewed high dollar fund raisers Ms  Warren s first quarter total trails those of Mr  Sanders and Mr  O Rourke even though Ms  Warren entered the presidential race more than a month before both candidates  However  her numbers also offer reason for optimism  considering Ms  Warren roughly matched another rival  Ms  Harris  in small dollar donations  and raised more in the final week of the quarter than Ms  Harris did through her digital program in the final week Ms  Warren  who won her Senate re election bid by a wide margin in November  is also relying on a stockpile of donations she had previously collected  Presidential candidates can make use of money they raised in federal campaigns in the past  and Ms  Warren transferred  10 4 million from her Senate account to her presidential campaign  her team said At the same time  she is spending money quickly to build up a large campaign operation  Her campaign said it spent  5 2 million in the first quarter  leaving it with  11 2 million in cash on hand  Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field  Ms  Warren s fund raising at the beginning of her campaign did not impress  On Dec  31  the day she announced her exploratory committee for president  she raised about  300 000 through the online donation processing platform ActBlue  according to Federal Election Commission records  By contrast  Mr  O Rourke raised  6 1 million in his first 24 hours in the race  and Mr  Sanders raised  5 9 million in his first day  according to their campaigns A New York Times article detailing Ms  Warren s early fund raising struggles  which was published online on the last day of the first quarter  helped create an outpouring for Ms  Warren  handing her one of her best fund raising days of the quarter  according to a Democrat familiar with her fund raising Supporters of Ms  Warren feared that she was being crowded out by Mr  Sanders on the party s left flank  but the campaign s surge in the final week has at least temporarily allayed some of the concern  During that time  Ms  Warren s campaign team made several dramatic pitches to its donor base  sending emails that addressed the harshest criticisms of the campaign  such as one titled  Can she really win   in which they laid out the campaign s overarching strategy The emails  which track with private conversations among Ms  Warren s senior advisers  suggest that the senator believes several things will help her break out of the Democratic pack  including an ability to do more political events because she is not devoting time to private fund raisers  her well praised policy rollouts and her campaign team s focus on digital organizing  The relative numbers don t matter to me   said John Walsh  a former chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party   Who has the most money  No  that doesn t matter  It s   Do you have enough money to run the campaign you said you re going to run   Candidates must report their fund raising for the first quarter to the Federal Election Commission by April 15  but campaigns can announce numbers before that deadline Other candidates who have disclosed their first quarter fund raising include Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  who said she raised more than  5 2 million  and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey  who said he raised more than  5 million   Ms  Klobuchar solicited donations for the general election as well as the primary  so a portion of her total cannot currently be used  Earlier Wednesday  Ms  Warren also disclosed her 2018 tax returns  showing that she earned about  325 000 from her books last year on top of her Senate salary Ms  Warren had previously posted 10 years of her tax returns online  and she has called on her fellow presidential candidates to do the same thing  She has proposed a wide ranging anticorruption bill that would require the disclosure of tax returns for the president  vice president and major party nominees for those offices President Trump has refused to share his tax returns  defying tradition going back decades  The issue of his tax returns is back in the spotlight now that House Democrats have requested them  I ve put out 11 years of my tax returns because no one should ever have to guess who their elected officials are working for   Ms  Warren said in a statement on Wednesday   Doing this should be law  Over all  Ms  Warren and her husband  Bruce H  Mann  a professor at Harvard Law School  had an adjusted gross income of  846 394  Their federal taxes came to  230 965  for an effective federal tax rate of 27 3 percent Ms  Warren s household income would easily place her in the top 1 percent of American households  according to census data A rough estimate of Ms  Warren s income from writing books had already come into public view from the financial disclosure filing that she made after entering the presidential race  That filing showed that she received a  300 000 advance for her latest book   This Fight Is Our Fight  In addition to  324 687 in writing income reported on her tax return  Ms  Warren earned  176 280 from her Senate position  Mr  Mann earned  402 897 from Harvard  Ms  Warren and Mr  Mann reported donating  50 128 to charity Ms  Warren is among several Democratic presidential candidates who have disclosed years of tax returns  Ms  Klobuchar  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Gov  Jay Inslee of Washington have also done so Mr  Sanders said on Tuesday that he would make public 10 years of tax returns by Tax Day on Monday  He  too  has supplemented his Senate salary with income from writing books  I wrote a best selling book   he said   If you write a best selling book  you can be a millionaire  too   

NEW YORK   Sanofi SA said on Wednesday it will cut the cost of its insulin products to  99 per month for uninsured patients and others who pay cash for it in the United States  as the French drugmaker contends with intense criticism over the high price of the life sustaining diabetes medication Sanofi announced the plan hours before one of its executives was set to testify before a congressional committee on the rising prices of insulin  Executives from the other leading insulin producers   Eli Lilly   Co and Novo Nordisk A S   will also testify The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled over a five year period  leading some patients to put their own health at risk by rationing the medication Under its plan  Sanofi said people with diabetes in the United States can buy up to 10 boxes of insulin pens or vials with a valid prescription for  99 per month  beginning in June The price of other manufacturers  leading insulin products is  178 to  300 per vial and  235 to  563 per pack of pens  according to Sanofi The move is an expansion of Sanofi s  Insulin Valyou Savings Program  launched last year and represents a significant savings for patients already enrolled who had been paying  99 for each vial of insulin and  149 for each pack of insulin pens  When you hear us say in our testimony in the hearing tomorrow that it is heartbreaking and no one should have to go without insulin  we mean it   Michelle Carnahan  Head of North America primary care at Sanofi  said in an interview on Tuesday Sanofi is not the first company to cut insulin prices in response to intensifying criticism from patients and politicians  Last month  Eli Lilly announced plans to sell a half price  authorized generic version of its popular Humalog insulin injection  The list price for Lilly s authorized generic  to be sold only in the United States  will be  137 35 per vial Patients with high out of pocket insulin costs can participate in the Sanofi program regardless of their income level  Sanofi said  Under current regulations  it can not offer the plan to patients insured under the government s Medicare or Medicaid programs or similar federal and state health programs In terms of profitability  Sanofi said it believes the pricing program is sustainable for the long term  The company s diabetes business brought in about 2 2 billion euros   2 5 billion  in U S  sales last year Since Sanofi launched its  Insulins Valyou Savings Program  last April around 12 000 patients have utilized the program  saving about  10 million  the company said   Reporting by Michael Erman  Editing by Bill Berkrot  

FRANKFURT   A plan by Qatar s sovereign wealth fund to make a significant investment in Deutsche Bank has stalled  according to two people with knowledge of the matter The Qatar Investment Authority  QIA  approached financial regulators months ago to seek approval to buy a big stake in Germany s largest lender  the people said  Qatar s royal family already holds a combined 6 1 percent stake in Deutsche Bank  But Qatari officials haven t yet provided the necessary documentation  which could derail the QIA s investment plans  they said  It was unclear whether the fund had lost interest or whether it was simply taking its time  The QIA initially expressed an interest taking a stake well before Deutsche Bank announced on March 17 that it was in talks to merge with German rival Commerzbank  The issue is sensitive because the European Central Bank  ECB  may ask Deutsche to raise fresh funds to approve any deal QIA  Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment  Rumours of the investment have been reported by various media outlets for months  Because of the Qatari royal family s existing stake in Deutsche Bank  an investment by QIA would trigger a standard background check by regulators on the shareholders to determine whether they were acting in concert to exert greater influence on the bank The royal family s stake is already among the largest of any shareholder  Other major shareholders include the U S  investors BlackRock and Cerberus  and Chinese conglomerate HNA The royal family has lost money on its initial investment but the small Gulf nation considers itself a long term strategic investor in Deutsche Bank  Qatar is home to a financial centre  which the family considers an important pillar of the economy  It also considers Germany an ally as it faces a blockade by its neighbours Some major investors have been sceptical about a possible merger between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank  questioning the logic and also the timing of a deal Deutsche Bank has said little or no capital may be needed for a deal  But regulators have been worried about the tie up amid doubts that a merger would strengthen Deutsche s sprawling global investment bank Deutsche has said it has already taken steps to shore up the investment bank  and a spokesman said on Friday there was  no basis  for the assumption that the ECB would ask it to raise fresh funds German government officials  led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz  have pushed for the merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over the banks  future A preliminary decision on whether the banks plan to go forward with a merger is expected within days   Reporting by Hans Seidenstucker  John O Donnell and Tom Sims  Additional reporting by Saeed Azhar and Davide Barbuscia in Dubai  Editing by Ludwig Burger and Mark Potter

Three teenagers were charged this week in connection with a January fire that destroyed the Shakespeare Theater in Stratford  Conn   a 1 500 seat venue that once featured performances by Oscar winning actors The theater  which opened in 1955 and closed about three decades later  was modeled after the Globe Theater in England  which burned down in the 17th century  The Connecticut theater once featured performances by Katharine Hepburn  Helen Hayes and Christopher Walken On Jan  13 at about 1 a m   a fire was reported at the Shakespeare Theater  and the building was ultimately reduced to a smoldering mound of mangled steel Frank J  Riccio II  the lawyer for one of the teenagers  said in a phone interview on Monday that his 18 year old client was charged with arson  burglary  reckless endangerment and criminal trespass in connection with the theater fire  Mr  Riccio would not identify his client  who was 17 at the time of the fire The Associated Press reported that the Stratford Police Department issued a statement on Monday saying that two teenagers  17 and 18  were charged with setting the fire and were not named because they were minors at the time  The teenagers were also charged with setting fire to a truck On Tuesday  the police said that a third juvenile was arrested in connection with the same incidents ImageSupporters were trying to revitalize the 1 500 seat Shakespeare Theater  which had been closed since the late 1980s CreditThomas McDonald for The New York TimesThe Connecticut Post reported that all three of the teenagers had their cases transferred to adult court Mayor Laura Hoydick of Stratford  a town of about 50 000  told The Hartford Courant that she was saddened by the news that two young people were charged with the crime  adding   Hopefully this doesn t impact the rest of their lives  The Shakespeare Theater opened in 1955 with a performance of  Julius Caesar  and became central to the production of Shakespearean plays in America  The idea for an American Shakespeare theater was credited to the playwright and producer Lawrence Langner  who enlisted the help of Lincoln Kirstein  co founder of the New York City Ballet  and the philanthropist Joseph Verner Reed The building was constructed from angelique teak  a gift of the French government  It started as a rich brown color and gradually turned to a silvery gray over years of exposure to the elements  Roberta Krensky Cooper wrote in her book  The American Shakespeare Theatre  Stratford   The auditorium s seats were upholstered with red corduroy  and there was a lounge that looked out on the Housatonic River Ms  Cooper wrote that the theater was representative of Americans  attempt to develop an approach to Shakespeare s works that was homegrown and  non British   But there was a constant tension between finances and artistic integrity  she wrote By 1982  the theater had run out of money and benefactors  and the state took ownership  In 2005  the town reclaimed the deed and struggled to figure out what to do with it A group of supporters had been working to revitalize the site in recent years  After the fire  the mayor  Ms  Hoydick  established a committee to decide what to do with the property on which the theater was situated  

WASHINGTON   The House Democratic campaign arm is nearing open warfare with the party s rising liberal wing as political operatives close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to shut down primary challenges before what is likely to be a hard fought campaign next year to preserve the party s shaky majority Progressive Democrats were infuriated last month when Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois  the chairwoman of the campaign arm  the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  moved to protect centrist incumbents by formally breaking committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who go to work for primary challengers Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  Democrat of New York  who owes her seat to a successful primary challenge  went so far as to encourage her 3 8 million Twitter followers to  pause  their donations to the campaign committee in protest  She also started a fund raising push on her official Twitter account for Representatives Jahana Hayes of Connecticut  Katie Hill of California and Mike Levin of California  That initiative  Ms  Ocasio Cortez said on Twitter  raised  30 000 in roughly two hours  She also helped raise money for Representatives Katie Porter of California and Lauren Underwood of Illinois The open hostilities are just the latest in the rising tensions between an experienced party establishment focusing on what is possible in the short run and a group of young liberals chafing at such restraint  House Democrats have divided over single payer  Medicare for all  versus incremental legislation to bolster the Affordable Care Act and over Ms  Ocasio Cortez s Green New Deal versus less ambitious climate change policies  Liberal Democrats and more moderate newcomers from Republican leaning districts have fought over Republican procedural motions And divisions on health care  climate change  military spending and tax policy convinced the House Budget Committee chairman  John Yarmuth of Kentucky  last week to give up on drafting a budget that would have laid down a broad legislative agenda for the new Democrat controlled House Now that tension has migrated to the mechanics of the 2020 campaign Ms  Bustos s rule prohibits Democratic consultants and vendors working for a primary challenger to an incumbent from receiving work from the committee  It comes as ardent liberal organizations like Justice Democrats  emboldened by a pair of high profile wins in 2018   Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ms  Ocasio Cortez   are aggressively gearing up to challenge centrist or old line Democrats with liberal candidates In the latest swipe in a fight that has erupted into open hostilities  a coalition of progressive groups on Friday introduced an online database of go to vendors for insurgent candidates emblazoned with the heading   Despite the D C C C  s bullying  we re still going to work on primaries  One group  the Progressive Change Campaign Committee  said Friday that it was exploring a challenge against Representative Richard E  Neal of Massachusetts  the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee  because he has not committed to holding hearings on the single payer health care system known as  Medicare for all   At the helm of that panel  Mr  Neal has been on the front lines of conducting oversight on President Trump s finances  and last week requested six years of his personal tax returns  We reject the D C C C  s attempt to hoard power  which will only serve to keep that talent pool   and Congress itself   disproportionately white and male   Mara Urbina  the national political director for Indivisible  a progressive grass roots group  said of the campaign committee   Incumbents who engage fully with their constituents shouldn t fear primaries and shouldn t rely on the national institutions like the D C C C  to suppress challenges before voters ever have a say  Party leaders and the campaign arm have stood by Ms  Bustos s moves  arguing that the committee s mandate is to protect the new majority by protecting incumbents   and that putting a longstanding rule in writing simply increases transparency  Primary challenges  even in solid Democratic districts  harm the mission of holding the majority  they argue  because incumbents fighting a primary challenge cannot raise money and help other Democrats in more marginal districts  I support the notion that the primary purpose of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is to elect Democrats in tough districts  so we can either win the majority or hold the majority   said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York  the No  4 Democrat A spokesman for the committee said that Ms  Bustos  who hails from a Midwestern district that voted for Mr  Trump in 2016  was fulfilling a campaign promise she made to Democrats that as the chairwoman  she would support incumbents  And some at the campaign arm are frustrated that the codification of the longstanding policy has received more attention than the enforcement of a new rule that requires vendors to meet certain diversity standards  including employing more racially diverse  veteran  lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender or disabled staff The new policy is unlikely to change  But the ire from the left flank may only grow  Primaries are often the only way that underrepresented and working class people are able to have a shot at pursuing elected office   Ms  Ocasio Cortez said   I think that it can reduce the odds of us getting really strong representation  We need to have kind of a farm system for the next generation  Other House Democrats  such as Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin  a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus  are taking a cooler tone  But on Thursday  he could not resist a jab at Ms  Bustos on the radio program  The Bill Press Show   We were trying to keep this in the family  but unfortunately this morning  I saw Cheri Bustos  after she asked us not to do it publicly  came out and decided to talk about it   he said   The progressive caucus doesn t go out and recruit people to run against incumbents  but I think it looks awful for the Democratic Party to be undemocratic   It s the wrong path for us to be taking   he continued   This was a misguided action  and rather than review it  she s trying to double down on it  The decision has pleased moderates and veterans in the more centrist New Democrat Coalition  in the Blue Dog Coalition  a fiscally conservative group of Democrats  and in the Congressional Black Caucus  who have been angered by some of the incumbents that outside liberal groups have chosen to target  Many of the candidates wooed in the last campaign cycle by Justice Democrats would have run in districts that lean Republican  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had to work hard to beat those challenges back  worried that a triumph by Justice Democrats in the primary would have cost the party a possible victory in the general election Defending the campaign arm s decision  Representative James E  Clyburn of South Carolina  the majority whip  recalled a past primary against Representative Bennie Thompson  Democrat of Mississippi  An African American got in the race against him running to his right and then he looked up and there was this Democratic pollster working for his opponent   Mr  Clyburn told National Journal   He s paying dues to the D C C C   who s giving a contract to that person and then that person ended up working for that opponent  There s something wrong with that   

As the Democratic field for 2020 gets more crowded  several fresh young faces have begun to emerge  There s Beto O Rourke  46  a Texas congressman who lost his Senate race against Ted Cruz last year  There s Mayor Pete  last name Buttigieg   just 37 and a gay veteran  who runs the city of South Bend  Ind   pop  102 245   There s the longer shot Andrew Yang  44  corporate lawyer turned do gooder entrepreneur  who is campaigning on the promise of a universal basic income  And now  there is Tim Ryan  45  a congressman from Ohio best known for challenging Nancy Pelosi for the speakership The Democrats vying for 2020 run a remarkable age gamut  Mr  Buttigieg is the youngest and Bernie Sanders  at 77  is the oldest  The prominent female candidates cluster more in the middle  Kirsten Gillibrand is the youngest at 52  and Elizabeth Warren is the oldest at 69  with Kamala Harris  54  and Amy Klobuchar  58  in the middle  But whether a youngish candidate is bright  brilliant and promising or inexperienced  off putting and ruthlessly ambitious depends on whether the young thing in question is male or female  Promise  itself is gendered  Research consistently shows that in American workplaces  women tend to be promoted once their managers see them perform well  men are promoted if managers believe in their potential to do well  We re running the same experiment in politics  Voters  donors and journalists are all excited by the great leadership potential of young men who leapfrog up the political ladder  They expect women to prove themselves before they move forward And so women don t move forward as quickly  Women are more likely than men to enter politics later in life  having spent years shoring up the experience  accomplishments and recognition necessary to be considered credible contenders for higher office  Women start low and climb up  which means they may not climb as high  Women also tend to run for more collaborative legislative positions  school board  state legislature  Congress  rather than executive ones  mayor  governor  president   Men do the opposite  seeking executive roles  starting early and skipping ahead Essentially all of the women running for president built their political lives in legislative bodies  and all but one also worked in law  Even the prominent young Democratic women making headlines outside of the presidential campaigns   Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  Ilhan Omar  Ayanna Pressley   are doing so in this more traditionally female way of a step by step rise through legislative bodies  The female presidential contenders have not generally been elected to major executive roles   Nearly two thirds of the men have In a political environment where  fresh faces  are rewarded  this gives men an advantage   It also seems to be largely benefiting white men this time around   just ask Julin Castro  44  whose longer  ladder climbing rsum has resulted in anemic press coverage   We want something new  but for women  unfamiliarity and youth end up being tied to incompetence  Take Mr  Buttigieg  an indisputably intelligent and thoughtful man  whose youth has been wrought to his advantage   When you run young  your face says you represent change   Mr  Buttigieg told The Washington Post  Reporters deem him  authoritative and logical and very young   noting that he s  at the forefront of a new crop of political leaders   He started his political career with a bid for Indiana state treasurer  he lost   then for mayor of South Bend  he won  then won re election  and then for Democratic National Committee chairman  he dropped out   Now he s seeking what would be his second executive role  president of the United States ImageKirsten Gillibrand kicked off her 2020 presidential campaign in front of the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan last month CreditChristopher Lee for The New York TimesContrast that with Kirsten Gillibrand  who may now be solidly in middle age  but was a bright young thing once  too  Like Mr  Buttigieg  she went from college to graduate school  Oxford for him  U C L A  Law for her  and then into the kind of corporate job increasingly considered a political liability on the left  management consulting for him  a law firm for her   From there  Ms  Gillibrand did the more typically female thing  climbing the ladder rung by rung  She worked on Hillary Clinton s Senate campaign  then ran for Congress in a traditionally red district in New York before being appointed to complete Mrs  Clinton s Senate term  she won re election herself  twice  Only now  after more than a decade in legislative roles  is she running for president It s not just women s and men s paths that look different  it s also how reporters tell their stories  Ms  Gillibrand s red district folksiness got her branded by some as  a country bumpkin who is in over her head   Mr  Buttigieg s is cast as a bonus   he doesn t wear a jacket   I just feel more comfortable with my sleeves rolled up   he said  and can win in a red state Ms  Gillibrand entered the Senate as its youngest member  a designation that was an immediate liability  Although she was at times called a  rising star   she was caricatured as a clawing Tracy Flick  ambitious but unwilling to pay her dues  Her  aggressiveness seems almost gauche  even for a politician   a journalist wrote  She was cast as  a young woman in a hurry  Few seem worried that Mr  Buttigieg is in a hurry  Instead  people wonder whether America is ready for a millennial president  a question not asked in relation to the admittedly unlikely Tulsi Gabbard  also 37 Consider too that the years in which one is considered a fresh face or a rising star coincide with the years in which most Americans have children  Mr  O Rourke  the father of three young children  has spoken  in a tone deaf way  for which he later apologized  about his wife doing the work at home so that he could be away running for office multiple times  Mr  O Rourke  who is 46  is cast as young even by his detractors   a young man who s got very little going for himself   President Trump grumbled   Does the youthful label come from having young kids  His are 8  10 and 12  But Ms  Gillibrand also became a parent in her mid 30s  and her sons are 10 and 15 Trevor Noah was certainly right when he said that at 52  Ms  Gillibrand is not exactly a  young mom   But since when is a 46 year old a  young man   Both of them would be younger than the average American president  who is a touch over 55   a statistic that includes a great many men born at a time when many people weren t expected to live much past 40 While Ms  Gillibrand was called  Senator Working Mom   Mr  O Rourke s status as a parent has been just one part of his story  not the core of it  After losing his Senate race  he took an extended solo road trip to clear his head and blog  or write  in a literary online diary    A jaunt that would be portrayed as child abandonment had a woman done it  could help him politically  advancing his offbeat brand   reporters mused  Few fretted about who was watching his children Women typically find their family responsibilities to be less flexible  Elizabeth Warren was a young mother and a young law professor at the same time  according to a law school friend  she was also doing all of her family s shopping  cooking and child care  and nearly dropped out of the work force as a result  One doesn t imagine a Kerouac style road trip was on the table for Ms  Warren as a young mom   and certainly not dreams of the presidency  That all came much later  as it does for most women  And later  of course  means older Unfortunately for women  age poses an unsolvable problem  They are seen as too young and inexperienced right up until they are branded too old and tedious  Ms  Warren  for example  finds herself put in the same  old  category as Mr  Sanders and Joe Biden  even though both men are nearly a decade older than she is  Men who are more or less the same age as Ms  Warren   Sherrod Brown  66   John Hickenlooper  67   Jay Inslee  68    are not lumped in with the white hairs

BRUSSELS   European Union lawmakers have backed plans to fine Facebook  Google  Twitter and other online platforms if they fail to remove extremist content within one hour The measures have been brought into sharper focus after the live streaming on one of Facebook s platforms of shootings by a lone gunman  killing 50 people at two New Zealand mosques in March The EU s draft law  including fines of up to 4 percent of annual global turnover  was endorsed by member states last year  However  concerns that the measures would hurt smaller online platforms or encroach on civil rights had stalled Monday s vote The EU assembly s justice and home affairs committee voted 35 to 1  with 8 absentions  in favor of the proposal  which now requires approval in a plenary vote next week and negotiations among the EU s three lawmaking bodies The first hour is the most vital to stemming the further viral spread of online content  EU officials say  moving to regulate after they judged that internet companies were not doing enough under voluntary measures Facebook said it removed 1 5 million videos containing footage of the New Zealand attack in the first 24 hours after the shootings Worries the new rules are lacking and could be misused have been expressed by three U N  special rapporteurs for human rights and by the EU s own rights watchdog Companies rely on a mix of automated tools and human moderators to spot and delete extremist content  However  when illegal content is taken down from one platform  it often crops up on another   straining authorities  ability to police the web In response to industry concerns that smaller platforms do not have the same resources to comply as speedily with tougher EU rules  lawmakers said authorities should take into account the size and revenue of companies concerned Those facing their first removal order would also receive an additional 12 hours to comply  Draft measures call on the bloc s national governments to put in place the tools to identify extremist content online and an appeals procedure The one hour rule would apply from the point of notification by national authorities and companies would face penalities over a  systematic failure  to comply However  lawmakers opted to drop a draft requirement for the monitoring of content uploaded or shared on their sites for signs of illegal activity  We risk the over removal of content as businesses would understandably take a safety first approach   said Daniel Dalton  a British lawmaker responsible for shepherding the bill through the house   It also absolutely cannot lead to a general monitoring of content by the back door  Brussels has been at the forefront of a push by regulators worldwide to force tech companies to take greater responsibility for content on their sites  Britain on Monday also proposed new rules that would penalize companies that fail to protect users from harmful content   Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel  Editing by David Goodman

WASHINGTON   The Education Department failed to approve a single application for federal student loan relief in the second half of last year  according to new department data that signals that students who claim they were cheated by their colleges cannot count on help from Washington anytime soon The department neither approved nor denied any relief claims filed by students under the so called borrower defense program from June to December 2018  even after a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration s foot dragging was illegal  In October  the judge ordered the Education Department to enforce a long delayed Obama era rule that expanded and expedited loan relief for defrauded students  many of whom attended for profit colleges Amid that inaction  the number of pending claims has swelled to more than 150 000   over double the number of applications the department inherited from the previous administration  And with no firm timeline to process them  advocates say the department has referred borrowers to the Treasury Department to have their tax refunds garnished to offset debts that have piled up while their claim is pending Liz Hill  a spokeswoman for the Education Department  blamed the delay on the swirl of lawsuits filed by advocates pressing for a more generous response to loan relief applicants  Pending litigation has slowed down the department s processing to provide relief to additional borrowers   Ms  Hill said   We will fully implement the 2016 borrower defense regulations and ensure those who qualify for discharge receive it  About 22 000 approved applications that are waiting to be discharged are delayed because of lawsuits  the department said  as it  continues to assess alternatives to provide a fair  balanced and consistent approach for legitimate borrower defense applications  Ms  Hill added that the department was taking steps to increase its capacity to manage applications  which in recent months have been coming in at nearly 2 000 a week Last month  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos offered no such assurances when pressed by senators about the backlog  Don t you have a heart   Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the No  2 Democrat  asked Ms  DeVos at a hearing on the department s budget  where he cited 140 000  victim students waiting on your department to give them relief so they can get on with their lives  He noted that many of the students were defrauded by predatory for profit schools  which Ms  DeVos has been accused of favoring with her policies  Nine percent of high school graduates go to for profit colleges and universities  but 34 percent of loan defaults belong to those students  No student should be defrauded  and if fraud is involved  there are consequences  and there will be consequences   Ms  DeVos replied   But we should not be judging institutions by their tax status  Let s be very honest here  there are bad actors on both sides of the equation  She added  with some indignance   Let s talk about the nonprofits that are doing a bad job  that are subject to bribes  that are lying in order to improve their U S  News and World Report statistics   referring to the recent college admissions scandal rocking Ivy League and other elite institutions  Since taking office  Ms  DeVos has tried to overhaul the 2016 process started by the Obama administration that was supposed to pave an easier road for students to secure loan relief after their colleges are found to have misled them with inflated claims of false promises of jobs  The Obama administration approved nearly 30 000 such claims  estimated at  450 million  in its last year in office  The Education Department approved 16 155 from Jan  1  2017 to December 31  2018 The Obama administration rewrote the borrower defense rule  which was virtually unknown until 2015  when two large for profit chains  ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges  began to crumble  The new rule was supposed to take effect in 2017 But Ms  DeVos delayed issuing what she said amounted to  free money  and has moved to narrow its scope to only forgive debts of students who  regardless of their schools  actions  fail to secure gainful employment and can prove they were otherwise harmed A 2017 report from the department s inspector general found that the Obama process had some flaws  Ms  DeVos  instituted a tiered system to grant some borrowers partial relief  but those measures were struck down by the courts  The department then blew a deadline to rewrite the rules  which were supposed to go into force this year Ms  Hill  the department spokeswoman  said that under Ms  DeVos  the department has discharged nearly 50 000 borrower defense claims  the bulk of which were queued up by the Obama administration  totaling more than  534 million She said it has also enforced part of the 2016 Obama regulation that automatically relieves students of debt when a school closes  As of February  the department discharged approximately 51 000 loans for 15 000 borrowers  totaling more than  158 million But applications have continued to pile up as the department charts its next move Education Department officials released data in response to a request from Senator Patty Murray  Democrat of Washington  showing that it still had 158 000 pending claims  The data covered the period from September to December  but officials wrote that those had not changed since the previous quarter The department did not say whether it has approved or denied any borrower defense claims in 2019  There s nothing stopping Secretary DeVos from providing relief to struggling borrowers today  and she needs to begin approving claims immediately so students who were cheated out of their education and savings get the relief they are entitled to   Ms  Murray said in a statement Eileen Connor  the director of litigation at Harvard Law School s Project on Predatory Student Lending  said that she had borrowers who had claims pending from as far back as four years The project  which represents thousands of students from ITT Tech and Corinthian  said that it had over 14 000 applications from ITT Tech pending at the department  Only 33 have been approved  and those were by the Obama administration  Zero have been approved under Ms  DeVos Debt on the loans has continued to grow  Ms  Connor said  In lawsuits  the group has described how borrowers have experienced anxiety  fear and psychological and financial distress caused by delays The project has won several lawsuits against Ms  DeVos  But it said that the department continued to ignore crucial court rulings  including one that found the department could not take tax refunds of former Corinthian College students to pay their student loans while they have borrower defense applications pending  The department s delay is not neutral   Ms  Connor said   It s harming students   

WASHINGTON NEW YORK   President Donald Trump said on Friday the U S  Federal Reserve should lower interest rates and take other unconventional measures to ease pressure on an economy that he said they slowed down  I think they should drop rates   Trump told reporters   I think they really slowed us down  There s no inflation  The U S  president also suggested that the central bank pursue an unconventional monetary policy called  quantitative easing  that was used to nurse the economy back after the global financial crisis  The technique used from 2008 to 2014 involved buying trillions of government sponsored bonds  It should actually now be quantitative easing   Trump said Trump s repeated public attacks on Fed policy and his intention to nominate two political allies to the central bank s board of governors has led some analysts to see the economic policymaker s cherished independence as under attack  The White House has said it does not wish to undermine the central bank s independence The renewal of quantitative easing  Trump said  should be in addition to interest rate cuts   a likely worrying thought  at this point  for Fed officials who describe such a combination of tactics as only appropriate in a dire downturn On Thursday  Trump said he plans to nominate his political ally Herman Cain  the former head of Godfather s Pizza  to one of two vacancies on the Fed s seven member Board of Governors  Cain runs a political fundraising group that has spent more than half its money supporting Trump s reelection Two weeks ago  Trump said he would nominate conservative economic commentator Stephen Moore to the other vacant seat on the Fed s board  Moore is also a longtime Trump ally who has joined him in criticizing last year s rate hikes The president s top economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  told Bloomberg News that both potential nominees share the view that strong growth does not necessarily cause inflation  which central bankers try to prevent by raising rates Half a dozen Fed officials in recent days have touted the underlying strength of the American economy and argued a recent spate of weak data on business activity is more likely to prove fleeting than lasting  None said they currently back a rate cut and some have said rate hikes may eventually be necessary But a Fed chaired by a Trump appointee  Jerome Powell  has stopped raising rates after four hikes last year  saying that there are enough economic risks  including a slowdown in Europe and China  to warrant patience  The Fed s policy rate is currently between 2 25 and 2 5 percent  This story has been refilled to remove extraneous word in last paragraph    Reporting by Steve Holland in Washington and Trevor Hunnicutt in New York  Additional reporting by Howard Schneider  Writing by David Alexander and David Gregorio  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Susan Thomas

JAKARTA   Armed with laptops  three dozen journalists and fact checkers braced for battle before a live debate between Indonesian President Joko Widodo and his challenger  Prabowo Subianto With two giant screens displaying television network feeds in front of them  the keyboard warriors split into six groups  each responsible for fact checking a segment of the debate For nearly three hours  their eyes barely left their screens as they attempted to verify candidates  comments in real time  allegations about corruption  statistics on the country s Muslim population  boasts  and even personal anecdotes They and other fact checkers are fighting a running battle against fake news and propaganda ahead of an April 17 election in the world s third biggest democracy  Election monitors are worried that the flow of misinformation stoking ethnic and religious divides could undermine electoral bodies and even raise social tensions  The Cekfakta   checkfacts  in Indonesian  initiative brings together the non profit fact checking organisation Mafindo and 24 news organisations that normally compete fiercely with each other during election campaigns   There s a watchdog now in operation   Cekfakta co founder Wahyu Dhyatmika  editor in chief of news website Tempo co  told Reuters   As a candidate  you cannot throw claims into the air     we will fact check them   Backed financially by Google News Lab  which also helps fund Mafindo  Cekfakta s volunteers took over the U S tech giant s swanky Jakarta office for the debate on March 30 Dhyatmika wanted to avoid a repeat of the 2014 election  also between Widodo and retired general Prabowo  when reporters were unprepared for the flood of false news that swept across social media  WE RE IN A WAR The fact checkers  adversaries  fake news peddlers  sit at screens too  pumping out misinformation disguised as fact that often exploits ethnic or religious divides  We re in a war for content     people are doing anything they want   said one fake news creator  who has written stories depicting Indonesian officials as paid off by Beijing  The person declined to be identified because such work is illegal Indonesia s population of 269 million has a youthful median age of just over 30 years  according to the World Population Review With more than 100 million accounts  the country is Facebook s third largest market and a top five market globally for its platforms WhatsApp and Instagram  as well as rival Twitter Fake news in Indonesia can rack up thousands of views in hours  despite laws against creating and spreading such content Mafindo s head of fact checking  Aribowo Sasmito  compares it to the drug trade  There are the factories  the dealers  and the victims  Most of the people who end up arrested are victims     They read hoaxes and believed them to be true  Since December  Mafindo has documented a surge in political fake news using ethnicity and religion to target both candidates The organisation finds most worrisome the dozens of stories that paint electoral bodies as corrupt  This will be only Indonesia s fourth democratic presidential election  Sasmito considers it a good result if fact checked posts can reach even a small fraction of the audience the originals did  Mafindo s work has made it some enemies  The group has received enough threats that it keeps its office address secret  Cefakta s website was hacked after a previous debate A Reuters investigation in March found that both the Prabowo and Widodo campaigns were funding sophisticated social media operations to spread propaganda and disinformation through fake accounts on behalf of the candidates   L3N20Z2EH Both campaigns said they did not use such teams FAKE NEWS CREATORSOne journalist said he was hired by Prabowo campaign advisers to write positive stories about Prabawo and negative ones on Widodo  to be posted on Facebook and WhatsApp  He said he was not motivated by money but believes the mainstream media is biased in favour of Widodo Fearing government retaliation  the man declined to be named  but he showed Reuters communications that suggested he was he in contact with Prabowo advisers  He said he wrote only  true  negative stories  and cited as an example a post that 2 000 Chinese workers on Indonesia s Sulawesi island were secretly part of the Chinese People s Liberation Army   We have evidence from government contacts and we can see they are soldiers from the way they look   he said  declining to share such evidence Prabowo campaign spokesman Andre Rosiadi denied any advisers had hired journalists to write  positive or negative content  and  especially not fake news  Asked about the Sulawesi allegation  a spokeswoman for the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia replied to Reuters in a text   fake news  But such claims also make it onto the campaign trail  A Prabowo campaign volunteer in West Java told Reuters last week that millions of Chinese workers had been secretly relocated to Sulawesi  It s not hoax  it s fact   said volunteer Cecep Abdul Halim Reuters found that the creator of the Sulawesi claim had also written stories in 2016 falsely depicting former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjaha Purnama as a Communist stooge of China  Purnama  a Christian ethnic Chinese Indonesian ally of Widodo  recently completed a two year prison sentence for blasphemy against Islam based on a video doctored to make him seem he was insulting the Koran  The man convicted of making the video  a former journalist  worked for Prabowo s media team until he was sent to prison last month  A campaign spokesman confirmed he had worked for the media team  but did not comment further  Social media data gathered by Mafindo as well as Indonesian big data consultancy Drone Emprit shows that allegations using China as a bogeyman are widespread in Indonesia  where suspicions about the wealth of the ethnic Chinese community and the influence of Beijing run deep A disproven video that went viral in January claimed to show seven shipping containers from China at Jakarta s port filled with millions of ballots punctured in favour of Widodo Common misinformation themes against Widodo portray him alternatively as a member of Indonesia s banned Communist party  a Chinese plant  or anti Islam Prabowo  meanwhile  has been depicted as both impious and planning to create a caliphate  while his running mate has been portrayed inaccurately as gay  All are inflammatory accusations in the world s largest Muslim majority country  which rights groups say recently has seen increased prejudice against religious and LGBT minorities And the stories work  Although Widodo enjoys a double digit lead over Prabowo  three surveys found that a minority of the population believes that he is either a communist or a Christian According to a December poll  as many as 42 percent of Prabowo supporters believed this about Widodo  while 65 percent of Widodo supporters believed Prabowo kidnapped democracy activists while in the military  a claim he strenuously denies Experts say such polarisation is dangerous for Indonesia and could stoke anger against minorities  This kind of fake news gains traction because they re the seeds of intolerance in our society   said Cefakta s Dhyatmika   And it s not being addressed     Reporting by Fanny Potkin in JAKARTA and Agustinus Beo

NEW DELHI   It is the biggest election in history Across India  from the Himalayan mountains to the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal  the first wave of millions of citizens started casting ballots Thursday in a five week long vote to choose a new Parliament  which will select a prime minister India is the world s largest democracy  the most populous nation after China  and a pivotal geopolitical power  And it has never before held an election of this magnitude  900 million eligible voters  at least 11 million poll workers  2 3 million electronic voting machines  2 000 political parties  and special trains  boats  helicopters and even elephants to transport voting equipment ImageChecking an electoral list in Alipurduar CreditRupak De Chowdhuri ReutersThe race is a referendum on Narendra Modi  the powerful prime minister who is up for re election  One of the most polarizing figures India has produced in decades  Mr  Modi has championed an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics that strives to elevate India s Hindu identity but has sharply divided this country Many Indians appreciate his intensity  which he constantly demonstrates in huge rallies where hundreds of thousands of people gather under the hot sun to hear him thunder about being India s watchman   his new campaign slogan   and how he is the best candidate to preside over this dizzyingly diverse nation of 1 3 billion On Thursday evening  the Election Commission of India said that the first phase of voting   which involved more than 140 million voters in 20 states and federal territories   had been free  fair and peaceful  and that in some places  turnout topped 80 percent But there were a number of complaints about malfunctioning voting machines  and opposition parties in a few areas said that security forces or poll workers had coerced people to vote for Mr  Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party Chaos erupted at one polling station in the state of Andhra Pradesh when supporters of rival parties attacked each other  At least one man was killed At the Merry Angels Public School just outside the capital  New Delhi  the vast majority of more than a dozen voters interviewed on Thursday morning said they had voted for Mr  Modi s party  I m not even that happy with Modi   said Vikas Kumar Sau  a rickshaw driver who complained about slum housing and police harassment   But everyone else was voting for him  so I thought I might as well too  The voters moved through long lines to have their identification cards checked and then stepped into cardboard voting booths  where they pushed a button on a long tablet that showed the candidates  names  photographs and party symbols  which varied from a flower and soccer ball to a pair of scissors  All this unfolded quietly  The loudest sound was the electronic ding after each vote was cast A large number of Indians believe that the Modi administration has been more effective  less corrupt and better at positioning India on the world stage than past governments But his party has also alienated minorities and created fear  Intellectuals blame the Hindu nationalist atmosphere stoked by Mr  Modi and the party for a rash of lynchings and other violence against Muslims and lower caste Indians The latest surveys predict that Mr  Modi  68  will return to power  But voter discontent over India s economic challenges  especially rising joblessness  is likely to reduce the number of parliamentary seats his party controls  That could hamper his ability to push the Hindu nationalist agenda further ImageMr

facing India and its 900 million voters In the last election  in 2014  Mr  Modi s party stunned the country by winning an outright majority in the lower house of Parliament  which has 543 elected seats  By picking up even more seats through alliances with smaller parties  he then built a political juggernaut that went on to dominate Indian politics But this time around  few expect such a tidal wave  Though Mr  Modi remains popular among many in the middle class and across northern India s Hindu heartland  more poor Indians are turning against him Farmers in many states have organized protests  furious that Mr  Modi has not delivered on promises to strengthen crop prices  In urban areas  anti Modi feelings are building as well  Rising inflation and unemployment have become liabilities for him India s economy is still growing at a fast rate  around 7 percent a year  Technology companies are popping up across the landscape  passenger jets are almost always packed  and more Indian students are attending the world s best universities  India now is the sixth largest economy  powered by its sheer scale But many gains have been captured by a tiny elite  Poverty lurks in every corner of this country  from New Delhi s busiest intersections to the sharecropper cotton farms across central India This leaves the leading opposition party  the center left Indian National Congress  an opportunity to capture more seats than in the last election  which it lost badly  But most polling data suggests Congress will be a distant second to Mr  Modi s  with slim prospects of forming the next government Several voters at the polling station outside New Delhi grumbled that Congress hadn t done much for India in all its years in power  A few said they voted for neither Congress nor the B J P  but for  the elephant   the symbol of the Bahujan Samaj Party  a party formed by members of lower castes The biggest criticism of Congress  which won India freedom from Britain and ruled for most of India s independent history  is that it has failed to articulate a clear vision  The party historically has championed minority rights  Its socialist policies have helped improve education and empower lower castes But as Mr  Modi s party has pulled India rightward  the Congress party has struggled to respond Rasheed Kidwai  author of several books on the Congress party  said it lacked  that kind of hunger for power that the B J P  has  The party also cannot shake its reputation as a family dynasty  embodied by its leader  Rahul Gandhi ImageCarrying equipment to a remote

NAIROBI  Kenya   Four days after her toddler s health took a turn for the worse  his tiny body racked by fever  diarrhea and vomiting  Sharon Mbone decided it was time to try yet another medicine With no money to see a doctor  she carried him to the local pharmacy stall  a corrugated shack near her home in Kibera  a sprawling impoverished community here in Nairobi  The shop s owner  John Otieno  listened as she described her 22 month old son s symptoms and rattled off the pharmacological buffet of medicines he had dispensed to her over the previous two weeks  None of them  including four types of antibiotics  were working  she said in despair Like most of the small shopkeepers who provide on the spot diagnosis and treatment here and across Africa and Asia  Mr  Otieno does not have a pharmacist s degree or any medical training at all  Still  he confidently reached for two antibiotics that he had yet to sell to Ms  Mbone  See if these work   he said as she handed him 1 500 shillings for both  about  15  Like the Science Times page on Facebook    Sign up for the Science Times newsletter  Antibiotics  the miracle drugs credited with saving tens of millions of lives  have never been more accessible to the world s poor  thanks in large part to the mass production of generics in China and India  Across much of the developing world  it costs just a few dollars to buy drugs like amoxicillin  a first line antibiotic that can be used against a broad range of infections  from bacterial pneumonia and chlamydia to salmonella  strep throat and Lyme disease Kibera residents are prodigious consumers of antibiotics  One study found that 90 percent of households in Kibera had used antibiotics in the previous year  compared with about 17 percent for the typical American family ImageSharon Mbone washing clothes outside her home in Kibera CreditAndrew Renneisen for The New York TimesBut the increasing availability of antibiotics has accelerated an alarming downside  The drugs are losing their ability to kill the germs they were created to conquer  Hard wired to survive  many bacteria have evolved to outsmart the medications And as these mutant bacteria commingle with other pathogens in sewage canals  hospital wards and livestock pens  they can share their genetic resistance traits  making other micro organisms impervious to antibiotics Antibiotic resistance is a global threat  but it is often viewed as a problem in rich countries  where comfortably insured patients rush to the doctor to demand prescriptions at the slightest hint of a cough or cold In fact  urban poverty is a huge and largely unappreciated driver of resistance  And so  the rise of resistant microbes is having a disproportionate impact on poor countries  where squalid and crowded living conditions  lax oversight of antibiotic use and a scarcity of affordable medical care are fueling the spread of infections increasingly unresponsive to drugs  We can t effectively mitigate the growing problem of antibiotic resistance without dealing with places like Kibera   said Dr  Guy H  Palmer  a researcher at Washington State University who studies resistance in Africa   There are a billion people living in similar situations  and as long as they aren t getting clean water and basic sanitation  all of us are at risk  VideoBacteria are rebelling  They re turning the tide against antibiotics by outsmarting our wonder drugs  This video explores the surprising reasons Worldwide  resistant pathogens already claim 700 000 lives each year  according to one British study  Resistance here in Kenya is not just a potential calamity for future generations  Lack of effective treatment is already claiming thousands of lives each year  many of them young children whose immune systems have yet to fully develop  according to government figures Sam Kariuki  a researcher at the Kenya Medical Research Institute who has been studying resistance for two decades  said nearly 70 percent of salmonella infections in Kenya had stopped responding to the most widely available antibiotics  up from 45 percent in the early 2000s Salmonella kills roughly 45 000 Kenyan children every year  or nearly one in three who fall severely ill with it  he said  In the United States  the mortality rate is close to zero  We are quickly running out of treatment options

2019What You Need to Know About Candida AurisApril 6  2019In some cases  vendors sell counterfeit antibiotics that contain none of the active ingredient  or so little that they accelerate resistance  Even when the drugs are authentic  many poor Kenyans try to save money by buying just a few tablets instead of the full course   not enough to vanquish an infection but enough to allow bacteria to mutate and gain resistance  Who am I to deny them what they want   asked Lena Ochomba  40  a pharmacy stall owner in Kibera who earns most of her income selling antibiotics  often three or four pills at a time   an amount that is one third or less of the recommended course for most antibiotics   Even when I manage to sell the whole box  my customers rarely take them all because they think it s just too many pills  ImageA pharmacy in Kibera  Pharmacy stalls often sell antibiotics in amounts that are far less than the recommended course CreditAndrew Renneisen for The New York TimesPoor sanitation  rampant diseaseThere is no escaping human waste in Kibera  It oozes from shallow  hand dug latrines  pools into rivulets and finally builds into a black river At night  feces filled plastic bags are tossed from rooftops by those afraid to venture outdoors  Residents call them flying toilets Ms  Mbone and her husband have become inured to the sight and smell of untreated sewage that flows in front of their one room shack  With no other place to play  their son  Shane  and his 3 year old sister sometimes end up frolicking in the muck   They are kids  they will always go outside to play   said Ms  Mbone  19   How can you stop them  A plastic bucket brimming with store bought medicine is a testament to the ailments that have dogged Shane for most of his short life  Born prematurely  he spent his first few weeks in a clinic and then at a hospital  Even with subsidized care  the medical bills came to roughly  200  equivalent to 10 months of wages that Ms  Mbone s husband earns as a bus station porter  Since then  she has been reluctant to take Shane to a doctor   I m worried if I go to a bigger hospital  the bill will be bigger too   she said Ms  Mbone isn t convinced that the unsanitary conditions are to blame for Shane s health problems  Other children play in Kibera s drainage ditches  she noted  while few are bedeviled by the constant diarrhea that afflicts her son ImageMs  Mbone having breakfast with her son  Shane  who has been ill and taking antibiotics CreditAndrew Renneisen for The New York TimesBut epidemiologists and public health experts who have studied Kibera say there is a direct correlation between the community s poor hygiene and the infections that stalk nearly every household  Harmful bacteria in feces that is allowed to seep into the surrounding soil can survive for months  and in densely populated settlements like Kibera that are veined with dirt paths  they easily find their way into food and water  often by residents who unknowingly carry the pathogens into their homes on shoes or unwashed hands According to a 2012 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  cases of typhoid fever among children in Kibera were 15 times higher than those living in a rural area west of the capital  infections in Kibera were even higher in low lying areas where sewage tends to pool  The study also found that 75 percent of the typhoid strains found there were resistant to commonly available antibiotics  A lack of sanitation leads to more disease  which leads to higher antibiotic use  which leads to greater resistance   said Marc Alain Widdowson  principal deputy director of the C D C  s Division of Global Health Protection for Kenya  which has been doing surveillance work in Kibera since 1979   It s a vicious cycle  Sylvia Adhiambo Omulo  a researcher at Washington State University s global health program who has spent the past several years studying antimicrobial resistance in Kibera  said she was stunned by the ubiquity of resistant pathogens like E  coli  It s in the soil  it s on the kale people eat  and also on the hands of adults and children   she said one afternoon as she trudged through Kibera s muddy footpaths  dodging children  stray dogs and the occasional chicken   It s no wonder people here are constantly sick  ImageWashing clothes in a stream polluted with sewage  Human waste is unavoidable in Kibera CreditAndrew Renneisen for The New York TimesWhen residents feel unwell  they often turn to people like Mr  Otieno  the roadside drug vendor who wears a white lab coat and keeps the bulb in his stall burning late into the night Ms  Mbone relies on him for affordable drugs  but also for a sympathetic ear and the occasional cash loan   These chemists are my neighbors   she said   I trust their advice  A wiry man with sharp features and a gentle manner  Mr  Otieno  32  is a lifelong resident of Kibera  Unable to find full time work after high school  he spent several years assisting another chemist in the neighborhood until he saved up enough money for his shop With its baby blue interior  medical posters on the wall and a cabinet overflowing with bandages  Mr  Otieno s stall could be mistaken for a health clinic  Despite his lack of training  he said years of hands on experience informed his prescribing decisions  and he knows the antibiotics aren t working because they often don t cure the people who buy them  There s a lot of antibiotic resistance here   he said   That is why people keep coming back to get different antibiotics  ImageThe lobby of

of antibiotics  limited optionsIf Ntihinyuirwa Thade had been conscious  the doctors at Kijabe Mission Hospital would have asked about his medical history  including a list of antibiotics he had taken in recent years  But Mr  Thade  25  a migrant laborer from Rwanda  was on a ventilator and unconscious  having fallen from the upper floor of a building project  He was not wearing a hard hat and suffered a grievous head injury A week after the accident  he was facing a more immediate threat  A Klebsiella pneumonia infection was blossoming in his lungs  Mr  Thade s condition failed to respond to the three antibiotics already flushed into his veins  so his doctor  George Otieno  no relation to Mr  Otieno  the pharmacy stall owner   was preparing to administer the final drug in his limited arsenal  a relatively expensive antibiotic called meropenem   If that doesn t work    he said  his voice trailing off Klebsiella bacteria are omnipresent in the environment   in the soil and in the human gut   but they can turn deadly for people with frayed immunities Dr  Otieno acknowledged that Mr  Thade most likely acquired his through the plastic breathing tube that was keeping him alive

hospitals  is no different Nestled in a verdant valley just outside Nairobi  it boasts top notch equipment and a mix of Kenyan and foreign doctors that draw patients from across the country  But being a referral hospital has a downside  Many people arrive quite sick and have already cycled through a plethora of antibiotics   Oftentimes they have taken every drug that is commonly available   said Dr  Evelyn Mbugua  an internist Mr  Thade was one of several patients that day struggling to overcome resistant bugs  In the pediatric ward  a one month old baby  Blessing Karanja  was fighting a worrisome blood infection  and elsewhere in the hospital  Grace Mutiga  65  a retired nurse  was back again with a tenacious respiratory infection Having taken five different antibiotics over the previous few weeks   drugs purchased at the local pharmacy   Ms  Mutiga was running out of options   We ll have to see if we can get an antibiotic from Nairobi   a doctor said as Ms  Mutiga struggled to catch her breath In Kenya and other emerging economies  the most effective antibiotics are not always available  or affordable  Loice Achieng  an infectious disease doctor at Kenyatta National Hospital  shook her head when recalling one recent patient  a 65 year old kidney transplant recipient infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa  a bacterial illness that is often acquired in hospitals After the patient had taken every appropriate antibiotic available in Kenya  Dr  Achieng told the family their only hope was Avycaz  a four year old  American made drug  There were hurdles  however  including red tape from Kenyan customs officials and a  10 000 price tag for a 10 day course  After several days  his children managed to gather the necessary funds  but it was too late  The man died ImageGrace Mutiga with her son at the Kijabe hospital  She had a respiratory infection and had taken five different antibiotics over the previous few weeks CreditAndrew Renneisen for The New York Times I don t have faith that we will solve this Kenya has officially embraced what public health experts call antimicrobial stewardship  the effort to stem resistance by reducing the overuse of antibiotics  promoting vaccinations and encouraging better hygiene among hospital workers  Over the past two years many of the country s medical institutions have established stewardship committees  Wall mounted hand sanitizers have become a common sight in hospital hallways and patient waiting areas But the government has made little headway in enforcing laws that require prescriptions for buying antibiotics  nor has it done much to stem the flow of bootleg drugs that spill across the nation s 400 mile border with Somalia  It s proving more difficult than we thought   said Dr  Widdowson of the C D C   who has been advising the government Back at Kijabe Hospital  Mr  Thade s condition was growing more dire  As nurses prepared him for yet another X ray  Dr  Otieno talked about the challenges of tackling drug resistance A passionate man with wide  expressive eyes  Dr  Otieno  36  is a driving force behind the hospital s newly established antimicrobial stewardship program  But he expressed frustration over the lack of progress  describing overworked nurses reluctant to embrace complex hygiene protocols and the hospital s own pharmacy  which he said continued to overprescribe antibiotics  To be honest  based on the past  I don t have faith that we will solve this  I don t think our government thinks it s a big problem   he said  as Mr  Thade s limp  swollen body was lifted onto a gurney  I worry about my country  but also about my own family  One day I could go home and infect my own children with one of these dangerous bugs  In the days that followed  Mr  Thade s condition stabilized enough that he was moved out of the intensive care unit  Though his injuries prevented him from walking  he regained consciousness and seemed to be recovering  his doctors said  but the infection was tenacious and gave no ground to meropenem  the best antibiotic in the hospital s arsenal  Three months later  after the infection spread to his blood  Mr  Thade died alone in his bed and far from home   God rest his soul   Dr  Otieno said Christina Goldbaum contributed reporting from Nairobi ImageHelena Adhiambo with her 2 year old daughter  Shairley  and 5 year old son  John

RIO DE JANEIRO   President Jair Bolsonaro s first 100 days in office have been marked by infighting in his administration  insults to adversaries and allies  praise for Brazil s 1964 1985 dictatorship and a scarcity of bills passed by Congress   pretty much the same as his record as a congressman and as a candidate So far  the anti corruption and pro gun outsider who is frequently compared to U S  President Donald Trump has scored only a few major victories to keep his far right base excited Bolsonaro s electoral triumph in October sent Brazil s left to its biggest defeat in almost two decades  But for many  so far Bolsonaro s administration is heavy on discourse and light on concrete accomplishments Bolsonaro has achieved some of his campaign promises  He signed a decree easing restrictions on gun ownership as an anti crime move  privatized some state run companies  installed a Cabinet with eight members of the military   more than at any time since the restoration of democracy   and has built strong ties with Trump and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu while distancing Brazil from Venezuela s socialist leader  Nicolas Maduro He has also begun moves to weaken environmental restrictions on development  as promised Still  as he marks off his 100th day in the presidency Wednesday  he has also given critics a lot of material to work with  and corruption suspicions against the president s family have emerged The former army captain has been widely criticized for celebrating the March 31  1964  coup that launched Brazil s military regime and for labeling Nazism as a leftist ideology while in Jerusalem  He managed to offend even allies with a pornographic tweet of a Carnival party in response to revelers who had mocked him What is widely seen as his most crucial challenge  fixing the country s costly pension system   remains trapped in Congress with other proposals  including a highly touted revamp of the anti crime and anti corruption systems During 27 years in Congress  Bolsonaro was noted for inflammatory speeches but presented only two bills that became law  This administration is characterized by strong rhetoric that is not necessarily supported by actions in the same direction   said Renato Flores  an analyst with the Rio based Fundacao Getulio Vargas think tank Some once staunch supporters of the president now worry about the role he gives to his sons Carlos  Eduardo and Flavio  Criticism by Carlos helped prompt the resignation of Bolsonaro s aide and attorney Gustavo Bebianno  Eduardo alarmed some by tweeting that the president would need only  one soldier and one corporal  to deal with the Supreme Court Bolsonaro s Cabinet appears to be divided into four  sometimes fractious factions  the military  with eight out of 22 ministers  evangelical conservatives who control the government s human rights agenda  a moderate wing overseeing economic and justice ministries  and a cluster of anti globalist fans of Olavo de Carvalho  a far right Brazilian writer who lives in the United States  now dominate foreign relations and education Carlos Melo  a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo  said the divisions put Bolsonaro s administration  in paralysis from the start   There are too many conflicts  We can t see a proper plan to grow the economy and Bolsonaro is losing the momentum presidents have in the first six months  Even his pension reform  which led many moderates to believe him  seems at risk of failing or being massively dehydrated by the very Congress he doesn t talk to   Melo said   It can all change  he has time  But the signs are not here yet  Even lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia  who initially had good relations with Bolsonaro  has complained that the far right leader is  playing at being Brazil s president   Now it is time for us to stop joking around and it is time that he sits on his chair that Congress sits here and we solve Brazil s problems together   Maia said last month The public also seems restless  The Datafolha polling institute reported Sunday that Bolsonaro s approval rating has slipped to 32   the lowest for any elected first term Brazilian president  though still far above the single digit approval rating his predecessor  Michel Temer  had at the end Datafolha interviewed 2 086 people April 2 3 and reported a two  percentage point margin of error Business leaders and stockbrokers initially welcomed Bolsonaro s victory  but so far there has been little sign of economic improvement  Unemployment officially is still at 12   a record 4 9 million Brazilians stopped searching for jobs in March and an initial stock market rally was erased following some of the president s Twitter made rifts with allies  The government research institute recently reduced its 2019 economic growth expectations from 2 7  to 2  Bolsonaro  who likes to say he is pushing ideology out of Brazil s foreign affairs  has shifted the country s alliances toward other leaders who share his conservative tendencies  joining in regional efforts to isolate Venezuela s Maduro He has been hosted in Trump s White House and in Netanyahu s Jerusalem  but China  Brazil s biggest trading partner  has been shunned  Agribusiness leaders fear that approach could harm Brazilian exports to Asia Vice President Hamilton Mourao has tried to soften that stance  calling China a partner and meeting with Chinese diplomats The man once hailed as an anti corruption hero by supporters is facing suspicions of familial wrongdoing Regulatory authorities said his son Flavio  who is also a senator  received 48 suspicious payments totaling about  25 000 in a single month from his former driver Fabricio Queiroz  who also made a payment to first lady Michelle Bolsonaro of about  5 500  All involved deny any wrongdoing  An investigation is ongoing None of those difficulties have alienated Bolsonaro s hardcore supporters  like 60 year old hairdresser Roberta Duarte  Bolsonaro is doing what he promised  No other president did this in more than 50 years  He is putting the house in order  fighting crime and violence   said Duarte  who lives in a violent region in the south of Sao Paulo   Violence was so strong that no one could leave at night to watch a movie or eat a pizza  Slowly things are improving  Others  like 18 year old journalism student Lucas Batista  are worried by Bolsonaro s frequent nods to Brazil s military dictatorship when his administration comes under criticism  He is an authoritarian leader who believes he is the only one capable of solving the country s problems   Batista said   I fear Bolsonaro and his followers want to reintroduce a military regime     Associated Press writer Marcelo Silva de Sousa reported this story in Rio de Janeiro

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today by email  Although the California connections run deep throughout the sprawling college admissions scandal  the complex federal case is now playing out in Boston  My colleague  Kate Taylor  has been covering the court proceedings  Here  she reports on the latest  In a coup for prosecutors and possible bad news for other defendants in the sweeping college admissions fraud investigation  one of the parents charged in the case  Davina Isackson of Hillsborough  Calif   has agreed to plead guilty and to cooperate with the government  according to a person with knowledge of the case Two other parents have said so far that they intend to plead guilty  and more will probably follow in the coming days  But Ms  Isackson s agreement to cooperate is significant  Ms  Isackson and her husband  Bruce  a real estate developer  were accused of conspiring with William Singer  the college consultant at the center of the case  to bribe athletics officials in order to secure their daughters  admission to U C L A  and U S C  as athletic recruits Prosecutors also accused them of paying Mr  Singer so that a proctor could correct their younger daughter s answers on her ACT exam  The prosecutors have said that the Isacksons paid Mr  Singer a total of  600 000  Catch up on all of The Times s coverage here  Mr  Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges The agreement to cooperate means that Ms  Isackson will share what she knows about the roles that officials at U C L A  and U S C  played in the scheme and  if their cases go to trial  could testify against them  It also puts pressure on other parents charged in the recruitment scheme  if Ms  Isackson testifies that she believes her actions were wrong  it makes it harder for others to say that they thought that they were simply making innocent donations One unusual aspect of the Isacksons  case is that  according to the charging documents  their older daughter  Lauren  who was admitted to U C L A  as a soccer recruit despite not being a top player  was required to participate on the team as a student athlete for a year  She is listed on the 2017 roster as a midfielder  Most students involved in the case did not actually play on the teams they had been recruited for Prosecutors say that  after Lauren Isackson was provisionally admitted to U C L A   Mr  Singer directed  100 000 to a sports marketing company controlled by Jorge Salcedo  the former head men s soccer coach at U C L A  The government has charged Mr  Salcedo with conspiracy to commit racketeering  and he has pleaded not guilty Davina Isackson could shed light on whether the coaches of the women s soccer team were also in on the scheme  Amanda Cromwell  the head coach of women s soccer at U C L A  since 2013  did not respond to messages Both Davina and Bruce Isackson will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud  according to the person with knowledge of the case  Mr  Isackson will also plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States Here s what you might

for president Mr  Swalwell told the Bay Area News Group that he comes  from a generation that solves big problems in the private sector but has lost faith that government can do it when it comes to health care  education and reducing gun violence   That generation is the millennial one But Mr  Swalwell is far from the only candidate with relative youth on his side  Mayor Pete Pete Buttigieg of South Bend  Ind   is 37  for instance  as is Mr  Swalwell s friend and House colleague  Tulsi Gabbard Mr  Swalwell has tried to differentiate himself with an aggressive stance on gun control  he has called for a national ban on assault weapons  and he has emphasized his experience as a prosecutor As The San Francisco Chronicle noted  Mr  Swalwell has also said his relationship with his conservative family would help him attract some of the president s supporters Does he have a chance  Mr  Swalwell s path is pretty slim  He s entering the race late  and beyond the cable news circuit  he s not particularly well known  But Mr  Swalwell has said he will not run for Congress again while running for president  so he could be setting himself up for another try down the line  Think

RBADE  Spain   After a decade of working on luxury cruise ships in the Bahamas  Jeff King  60  and Claudia Weber  50  decided they d had enough of Caribbean sun  tourism and mosquitoes A former ship s captain and a cook  they decided to drive around northern Spain in search of a quiet place to settle down   an old farmhouse  perhaps  or an abandoned mill When they stumbled across an entire ruined hamlet up for sale  they were smitten  As soon as we saw this place   Mr  King said   we stopped looking  Their decision two years ago to buy an entire village is still rare  but getting less so For less than 300 000 euros  or about  336 000  they bought a cluster of crumbling stone houses with slate roofs  set on 12 acres of woodland dotted with chestnut  oak and apple trees  There is just so much space   Ms  Weber said  patting their horse  whose sole purpose is to eat the grass  so that neither she nor Mr  King needs to cut it ImageJeff King and Claudia Weber bought a cluster of stone houses set on 12 acres in Galicia for less than 300 000 euros  or about  360 000  The horses take the place of a lawn mower CreditSamuel Aranda for The New York TimesThough some Spaniards are beginning to invest in abandoned villages  it is mostly foreigners who are interested  said Pepe Rodil  a salesman at the real estate agency Aldeas Abandonadas Gwyneth Paltrow gave the idea a shout out last year  when she suggested on her blog  Goop  that one of the abandoned Spanish villages sold by Aldeas Abandonadas could make the perfect Christmas gift for a loved one Despite being in dire need of a roof or two  the village in question was snapped up for  150 000 by Dutch investors  Mr  Rodil said Dozens of such empty villages are listed in 10 languages on the Aldeas Abandonadas website The going rate for a ruined hamlet is now close to  100 000  If you re feeling flush  an entire village of 75 homes  all abandoned during the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939  will set you back  425 000  For a couple of million  you could even purchase a medieval hilltop settlement with its own fortress Mark Adkinson  who owns Galician Country Homes  the agency that sold Mr  King and Ms  Weber their hamlet  says entire villages are particularly popular with northern Europeans looking for retirement options or vacation homes  There is a boom   he said  contemplating the sea view from the ruined hamlet he sold for  312 000 in February to a young British family ImageMost of the buildings in the hamlet that Mr  King and Ms  Weber bought have not been inhabited for over 50 years CreditSamuel Aranda for The New York TimesThough the buildings are in a state of disrepair  the location is stunning  Hence the price tag  Wild boars forage for acorns on the land  which runs down to a sandy cove  We wanted somewhere quiet  where our daughters could run free during the holidays   the new owner  Rupert Evans  said from his London home But he expects that his family will be camping on their land this summer  as it will take time to make the buildings habitable While Spain s cities are full of young people  struggling to find work that will enable them to pay sky high urban rents  the countryside is cheap and empty Not even the pristine roads that lead to many abandoned villages  thanks in part to European Union regional development funds  nor the 4G internet service that is available  attracts Spain s young people Successive governments have tried  unsuccessfully  to reverse the trend  As general elections loom on April 28  promises are being made to provide rural areas with more schools and medical centers  One party has even proposed a 60 percent reduction in income tax for inhabitants of rural areas ImageInside one of the houses in Acorrada  a village offered for sale at 84 000 euros CreditSamuel Aranda for The New York TimesMore than half of Spain s villages are in the lush  northwestern region of Galicia  Daniel Herrera  a researcher at the Territorial Observatory at the University of Oviedo  said this is because a group of only two or three houses in Galicia can be considered a hamlet  whereas in other regions the bar is five or six Mr  Herrera s research group estimates that 1 789 villages are empty in Galicia  The figure for the entire country is 3 475 Rural depopulation began in Spain at the end of the 19th century  when small farming communities could no longer sustain families that were becoming bigger because of the decline in infant mortality Some Spaniards sailed to the Americas to seek their fortunes  But it wasn t until Gen  Francisco Franco industrialized Spain s cities in the 1950s and  60s  that there was a mass exodus from the countryside It has taken Rosa and Neil Christie over a decade to restore the hamlet they bought for  45 000 in 2004 Mr  Christie  who had experience as a builder  brought his machinery with him from Britain  He admits that restoring his village has tested his engineering skills   not only has he had to put in windows and mend roofs  but he has had to build foundations and drainage systems ImageMr  King  right  and a helper from France who works for food and lodging  fixing up one of his houses  Mr  King and Ms  Weber have renovated one cottage and rented it out to pay the bills CreditSamuel Aranda for The New York Times When we came here  the weeds were taller than me   his wife said   and a tree was growing out of the roof of the room that is now our kitchen  Fifteen years later  wooden beams crisscross the ceiling of their spacious country kitchen  which has a traditional cast iron stove  neat shelves lined with china teapots and an under floor heating system partially powered by solar and wind energy  Elegant French windows in the sitting room open onto the five acre property  where deer can often be spotted The Christies urge potential buyers to be patient  Though the local council has been helpful   it built a road connecting the village to the highway   obtaining licenses and permissions can take time  and it can be tough to maneuver through government bureaucracy if you don t speak Spanish Another consideration before purchasing a village is establishing ownership While paperwork would normally be routine for an estate agent  it can be a tall order when dozens of potential heirs must be tracked down  and original documents are often damaged or even lost  We must become detectives   said Rosy Costoya  the wife and business partner of Mr  Adkinson of Galician Country Homes  It takes months or years to check whether a property can legally be sold The Christies have never been able to confirm whether the owners of two ruined cottages at the far end of their village have living descendants  Buried in undergrowth and weeds  the ruins pose a health risk by attracting vermin  and are also a fire hazard  The Christies are waiting for the local council to decide what to do ImageThe valley near Ourol in Galicia  A mass exodus to Spain s cities in the 1950s and  60s left the countryside empty CreditSamuel Aranda for The New York Times This is not for the fainthearted   Mr  Christie said There s nothing fainthearted about Mr  King and Ms  Weber Most of the buildings at Mr  King and Ms  Weber s hamlet have not been inhabited for over 50 years  Broken desks are piled up on the floor of what was the schoolhouse  moss covers the walls of an old stone oven  iron hooks dangle from beams in one house where meat was hung to dry In what is now Mr  King and Ms  Weber s garden  a granary stands on stone stilts  and a stream trickles through the remains of the old laundry house where residents once washed clothes They have renovated one cottage and rented it out to help pay the bills  Work is also underway to build a gymnasium  an open plan kitchen and four en suite bedrooms in the largest  three story house  where the couple hope one day to host paying guests for training camps or plant based cookery courses They still find time to enjoy the lifestyle  gathering giant mushrooms for lunch  climbing trees when grandchildren visit and settling down in the evening to light a fire in their wood burning stove Occasionally  they travel 17 miles to the nearest town  Viveiro  for a night out  They shop there once a week too  and every few days local merchants drive by selling bread  fish and gas  Garbage collection is once a week  It s not as isolated as you think   Mr  King said  

BRUSSELS   Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini sends texts with smileys to French far right leader Marine Le Pen and posts selfies with Austrian far right politician Heinz Christian Strache The face of the leader of Italy s far right League party is beamed onto big screens at right wing rallies from Prague to Sofia      Buoyed by his own success and voter fatigue with mainstream parties  Salvini is trying to build bridges before elections on May 26 to the European Parliament  the European Union s legislature  With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority  he and other far right leaders hope to form an opposition  eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation       Our idea is to come together     into a new party that better reflects the euroskeptical views that unite us   Salvini s foreign affairs advisor Marco Zanni told Reuters   Now is our chance to unite forces once and for all          But when Salvini starts his campaign for the elections on Monday in Milan  representatives of only three  relatively small far right European parties will be present  Le Pen will not be there  Nor will representatives of Jaroslaw Kaczynski s Law and Justice party  PiS   which governs Poland       Salvini promises a much bigger rally next month  But the absence of Le Pen and other leading far right and nationalist leaders speaks to the policy differences and rivalries that have long stood in the way of unity among such groups Far right leaders share the broad ideological goals of curbing the EU s perceived liberal course and returning power to the member states  capitals  But they differ in other areas  and an attempt by U S  President Donald Trump s former strategist  Steve Bannon  to act as a power broker among Europe s populist groups has fizzled         BIRDS OF A FEATHER       Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election  in which 705 members of the European Parliament  MEPs  will be elected  or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned     General dissatisfaction over slow economic growth  security threats posed by Islamist militants and a backlash against migration across open EU borders have boosted support for eurosceptic nationalists in many member states      There is a growing confidence of voters to go against the norm   said Susi Dennison  a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations   The  anti  forces  are much more motivated right now than the pro Europeans  Their gains and Britain s planned departure from the EU will mean a shake up of the pan national groups created by parties in the EU parliament  whose main role is checking and amending EU laws drawn up by the executive European Commission     Salvini s anti immigrant League is forecast to more than quadruple its representation in the EU assembly with 27 seats     Along with the projected rise for Le Pen s National Rally and Strache s Freedom Party of Austria  which is in a coalition government with Strache as vice chancellor  the Europe of Nations and Freedom  ENF  group to which they belong could be boosted to 61 seats from 37     Salvini  whose party co rules Italy  wants to embrace other leaders whose parties are in rival groups such as Kaczynski     The two held a meeting in Warsaw in January  and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban hailed the prospect of them forming an alliance as one of the greatest developments of this year Forming one big political group can also unlock funds and opportunities for patronage  They re going to get much more resources if they re able to sit together   said Cas Mudde  an expert on the far right at the University of Georgia     But policy differences make it likely that parties critical of the EU will remain divided into at least two groupings  one centered around Salvini and the other around Kaczynski Salvini admires Russian President Vladimir Putin   Kaczynski vilifies him  Both are anti immigration but at odds over how to handle it  Italy is net giver to the EU budget  Poland is a net receiver  Their views on the economy do not align For right wing parties in Denmark  Finland and Sweden which see Russia as a threat  Salvini and Le Pen s pro Kremlin sympathies are also a red line   It is a crucial aspect for many countries   Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson told Reuters   It will not succeed  there will be no such group  Many parties competing at the national level will also find it difficult to sit together Orban has chosen to remain with the parliament s biggest political grouping despite being suspended from it last month  For all his praise of coalition building among eurosceptics  being in a group with Europe s power brokers confers a mainstream respectability that other populists lack Some hope that will change after the election      Leaving a strong group to join a weak group is a difficult political decision  but leaving to join a group that is also quite strong and growing is less so   said Ryszard Legutko  a PiS lawmaker and co chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists  ECR  group  It is the first time there s a real chance things might change  that this political  even ideological monopoly can be somehow undermined   Legutko said     IN FROM THE COLD     Links among the far right remain largely limited to personal relationships  When leaders who have long been isolated at home and lack influence abroad attend each other s rallies  it is about showing they are not marginal  It is about validating one another   said Duncan McDonnell  Professor of Politics in the School of Government and International Relations at Griffith University  But he said the far right increasingly saw itself as  part of a new wave     The Alternative for Germany  AfD  could win many more seats in the next European Parliament  opinion polls show  and might throw its hat in with Salvini s ENF group  The polls show the Forum for Democracy  FvD  in the Netherlands  led by Thierry Baudet  could win four new seats in the EU assembly and it has said it will join Poland s PiS in the ECR Spanish newcomer Vox has become the darling of eurosceptic groups following its success in a regional election last December in Spain  which until then had been resistant to the populist currents sweeping Europe  Vox is now being courted by both by Poland s PiS and Salvini s League  But looking ahead to the next European Parliament   where polls suggest Vox will win about five seats  up from none today    Vox leader Santiago Abascal told Reuters   It may be that we ll be alone      Vox has capitalized on domestic tensions over Catalan separatism   it regards Catalonia as an integral part of Spain   but some other far right parties do not share its view  Their support of the  separatists   coup d etat by Catalonia is an enormous barrier  to cooperation    he said Even if parties are not the same group  Zanni of Salvini s League says there will be greater cooperation to try to influence or thwart EU policy      The risk is longer term paralysis   Dennison said   that over time will erode the idea of EU as an effective actor  But European Parliament strategists say younger right wing political groups have shown far weaker party discipline   The eurosceptics are a wing of many feathers  and I m not sure it will beat effectively   said one senior official in the European People s Party  the main centre right group   Additional reporting by Johan Ahlander in Stockholm  Beln Carreo and Ingrid Melander in

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s tax returns will never be handed over to Democratic lawmakers  White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on Sunday  defying an effort in Congress to learn more about the real estate mogul s personal finances Asked on  Fox News Sunday  if congressional Democrats will succeed in obtaining the Republican president s tax returns  Mulvaney said   No  never  Nor should they  He dismissed an effort to obtain the returns  launched on Wednesday by U S  House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Richard Neal  as a political ploy from Democrats who will never stop attacking Trump  Democrats are demanding that the IRS turn over the documents  That is not going to happen  and they know it  This is a political stunt   Mulvaney said Democrats countered that Neal s request to the Treasury Department for Trump s returns is grounded in law and a needed inquiry  given Trump s refusal to disclose his tax records and to divest himself of his business interests  This is a legitimate authority that the Congress has  This president  by the way  is the least transparent president that we ve had in half a century   Democratic Representative Dan Kildee  a tax committee member  told ABC s  This Week  Democratic Representative Ben Ray Lujan noted that presidents for decades have voluntarily released their income tax returns   This is not political  as our Republican colleagues are making it out to be   he told  Fox News Sunday  An attorney for Trump on Friday blasted House Democrats  request for six years of Trump s personal and business returns as  a misguided attempt  to politicize the tax laws  accusing lawmakers of harassment and interference in IRS audits In a statement that mapped out the legal battlefield ahead  Trump lawyer William Consovoy said the request filed by Neal flouts  constitutional constraints  Republican Senator Mitt Romney urged Trump to release his tax returns as promised but criticized Democratic efforts to force the issue through legislative action as  moronic    The courts are not going to say that you can compel a person running for office to release their tax returns   he said on NBC s  Meet the Press  One of many investigations targeting Trump on Capitol Hill and in the U S  court system  the House Democrats  probe into the president s tax returns could pull back the curtain on his business empire and his reputation as a dealmaker As a presidential candidate in 2016  Trump broke with a decades old practice of making his tax returns public and continues to refuse to release them as president  while retaining ownership in many enterprises  ranging from golf courses and hotels and other properties If Congress takes the administration to court over Trump s taxes then little case law would be available to help guide judges  legal experts said  both because the statute cited by Neal to obtain the returns has hardly ever been contested  and because most document disputes between the legislative and executive branches of government are resolved by negotiation The losing party could appeal  ultimately to the U S  Supreme Court  If litigation extends into 2021  a judge could also force a newly elected Congress to start the process over  said Ross Garber  an attorney who specializes in political investigations   Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Kevin Drawbaugh  Additional reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco  Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Lisa Shumaker

There were more new cases of measles reported last week in the United States than in any other week of 2019  new government data shows  with the outbreak spreading to four states that recorded their first cases of the virus for the year In the first week of April  the country added 78 new measles cases  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  with Florida  Indiana  Massachusetts and Nevada confirming their first patients  Two weeks ago  the country added 73 new cases  which was the most for the year until last week The dozens of new infections take the count to 465 confirmed cases this year  the second greatest number of reported cases in a year since 2000  when measles was declared eliminated in the United States At the current rate  the country would surpass by midyear the number of measles cases in 2014  when an outbreak among unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio helped drive the total to 667 reported cases  the high mark for this century  Have more questions about the measles outbreak  Here are some answers  Fifteen other states have also reported cases this year  Arizona  California  Colorado  Connecticut  Georgia  Indiana  Kentucky  Michigan  Missouri  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New York  Oregon  Texas and Washington Daniel Salmon  director of the institute for vaccine safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health  cautioned against reading too much into the weekly data  Maybe it s getting worse   he said  but he emphasized that measles vaccination coverage is strong at the national and state levels   more than 90 percent of children are immunized  according to C D C  tracking   which has kept the outbreaks mostly isolated to geographic and social pockets In Brooklyn  a large outbreak in the Orthodox Jewish community prompted New York City to declare a public health emergency on Tuesday  Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the city would require unvaccinated people living in select ZIP codes in the Williamsburg neighborhood to receive the measles vaccine The largest outbreak has been in the northern suburbs of New York City  with 167 cases in Rockland County as of Friday A judge there put a hold last week on a county order that had barred children and teenagers who were not vaccinated against measles from public places  Public health experts said that they could not recall any action like what the county tried to do in recent years Rockland County is home to a large ultra Orthodox Jewish community where there has been some resistance to vaccinations  The vast majority of states allow families to opt out of getting vaccinated if they object on religious grounds  Why are vaccines a religious issue for some people  Here s a primer  Most of the American cases since 2000 have been the result of people traveling to or from countries where measles is endemic because there is little vaccination  The outbreak in Rockland County has been traced to an annual Hasidic pilgrimage from Israel to Ukraine Last week  the University of California  Davis  sent letters to about 200 people warning them that they and anyone who had accompanied them to a Sacramento emergency room on March 17 had encountered a  possible exposure  to the measles virus  A young girl who is believed to have contracted the virus on an overseas trip had visited the U C  Davis Medical Center that day  At that time  we didn t suspect that they had measles   Dr  Dean Blumberg  the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at U C  Davis Health  told KCRA TV in Sacramento Officials did not realize that the girl  who was unvaccinated  had the measles until two days after she visited the hospital  The girl was from Calaveras County  southeast of Sacramento

March  the dumpster yielded a box of silver goblets  dishes and plates  as if someone had yanked a tablecloth from underneath a feast in some European chateau  How do you say it   William Washington

TimesMr  Orta says he only takes what people have clearly thrown away  although 14 years ago he spent a few months in jail for breaking into someone s garage in Sacramento and trying to steal a wrench for his bicycle   It was a dumb mistake   he said For years San Francisco has been a global beacon of recycling  attracting a stream of government ministers  journalists and students from across the globe to study the sorting facilities of Recology But the city is also full of young  affluent people preoccupied with demanding jobs and long commutes for whom the garbage can is a tempting way to get rid of that extra pair of jeans or old electronics cluttering their closet  We have a lot of trash of convenience   said Mr  Reed  the spokesman for Recology   You ve got more and more tech people here and this city is moving faster and faster  These people have short attention spans  Some discard items that ought to be repurposed through a thrift shop  Trash pickers fall into several broad categories  For decades  elderly women and men have collected cardboard  paper  cans or bottles  lugging impossibly large bags around the city and bringing them to recycling centers for cash The city is most concerned about the battered pickup trucks  known as mosquito fleets  that buzz around San Francisco collecting recyclables on an industrial scale  depriving Recology  and ultimately the city  of income  said Bill Barnes  a spokesman for the city administrator s office  That s a significant challenge for residents because it results in higher garbage rates   Mr  Barnes said Image It just amazes me what people throw away   Mr  Orta said CreditJim Wilson The New York TimesTrash pickers like Mr  Orta are in yet another category  targeting items in the black landfill garbage bins whose contents would otherwise go to what s known as the pit   a hole in the ground on the outskirts of the city that resembles a giant swimming pool  where trash is crushed and compacted by a huge bulldozer and then carried by a fleet of trucks to a dump an hour and a half away  The city exports about 50 large truckloads a day Nick Marzano  an Australian photographer who publishes a glossy magazine  Mission Gold  which documents the world of trash pickers in San Francisco  estimates there are several hundred garbage scavengers in the city  It s a civic service as I see it   Mr  Marzano said   Rather than this stuff going to landfill the items are being reused  Mr  Marzano says there is overlap among trash picking and homelessness and public drug use   the street conditions that have ranked at the top of residents  concerns for several years  But he sees trash picking  and the spontaneous sidewalk markets that pop up in neighborhoods like the Mission and Tenderloin  as a form of entrepreneurship  It s the primary form of income for people who have no other income   he said Mr  Orta sells what he retrieves at impromptu markets on Mission Street or at a more formal market on Saturdays on Julian Avenue  Children s toys very rarely sell   parents don t like the idea that they have come from the trash  Women s clothing is iffy  But men don t seem to care as much where the clothing came from  and jeans are easy to hawk for  5 or  10 a pair Mr  Orta s favorite item retrieved from the trash is one that he will not sell  a collection of newspapers from around the world documenting the course of World War II  He wonders why anyone would have thrown that away On a recent Tuesday evening   the eve of trash collection in Mr  Zuckerberg s neighborhood   Mr  Orta didn t find anything worth keeping in the Facebook founder s two garbage cans  Mr  Zuckerberg has at least one other home in the San Francisco Bay Area  this one he bought in November 2012 for  9 999 000 through a company he controls In the blue recycling bin marked with Mr  Zuckerberg s address  there were A W diet root beer cans  cardboard boxes and a junk mail credit card offer  In the black landfill bin were remnants of a chicken dinner  a stale baguette and Chinese takeout containers Mr  Orta pulled apart a garbage bag in the black bin  Just junk   nothing in there   

The storm that swept through Rio de Janeiro this week left a wreck in its wake  A landslide swallowed homes  floodwaters rose up in hospitals and power lines collapsed as streets turned into roaring rivers Then came the alligators   or  more precisely  their South American cousins  the caimans The storm knocked down the walls of a caiman farm in a neighborhood  or favela  that is controlled  like others in Rio de Janeiro  by a heavily armed criminal paramilitary group  This made the local authorities reluctant to enter   and left the creatures  which can grow to be 11 feet long  to swim through the flooded streets  terrifying residents The caiman farm stood in the Favela do Rola  in western Rio de Janeiro  one of several sections of the city to be flooded this week  It was unclear how many caimans were bred there  but photographs and videos of the creatures coursing through the floodwaters were shared by several people on social media Rejane Guimares  38  who has lived in the Favela do Rola for 25 years  said she had spotted two caimans swimming in the murky waters around 10 a m  Tuesday  She and her neighbors called local officials repeatedly  she said  asking them to remove the creatures But the authorities did not even try to help  Ms  Guimares said  They told her it was too dangerous to go into the neighborhood  she said The city s press office and environment department said Wednesday that although their officials had declined to enter the favela  they were talking with residents to assess the possibility of a joint rescue operation with the military police The Rio de Janeiro Fire Department said that it sent a team to the area on Tuesday night  but that it had failed to find the caimans  Residents said they never saw the agents For Ms  Guimares  the caimans felt like the last drop of misfortune after a flood of it  The storm has left at least 10 people dead around the city  including two sisters whose house was swallowed by a landslide  and has caused untold damage to businesses and homes At 3 a m  Tuesday  after trying to rescue some belongings from the waters  Ms  Guimares ran with her children to her mother s house  She now fears that she could lose everything she owned in the flood  including her refrigerator  a television and a washing machine she bought only three months ago Several people in her community did lose everything  and are sleeping in a local church  relying on donations to eat  Ms  Guimares said  It s complete chaos here   she said   We are really scared  we don t know how to defend ourselves  These wild animals are totally free now  they could attack us  We don t know if they re hungry  what their reaction will be if we see them  She dismissed the government s explanation for why officials did not enter the favela  saying that the mayor himself had been there this year  making promises to improve their lives  Others echoed her comments on social media  poking fun at the city officials  excuse that the neighborhood was too dangerous to enter  Only if the criminals are on boats   a Facebook user named Vincius Melo Abade wrote beneath a post on the floods  Only if the crocodiles themselves are armed   wrote another user  Aline Taylor Ricardo Freitas  a local biologist who has been studying crocodilians in Rio de Janeiro State for 17 years  was not surprised by the existence of a caiman farm inside a favela  People illegally breed caimans across the city to sell to restaurants  he said He also suggested that criminals sometimes use the animals to scare kidnapping victims  though there is no evidence that was the case in Favela da Rola Mr  Freitas  who dedicates some of his time to rescuing caimans  said that the creatures do not prey on people  but could eat pets  He said there are around 8 000 broad snouted caimans  the most common species in Rio  in the city s western zone  It sounds like movie stuff   he said   But it s a surreal reality in Rio de Janeiro   

TOKYO   A defiant Carlos Ghosn accused  backstabbing  former colleagues of conspiring to oust him as Nissan chairman and threatening the Japanese automaker s future  in a video marking his first public address since his initial arrest last year Prosecutors took the highly unusual step of re arresting Ghosn on Thursday on fresh allegations that he used company funds to enrich himself by  5 million  The once feted executive  who had been out on  9 million bail for 30 days  recorded the video the day before he went back to jail In the video  shown to reporters by his lawyers in Tokyo  the former Nissan Motor Co chairman said he was the victim of selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the automaker and French partner Renault  This is not about greed or dictatorship  this is about a plot  this is about a conspiracy  this is about a backstabbing   Ghosn said   I am innocent of all the charges that have been brought against me   he said  without explaining further Wearing a dark jacket and a white shirt  Ghosn sat at a desk with his hands folded as he looked into the camera and spoke in a calm voice  His hair appeared greyer and his face thinner than before his first arrest in November  The video  and comments by his lawyer Junichiro Hironaka alleging harsh treatment by prosecutors against Ghosn and his wife Carole  cast Ghosn as the victim of internal rivalries and a Japanese judicial system bent on forcing a confession The seven minute clip was  however  edited by his legal team to remove the names of people Ghosn accused of treachery due to legal concerns  The conspiracy  Ghosn said  was born out of fear that he would bring Nissan closer to Renault  also its top shareholder  There was fear that the next step of the alliance in terms of convergence and in terms of moving toward a merger  would in a certain way threaten some people or eventually threaten the autonomy of Nissan   he said Ghosn also took aim at Nissan s current management  blaming them for three profit warnings and a domestic scandal involving improper vehicle inspections since his departure as CEO in 2017 The lack of leadership is  very sickening   Ghosn said PHYSICAL  MENTAL PRESSUREGhosn s second stint at the Tokyo detention center comes after he served 108 days following his first arrest last year Prosecutors are acting in a  cruel way  and putting him under intense physical and mental pressure to get a confession  Hironaka told reporters A spokeswoman at the Tokyo prosecutors office said she was unaware of Hironaka s comments and declined to comment  Hironaka has previously criticized the move by prosecutors to confiscate Ghosn s belongings  including his mobile phone and trial documents  along with the mobile phones and Lebanese passport of his wife  Carole  who was present when prosecutors entered their home early in the morning last Thursday The lawyer said on Tuesday that Ghosn s wife  who left Japan last week  did so out of concern for her own safety  adding she intended to ask the French government to help her husband But  France s finance minister said political interventions might not be the best way to help Ghosn The case has rocked the global auto industry and also shone a harsh light on Japan s judicial system  which critics refer to as  hostage justice  as defendants who deny their charges are often not granted bail Under Japanese law  prosecutors are able to hold suspects for up to 22 days without charge and interrogate them without their lawyers present Ghosn has been charged with under reporting his Nissan salary for a decade and of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan s books  However  the latest allegation is potentially more serious  as it could show he used company funds for his own purposes   Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu and Tim Kelly  writing by David Dolan  Editing by Himani Sarkar  

A slithering  17 foot Burmese python found at Big Cypress National Preserve in the Florida Everglades weighed 140 pounds and took four people to carry What may have been even more unnerving  for conservationists  anyway  was that it contained 73 developing eggs That s because the Burmese python  as its name suggests  is a nonnative species in Florida that is considered invasive and harmful to the area s ecology  Researchers at the preserve  as they have done with other female pythons  euthanized the huge snake and destroyed the eggs  She is the largest python ever removed from Big Cypress National Preserve   and she was caught because of research and a new approach to finding pythons   the preserve said on Facebook late last week The researchers found the snake by using male pythons with radio transmitters to locate breeding females  The team tracked one of the sentinel males with the transmitter and found this massive female nearby   the preserve said on Facebook  I wish we could eradicate this species  but I think they are established   said Cheryl Millett  the manager of the Nature Conservancy s Tiger Creek Preserve in central Florida  who led a  Python Patrol  program to try to control the snake s population   One of the problems with the Burmese python is that it s an invasive species getting in the way of the area s natural functioning system  That is why we are trying to eradicate it  Burmese pythons can grow to about 23 feet and are native to South Asia  They found their way to Florida decades ago through people who imported them as pets  Many owners underestimate how large the python will grow  and sometimes they let the snakes loose when they can no longer take care of them  Female pythons have the ability to lay 100 eggs  and the snakes multiply quickly That has led the python to threaten the biodiversity of the Everglades  The mammal and bird populations in the Everglades began to decline around the time that pythons started to proliferate in the area  according to a 2012 article in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences With expert level hiding skills  the Burmese python is hard to find and therefore hard to get rid of  We tried using python detecting dogs   Ms  Millett said of an experiment the Nature Conservancy carried out  The dogs helped  but they needed handlers  and the training made the program too expensive The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has several programs to encourage people to come forward when they see a Burmese python and to train the public to capture them The training starts with a classroom discussion followed by a demonstration  and then the trainees practice catching live Burmese pythons  according to Ms  Millett  We do encourage them to catch the snakes if they are trained to   she said  We re doing all kinds of things   said Carol Lyn Parrish  a spokeswoman for the conservation commission  which now runs the Python Patrol program She said the agency had programs for contractors to catch the pythons as well as training for capturing the snakes and cash rewards for turning them in  We ve been actively trying to educate and remove pythons for more than five years   she said  adding that  right now they are considered a conditional species in the state  which means they cannot be sold or had in Florida  But that is not the case in other states  In Louisiana  for instance  people are allowed to have a Burmese python as a pet or sell one as long as they have acquired the appropriate permits and licenses  even though the Burmese python was banned by the United States government in 2012 Lexin Vincent  20  of Louisiana owns a four and a half foot Burmese python named Bernice after paying a breeder  300 for her  In Louisiana  they come and check the cages  the house and everything   Mr  Vincent said of the process to acquire a permit for a Burmese python in the state   People don t realize how much detail goes into keeping one of a certain size  Mr  Vincent said he was prepared for when Bernice grows to be eight feet long and strong enough to strangle a human  I feed her rats for now  but eventually I ll have to move up to chickens and baby pigs with natural deformities   Mr  Vincent said   The risk is worth it   

KARACHI  Pakistan MUMBAI   Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan blamed India s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  for  whipping up war hysteria  over claims that India shot down a Pakistani F 16 during a standoff in February  saying the truth is always the best policy U S  based Foreign Policy magazine  citing U S  officials  said all of Pakistan s F 16 combat jets had been accounted for  contradicting an Indian air force assessment that it had shot down one of the jets  The truth always prevails and is always the best policy   Khan said in a Tweet   BJP s attempt to win elections through whipping up war hysteria and false claims of downing a Pak F 16 has backfired with US Defence officials also confirming that no F16 was missing from Pakistan s fleet  Nuclear armed neighbours India and Pakistan engaged in an aerial battle over the disputed region of Kashmir a day after Indian jets crossed over into Pakistan to attack a suspected camp of anti India militants An Indian jet was brought down during the fight and its pilot captured when he ejected on the Pakistani side of the border  He was later released India said it too had shot down a Pakistani aircraft and the air force displayed pieces of a missile that it said had been fired by a Pakistani F 16 before it went down Foreign Policy said in a report published on Thursday two U S  defence officials with direct knowledge of the matter said U S  personnel had done a count of Pakistan s F 16s and found none missing  Details of the India Pakistan air engagement have not been fully provided by either side  If the U S  report turns out to be true  it would be a further blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi  who had said that India had taught Pakistan a lesson  ahead of elections next week The BJP is campaigning on a platform of tough national security  especially with regard to arch foe Pakistan  New Delhi blames Pakistan for stoking a 30 year revolt in Muslim majority Kashmir but Islamabad denies any involvement BJP spokesman Bizay Sonkar Shastri dismissed Khan s accusations  Firstly  their  Pakistan s  habit of lying is no secret to the world  Secondly  this is absolutely clear that the roots of terrorism lie in Pakistan and terrorism is cultivated in Pakistan   he told Reuters The success of Indian air strikes on a camp of the Jaish e Mohammed militant group in northwestern Pakistan has also been thrown into doubt after satellite images showed little sign of damage High resolution satellite images reviewed by Reuters last month showed that a religious school run by Jaish appeared to be still standing days after India said its warplanes had hit the Islamist group s training camp on the site and killed a large number of militants Pakistan closed its airspace amid the standoff but most commercial air traffic has since resumed and major airports have opened Pakistan offered to open one air route on Friday  an Indian government official said  without specifying details and declining to be named as the matter was not public  An Air India official said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan has opened one of its 11 air routes  from the southern side  adding that the carrier began operations via this route on Friday  Pakistan has opened one air route over India on April 4th  it is a north west bound route   Mujtaba Baig  spokesman for Pakistan s Civil Aviation Authority  told Reuters on Saturday An email sent to the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation was not immediately answered  Air India did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment   Writing by Nick Macfie  Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman  

NEW YORK   Deutsche Bank said it was open to further restructuring of its U S  investment bank after Commerzbank executives sought clarity on its plans during merger talks  according to three sources familiar with the matter The future of the bank s U S  trading and investment banking presence had already been in question  with some shareholders calling for further cuts on top of ones announced last year  Speculation has intensified following confirmation of the merger talks last month Among the options floated by the bank during the talks were a further scaling back of its U S  equities business  including prime brokerage services for hedge funds  and reductions at its corporate finance business  the sources said Commerzbank wanted reassurances Deutsche Bank was prepared to make deeper cuts at its loss making U S  business as a condition of proceeding with the merger talks  the sources said The two banks have been in discussions on the potential deal over the past three weeks and a decision on whether to intensify or terminate the discussions is expected as early as this weekend  the sources said It is unclear how many of the bank s 10 000 strong U S  employees would be affected by any new cuts  Last year  the bank said it would reduce its global headcount to below 90 000 from 97 000  That included a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs  including a significant number in New York In a research note published on Friday  analysts at KBW said Deutsche Bank could cut up to 15 percent of its investment banking staff globally  equivalent to around 2 500 jobs  to achieve cost savings required to make the deal work  Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both declined to comment David Hendler  an independent analyst at New York based Viola Risk Advisors  which specializes in risk management  said he thinks the majority of the cuts would be outside Germany  If you want to reduce the pain for the staff in Germany  you have to cut more in New York and  maybe  London also  Deutsche Bank does not have a competitive advantage in investment banking in the United States   he said Deutsche Bank s chief executive  Christian Sewing  said in a memo to staff last month the bank aimed to remain a global bank with a strong capital markets business  Commerzbank s chief executive  Martin Zielke  believes a strong and focused investment bank would be a good addition to the lender  according to a person familiar with his thinking The German government  which has pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion  wants the combined business to retain an investment bank capable of supporting German companies doing business around the world  the sources said  A tie up between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank would give the combined bank a dominant position in its domestic market and improve its cost of funding  However  some analysts believe the deal fails to address Deutsche Bank s biggest problem  its underperforming and capital intensive U S  investment bank Commerzbank has limited investment banking operations so there are few opportunities to generate cost savings in that part of the bank  leaving Deutsche Bank still striving to turn around a business that has weighed on its earnings  After the 2007 2009 financial crisis  Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street  even as European rivals like Credit Suisse made big cuts Deutsche Bank s U S  business has brought in around half of revenue for its overall investment banking unit  which includes corporate and investment banking as well as trading  However  the business  encumbered by litigation and regulatory investigations into past misconduct  has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals   Additional reporting by Tom Sims in Frankfurt  editing by Chris Reese and Steve Orlofsky

For months  former Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  hewed to a tortoise like strategy for the 2020 presidential race  Repeatedly delaying his final decision  he hoped to skirt a long stretch of campaigning as a front runner with a target on his back That approach carried risks  Mr  Biden missed the chance to recruit top level aides  including former Obama advisers  women and people of color  because he had not formalized his campaign  He left urgent questions about his political vulnerabilities lingering  and he has not deployed researchers to review his vast record  because he has not hired any Still  the former vice president persisted with his unrushed strategy   until this past week  when it appeared to backfire in striking fashion Mr  Biden has faced accusations from multiple women who came forward to complain that his penchant for close physical contact made them feel uneasy  Rival Democrats demanded that he account for his treatment of the women  and President Trump lobbed taunts that offered a preview of how he might attack Mr  Biden in a 2020 general election It was a multiday crisis that seemed entirely foreseeable  given that Mr  Biden s physical touching occurred over many years  often in public  But despite almost five decades in the political arena  Mr  Biden  76  did not have an agile  fully staffed campaign in place to confront it He issued three statements and one online video attempting to explain his conduct  only to joke about the issue in a speech to a union conference Friday  Afterward  he gave an ambivalent response to reporters who asked if he was sorry  acknowledging that he would have to change his behavior but apologizing only for the fact that he  didn t understand more  about the implications of his conduct Mr  Biden showed no evident regret about his wait and wait some more strategy  explaining coyly that he would  give everybody else their day  then I get a shot  But Mr  Biden s eventual announcement now seems fated to fall in the shadow of the recent allegations and the progressive concerns he has so far declined to address  Far from remaining above the fray  Mr  Biden will enter the campaign as bruised as any of the 17 other candidates already in the race  They re in this never never land right now   said David Plouffe  the former strategist to President Barack Obama s campaign   because they re being treated by the outside world like they re in the race full speed and they re not  That s a really tough place to be   Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  Mr  Plouffe cautioned that Mr  Biden s initial difficulties could all mean very little should the former vice president enjoy a successful start when he formally enters the race Indeed  amid the week s chaos  Mr  Biden for the first time took several swift steps toward becoming a candidate  His allies have been told to expect an announcement after Easter and the former vice president was sighted on Thursday in Scranton  Pa   apparently recording a video at his childhood home there  And Mr  Biden has secured the services of Mark Putnam  a Democratic ad maker known for crafting gripping  cinematic commercials  according to people familiar with the decision   Mr  Putnam declined to comment  Mr  Biden has used his time on the sideline to some advantage  Aides have put him through so called murder board sessions on his vulnerabilities and compiled documents detailing his accomplishments and weaknesses  His likely campaign manager  Greg Schultz  has organized now weekly conference calls with future staff members But if the attacks from Mr  Trump and his allies illustrated that Republicans are worried about facing Mr  Biden  the controversy this past week has also shined a light on the risks Democrats would be taking in nominating him   and not just because of his recent problems The uneven response to the women s accusations capped a four month stretch in which Mr  Biden has labored to expand his core group of older  mostly white advisers  failed to defuse the political equivalent of ticking time bombs relating to race and gender that await his entry in the race  and delayed a campaign that will have considerable ground to make up organizationally  financially and technologically Even some of his strongest allies are growing anxious   I d like to see him go ahead and get engaged because the summer is going to be here before you know it  the debates are going be here before you know it   said Senator Doug Jones of Alabama  who was a state chairman for Mr  Biden s 1988 presidential bid  Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker  The questions now looming over his campaign in waiting  however  are not merely ones of timing  Mr  Biden s uncertainty over how to address his past positions and conduct  and how contrite he ought to be  captures the tension at the heart of his emerging candidacy  Can he retain the unvarnished  tell it like it is political brand that appeals to so many voters  especially older ones  while also inspiring a Democratic Party that has grown more progressive and is increasingly defined by its youthful  diverse constituencies ImageMr  Biden spoke at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Construction and Maintenance Conference in Washington on Friday  He joked about his penchant for close physical contact CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesHe does retain obvious strengths as a potential candidate  He is still at the top of the polls  albeit not quite as high as he was at the start of the year  Democratic voters view him in overwhelmingly favorable terms  as a thoroughly qualified commander in chief and an emblem of the Obama administration  And there is also deep and lasting sympathy for Mr  Biden and his family after the death of his eldest son  Beau  from cancer in 2015 Yet his decision to wait on announcing his candidacy has come with a cost  in part because he did not use the time to better prepare for some of the most inevitable questions about his lengthy record in politics  Without a campaign in place  Mr  Biden has also not done any polling to determine his most glaring liabilities or substantial assets Mr  Biden has yet to apologize to Anita Hill even though he said last month that he regrets that  he couldn t give her the kind of hearing she deserved    a reference that seemed to play down his powerful role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Ms  Hill testified at Justice Clarence Thomas s confirmation hearing in 1991 that he had sexually harassed her Mr  Biden has also done little to reach out to feminist leaders before entering a campaign in which his mixed record on abortion rights is sure to be an issue  He has not contacted Ilyse Hogue  the head of Naral Pro Choice America  or Cecile Richards  the former head of Planned Parenthood  according to Democratic officials He has said publicly that he wants a campaign that reflects the country  but his inner circle remains largely white and male  and some of his overtures to next generation Democratic strategists have fallen flat or petered out  several people briefed on the efforts said Karine Jean Pierre  a top official with the liberal group MoveOn  met privately with Mr  Biden but elected not to pursue a campaign job  Biden advisers sought to hire Tara McGowan  a highly regarded Democratic digital strategist  and Emmy Ruiz  an operative who managed several Western states for Hillary Clinton in 2016  Neither signed on  and Ms  Ruiz now works for Senator Kamala Harris of California   All three women declined to comment or did not respond to requests  Many Democrats also expected Larry Grisolano  another veteran of Mr  Obama s campaigns  to take a senior role in Mr  Biden s organization  but earlier this year Mr  Grisolano declined It is not clear how strongly Mr  Biden might be able to rely on other members of Mr  Obama s political network  many of whom have gravitated toward newer candidates like Ms  Harris and former Representative Beto O Rourke of Texas   Mr  Obama himself has been tight lipped during his former running mate s difficult week  a spokesman for the former president declined to comment while noting that Mr  Obama had praised Mr  Biden warmly in recent months  And Mr  Biden has done little self vetting of his legislative record because he has not hired a research director  His aides have contacted at least two Democratic officials  James Singer and Helen Smith  about research jobs  but Mr  Singer went to work for Ms  Harris and Ms  Smith is planning to work on a House race Patti Solis Doyle  who managed Mrs  Clinton s campaign in 2008  said Mr  Biden had already sacrificed some of his political strength by waiting so long  She said Mr  Biden remained formidable  but urged him to enter the race soon and initiate a  bigger  more thoughtful conversation about how men of power interact with women with not so much power   I think he can look at this as an opportunity  and I wish he would   Ms  Solis Doyle said As he demonstrated on Friday with his joking references to giving hugs and his impromptu press availability  there is only so much his aides can do to contain Mr  Biden  His reliance on his own instincts has been legendary for decades  since his turbulent  1988 campaign chronicled in the classic political book  What It Takes  But it s unclear whether Mr  Biden s instincts will be enough to navigate his party s shifting center of gravity  After declaring at a Democratic fund raising dinner in Delaware last month that he would be  the most progressive candidate  in the race  Mr  Biden clarified on Friday that he meant his positions on issues like race and L G B T  rights   not  as he put it  on the question   Are you a socialist  Quieting aides who sought to cut short his session with reporters  he argued that the  party has not moved  and said that  the vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional sense  Some of Mr  Biden s longtime friends  who winced at his boast in Delaware  urged him to campaign as the center left Democrat he has always been  You can t try to out progressive the field  you ve got to be who you are   said William M  Daley  the moderate former White House chief of staff who lost a race for mayor of Chicago this year John Morgan  a prominent Florida trial lawyer who raises money for Democrats  said he believed Mr  Biden s authenticity would still connect powerfully with voters  Mr  Biden s  only sin   he said   is he loved people  But  Mr  Morgan added  it was past time for Mr  Biden to make a decision about the race  There are two ways to get in a cold pool   he said   toe by toe  or take a tequila shot and do a cannonball   

SQUAMISH  British Columbia   Everyone knows an electric fan can make people feel cooler on a steamy day  But could fans moderate the planet s rising temperatures Some of the world s biggest fossil fuel companies would like to find out Chevron  Occidental Petroleum and the Australian mining giant BHP this year have invested in Carbon Engineering  a small Canadian company that claims to be on the verge of a breakthrough in solving a critical climate change puzzle  removing carbon already in the atmosphere At its pilot project in Squamish  an old lumber town about 30 miles north of Vancouver  the company is using an enormous fan to suck large amounts of air into a scrubbing vessel designed to extract carbon dioxide  The gas can then be buried or converted into a clean burning   though expensive   synthetic fuel Investing in Carbon Engineering and other carbon reduction initiatives is part of an emerging effort by fossil fuel industries to remain relevant and profitable in a warming world  With electric cars and solar and wind power becoming increasingly affordable  executives acknowledge that business as usual could put their companies at risk Already  fossil fuel companies face a barrage of lawsuits  investor resolutions and regulations prompting them to invest more in clean energy  Advocacy groups are also pressing companies and lawmakers to keep oil and natural gas in the ground by challenging hydraulic fracturing  especially in Europe  and fighting pipelines meant to transport production from Canada s oil sands  This is about recognizing that climate change poses significant risks to all economic sectors   Fiona Wild  BHP s vice president for sustainability and climate change  said about the company s  6 million investment in Carbon Engineering   Climate change is no longer seen as a fringe issue  It s a business risk that requires a business response  Of course  big energy companies continue to drill for oil and gas and are pushing the Trump administration and other governments to open more territory to exploration But some businesses have signaled that they are changing  A few companies  including Royal Dutch Shell and BP  are linking compensation to emissions reductions  Equinor  the Norwegian oil company  plans to increase spending on clean energy to 15 to 20 percent of its capital investment by 2030  up from 5 percent now Carbon Engineering s pilot on the rocky shores of Howe Sound is one of several carbon  direct air capture  ventures being attempted around the world  It is still a small effort  but its backers say it could play an important role in arresting climate change Much of the work is done in an old industrial warehouse of corrugated metal adorned with faded graffiti  a structure once used by a company that made chemicals for the pulp industry  The temporary offices are decidedly makeshift  with the bathrooms entered from outside  No carbon is actually being pulled out of the atmosphere permanently because the company is still in testing mode Chevron and Occidental  which have each taken seats on Carbon Engineering s board  refused to disclose their investments  The company says it raised a total of  68 million in its most recent funding round to expand the pilot and develop its first commercial plant Critics of fossil fuel companies say such investments are so modest as to amount to little more than a public relations stunt  That s chump change for these guys   said Dan Becker  director of the Safe Climate Campaign  an environmental organization in Washington   I don t see any epiphanies  But other experts disagree   It could be greenwashing  but so what   said Dieter Helm  a professor of energy policy at Oxford and the author of  Burn Out  The Endgame for Fossil Fuels    If money is being spent on research and development to develop ways to sequester carbon  that is a good thing  Executives at Carbon Engineering said they welcomed investments by fossil fuel companies not only for the money but also for their engineering and lobbying skills  I have great big brothers now who are looking after me   said Steve Oldham  Carbon Engineering s chief executive   Initially companies wanted to show that they were thinking of being green  Now you are seeing action  The company said its commercial plants would have banks of large fans  33 feet in diameter  to collect air and run it through a complex chemical process Removing Carbon Dioxide From the AirCarbon Engineering  a small Canadian company  has developed methods to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere using  direct air capture  technology  It is one of several companies around the world working on the technique  The carbon dioxide may be reprocessed into fuel  or buried for disposal        g 0408 biz web CARBON box

with potassium hydroxide that attaches itself to carbon dioxide  More chemicals will be added to produce tiny white pellets containing carbon  The pellets will then be heated to more than 1 600 degrees to form carbon dioxide gas In one kind of plant the company hopes to build  the captured carbon dioxide could be injected underground  where it would be harmless unless some of it leaked back into the atmosphere  Mr  Oldham asserts that each such installation could eventually take as much carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere annually as 40 million trees In another kind of facility  captured carbon dioxide would be combined with hydrogen extracted from water to make synthetic fuel that can be processed into gasoline  diesel or jet fuel  The energy needed to produce hydrogen would come from wind turbines and solar panels to limit emissions The company s synthetic fuel would be more expensive than conventional gasoline  Production costs could be about  4 a gallon  according to Carbon Engineering  compared with more than  2 70 a gallon average retail price in the United States  But it could still be attractive to countries that spend tens of billions of dollars on crude imports  like India and Japan  Regulations taxing carbon could also make the fuel more attractive The company says its synthetic fuels could be used in standard car  truck and plane engines  and would cause less air pollution than traditional fuels Burning Carbon Engineering s fuel would release carbon dioxide  but it would not increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by much or at all because the process would be recycling carbon that was already in the air  executives said Early investors in Carbon Engineering include the Microsoft co founder Bill Gates and N  Murray Edwards  executive chairman of Canadian Natural Resources  a big producer of oil sands  a heavy oil that has a large carbon footprint  Oil and gas companies have to wonder about their future   said Michael Webber  an energy professor at the University of Texas at Austin   They know that someday the energy mix will be different  So there are a lot of motivations for this investment  Occidental wants to use the technology to find a sustainable supply of carbon dioxide that it can use to inject in its oil fields to increase pressure and extract more oil while also sequestering the carbon  The company is already the largest injector in the industry  but it now re injects carbon that was found in natural underground deposits   providing little or no environmental benefit  By recycling carbon taken from the air  it hopes to bury as much carbon as its fuels emit  or even more  As an added benefit  there is a federal tax credit for sequestering carbon  Every oil company should be striving to become carbon neutral   said Vicki Hollub  Occidental s chief executive   Ultimately  we think we can be carbon negative  Addressing climate change is a turning point for the industry  Chevron is seeking to meet a different immediate need  California requires refiners and other distributors to meet progressively declining targets of carbon in their fuels through 2030  Chevron  which is based in San Ramon  Calif   has two big refineries in the state that could use the synthetic fuel  We have a need for low carbon fuels   said Barbara Burger  president of Chevron Technology Ventures   The world needs transportation fuels and the public desires them  but they have an expectation that we lower the carbon content  And this is one of the options to do that  But ramping up the ambitious ideas put forward by Carbon Engineering and other companies into projects large enough to have an important environmental impact will take considerable investment Mr  Oldham said one of his carbon capture and sequestration plants would remove one million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually  a small fraction of the more than 33 billion tons humanity emits in a year  The sequestration process would cost roughly  100 per ton  which in Occidental s model could be offset in part by the increased oil production it would enable  The carbon could also be used to make cement and other building materials But in case of an acute global climate emergency  governments would probably have to step in to hasten removal of carbon from the atmosphere  Mr  Oldham said the cost of capturing and sequestering all the carbon needed to stop climate change would require trillions of dollars The company s synthetic fuel could also struggle to find markets because of its cost David Keith  an applied physicist at Harvard who founded Carbon Engineering and sits on its board  said the synthetic fuel would be most useful for trucks  ships and planes  while cars and other smaller vehicles would more likely be powered by batteries in the future  There is no way we are beating oil from the ground in a head to head competition without regulation   Mr  Keith said  referring to carbon taxes and other environmental policies  If there is sufficient political will to deeply cut emissions  he added   I think you will see a large amount of this technology in the next decade or two   

JERUSALEM   As Israelis get ready to go to the polls on Tuesday  a stark  fateful and long deferred choice has suddenly reappeared to confront them after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s unexpected promise to begin extending sovereignty over the West Bank if he is re elected Do voters want to make permanent their country s control over the West Bank and its 2 6 million Palestinian inhabitants  Or do they want to keep alive the possibility that a Palestinian state could be carved out there one day That question has been made newly urgent by Mr  Netanyahu  who is facing a career threatening challenge from a unified centrist party headed by a team of former army chiefs  His shocking announcement about Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank appeared to be a last ditch effort to rally his right wing base and stay in power For supporters of annexation  it is not only this week s vote that is on their minds but the American election in 2020  They call President Trump s staunch support for Israel a  historic opportunity  to proceed with annexation of some  much or even all of the West Bank   but one that comes with a ticking countdown to a possible new administration in Washington Two state proponents  while conceding that there is no way to know for sure how the Palestinians would react  say a sovereignty push would almost certainly lead to a nightmare of one kind or another for Israel  like a rise in violence and international condemnation The incremental entrenchment of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land is often called  creeping annexation   And until now it has occurred slowly enough  and piecemeal enough  to let supporters of a two state solution reassure themselves that such steps could still be undone or accounted for in future negotiations Applying sovereignty  by contrast  would be all but irreversible Whether accomplished quickly or by degrees  it is tantamount to annexation  and it would break with a quarter century old agreement  under the Oslo accords  that the status quo between Israel and the Palestinians must not be altered except through negotiations For years  Mr  Netanyahu positioned himself as a check on both sides in the debate  He placed himself to the right of supporters of a two state solution on the one hand  and to the left of those who want to annex the West Bank and see a so called Greater Israel fulfill the Zionist dream of a Jewish state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Those Israelis were once marginalized as part of the right wing fringe  But with fewer than half of Israelis still supporting a two state solution  it is the peace camp that is now out of step with the majority of society  A fast growing sovereignty movement  called Ribonut in Hebrew  has not only achieved political acceptability but has overtaken much of the powerful Israeli right wing No fewer than 60 bills pushing some form of annexation have been offered for a debate in Parliament since 2015  according to the human rights group Yesh Din  Support for declaring Israeli sovereignty over parts or all of Judea and Samaria has become the litmus test for all leaders of the right   said Michael B  Oren  a deputy minister under Mr  Netanyahu who is not running for re election  using the biblical names for the West Bank ImageThe Israeli settlement Beitar Illit in the West Bank on Sunday CreditRonen Zvulun ReutersAdherents of the sovereignty movement contend that the closer Israel has gotten to a two state solution  whether in pulling out of Gaza or in redeploying its forces out of much of the West Bank   the more death and bloodshed it has brought us  in uprisings  suicide bombings and rocket attacks  as Ribonut says on its website Every other member of Mr  Netanyahu s Likud party seeking re election had already embraced annexation  Their leader was the lone holdout Saturday night  under intense pressure in a neck and neck contest with a centrist former army chief  Benny Gantz  Mr  Netanyahu gave in  Lunging further to his political right  he declared on national television that he would indeed begin to  apply sovereignty  in the West Bank  The question you re asking is an interesting one  Will we move on now to the next stage   he told an interviewer   And the answer is  yes  We will move on to the next stage  Asked if he would extend Israeli law over the so called settlement blocs   large Jewish communities built on the West Bank that even many two state supporters assume the Palestinians would give up in trade for other Israeli territory in an eventual deal for their own state   Mr  Netanyahu said he would not stop there  I m going to apply sovereignty  but I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlement points  because from my perspective every such point of settlement is Israeli   he said The morning after  few Israelis were taking Mr  Netanyahu at his word  There is a term for his 11th hour pre election surprises  the  gevalt campaign   as in the Yiddish  Oy  gevalt   used to express incredulity or weariness In 2015  Mr  Netanyahu rallied his base by sowing fears of a big turnout by Arab Israelis that would hand the government to the left  This time  many see him as trying to induce the right wing to come to his aid with a promise to fulfill a settler dream  This is Bibi being Bibi   said Daniel C  Kurtzer  a former American ambassador to Israel under Democratic and Republican presidents  using Mr  Netanyahu s nickname Mr  Gantz  along with three other leaders of his Blue and White Party  two of them also former army chiefs  all forswore any such unilateral moves on the West Bank  They said that Mr  Netanyahu was merely trying to save his political skin  and that no Israelis were foolish enough to believe him Indeed  analysts quickly speculated about the loopholes through which Mr  Netanyahu could slip free of his new commitment  dragging his feet on the promise to avoid interfering with a potential Trump peace proposal  arguing that changing circumstances made it no longer workable  or acceding only to the subtlest incremental applications of Israeli law to the territories  but nothing that equated with formal annexation Michael Koplow  an analyst for the left leaning Israel Policy Forum  likened Mr  Netanyahu s remarks to a famous 2009 speech he gave at Bar Ilan University in which  under pressure from President Barack Obama  he declared his support for a two state solution ImageIn 2009  Mr  Netanyahu  under pressure from the Obama administration  delivered a speech declaring support for a two state solution CreditGovernment of IsraelIt was a high water mark for his openness toward a Palestinian state  and he has effectively been retreating from it ever since  But the Israeli left cited it for years afterward to pressure Mr  Netanyahu to keep a two state option alive Now  Mr  Koplow said  the right will be able to squeeze Mr  Netanyahu over his televised promise to proceed with annexation moves   and I don t think he ll be able to wiggle out of it  Mr  Netanyahu is also much weaker than he was 10 years ago  He faces a likely indictment on corruption charges  including bribery  which could force him from office  He has been widely expected  if the election result gives him the chance  to try to form a governing coalition that would enact retroactive legislation preventing a sitting prime minister from being prosecuted That could set up a trade off with his coalition partners  a get out of jail free card in exchange for concrete steps on annexation  said Daniel B  Shapiro  the American ambassador to Israel under Mr  Obama  The parties he will need to form this coalition can now insist that he follow through on sovereignty  in return for protection from the indictments   Mr  Shapiro said   He ll try to provide the minimum  they ll try to extort the maximum  Mr  Shapiro added   And there s no evident check coming from the Trump administration  as there always had been under every previous administration  saying   Don t do that   In response to the rise of the sovereignty movement  two state supporters have warned loudly of a domino effect that any annexation would set in motion  whether limited to a few big settlements  the Israeli administered portion of the West Bank known as Area C  or the West Bank as a whole  It will be taken by the Palestinians  by the other Arabs and by the international community as an Israeli national decision to slam the door on a two state solution  on a negotiated agreement   said Nimrod Novik  a former senior adviser to Prime Minister Shimon Peres who sits on the executive committee of Commanders for Israel s Security  a group of retired senior military and national security officials who support a two state solution The toppling dominoes  the group predicts  would begin with a wave of West Bank violence  the refusal of Palestinian security officers to continue cooperating with Israel  the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and the necessary re occupation of the entire West Bank by the Israeli military   an operation that would take weeks and require the entire standing army  more or less Even more serious  if Palestinians in annexed territory are not granted citizenship  it could pave the way for the kind of apartheid state that two state supporters have long warned against Sovereignty proponents insist that annexation of settlement blocs like Maale Adumim or Gush Etzion would actually meet little international or Arab resistance because of the expectation that those areas would remain in Israel under a two state outcome But Mr  Koplow said this was deceptive  Once you start down this annexation road  it s not going to stop at the blocs   he insisted   And that s where the real danger comes in  If the Israeli government annexes Maale Adumim  the sky isn t going to fall  And when that happens  the next step is going to be the overreach  There ll be a big push to annex Area C  And once you do that  that s the whole ballgame   

Sydney Brenner  a South African born biologist who helped determine the nature of the genetic code and shared a Nobel Prize in 2002 for developing a tiny transparent worm into a test bed for biological discoveries  died on Friday in Singapore  He was 92 He had lived and worked in Singapore in recent years  affiliated with the government sponsored Agency for Science  Technology and Research  which confirmed his death A witty  wide ranging scientist  Dr  Brenner was a central player in the golden age of molecular biology  which extended from the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 to the mid 1960s  He then showed  in experiments with a roundworm known as C  elegans  how it might be possible to decode the human genome  That work laid the basis for the genomic phase of biology Later  in a project still coming to fruition  he focused on understanding the functioning of the brain  I think my real skills are in getting things started   he said in his autobiography   My Life in Science   2001    In fact  that s what I enjoy most  the opening game  And I m afraid that once it gets past that point  I get rather bored and want to do other things  As a young South African studying at Oxford University  he was one of the first people to view the model of DNA that had been constructed in Cambridge  England  by Francis H  C  Crick and James D  Watson  He was 26 at the time and would call it the most exciting day of his life  The double helix was a revelatory experience  for me everything fell into place  and my future scientific life was decided there and then   Dr  Brenner wrote Impressed by Dr  Brenner s insights and ready humor  Dr  Crick recruited him to Cambridge a few years later  Dr  Crick  a theoretical biologist  liked to have with him someone he could bounce ideas off  Dr  Watson had played this role in the discovery of DNA  and Dr  Brenner became his successor  sharing an office with Dr  Crick for 20 years at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge The fundamental elements of molecular biology were uncovered during this period  many of them by Dr  Crick or Dr  Brenner  Their chief pursuit for 15 years was to understand the nature of the genetic code ImageDr  Brenner  left  received the Nobel Prize from King Carl Gustaf of Sweden at the Concert Hall in Stockholm in December 2002  Dr  Brenner shared it with two other scientists and believed he had deserved a second Nobel  for his work on the decoding of DNA CreditHenrik Montgomery  via Associated PressDr  Brenner made a decisive contribution to solving the code with an ingenious series of experiments in which he altered the DNA of a virus that attacks bacteria He showed that by making a series of three mutations  the virus would first lose  then regain  its ability to make a certain protein  as if the cell s reading of the DNA  tape  had come back into correct phase  The experiment showed that DNA is a triplet code  with each group of three DNA letters specifying one of the 20 kinds of amino acids of which proteins are composed  Dr  Brenner gave these triplets the name codon Other researchers were then able to figure out which codon specified each of the 20 amino acids  It fell to Dr  Brenner to identify two of the three triplets that signal  Stop  to the cell s protein making machinery Dr  Brenner was also the first to conclude that there must be some means for copying the information in DNA and conveying it to the cellular organelles that manufacture proteins  That intermediary  now known as messenger RNA  was discovered in 1960 in an experiment devised by Dr  Brenner and others With the fundamental problems of molecular biology solved  as they saw it  Dr  Brenner and Dr  Crick looked for new areas of inquiry  Dr  Brenner decided to approach the brain  but he realized he needed a simpler animal to study than the fruit fly  a standard organism used in laboratories He settled on Caenorhabditis elegans  or C  elegans  a tiny  transparent roundworm that dwells in the soil  eats bacteria and completes its life cycle in three weeks  That worm has spun off many developments  starting with the decoding of the human genome Using the worm  Dr  Brenner and his colleagues first worked out methods for breaking a genome into fragments  multiplying each fragment in a colony of bacteria  and then decoding each cloned fragment with DNA sequencing machines  His colleagues John Sulston and Robert Waterston completed the worm s genome in 1998  and they and others used the same methods to decode the human genome in 2003 Another major project  made possible because of the worm s transparency  was to track the lineage of all 959 cells in the adult worm s body  starting from the single egg cell  This feat  accomplished so far for no other animal  made clear that many cells are programmatically killed during development  leading to the discovery by H  Robert Horvitz of the phenomenon of programmed cell death The topic assumed an importance that transcended worm biology when it emerged that programmed cell death is supposed to occur in damaged human cells  and that cancer can thwart this process For their work on programmed cell death  Dr  Brenner  Dr  Sulston  who died last year  and Dr  Horvitz were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2002  But many people  including Dr  Brenner himself  believed he should have been awarded a Nobel much earlier for his and Dr  Crick s work on the genetic code ImageDr  Brenner  seated second from right  with other 1971

occasion  in fact  he has claimed that he is delighted to have been awarded two Nobel Prizes   the first he never received   his biographer  Errol C  Friedberg  wrote Sydney Brenner was born to Jewish immigrants in Germiston  a small town near Johannesburg  on Jan  13  1927  His father  Morris  a cobbler who could not read or write  had fled Lithuania to escape conscription in the czar s army  His mother  Leah  Blecher  Brenner  was an migr from Latvia Sydney was taught to read by a neighbor  When a customer at his father s shop learned that Sydney  at age 4  could read English fluently but that his father could not afford to send him to school  the customer paid the boy s tuition At 15  Sydney won a scholarship to study medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg  The scholarship covered only his fees  but he managed to afford university life by earning the equivalent of five cents a day by attending synagogue to help form a minyan  the quorum of 10 men required for public prayer During his medical training he became interested in scientific research while growing disenchanted with clinical medicine  After finishing medical school in 1951  he won a scholarship to Oxford to work on bacteriophages  the viruses that attack bacteria The scholarship required him to return to South Africa  In 1952  he married a fellow South African  May  Covitz  Balkind  who was divorced and had a son by an earlier marriage  She went on to a career as an educational psychologist  and she and Dr  Brenner had three children of their own Dr  Crick was eventually able to find Dr  Brenner a post in Cambridge  and in 1956 he returned with his family to England for good Dr  Crick  a physicist by training  was a theoretician  but Dr  Brenner was deeply interested in the practice of biology as well  He loved the laboratory  and he loved designing elegant experiments  As a student in South Africa  he had built his own centrifuge  If he had wanted to stain a cell  he first had to synthesize the dye At Oxford   he threw himself into bacteriophage research with the energy of a man digging a tunnel out of prison   Horace Freeland Judson wrote in  The Eighth Day of Creation   1979   a history of molecular biology Dr  Brenner s most ambitious project after the genetic code   understanding the brain of the worm   was in a formal sense a failure  His colleague John White  after a decade peering through a microscope  established that the worm s brain consists of 302 neurons  with more than 7 000 connections between them  But the job of then computing the worm s behavior  which was Dr  Brenner s goal  has so far proved too daunting ImageDr  Brenner at home in the La Jolla section of San Diego in 2003  For many years he divided his time between California and Cambridge  England  before taking up permanent residence in Singapore CreditRobert Burroughs Dr  Brenner s wife died in 2010  His survivors include their three children  Belinda  Carla and Stefan  His stepson  Jonathan Balkind  died last year In the early 1990s  Dr  Brenner went to work at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego on a fellowship  In 1996  with a multimillion dollar grant from the Philip Morris Company  he established and directed the nonprofit Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley  with a mission  in part  to track research in various genome sequencing projects From 1994 to 2000 he wrote an opinion column for the journal Current Biology  He originally called it Loose Ends but later changed the name to False Starts when it was moved to the front of the publication Among his many honors  besides the Nobel  was the prestigious Lasker Award in medical science  given to him in 1971 Dr  Brenner held positions at Cambridge and at the Salk Institute in San Diego  where he was appointed  as he termed it   extinguished professor  He had divided his time between Cambridge and California until  with his health declining  he took up permanent residence in Singapore while working as an adviser to the research agency  In 2003 he was named an honorary citizen of Singapore  He had been advising the Singapore government on science policy since the 1980s and was instrumental in the founding of the Molecular Engineering Laboratory there British and Singaporean news organizations said that Dr  Brenner  a former heavy smoker  had been treated for lung disease in recent years Known for his wit  Dr  Brenner boasted that aside from science   the other thing I m rather good at is talking  It was hard for any listener not to fall under his spell  He spoke slowly and precisely in a lingering South African accent  his sentences long and perfectly constructed and often ending with a joke  Insights into the nature of the cell would alternate with his playful inventions  like Occam s broom    to sweep under the carpet what you must to leave your hypotheses consistent    or Avocado s number   the number of atoms in a guacamole  For a short time he had been director of the Cambridge Laboratory of Molecular Biology  but he did not much enjoy working as an administrator  You become a mediator between two impossible groups   he said   the monsters

BEIJING   China s exports are expected to have rebounded in March after a sharp drop in February  while imports likely shrank for a fourth straight month but at a more modest pace  a Reuters poll showed If Friday s data are in line with forecasts or better  it could add to early signs of stabilisation in the world s largest trading nation as worries grow over slowing global growth But veteran China watchers said the gains may be due more to seasonal factors than a turnaround in lacklustre global demand  with shipments likely to jump after long Lunar New Year holidays had dampened business activity in February Exports in March are expected to have risen 7 3 percent from a year earlier  according to the median estimate of 32 economists in a Reuters poll  following a 20 8 percent drop in February  This distortion is particularly strong in early March but no longer around in the second half of the month as the impacts of the festival normally last for less than a month   analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note  China s Commerce Ministry said recently that both exports and imports had rebounded in the first half of March Factory surveys for March also provided some glimmers of hope on the export front  While export orders remained sluggish  there were some signs that a long spell of contraction is easing  We do not expect a distinct pick up in exports in the coming months as the recovery of the global economy is slowing down and a relatively strong yuan currency is expected to cap the rise   said Nie Wen  an economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai U S  and Chinese negotiators wrapped up their latest round of trade talks last week and were scheduled to resume discussions this week to try to secure a pact that would end a tit for tat tariff battle that has disrupted global supply chains and roiled financial markets A top White House official said on Monday the U S  side is  not satisfied yet  about all the issues standing in the way of a deal to end the U S  China trade war  but said progress was made in talks last week President Donald Trump said last week that a deal could be reached in about four weeks The global economy is slowing more than expected and a sharp downturn could require world leaders to coordinate stimulus measures  the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday as it cut its forecast for 2019 world economic growth for the third time But the IMF edged up its outlook for Chinese growth to 6 3 percent this year  in part because the Sino U S  trade war had not escalated as much as feared  WEAK IMPORTS China s imports in March are expected to have fallen 1 3 percent from a year earlier  though the drop was seen narrowing from the previous month s 5 2 percent decline  Factory activity surveys had shown an unexpected return to growth last month  suggesting domestic demand was starting to respond to a slew of government economic support measures Still  most of the poll respondents pencilled in a contraction in imports  with the lowest forecast projecting a 18 2 percent drop  Ramped up infrastructure investment has lifted imports last month  but factories restocking demand likely stayed weak as fears about the medium  to long  term economic outlook remained   Nie said Policymakers have acknowledged the economy is under pressure as multi year debt and pollution crackdowns have deterred investment  while the U S  China trade war is hurting China s export sector  threatening even more jobs In response  Beijing has announced more spending on roads  railways and ports  along with trillions of yuan of tax cuts to ease pressure on corporate balance sheets and avert a sharper economic slowdown Investors are closely watching to see how long it will take those support measures to take hold  which could lift some of the gloom hanging over the global economy  But analysts believe China will still need to loosen policy further in coming months to ensure a sustained economic turnaround China s overall trade surplus is seen to have expanded to  7 05 billion in March from  4 08 billion the previous month  according to the Reuters poll   Reporting by Lusha Zhang and Beijing Monitoring Desk  Editing by Kim Coghill  

Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines   and the power brokers who shape them           Aircraft manufacturers like Boeing rarely face a criminal investigation resulting from plane crashes  But last fall a grand jury in Washington  D C   issued a subpoena for records after the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max plane  In the wake of the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash involving similar circumstances  the F B I  has joined that investigation The New York Times described Boeing s push to develop the 737 Max as  frenetic  and reported that prosecutors and regulators are investigating whether that led Boeing  to miss crucial safety risks and to underplay the need for pilot training  But what federal criminal laws are the investigators looking at as they pore over Boeing s records  Both the Justice Department and Boeing have declined to comment on the criminal inquiry One statute they may consider is the federal false statements law  The broad statute is used when a company provides information to a federal agency like the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the safety of a plane and makes it a crime to provide an agency with  any materially false  fictitious  or fraudulent statement or representation  about a matter that comes within its jurisdiction Investigators will examine whether Boeing made any false statements regarding a new software system added to avoid stalls in Boeing s 737 Max series  Investigators suspect that faulty data from sensors on both planes may have caused the system  known as MCAS  to malfunction  Boeing s chief executive has said that the automated flight system played a role in the two crashes Boeing also charged extra for two safety features on its 737 Max jets that might have helped the pilots detect erroneous sensor readings to avoid problems with the software Investigators likely will examine whether Boeing made any misstatements about the upgrades or if the company failed to disclose possible safety problems to the F A A  without those upgrades  The false statement law covers not only outright lies  but also submissions in which a person  falsifies  conceals  or covers up  information submitted to a federal agency  There have been a number of prosecutions involving false statements to the F A A  under the statute  Most of those cases  though  involve pilots who fail to disclose information that might result in the agency revoking or refusing to renew a license The challenge to bringing a false statement charge is that the government must show they were made  knowingly and willfully   That means negligence by Boeing would not be enough to prove a violation The criminal investigation may also examine whether Boeing violated a law adopted in 2000  The statute makes it a crime to  knowingly and with intent to defraud  to falsify or conceal a material fact about an aircraft part  or to make  any materially fraudulent representation  about a part  It can be applied to conduct outside the United States so long as the company is organized under the laws of this country  which  as a Delaware corporation  Boeing is The aircraft fraud parts law carries stiff penalties  including a fine of  10 million for each violation by a company and a sentence of up to life in prison for individuals charged if the part involved was the  proximate cause  of a malfunction that resulted in death  A conviction also could result in a criminal forfeiture of  any property constituting  or derived from  any proceeds that the person obtained  directly or indirectly  as a result of the offense  If there is evidence of fraud and not just false statements  the Justice Department could also pursue a wire fraud case  Prosecutors used that law against General Motors for the failure of ignition switches in certain models that caused a number of deaths  along with a charge under the false statement law  In addition  the auto parts maker Takata pleaded guilty to a wire fraud charge for installing faulty airbag inflaters Federal prosecutors have a number of options if there is evidence that Boeing intentionally provided false or misleading information to the F A A  The investigation is still in a preliminary stage  and there is no guarantee that a criminal case will emerge  For the company  there is danger in any criminal investigation because even the hint of possible misconduct could have significant consequences as it tries to deal with the fallout from crashes of its best selling aircraft  

WASHINGTON   U S  consumer prices increased by the most in 14 months in March  but the underlying inflation trend remained benign amid slowing domestic and global economic growth The mixed report from the Labor Department on Wednesday was broadly supportive of the Federal Reserve s decision last month to suspended its three year campaign to raise interest rates  The U S  central bank dropped projections for any rate hikes this year after lifting borrowing costs four times in 2018  Minutes of the Fed s March 19 20 meeting  published on Wednesday  showed most policymakers viewed price pressures as  muted   but expected inflation to rise to or near the central bank s 2 percent target  The Fed s preferred inflation measure  the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy is currently at 1 8 percent  For the most part  inflation remains tame   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania   The Fed effectively went on vacation and is likely to stay there for quite a few more months  The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0 4 percent  boosted by increases in the costs of food  gasoline and rents  That was the biggest advance since January 2018 and followed a 0 2 percent gain in February In the 12 months through March  the CPI increased 1 9 percent  The CPI gained 1 5 percent in February  which was the smallest rise since September 2016  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI climbing 0 3 percent in March and accelerating 1 8 percent year on year Stripping out the volatile food and energy components  the CPI nudged up 0 1 percent  matching February s gain  The so called core CPI was held down by a 1 9 percent plunge in apparel prices  the largest drop since January 1949  The government last month introduced a new method and data to calculate apparel prices  Apparel prices  which had increased for two straight months  trimmed the core CPI by 0 07 percentage point in March  Many economists expected a reversal in April  The new price collection methodology for apparel incorporates corporate data from one unidentified department store to complement prior survey based collection   said Kathy Bostjancic  head of U S  Macro Investor Services at Oxford Economics in New York   The new methodology appears more likely to show large monthly declines due to the lifecycle of apparel  LOW INFLATION EXPECTATIONSIn the 12 months through March  the core CPI increased 2 0 percent  the smallest advance since February 2018  The core CPI rose 2 1 percent year on year in February The dollar was trading slightly lower against a basket of currencies  while U S  Treasury prices rose  Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher  Inflation has remained muted  with wage growth increasing moderately despite tightening labor market conditions  Minutes of the March policy meeting showed some Fed officials believed the benign price pressures could be the result of low inflation expectations and also an indication the labor market was likely not as tight as implied by measures of resource utilization   The minutes reinforce our view that rates are on hold for the foreseeable future  though this could shift if the economy and or inflation surprise to the up or down sides   said Sal Guatieri  a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto A 3 5 percent jump in energy prices in March accounted for about 60 percent of the increase in the CPI last month  Gasoline prices surged 6 5 percent  the biggest gain since September 2017  after rising 1 5 percent in February  Food prices gained 0 3 percent after accelerating 0 4 percent in February  Food consumed at home increased 0 4 percent  Consumers also paid more for rent  Owners  equivalent rent of primary residence  which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home  increased 0 3 percent in March after a similar gain in February Healthcare costs rebounded 0 3 percent after slipping 0 2 percent in February  There were increases in the costs of prescription medication and hospital services The cost of new vehicles rebounded 0 4 percent after declining 0 2 percent in February  But there were decreases in the prices of used motor vehicles and trucks  airline fares and motor vehicle insurance   Reporting by Lucia Mutikani  Editing by Andrea Ricci  

SYDNEY MELBOURNE   Australians will go to the polls in a general election on May 18 after Prime Minister Scott Morrison fired the starting gun on Thursday on a campaign set to be fought over taxation  climate change and inequality Morrison and his main opponent  Labor party leader Bill Shorten  both used the Australian phrase  a fair go  to frame their campaigns around a national sense of equality and opportunity  albeit from very different angles Opinion polls have had center left Labor well ahead for years and show that the coalition of Morrison s Liberals and the rural focused Nationals party is headed for a resounding defeat   It s an enormous mountain to climb   said political science professor Paul Williams from Griffith University in Brisbane  If  Morrison  were to pull this off it would be one of the greatest comebacks in political history   he said Morrison led his pitch to voters with his conservative coalition s economic credentials  framing the election as a referendum on its record of managing Australia s finances  So the choice to be made by Australians on the 18th of May is like it always is at every election  and that is  who do you trust to deliver that strong economy which your essential services rely on   he told reporters in Canberra However  Morrison s coalition governs in minority and must win seats to hold power  It has also had three prime ministers in six years  with leadership instability a major reason for its poor showing in opinion polls Labor promised higher wages and an end to tax breaks that favor the wealthy under its slogan  A Fair Go for Australia    We can manage the economy in the interests of working  and middle class people   Shorten told a news conference he called in a suburban backyard in the southern city of Melbourne   When everyday Australians are getting a fair go  this economy hums  Asked for his response to Labor s campaign  Morrison replied   I believe in a fair go for those who have a go  The campaign will run for five weeks but the major parties are set to suspend their campaigns on the Easter public holidays and Anzac Day on April 25  a war remembrance day in Australia and New Zealand SLOWING ECONOMYMorrison s pitch comes just as the economy shows signs of beginning to slow  Consumer spending has weakened as home prices fall after a prolonged property boom and high debt levels weigh on sentiment The International Monetary Fund said overnight stimulus may be needed in Australia and financial markets are fully pricing in the probability of at least one interest rate cut later this year  Markets reacted modestly  with the announcement no surprise for a poll that must be held by the end of May Morrison s pre election budget last week promised tax cuts for low  and middle income earners  while projecting the first budget surplus in more than a decade Labor promised to match the tax cuts for middle income earners and pledged bigger concessions for lower paid workers  It will fund the income tax cuts by curbing capital gains tax discounts  seeking greater taxes from multinationals and banks  and scrapping a favorable tax scheme for property investors called negative gearing  the party said  Labor s higher tax and regulation agenda may be a negative for Australian assets  but this could be partly offset in the short term by more targeted fiscal stimulus   said AMP Capital Chief Economist Shane Oliver  The May election presents a starker choice than has been the case since the 1970s and so suggests greater uncertainty for investors than usual   he said It will be Morrison s first election as leader since he replaced former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in August after a party room revolt  That did little to improve the coalition s weak poll numbers and the government remains divided over energy and social policies  I think the zeitgeist is changing a little bit away from fiscal rigor to fairness   said Mark Triffitt  a public policy lecturer at the University of Melbourne  There are a lot of people that take that fiscal rigor and budget surplus as very  very fundamental  but I think that s shifting back into   What s the point of having a budget surplus if I feel like I m not getting ahead     he said   Reporting by Tom Westbrook in SYDNEY and Sonali Paul in MELBOURNE  Editing by Darren Schuettler  Grant McCool and Paul Tait

WASHINGTON   U S  President Donald Trump praised his Egyptian counterpart  Abdel Fattah al Sisi  as a  great president  on Tuesday  even as a bipartisan group of U S  lawmakers raised concerns about Sisi s record on human rights  efforts to keep him in office for many years and planned Russian arms purchases Egypt s parliament has proposed constitutional reforms aimed at allowing Sisi to remain in power until 2034  which senior U S  lawmakers and advocacy groups have criticized  along with Egypt s repression of human rights Asked if he backed the efforts to allow Sisi to potentially stay in power for 15 more years  Trump told reporters   I think he s doing a great job  I don t know about the effort  I can just tell you he is doing a great job     great president  Sisi is a former general who came to power after the military overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 following mass protests against his rule  Sisi was elected the following year He has since overseen a sweeping crackdown on both Islamist and liberal opposition  Activists consider it the worst repression in Egypt s modern history Trump  who referred to Sisi as  my friend   made no mention of human rights as the two spoke to reporters In a later statement stressing Trump s commitment to Egypt  the White House mentioned the issue in its fifth bullet point  saying   The United States encourages the Egyptian government to preserve space for civil society and to protect human rights  PRAISING RELATIONSHIP WITH EGYPTEgypt  the Arab world s most populous nation  is of strategic importance to the United States because of its peace treaty with Israel and control of the Suez Canal  a vital waterway for global commerce as well as the U S  military  The U S  Congress has set aside  1 4 billion in aid to Egypt in recent years While there continues to be support for such aid  U S  lawmakers have voiced deep concerns about Egypt s reported signing of a  2 billion deal with Russia to buy more than 20 Sukhoi SU 35 fighter jets and weapons for the aircraft Trump did not answer a question about Egypt s planned Russian arms purchase  which could expose the country to U S  sanctions  He said  a lot of progress has been made     in terms of terrorism and other things with Egypt   We ve never had a better relationship  Egypt and the United States  than we do right now   Trump added as the two men spoke to reporters before meeting in the White House Oval Office  All the credit goes to you  Mister President   Sisi responded through an interpreter   Thank you very much for your support on all fronts  In a letter released on Monday  leading senators said Egypt had  unjustly detained  more than a dozen Americans  and called for their release  They also raised  serious concerns about the erosion of political and human rights  The letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was signed by the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee s Republican chairman  Jim Risch  the panel s senior Democrat  Bob Menendez  and 15 other senators During a congressional hearing  Patrick Leahy  the Senate Appropriations Committee s top Democrat  asked Pompeo to explain Trump s praise for authoritarian leaders  Maybe you can explain why a dictator like Egypt s President al Sisi is feted at the White House  Russia s President  Vladimir  Putin  North Korea s Kim Jong Un and Turkey s President  Tayyip  Erdogan are praised as strong leaders and the Saudi Crown Prince is treated as an indispensable friend and ally   he said Pompeo disputed that the Trump administration was treading lightly on human rights and he praised Egypt s actions in support of Israel   We have not been remotely bashful   he said The Egyptian embassy was not immediately available for comment The White House said in a statement that Trump and Sisi discussed water issues   These complex issues must be addressed through negotiations and with respect for international best practices   the statement said The statement did not refer to a specific water issue  but Egypt has criticized a dam Ethiopia is building on the River Nile  saying it could restrict waters coming from Ethiopia s highlands  through the deserts of Sudan  to Egyptian fields and reservoirs    Reporting by Jeff Mason and Roberta Rampton  Additional reporting by Mohammad Zargham  Patricia Zengerle and Arshad Mohammed  Writing by Arshad Mohammed and Mohammad Zargham  Editing by Bill Berkrot  Leslie Adler and Peter Cooney  

TOKYO   Nissan shareholders voted on Monday to remove Carlos Ghosn from the company s board  severing one of its last ties to an executive who once was hailed as the automaker s savior Mr  Ghosn  Nissan s longtime chairman  who helped pull the company out of a deep slump nearly 20 years ago  is now in a Tokyo jail  where he faces four charges ranging from underreporting his executive compensation to  aggravated breach of trust  He was released on bail in early March  but Japanese prosecutors rearrested him late last week  accusing him of using a Nissan subsidiary to enrich himself to the tune of  5 million  Mr  Ghosn and a close associate  Greg Kelly  who was charged with helping him underreport his compensation  have denied all wrongdoing Nissan removed Mr  Ghosn from his position as chairman in November  shortly after he was arrested  but the board could not remove him as a director until Monday s special meeting Nissan s chief executive  Hiroto Saikawa  and the board of directors began the session with an apology and a deep bow to the assembled shareholders Nissan s top management  is in a state of soul searching   Mr  Saikawa said   We have to admit that there was a significant problem with our corporate governance   I have been asking myself over and over why the organization failed to stop the misconduct   he said   The reasons  I believe  were the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual for a long time  The audience was not in a forgiving mood  During a question and answer session  shareholders launched a salvo at board members  One person called for the entire group to resign to make amends for fumbling its responsibilities to the company  The suggestion was met with applause and hoots of approval from the assembly Mr  Saikawa responded by apologizing again   The board and executive committee members are dedicating their efforts towards the present and future of Nissan   he said  adding   I would like to ask for your support  Shareholders voted to replace Mr  Ghosn with Renault s new chairman  Jean Dominique Senard  He will assume the role of vice chairman on Nissan s board They also removed Mr  Kelly  who is free on bail in Tokyo  from his seat on the board Mr  Ghosn s sudden fall plunged the auto making alliance of Nissan and Renault into chaos  Mr  Ghosn led both companies and the alliance itself  and his arrest added tension to a relationship that already had begun to fray as Nissan struggled to assert independence from Renault But in recent weeks  the group  which includes the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi  has pledged to redouble its efforts to work together Renault is eager to move on and focus on the future business of the alliance  Tensions had blown up between it and Nissan after Mr  Ghosn s arrest  as Nissan leaked allegations of his wrongdoing into the media  Renault and the French government  its biggest shareholder  responded bitterly and maintained a presumption of innocence toward Mr  Ghosn But in recent months  Renault s own internal investigations began to turn up questionable use of company funds by Mr  Ghosn  These included a lavish Marie Antoinette themed wedding party at Versailles  and payments to a Renault Nissan business partner in Oman that are suspected of being used to help finance Mr  Ghosn s yacht  Renault referred both findings to French prosecutors In March  the companies announced the formation of a new operating board for the alliance  after discussions at Nissan s headquarters in Yokohama aimed at creating a new path forward for the three automakers  with a greater voice for the junior Japanese partners  The board includes two representatives from Renault and one each from Nissan and Mitsubishi Still  questions surrounding the imbalance in the alliance s ownership structure remain  While Renault has argued that closer ties would help the companies work better together and share costs  some Nissan executives remain concerned that Renault  which holds a 43 percent stake in the Japanese automaker  would still wield greater power  Nissan owns a 15 percent nonvoting stake in the French automaker Executives at both companies have said that the issue is one to be addressed in the future But it was clearly on the mind of at least one shareholder at Monday s meeting  who criticized Renault s role in making business decisions at Nissan  Does Renault  a French company  really know the Japanese market   he asked the board   Does it really understand Nissan s technology   I have my doubts

It was never like this before The migrants come now in the middle of the night or in the bright light of day  Men and women arrive by the hundreds  caked with dirt  with teens and toddlers in tow  They jump the small fences in remote parts of Texas  and they gather on the hot pavement at the main border crossing in California  Tired and fearful  they look for the one thing that they pray will allow them to stay in the United States  at least for a while  a Border Patrol agent Gone are the days when young  strong men waited on the Tijuana River levees for their chance to wade across the water  evade capture and find work for the summer  These days  thousands of people a day simply walk up to the border and surrender  Most of them are from Central America  seeking to escape from gang violence  sexual abuse  death threats and persistent poverty  The smugglers have told them they will be quickly released  as long as they bring a child  and that they will be allowed to remain in the United States for years while they pursue their asylum cases The very nature of immigration to America changed after 2014  when families first began showing up in large numbers  The resulting crisis has overwhelmed a system unable to detain  care for and quickly decide the fate of tens of thousands of people who claim to be fleeing for their lives  For years  both political parties have tried   and failed   to overhaul the nation s immigration laws  mindful that someday the government would reach a breaking point That moment has arrived  The country is now unable to provide either the necessary humanitarian relief for desperate migrants or even basic controls on the number and nature of who is entering the United States ImageMigrants seeking to turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents wait behind a portion of the U S  Mexico border fence in El Paso CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesThe immigration courts now have more than 800 000 pending cases  each one takes an average of 700 days to process  And because laws and court rulings aimed at protecting children prohibit jailing young people for more than 20 days  families are often simply released  They are dropped off at downtown bus stations in places like Brownsville  Tex   where dozens last week sat on gray metal benches  most without money or even laces on their shoes  heading for destinations across the United States At the current pace of nearly 100 000 migrants each month  officials say more than a million people will have tried to cross the border in a 12 month period  Some of those arriving today will have a strong legal case to stay under international refugee treaties and federal asylum laws  but most won t have a formal asylum hearing until 2021 The flow of migrant families has reached record levels  with February totals 560 percent above those for the same period last year  As many as 27 000 children are expected to cross the border and enter the immigration enforcement system in April alone  So crowded are border facilities that some of the nearly 3 500 migrants in custody in El Paso were herded earlier this month under a bridge  behind razor wire In recent days  officials have grasped for ever more dire ways to describe the situation   operational emergency    unsustainable    systemwide meltdown  One top official said simply   The system is on fire  An ineffective  not welcome  messageFor President Trump  the situation at the border has generated red hot fury  It erupted again on Sunday as he abruptly forced out Kirstjen Nielsen  his long embattled homeland security secretary  for what he considered her failure to put an end to the surge of migrants In recent days  the president has landed on a dark new message that  if taken literally  could mean an end to all immigration   legal and illegal   across the Mexican border  ImageAt the bus station in Brownsville  Tex   city officials took over a section of empty counter space to manage the intake of migrants  who wait in line after being dropped off by ICE CreditIlana Panich Linsman for The New York Times The system is full   the president said in California on Friday  standing in front of the rusting iron slats of the border wall that he wants to expand for hundreds of miles across the country s southern border   Whether it s asylum  whether it s anything you want  it s illegal immigration  We can t take you anymore  Yet  perversely  the president s own anti immigrant rhetoric has helped supercharge the pipeline of migrants from Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador  Smugglers lately have been buying radio ads in Central America  warning that Mr  Trump is about to shut down all immigration  If you ever want to go to the United States  they say  go now   They said they would take us by bus  We would be safe   said Jeremias Pascoal  16  who crossed into Texas earlier this month after paying  3 200 for a  guide  who showed his group to a road where he said they could surrender to the Border Patrol  Experts say the president is not wrong when he says that  legal loopholes  in America s immigration system are partly responsible for encouraging migrants to bring children like Jeremias on a dangerous journey that in some cases ends in tragedy  In December  two migrant children died in Customs and Border Protection custody after becoming gravely ill during their trip  Officials warn that more deaths are likely Christopher Cabrera  a vice president of the local union of Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas  pulled out his phone last week and scrolled through dozens of pictures he has taken out in the field  Groups of more than 100 people turning themselves in at night  seriously ill children huddled on the ground  being given medical aid  The majority of our agents get sick  Infectious disease is everywhere   Mr  Cabrera said  including in the Border Patrol s migrant processing center   There s always scabies in there  Usually we have chickenpox  We have tuberculosis in there  You name it  it s probably been through that building  So it s dangerous  It s dangerous for our agents  It s dangerous for the detainees that don t have anything  ImageA volunteer physician assistant examines a sick Guatemalan teenager in the medical clinic at Casa Oscar Romero  a migrant shelter in El Paso CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesBut the president has not chosen to prioritize a surge of new resources to the border  which could help ease the overcrowding and suffering that have gripped the migrants and the border communities where they arrive  Instead  Mr  Trump has insisted on simply trying to stop people from getting into the country in the first place   a policy of deterrence that not only has failed but has made the problem worse In an effort to send a  you re not welcome  message  the administration has tried a series of strategies  prosecuting everyone who crosses illegally  taking their children from them  tightening asylum standards  slowing down the number of people allowed to apply for asylum each day  forcing asylum applicants to remain in Mexico while they wait for court dates  In some cases  this approach has proved too cruel for the American public to tolerate and has run up against the protections enshrined in the Constitution  which the courts have decided protect migrants as well as citizens  Some of the president s agenda has been blocked by Congress or the courts  None of it has fixed the problem To the contrary  these policies have forced migrants to divert from well staffed border stations like the one in San Ysidro  Calif   where agents deliberately slowed down the number of migrants they would allow to cross each day  toward remote areas of West Texas and New Mexico  where the two migrant children died in December And the administration has done little to speed up the immigration courts  though that could be just the deterrent the president has sought  The backlog has been allowed to build to the point of a crisis   said Doris Meissner  the immigration commissioner in the Clinton administration and now a fellow at the Migration Policy Institute   They do not accept the basic proposition that this is a population where there are people qualified for protection and that enabling the systems we have is an answer  Seeking asylum  with childrenIn a series of international human rights agreements  beginning with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees  nations agreed to allow anyone to seek asylum  even if they entered a country illegally  The agreements defined a refugee as someone with a well founded fear of persecution based on  race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion   Determining whether an applicant receives asylum was left up to individual nations  but in the United States  the international obligations and the standards for asylum were largely incorporated into American immigration law beginning with the Refugee Act of 1980 Only about 20 percent of asylum seekers ultimately win the right to live and work in the United States by proving that they would face persecution in their home countries  Just wanting a better job doesn t qualify  Applicants have the burden to show evidence of past persecution or compelling testimony that establishes the  well founded  fear that they would face danger if they return home Some have won asylum  for example  by proving that their membership in a religious minority singles them out for harassment or threats  In the past  women suffering domestic abuse have qualified  as have some victims targeted by gangs  Generalized fear of violence does not qualify  Neither does poverty How Migration Is

process begins with a  credible fear  screening to see if an applicant is likely to succeed in the first place Out of nearly 100 000 credible fear interviews during the year that ended in September of 2018  an asylum officer confirmed a credible fear 74 677 times   a nearly 75 percent approval rate  A senior Trump administration official vowed on Tuesday to dramatically reduce that rate by making the standards tougher  But it is what happens after the credible fear interview that is at the heart of America s bitter immigration debate In 2017  11 292 immigrants who had been released on bond or on their own recognizance were ordered deported because they failed to show up for their immigration proceedings  a 26 percent increase over the previous year  according to Justice Department data

husband and torched their home  passed a credible fear interview at the border in 2013  She was released and settled in northern Texas  where she got a janitorial job and waited for her day in court  About a year later  she said  she unintentionally missed her first hearing and was most likely ordered deported for failing to appear She s not sure  because she stopped going to court at all   I got confused   she said   I ask God to look after me  There are too many problems in my country  I want to stay here  Maria Perez  a Honduran who joined a caravan with her 8 year old son  Yunior  in November  waited two months in Tijuana for the chance to apply for asylum after her son s father was killed by a man who continued to threaten her family  When her number   1 506   was finally called  she and her son were soon released to await their court hearings under the juvenile protection laws  She lives now with a friend in Northern California  but she does not have a lawyer and isn t sure how to proceed with her case  I am very worried  I don t know what to do   she said Families like Ms  Perez and her son are the biggest targets of Mr  Trump s fury  The president and his aides blame the nation s immigration laws   the president derisively calls them  Democrat laws    for creating an incentive for migrants to bring a child with them to improve their chances of getting into the United States  One of them is the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  a 2008 bill signed into law by President George W  Bush that requires immigration authorities to treat migrant children differently than they do adults  The other is a 1997 legal settlement in a case known as Flores  which prevents the government from holding children or families in secure detention facilities for longer than 20 days It was trying to get around those legal limits that prompted the administration last spring to begin forcibly separating migrant children from their parents   detaining parents indefinitely while sending children to shelters and foster care  The fierce political backlash forced Mr  Trump to abandon that approach The president s most recent initiative was the one calling for many migrants to remain in Mexico for the months or years it could take for an American judge to hear their case  that policy  too  ran afoul of the courts when a federal judge in California blocked its implementation  ImageA young boy clings to his mother as they wait in a line of asylum seekers at the bus station in San Antonio CreditCallaghan O Hare for The New York TimesFor some migrants  the policy effectively meant no asylum case at all Miguel Aquino  29  who fled El Salvador in a caravan in October after being shot in the leg and hand by MS 13 gang members  waited for weeks in Tijuana to apply for asylum at the sprawling San Ysidro port  the biggest on the border  He was interviewed and sent back to Mexico to wait for a court date In March  when he arrived for a preliminary hearing without an attorney  the judge gave him more time to find one   and sent him back to Mexico to wait  Mr  Aquino said he has called eight lawyers  and they all said they couldn t represent him because he is in Tijuana  At this point  he is tired of waiting  The next time  if I don t go with a lawyer and they don t give a clear answer   he said   I m going to look for another way to get in   The source of the problemMr  Trump often says he plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt illegal immigration  But when the standoff over funding for the wall led to a 35 day government shutdown in December and January  it actually made things worse  Many immigration judges were furloughed  and tens of thousands of deportation and asylum cases were delayed  in some cases for years  There is another problem with the wall  Slowing the exodus of migrants from Central America would need to start in those countries first Central America s economies are still weak  and residents face drug and gang violence at levels largely unseen in other countries  Many are subject to deep poverty  a situation that recently reached a crisis with the collapse of coffee  corn and maize crops  M C   a 23 year old Guatemalan woman who asked to be identified by her initials for safety reasons  received an anonymous letter recently in her hometown  San Marcos  warning her that she would be killed if she did not give the letter writers 65 000 Guatemalan quetzals  nearly  8 500 M C   who is three and a half months pregnant  went to the police in San Marcos  Then she got a second letter  warning her to never go to the police again  After she received a third letter  she made the decision to leave for the United States  I didn t want to come here at first  but then I think it s the best thing for the baby   M C  said as she sat in a migrant shelter in the South Texas border city of Brownsville   Here  he s going to grow without crime  He can go to school  American diplomats say the best way to confront that kind of lawlessness is with the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid that has been flowing to Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras for several years  designed to bolster the rule of law and improve the economy ImageAt the Good Neighbor Settlement House in Brownsville  migrants rest  exhausted  after a meal CreditIlana Panich Linsman for The New York TimesLast week  Mr  Trump abruptly abandoned those efforts  ordering the State Department to scrap about  500 million in aid to the three countries  Mr  Trump s decision has been criticized by members of both parties  who call it shortsighted Likewise  critics say that Mr  Trump s repeated denigration of Mexico over the years   including his insistence on building a border wall   risks undermining Mexico s willingness to help to keep Central American migrants from traveling to the United States  This is the first Mexican administration that has even been oriented toward doing that   Ms  Meissner  the Clinton administration immigration commissioner  said  But blaming other countries and painting those coming across the border from Mexico as a national security threat has never failed to animate Mr  Trump s core supporters   the ones who helped deliver him the White House in 2016  It s an invasion   Mr  Trump declared in February  after Congress denied him money to build a wall   We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country  In fact  the migrants are mostly victims of the broken immigration system  They are not  by and large  killers  rapists or gang members  Most do not carry drugs  They have learned how to make asylum claims  just as the law allows them to do  And nearly all of them are scared   of being shipped off to Mexico  separated from their children

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox   The Vaccine Safety Handbook  appears innocuous  a slick magazine for parents who want to raise healthy children  But tucked inside its 40 pages are false warnings that vaccines cause autism and contain cells from aborted human fetuses   It is our belief that there is no greater threat to public health than vaccines   the publication concludes  contradicting the scientific consensus that vaccines are generally safe and highly effective The handbook  created by a group called Parents Educating and Advocating for Children s Health  or Peach  is targeted at ultra Orthodox Jews  whose expanding and insular communities are at the epicenter of one of the largest measles outbreaks in the United States in decades On Tuesday  Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency in parts of Brooklyn in an effort to contain the spread of measles in ultra Orthodox neighborhoods there  He said unvaccinated individuals would be required to receive the measles vaccine   or be subjected to a fine   as the city escalated its campaign to stem the outbreak Peach s handbook   with letters signed by rabbis and sections like  Halachic Points of Interest    has become one of the main vehicles for misinformation among ultra Orthodox groups  including Hasidim  Its message is being shared on hotlines and in group text messages   Vaccines contain monkey  rat and pig DNA as well as cow serum blood  all of which are forbidden for consumption according to kosher dietary law   Moishe Kahan  a contributing editor for Peach magazine  said in an email  Vaccines are often grown in a broth of animal cells  but the final product is highly purified  Most prominent ultra Orthodox rabbis agree that vaccines are kosher  and urge observant Jews to be immunized Still  from enclaves in suburban Rockland County to the bustling streets of Brooklyn s Borough Park neighborhood  fliers tell the Hasidim to be skeptical of immunizations  On a recent Sunday evening  a four hour conference call promoted to ultra Orthodox families   with call in numbers for a variety of countries   offered advice from speakers who were presented as experts in vaccine science ImageFliers like this were hung in temples and along streets in Brooklyn  promoting a conference call that cast doubt on the safety of vaccines The anti vaccine movement goes beyond the confines of the ultra Orthodox community  There are thriving and growing pockets of vaccine opponents across the country that span ideological boundaries  In Washington State  some liberal communities shun vaccinations while conservative populations in Texas also oppose them  In New York s ultra Orthodox community  the anti vaccine movement has no clear public leader  Jewish leaders have said its message has spread through grass roots activism and has found a foothold largely because many Hasidim have limited access to the internet or rigorous scientific research By some estimates  there are approximately 300 000 ultra Orthodox Jews in New York  most live in Brooklyn s Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods and in Rockland County ImageA handbook created by Parents Educating and Advocating for Children s Health   It is our belief that there is no greater threat to public health than vaccines   the handbook states The majority of ultra Orthodox Jews emphatically say they would never go against the advice of doctors  and health officials say most Hasidim are vaccinated   I don t understand anyone that doesn t vaccinate   Abe Kornbluh said as he stood at the front of Bleu  his restaurant on 13th Avenue in Borough Park But there have been dozens of sick children whose parents have hidden their measles diagnoses from the public  And as public officials have scrambled to curtail the highly contagious disease  groups like Peach  whose members are mostly anonymous and are supported by national anti vaccine organizations  have only intensified their messaging  Many of the vaccine skeptics cloak their rhetoric with scientific language  as did the speakers on the recent conference call The call  which was advertised on fliers and accessible to anyone with the call in number  told participants its goal was to  create an intelligent discussion about what we are putting into our children   It featured speakers who were rabbis  doctors and lawyers  all of whom touted postgraduate degrees as they downplayed the dangers of measles and questioned the efficacy of vaccines A Hasidic mother who lives in Rockland County and participated in the call told The New York Times that none of her three children were vaccinated  and all of them recently had measles  The woman  who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution  said that she did not report the cases to doctors and that the children recovered in a matter of days  The body is not a machine   she said   The body is something that reacts to toxins in certain ways  I ve heard firsthand of cases of SIDS after children getting a vaccine   she added  referring to sudden infant death syndrome  Many studies have concluded that vaccines do not cause SIDS ImageThe Rockland County executive  Ed Day  addressed the measles outbreak last month by barring children not vaccinated against measles from public spaces  A judge ruled Friday against the ban  CreditBryan Anselm for The New York TimesThe measles outbreak began in New York in October  after ultra Orthodox Jews had returned from Israel where they were celebrating Sukkot  a Jewish harvest festival  They had prayed at the Western Wall  eaten in sukkahs and vacationed in the warm weather But Israel was in the midst of a monthslong outbreak  and health officials have said that several unvaccinated children came home with the virus  As doctors confirmed the first cases in New York  health officials and Jewish leaders rushed to stop the spread of the disease  which the United States had declared eradicated in 2000  Fliers that emphasized the importance of vaccinations were dispersed  Health experts organized meetings with Jewish pediatricians  and thousands of doses of the measles mumps rubella  M M R   vaccine were dispensed The majority of ultra Orthodox rabbis said they  too  urged vaccination  citing religious scripture about protecting one s health and the health of others  But all of that has not been enough to persuade vaccine skeptics Yosef Rapaport  a Hasidic journalist in Borough Park who has written about the importance of vaccination  said parents who do not want to immunize their children will seek rabbinical counsel that aligns with their views  You make up your mind and then try to find the interpretation in the Talmud   he said   You can always find some rabbi who will express doubt  Measles Outbreak Explained  Your Questions AnsweredFeb  20  2019Dr  Aaron Glatt  an infectious disease specialist who is also an ordained rabbi on Long Island  says he has explicitly pushed back on misinformation about the dangers of vaccines  He has emphasized to his patients and congregants that measles is spread by the unvaccinated and can be deadly  especially for infants under 6 months old and people with compromised immune systems  who cannot get vaccines   Unfortunately  we are not immune to anti vax people   Dr  Glatt said   They re found in every community  in every religion  and unfortunately  they re vocal  Dr  Yakov Kiffel  a pediatrician in Monsey in Rockland County  said that he has both vaccinated children and treated about a half dozen patients with measles since the fall  He said the majority of the sick were under 6 months old   the age at which a child can be given the first dose of the M M R  vaccine   and members of families that said they vaccinate More than 400 measles cases have been confirmed in New York since October  and the majority of them have been among Hasidim In the past week  according to the Centers for Disease Control  there were 60 new cases reported in New York City  Nine new cases were confirmed in Rockland County  which last month took the extraordinary step of barring children who were not vaccinated against measles from public places  A judge ruled against the order on Friday  temporarily lifting the ban  In the city  officials have prohibited unvaccinated children from attending schools in certain ZIP codes  predominantly in Williamsburg and Borough Park   an effort that has met mixed success Measles Outbreak  1 Student Got 21 Others SickMarch 7  2019Some Hasidim have said that longstanding tension between members of the ultra Orthodox community and the government have made them wary of officials  efforts to contain the outbreak  The past persecution of the Jewish people is still a factor  they said  And more recently  quarrels with secular leaders over a circumcision ritual that has transmitted fatal herpes infections to infants and the government s oversight of ultra Orthodox Jewish private schools known as yeshivas have only soured relations Some Hasidic parents also blame the absence of science education in yeshivas  The lack of a comprehensive secular education has raised a generation of some parents who do not appreciate modern science and do not have trust in the health system   said Dov Bleich  a Hasidic father of two who lives in Monsey and emphasized that most rabbis are supportive of vaccines   It s leaving them vulnerable to the anti vaccine crusade  Blima Marcus  a nurse practitioner at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  is one of the many health care providers trying to counter that crusade  Ms  Marcus  the former president of the Orthodox Jewish Nurses Association  said her work began last fall after a relative included her in a text message with nearly 40 ultra Orthodox mothers in Lakewood  N J  The majority of the women had not vaccinated their children  she said  but many began to reconsider that decision once she presented them with facts  ImageThe town of Monsey in Rockland County is home to a large community of ultra Orthodox Jews CreditBryan Anselm for The New York TimesBut Ms  Marcus acknowledged that her efforts are too limited to have a significant impact on the outbreak On Friday  rabbis met in Brooklyn to consider a proposal that would require all Hasidim to be vaccinated in order to attend synagogues and yeshivas  After the meeting  anti vaccine organizers sent a robocall to Hasidic homes  urging people to persuade their rabbis not to support the measure Dr  Paul Offit  the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia and the co inventor of a rotavirus vaccine  said people often do not understand the severity of diseases that have been eradicated by vaccines  Vaccines have been a victim of their own success   Dr  Offit said  What upsets me is we haven t learned from history   he added   What history teaches us is that measles is a killer  and vaccines can eliminate this killer  but now because of our ignorance we have to see children suffer  Still  opponents of vaccination ardently maintain that diseases like measles are not dangerous   The adverse events from getting measles  they re very  very  very low   Dr  Lawrence Palevsky  a pediatrician in New York  said on the recent conference call  There have been no reported deaths in New York State linked to the recent outbreak  But measles killed 110 000 people globally in 2017  according to the World Health Organization In New York  people like Shoshana Bernstein  a Hasidic mother in Monsey  worry about the potentially deadly consequences of listening to anti vaccine proponents like Dr  Palevsky  A basic Jewish tenet that every Jewish child is raised on  is love your friend like yourself   Ms  Bernstein said   This is woven into the very fabric of who we are  which is why the current situation is extremely frustrating because it is the complete opposite of

LOS ANGELES   By signing an executive order  Gov  Gavin Newsom of California recently ended the threat of execution as long as he is in office for the 737 inmates on the state s death row  the largest in the Western Hemisphere Almost immediately  Democratic presidential candidates lined up in support  calling capital punishment a moral outrage infected with racial bias  Senator Kamala Harris of California  a former prosecutor  called for a federal moratorium on executions  Former Representative Beto O Rourke of Texas did the same The moment marked a generational shift for a party where some candidates long supported the death penalty to protect themselves from being portrayed as soft on crime But Democrats aren t leading a national debate  they are following a decades long trend that has seen support for the death penalty drop from nearly 80 percent in the 1990s to just over 50 percent now  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race  Still  many feel that Mr  Newsom was doing his party no favors politically by forcing Democrats to talk about an issue that can still be fraught in a general election  Even in solidly Democratic California  voters in 2016 rejected a ballot initiative to end the death penalty and instead approved one to expedite executions In short  the moment captured what has changed significantly and what has not with an issue that is hard wired into the nation s psyche  Like the proliferation of guns  capital punishment distinguishes the United States from other Western democracies  virtually all of which have banned it Bill Whalen  a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who once advised Pete Wilson  a Republican former governor of California  wrote in a column   Every Democrat who wants to unseat President Trump now must figure out where they stand on the death penalty  He continued   For some triangulating Democrats  that s a tricky balancing act given that capital punishment is despised by the party s progressive base but is far more popular in the crime and order Heartland  The new attention notwithstanding  presidents are limited in their power over capital punishment  several experts pointed out in interviews  A president could clear federal death row  but that includes only 62 people compared with more than 2 500 condemned inmates in state prisons ImageTimothy McVeigh was executed in 2001 for the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City CreditDavid Longstreath Associated PressThe federal government has executed only three people since it reinstated capital punishment in 1988   one of them was Timothy McVeigh   and the last one was in 2003  Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field  The president has far greater power to determine the future of capital punishment in the United States by appointing justices to the Supreme Court  Experts expect the court to eventually rule on whether the Constitution allows executions at a time of increasing recognition of the enormous financial costs of the death penalty  high profile exonerations and research showing persistent racial bias in capital cases  The president  and what the president does  will bear very much on the Supreme Court s thinking on this  because the president does reflect the national electorate   said James S  Liebman  a professor at Columbia University who specializes in the death penalty New positions and different risksYou don t have to look back very far to see what a shift there has been in the positions taken by Democratic candidates In 2016  for the first time  the Democratic Party platform called for the abolition of the death penalty  But Hillary Clinton  the party s nominee for president  supported capital punishment  President Barack Obama never called for its end  either  Al Gore was a supporter  and so was Bill Clinton Some fear it could still be a losing issue in a general election against President Trump  who has talked about expanding those eligible for execution to include convicted drug dealers and could use the issue to rally his base and portray Democrats as weak on crime In a Twitter post about Mr  Newsom s moratorium  Mr  Trump wrote   friends and families of the always forgotten VICTIMS are not thrilled  and neither am I  The issue illuminates ideological and generational divides among many Democratic voters  Many of the presidential candidates are on record opposing capital punishment  Joseph R  Biden Jr   the former vice president who is expected to enter the race in the coming weeks  has supported it As a senator in the 1990s  Mr  Biden supported many get tough on crime policies that liberals now disavow  including limits on appeals for death row inmates  Biden was one of the major proponents of the 1994 amendments that severely limited the ability of death row prisoners to obtain meaningful judicial review   said Robert Dunham  the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center  a nonprofit group that provides analysis and information on capital punishment   Other people who have sponsored that bill have said they thought that was a mistake  And I think that voters will have to decide whether candidates for office have made mistakes and learned from them  or whether they are professing new views because the views of the public have changed  While Ms  Harris has long opposed capital punishment  she has a somewhat complicated history on the issue  As the district attorney in San Francisco  she refused to seek a death sentence for a defendant accused of murdering a police officer  provoking outrage from the right  But she defended California s death penalty as the state s attorney general  and twice  in 2012 and 2016  she refused to take a stand on ballot initiatives that proposed to abolish it Aside from Mr  Biden  most of the other candidates have opposed the death penalty  In addition to Ms  Harris and Mr  O Rourke  who have said they would support a federal moratorium  Senators Bernie Sanders  Cory Booker  Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand all said they support Mr  Newsom s moratorium  Two others in the race   John Hickenlooper  former governor of Colorado  and Jay Inslee  governor of Washington   imposed moratoriums in their states  It s kind of interesting that they are talking about it because it had pretty much dropped off the radar for national campaigns   said Kent Scheidegger  the legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation  a group based in Sacramento that has led campaigns in California and across the country in support of the death penalty   I d love to see it made an issue  He predicted that it may  drop back off the screen in the national campaign   I don t think Democrats want this to be an issue in a general election  because it would be a loser for them   he said Limiting executions  but not ending themFor all the shifts on the death penalty  its status now is defined by two things  The Supreme Court  which determines its legality  seems firmly in favor of it  And at the state level  where prosecutors  jurors and local courts administer the justice system  the number of death sentences and executions is plummeting A very different Supreme Court declared executions unconstitutional in 1972  saying the arbitrary use of capital punishment constituted  cruel and unusual punishment  under the Eighth Amendment  Four years later  after states began remaking their death penalty systems  the court ruled that executions could resume   The first new federal death penalty statutes were approved in 1988  Executions soared during a period of high crimes rates in the 1980s and 1990s  The high point for death sentences was 1996  when 315 people were condemned to die  In 1999  98 people were executed  the most in any year since 1976 ImageSupporters of the death penalty outside San Quentin State Prison in California during the execution of Keith Daniel Williams in 1996 CreditPaul Sakuma Associated PressSince then  as crime has fallen  the number of new death sentences dropped to 31 in 2016  a modern era low  and 20 states have ended the practice In three important cases in recent years   in 2002  2005 and 2008   the court has narrowed the death penalty s scope  ruling that juveniles and those with intellectual disabilities can t be executed  and limiting the types of crimes   mostly only murder   that are eligible for a capital sentence But the court   with two new conservative justices appointed by Mr  Trump  Neil M  Gorsuch and Brett M  Kavanaugh  and a 5 4 conservative majority   is seen as solidly behind the death penalty That was vividly illustrated by a bitterly divided recent case in which the court ruled by 5 4 to allow the execution of an inmate in Missouri who said a rare medical condition would make him choke on his own blood during his lethal injection Justice Gorsuch  writing for the majority  said the Eighth Amendment  does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death  If President Trump is able to nominate additional justices who are confirmed  his successor s influence on the death penalty would be limited to enacting a federal moratorium  nominating district court and appeals court judges and using the bully pulpit to make a case against capital punishment  The most toxic issue The death penalty has long played a powerful role in presidential politics  especially in the 1980s and 1990s It helped sink the candidacy of Michael S  Dukakis  a Democrat  in 1988 when he said in a debate that he would oppose an execution even if his wife  Kitty  were raped and murdered Four years later  Bill Clinton rushed back to Arkansas from the campaign trail to oversee the execution of a mentally disabled man convicted of killing a police officer  burnishing an image of being tough on crime  It was just the most toxic issue   said Stephen B  Bright  a professor at Yale Law School  who noted that during this time many state judges were removed from office for their opposition to the death penalty  Gov  Mario Cuomo of New York lost his re election bid in 1994 partly because he was against capital punishment  Mr  Bright said ImageMichael S  Dukakis  debating George H W  Bush in 1988  said he would oppose an execution even if his wife  Kitty  were raped and murdered CreditLennox McLendon Associated PressNow  the politics have shifted  Not only are Democrats more willing to speak out against the death penalty  but many Republicans   though not Mr  Trump   are turning against capital punishment on limited government grounds and  especially  because of high costs One study has shown that capital punishment has cost California  5 billion since the 1970s  Another study  by Ernest Goss  an economics professor at Creighton University  found that each death penalty prosecution in Nebraska cost  1 5 million more than when prosecutors sought life without parole Those more complex realities do not negate the potential for contentious politics in 2020  I think the Democratic primaries may be the first one in which candidates outflank one another on the left on criminal justice issues   said Carol S  Steiker  an expert on the death penalty at Harvard Law School But while Democratic candidates would very likely appoint judges and officials who support criminal justice reform broadly  few expect the death penalty to become a litmus test issue like abortion And it s not clear what will carry more weight in 2020 politics   the complex realities of the justice system or the history of the death penalty as a potent political weapon  particularly in the hands of Mr  Trump  You ve already got socialism and immigration  and you can add this to it   Mr  Bright said   The question is if it

NEW YORK   When a 17th century Dutch painting looted by the Nazis turned up for sale in New York in late 2017  the FBI s Art Crime Team moved in  verified its identity and helped win a court order to return the work to its rightful owners It was the latest of many high profile cases for the 22 person Federal Bureau of Investigation division dedicated to solving a wide array of art related crimes at an agency that is better known for chasing bank robbers  spies and other criminal rogues Solomon Koninck s 17th century painting  A Scholar Sharpening His Quill   was one of many treasures belonging to the family of art collector Adolphe Schloss that were seized by the Nazi supporting Vichy government in France 75 years ago  The portrait  which once adorned Adolph Hitler s Munich offices  disappeared at the end of World War Two  It resurfaced at Christie s auction house  which tipped off the FBI unit last year that a Chilean art dealer was trying to sell it   The evidence was really overwhelming   FBI Special Agent Chris McKeogh said  days after the work s formal repatriation to the Schloss heirs in early April   There was really no question that this was the painting in question  In its early days  recalled Robert Wittman  the Art Crime Team s founding chief  being art cops was not exactly  a path to directorship   But after 14 years  the team is getting more respect from fellow agents after several headline grabbing recoveries in the United States of art works and other cultural property  Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter said  People just think what we re doing is cool   said Carpenter  who now runs the unit from the FBI s Washington headquarters   I think we ve changed a lot of perceptions  even within the organization   he said   So now my phone rings off the hook weekly for folks wanting to be on the team  Since it was founded in 2005  the team has recovered nearly 15 000 objects worth nearly  800 million and secured more than 90 convictions CHAGALL  RENOIR AND RUBY SLIPPERSLast year alone  its recoveries included a painting by Marc Chagall that had been taken from the Manhattan home of an elderly couple nearly 30 years earlier  a Nazi looted work by artist Auguste Renoir and a pair of  ruby slippers  worth millions worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in the 1939 movie  The Wizard of Oz  It is not the money  Carpenter stressed  but rather the  intrinsic value  of stolen art and cultural property   anything from baseball cards to a  5 million Stradivarius   that determines whether the FBI will pursue it  The red sequined shoes stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Minnesota 13 years ago were a prime example  People responded to that case   he said   They said this is really important  this is a piece of Americana  Agents selected for the team must understand why art and culture matter to humanity  Carpenter said  Agent McKeogh pinpointed his art awakening to a college backpacking trip in Paris  On an obligatory visit to the Mona Lisa at the Louvre  he happened to pass Pierre Narcisse Guerin s 18th century oil painting  The Return of Marcus Sextus    I found a painting that spoke to me and spent about a half hour sitting in front it   said McKeogh  who is based in New York   And from there  I was really hooked  MOST VEXING UNSOLVED CASEThe United States was lagging far behind European countries in art crime fighting resources when Wittman helped launch the team in 2005  partly to track down antiquities that were looted from the Baghdad Museum after the U S  led invasion of Iraq Now a private consultant  Wittman was the bureau s original art sleuth  He said art thieves were always most vulnerable when they tried to unload their high profile  ill gotten gains  The real art in art heists is not the stealing  it s the selling   said Wittman  who had recovered more than  300 million in stolen art when he retired in 2008 after 20 years  While there are no reliable statistics on art crime  Carpenter said he thinks technology is making things worse because stolen works and forgeries can be sold anonymously on online marketplaces  If the Art Crime Team s most vexing case is a daring 1990 heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in which thieves made off with 13 pieces by Dutch masters Rembrandt and Vermeer and other artists worth half a billion dollars Despite a  10 million reward  none of them has been recovered  and the theft  considered to be among the biggest in art history  looms as the team s most glaring unsolved case  There s not a single person on the Art Crime Team that doesn t dream of the day that we can recover those pieces   said Carpenter   Reporting by Peter Szekely  Editing by Susan Thomas  

NEW DELHI   Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is rallying his nationalist base ahead of the world s biggest election  which starts on Thursday  but has become tighter than anticipated just months ago  because of falling incomes for farmers and a lack of jobs  Polls predict Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party led alliance will just about squeeze out the parliamentary majority needed to rule  a sharp drop from his commanding mandate five years ago  when he vowed to turn India into an economic and military power But his government s inability to create a million jobs every month for new entrants to the workforce  and ease farmers  distress over low product prices  has taken the shine off what is still the world s fastest growing major economy From sugar farmers in northern Uttar Pradesh going unpaid for their produce to small businesses in the south shuttered because a new  unifying national tax is too challenging to comply with  discontent has brewed for months  pollsters say In December  alarm bells clanged within Modi s Hindu nationalist fold after he lost three big battleground states in a final test of popularity to the main opposition Congress and its allies  led by Rahul Gandhi  But a surge in tension with traditional foe Pakistan in February has pushed Modi ahead  as he plays up his image as a defender of national security and paints his rivals as weak kneed  even questioning their patriotism at times   People were very unhappy  angry that Modi makes tall promises and doesn t deliver   said Shiv Chandra Rai  an Uber driver in the commercial capital of Mumbai  who said his unemployed brothers faced difficulties making ends meet in their home village in Uttar Pradesh  Everyone said there are no jobs  everywhere farmers are struggling  But on this issue of Pakistan we are confused now  Some people feel we have to vote for Modi on this issue  it is a national problem  Modi ordered air strikes on a suspected camp of militant group Jaish e Mohammad in Pakistan after it claimed responsibility for a deadly car bombing in Indian Kashmir  in the first such raid since the neighbors  last war in 1971 Pakistan sent warplanes into India the next day and the two engaged in a dogfight  Later  both nuclear armed foes threatened each other with missile strikes  before Western powers  led by the United States  pulled them back But Modi claimed victory  vowing more similar action if militant attacks continue in Kashmir  He attacked critics for questioning the efficacy of the strikes and the risks of raising tension with Pakistan   Why do these people get so disturbed when India acts strongly against the forces of terror   he asked at a rally this week in western India  referring to opposition leaders   Is their hatred for Modi so great they can t even unite when it comes to national security   he said to tens of thousands of cheering supporters wearing saffron headbands The Congress  led by Gandhi  and his charismatic sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who took up a party post in January  is trying to steer the campaign back to Modi s broken promises on the economy Gandhi has pledged a monthly payment of 6 000 rupees to India s poorest families  benefiting 250 million of a population of 1 3 billion  in what he called a final assault on poverty   The BJP s campaign is largely around nationalism  national security and this is echoed in their manifesto   said Sanjay Kumar  director of think tank the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi   Congress is trying to pitch in the election with regard to farm distress  rural crisis  unemployment   Nearly 900 million people are eligible to vote in an election spread over seven phases into next month to allow security forces and officials to ensure a free and fair ballot Voters will travel by buses  trains  boats to about a million polling stations  Votes will be counted on May 23 and results are expected the same day Gandhi  as Congress leader  had attempted to forge a grand alliance with a clutch of powerful regional parties fighting the elections  so as to avoid the splintering of votes  But the unwillingness of other Congress officials to give in to the demands of the smaller parties and the vaulting ambition of key regional figures frustrated his efforts Still the Congress said Modi represented a threat to every opposition group by pursuing its vision of a Hindu first India  stoking fear among its Muslim minority  The BJP denies such bias Modi s tactics were borrowed from the playbook of U S  President Donald Trump  said Sam Pitroda  an adviser to Gandhi   The strategy was  there is enemy at the border  in that case it was Mexican  and enemy  also  as people in the country  immigrants  Very similar  Modi says there is an enemy at the border   Anything you say  immediately everyone attacks you    Additional reporting by Devjyot Ghoshal  Editing by Clarence Fernandez

China s Marriage Rate Declines to Fresh Low for Fifth Consecutive Year  A mixture of social and economic factors contribute to a reduced willingness to marry ImageChina s birthrate has been on a decline over the past few years  and now the number of people tying the proverbial knot is also heading lower Last year  the marriage rate nationwide dipped to 7 2 newly wedded couples per 1 000 people  dropping for the fifth consecutive year  according to the National Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Civil Affairs The rate stood at 9 9 per 1 000 in 2013  and was 7 7 in 2017 The declining figures come as China is grappling with fewer newborns and a mounting number of divorces The birthrate was 10 94 per 1 000 on the Chinese mainland last year  down from 12 43 in 2017  the bureau said Meanwhile  couples deciding to end their marriages were rising rapidly  reaching 3 2 divorces per 1 000 people in 2017  said the Social Service Development Statistical Bulletin of 2017  The number was only 2 0 in 2010 Experts say the declining marriage rate is due to a mixture of reasons  including an aging population and increasing economic pressures on those hoping to start a family Liu Yuanju  a researcher at Shanghai based SIFL Institute  said the downturn in marriage rates is normal when considering the dwindling youth population  the main contributor to the trend  Due to the demographic structure  the marriage rate is expected to decrease further   he said Among young people of marriageable age  Liu said the longer periods of time people spend undergoing formal education have led to many putting off marriage until later in life  and the soaring costs of housing and child rearing in cities have fueled a growing unwillingness to start families The researcher added that it is crucial for the government to allay financial pressures in a bid to promote marriage  because the rapidly declining desire to marry and have children could lead to social and economic problems down the road Diversified urban lifestyles and women s growing financial independence also seemed to be crucial contributors to the lower marriage rates A report released in March by Beike Zhaofang a major housing trading platform said women s purchasing power has been increasing  with 47 9 percent of its buyers being female  And among female buyers  74 2 percent said they have not received financial assistance from their partners Almost 30 percent said they bought homes on their own  without even a helping hand from their parents  the report said A graduate student surnamed Xu in Tianjin  24  who has opted to stay single so far  said women can now pursue furthering their educations  enter the workplace or start a business  which sets them apart from their counterparts 30 years ago who had little choice other than to wed when they came of age  The changes have greatly reduced the appeal of marriage and childbearing for women   she said Li Lei

President Trump s older sister  Maryanne Trump Barry  has retired as a federal appellate judge  ending an investigation into whether she violated judicial conduct rules by participating in fraudulent tax schemes with her siblings The court inquiry stemmed from complaints filed last October  after an investigation by The New York Times found that the Trumps had engaged in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s  including instances of outright fraud  that greatly increased the inherited wealth of Mr  Trump and his siblings  Judge Barry not only benefited financially from most of those tax schemes  The Times found  she was also in a position to influence the actions taken by her family Judge Barry  now 82  has not heard cases in more than two years but was still listed as an inactive senior judge  one step short of full retirement  In a letter dated Feb  1  a court official notified the four individuals who had filed the complaints that the investigation was  receiving the full attention  of a judicial conduct council  Ten days later  Judge Barry filed her retirement papers The status change rendered the investigation moot  since retired judges are not subject to the conduct rules  The people who filed the complaints were notified last week that the matter had been dropped without a finding on the merits of the allegations  The decision has not yet been made public  but copies were provided to The Times by two of the complainants  Both are involved in the legal profession Judge Barry did not respond to emails or telephone messages left at her Manhattan apartment Judicial council reviews can result in the censure or reprimand of federal judges  and in extremely rare cases  a referral to the House of Representatives for impeachment In retirement  Judge Barry is entitled to receive annually the salary she earned when she last met certain workload requirements  Though the exact figure was not immediately available  it appears to be between  184 500 and  217 600 The Times investigation focused on how the profits and ownership of the real estate empire built by the president s father  Fred C  Trump  were transferred to Donald J  Trump and his siblings  often in ways designed to dodge gift and estate taxes A lawyer for the president  Charles J  Harder  said last fall   The New York Times s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false  and highly defamatory  Judge Barry had been a co owner of a shell company   All County Building Supply   Maintenance   created by the family to siphon cash from their father s empire by marking up purchases already made by his employees  The Times investigation found  Judge Barry  her siblings and a cousin split the markup  free of gift and estate taxes  which at the time were levied at a much higher rate than income taxes VideoBy the end of 1997  Donald Trump and his siblings owned nearly all of Fred Trump s empire  free and clear of estate taxes  How did they do it  A special type of trust with a clunky acronym  GRAT  short for grantor retained annuity trust  It is one of the tax code s great gifts to the ultrawealthy On a financial disclosure form filed in 1999  Judge Barry noted that her share of the All County profits for the previous 17 months totaled just over  1 million The family also used the padded invoices to justify higher rent increases in rent regulated buildings  artificially inflating the rents of thousands of tenants  Former prosecutors told The Times that if the authorities had discovered at the time how the Trumps were using All County  their actions would have warranted a criminal investigation for defrauding tenants  tax fraud and filing false documents Similarly  Judge Barry benefited from the gross undervaluation of her father s properties when she and her siblings took ownership of them through a trust  sparing them from paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes  The Times found  For years  she attended regular briefings at her brother s offices in Trump Tower to hear updates on the real estate portfolio and to collect her share of the profits  When the siblings sold off their father s empire  between 2004 and 2006  her share of the windfall was  182 5 million  The Times found Judge Barry was nominated to the Federal District Court in New Jersey by President Ronald Reagan in 1983  after several years as a federal prosecutor  She was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by President Bill Clinton in 1999 In February 2017  shortly after her brother s inauguration  she notified the court that she would stop hearing cases and give up her staff and chambers  She was then considered a senior inactive judge  a status that did not entitle her to salary increases  but that left her still subject to conduct inquiries  Judge Barry did not announce a reason for the change at the time Following confidentiality requirements  Judge Barry s name does not appear on the order ending the investigation or the correspondence with the complainants  The order identifies the judge in question as a senior inactive judge  about whom complaints were filed in October 2018  Under court rules  all complaints are reviewed by a judge  and those with an allegation of misconduct or disability are generally referred to a panel of judges for investigation  The complaints allege  on the basis of a news article  that the then inactive senior circuit judge may have committed misconduct relating to tax and financial transactions   says the order  dated April 1 The complaints had been transferred to the Second Circuit to avoid conflicts with judges who knew Judge Barry Scott Shuchart  a lawyer who filed one of the complaints  said he had done so as a concerned member of the legal profession  He said he found it  galling  that Judge Barry  while still receiving her federal pension  was now immune from judicial misconduct proceedings  just because she changed from one form of retired status to another  In an opinion article last October for The Washington Post  Mr  Shuchart wrote that he had quit his job at the Department of Homeland Security  where he had served since the Obama administration

WASHINGTON   Senator Bernie Sanders  whose  18 million fund raising haul has solidified his status as a front runner for the Democratic presidential nomination  said Tuesday that he would release 10 years of tax returns by Tax Day on Monday and acknowledged that he has joined the ranks of the millionaires he has denounced for years  April 15 is coming   Mr  Sanders  whose refusal to release his full past returns has become an issue in the campaign  said in an interview in his office   We wanted to release 10 years of tax returns  April 15  2019  will be the 10th year  so I think you will see them  Told that he was being compared to President Trump  who has refused to release his tax returns  Mr  Sanders got more specific   On the day in the very immediate future  certainly before April 15  we release ours  I hope that Donald Trump will do exactly the same  We are going to release 10 years of our tax returns  and we hope that on that day Donald Trump will do the same  Mr  Sanders s refusal to release his full tax returns was a relatively minor issue in the 2016 Democratic primaries  when Hillary Clinton goaded him to be more transparent  But Mr  Trump s refusal to release his   and the subsequent effort by House Democrats to force the release   have raised the issue s profile  Mr  Sanders has bristled at comparisons between his behavior and the president s  Not being a billionaire  not having investments in Saudi Arabia  wherever he has investments  all over the world  mine will be a little bit more boring   Mr  Sanders said Reminded that he is a millionaire  he did not shirk from the description  I wrote a best selling book   he declared   If you write a best selling book  you can be a millionaire  too  A number of Mr  Sanders s rivals for the Democratic nomination  including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Gov  Jay Inslee of Washington  have already released their 2018 tax returns  Ms  Gillibrand has made 12 years of her returns public  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts released 10 years of her returns last year Mr  Sanders  a Vermont independent  has repeatedly promised to do the same  but has been evasive about his timing  prompting some speculation that he does not want voters to know what is in them  He has said he and his wife  Jane  who serves as an adviser to his presidential campaign  prepare the returns themselves  without an accountant In 2016  they released 2014 returns showing  205 617 in income  including  156 441 in wages and salary and  46 213 from Social Security benefits Mr  Sanders   whose trademark on the campaign trail is his attacks on the  millionaires  and the  billionaires    had consistently ranked among the least wealthy members of the Senate But since his 2016 run for the presidency  Mr  Sanders s financial fortunes have improved  His 2017 Senate financial disclosure forms show he earned roughly  1 06 million that year  more than  885 000 from book royalties  His most recent book   Where We Go From Here   was published last year

Lori Loughlin  the former TPG executive Bill McGlashan and the former Pimco C E O  Douglas Hodge The new charges carry tougher penalties than the first wave of accusations of mail and wire fraud  The original charges command a fine of at least  250 000  while money laundering involves fines of  500 000 or twice the value of the property involved Some legal experts think jail time is possible for these defendants  Duncan Levin  a former federal prosecutor  told the WaPo that money laundering charges are  one of the most powerful weapons  that the Justice Department can wield in court  and can

After Fisher Price s Rock  n Play sleeper was linked to multiple infant deaths  the company and a government regulator issued a joint warning to consumers about the product on Friday  stopping short of a recall But on Tuesday  the American Academy of Pediatrics called on Fisher Price to withdraw the Rock  n Play immediately  The group s president  Dr  Kyle Yasuda  said in a statement that the sleeper  which rocks babies to sleep in a cloth covered cradle  was  deadly  because it could cause asphyxiation Fisher Price  which stood by the safety of the Rock  n Play and said a recall was not necessary  can keep selling the product  Here s why The potential dangerIn issuing the safety alert  the consumer commission said it was aware of 10 deaths since 2015 of children 3 months or older linked to the Rock  n Play  Each of the children had rolled from their backs to their stomachs or sides while in the sleeper without being secured in the product s harness restraint  Update  Fisher Price recalls Rock  n Play sleeper linked to infant deaths  The warning recommended that consumers not use the Rock  n Play with children older than 3 months or those who can roll over  according to the federal regulator  the Consumer Product Safety Commission Chuck Scothon  Fisher Price s general manager  said in a statement on Wednesday that the Rock  n Play  meets all applicable safety standards   It is essential that the product warnings and instructions are always followed   he said But the warning that was issued  did not go far enough to ensure safety and protect infants   the pediatricians  group said  Citing reporting by Consumer Reports  the group said the sleeper had been linked to 32 infant deaths from 2011 to 2018  including some involving children under 3 months The commission said Wednesday that it was investigating other deaths connected the Rock  n Play  and that a recall was possible in the future  C P S C  has requirements it must follow for any decisions concerning recalls   said Patty Davis  an agency spokeswoman   If the evidence shows the need for a recall  we will take that step  The path to a recallBefore seeking any recall  the commission must conclude there is a  substantial product hazard   To make such a finding  it considers factors like whether the risk of injury is obvious to consumers  the severity of that risk and how many people are exposed to the product Most recalls are voluntary and prompted either by companies contacting the commission with concerns about a product or agreeing to stop selling a product after being approached by regulators Issuing a recall is a collaborative process  The commission works with companies to decide a recall s parameters  including the number of affected units and whether consumers should get refunds In rare cases  the commission can seek a mandatory recall by suing companies that refuse to agree to a voluntary recall  threatening to lay out its case publicly in legal filings Other federal agencies have their own recall policies  Last month  the Food and Drug Administration said it had found asbestos in cosmetics sold by Claire s  a retailer focused on products for teenagers  The agency  which said Claire s had refused to recall the products  urged consumers not to use them The company later said it had stopped selling the cosmetics at issue and similar items  out of an abundance of caution  A shifting regulatory landscape The commission has recently been leaning more heavily on warnings than on recalls  according to Pamela Gilbert  the agency s executive director from 1995 to 2001 In March  the commission s website listed 20 recalls for products including an electric bicycle  a riding saddle and a saut pan  In March 2018  there were 29 such listings Ms  Gilbert said the shift away from recalls was a  very dangerous trend   Consumers react to product recalls with more urgency and more care and attention than they do for warnings   she said   When deaths are involved  especially for babies and children  warnings are really not the appropriate remedy  Joseph Martyak  a spokesman for the safety commission  said that a warning or a safety alert could precede a voluntary recall  He added that the number of safety alerts issued by the agency  is much less than the number of voluntary recalls we achieve every year  The Washington Post reported this month that a leadership change at the commission under President Trump had allowed Britax  a British manufacturer of child care products  to avoid a recall of its popular BOB stroller  which the regulator had linked to hundreds of accidents Britax said in a statement last week that it did not agree to a recall of certain strollers because  they are not defective and are safe when used as instructed  Scrutiny outside the U S The Rock  n Play has faced scrutiny outside of the United States  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission warned parents to keep the product away from children  according to The Sydney Morning Herald In Canada  the Rock  n Play is classified as a  soother  rather than as a  sleeper   Canadian regulations do not allow the product to be used for unattended sleep  according to Fisher Price Ms  Gilbert  who is now a consumer safety lawyer  said that parents in the United States should be better informed about the product s risks  This is a discretionary product   if consumers knew that their babies could die  they wouldn t buy it   she said   The penalty for a caregiver failing to use a restraint should not be the baby s death   

WASHINGTON   Members of Congress from both parties expressed immense frustration on Wednesday at big increases in insulin prices and vowed to work together on legislation to prevent more people from dying because they could not afford the lifesaving medicine Representative Earl L  Carter  Republican of Georgia  said at the end of a three hour hearing with pharmaceutical executives and middlemen  known as pharmacy benefit managers   You ve done something here today that we ve been trying to do in Congress for years  and that is to create bipartisanship   This is going to end   Mr  Carter  known as Buddy  said of the convoluted arrangements that drive up list prices of insulin and the out of pocket costs for many people with diabetes The hearing was one of several indications that Congress was serious about trying to address the cries of distress from constituents unable to afford the medicines they need Mr  Carter s comments echoed statements by Representative Jan Schakowsky  Democrat of Illinois  who said that  on both sides of the aisle  there is a commitment  to end price gouging by insulin manufacturers Insulin manufacturers said that prices were going up  in part  because they had made many improvements in insulin products  leading to better treatment and longer lives for people with diabetes But Representative David B  McKinley  Republican of West Virginia  said he was baffled  Innovation is supposed to drive the prices down  not up   Mr  McKinley said Congress heard from the three main producers of insulin   Eli Lilly and Company  Novo Nordisk and Sanofi   and from three middlemen that manage drug benefits for most Americans  CVS Health  Express Scripts  which was acquired last year by Cigna  and OptumRx  which is part of UnitedHealth Group  the nation s largest health insurance company The drug makers said they could not reduce list prices because it was not feasible to do so in  the system  as it now exists  In that system  they said  the middlemen and insurance companies demand discounts  rebates and other price concessions that are calculated as a percentage of the list price  And they provide the concessions to guarantee that their drugs will be covered But  they said  many consumers  including people with high deductible health insurance plans and people who are uninsured  do not receive the benefit of those discounts The drug makers said that the net price they received for insulin   after discounts and rebates   was declining  even as the list prices were rising  For example   said Kathleen W  Tregoning  an executive vice president of Sanofi   the average net price of Lantus  our most prescribed insulin  has declined by over 30 percent since 2012  while the average out of pocket burden for patients with commercial insurance and Medicare has increased by approximately 60 percent over the same period  Michael B  Mason  a senior vice president of Lilly  said the company could not reduce the list prices of its insulin products ImageEli Lilly and Company is one of the three main producers of insulin  Michael B  Mason  a senior vice president at the company  said reducing the list prices of its insulin products would be  too disruptive  CreditDarron Cummings Associated Press No pharmaceutical manufacturer has lowered list price for a significant medication because it is too disruptive to the system and thus to people who rely on that medication   he said in his written testimony Under questioning by members of Congress  Mr  Mason said   The current system is not working  We agree 100 percent  Representative Diana DeGette  Democrat of Colorado  who presided over the hearing as the chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  said   The people who are suffering are the people who need insulin every second of every minute of every day or they will die  Ms  DeGette  who has a 25 year old daughter with diabetes and is a leader of the Congressional Caucus on Diabetes  said she saw a high likelihood of bipartisan agreement on legislation to address the problem  Lawmakers will work with drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers  she said Although she represents a liberal Denver district  Ms  DeGette has a history of working with Republicans on health legislation like the 21st Century Cures Act  adopted in 2016 to speed the discovery of cures for killer diseases The chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee  Representative Frank Pallone Jr   Democrat of New Jersey  told the witnesses that he believed in a competitive market built on private enterprise  but that many of his constituents were losing faith in it  My constituents are disgusted   Mr  Pallone said  adding   What they tell me is   Just set the price  You the Congress or some government agency should set the price  and that s it   The drug companies generally endorsed a proposal by President Trump to outlaw payment of rebates unless they are passed on to consumers  The pharmacy benefit managers said premiums would go up if they no longer received rebate payments On Tuesday  the House Ways and Means Committee voted unanimously to approve a bill that requires drug manufacturers to publicly justify large price increases for existing drugs and high prices for new products  Drug companies would  for example  have to report what they spent on research and development of such drugs  as well as the costs of manufacturing  marketing and advertising them Also on Tuesday  the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to investigate the business practices of pharmacy benefit managers  The current system is so opaque that it s easy to see why there are many questions about P B M s  motives and practices   said Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the committee  referring to the managers Senator Sheldon Whitehouse  Democrat of Rhode Island  said that drug manufacturers had performed a remarkable act of  political jujitsu   shifting the blame for high drug prices to the middlemen But Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee  said the middlemen had  raked in profits while drug prices have shot into the stratosphere   Whether pharmacy benefit managers bring any real value to taxpayers is a mystery   Mr  Wyden said  

PRAGUE   It s the kind of maneuvering that might make the Game of Thrones  shrewdest operator Tyrion Lannister feel right at home As streaming giants Amazon  Netflix and Hulu prepare to splash out on their next fantasy blockbusters and dystopian dramas  Central European countries are slugging it out to get a grab a slice of their bumper production budgets Experienced crews  lower labor costs and generous production incentives have long attracted international filmmakers to the Czech Republic and Hungary but other countries in the region are now getting into the game The Czechs and Hungarians are both considering raising their incentives after Romania approved a production rebate of up to 45 percent in 2018 and Poland introduced a 30 percent cash rebate in February to keep pace with its neighbors A new European Union directive due to come in this year is also expected to spur investment as it will require video on demand platforms selling to European audiences to ensure at least 30 percent of their catalogs are European works   This is a new era   said Agnes Havas  chief executive of the Hungarian Film Fund told Reuters  noting that the Netflix series  The Crown  and Amazon Prime Video s  Hanna  were shot in Hungary   What we see is we started at 30 percent  incentives  and now we are looking at the other countries in Europe and we will evaluate the situation and see whether we should potentially think about raising it again in the future  BITG media analyst Rich Greenfield estimates Amazon will spend  5 billion to  6 billion in 2019 on content with Netflix laying out about  15 billion   and a significant portion of the Netflix budget will flow overseas   We are aware there is a shift in global production and you can t ignore the big streaming companies   Anna Dziedzic of the Film Commission Poland told Reuters  In 2018 Netflix filmed  1983  in the country  the company s first original Polish Netflix series  They are one of the biggest players now  You have to adjust to the changing environment and you have to have them in mind   Dziedzic told Reuters Amazon and Netflix declined to comment on their plans in the region GAME OF THRONES EFFECTA landscape dotted with castles and rolling countryside makes central Europe a versatile setting for increasingly popular historical and fantasy shows looking to cash in on the success of series such as  Game of Thrones   The types of shows being shot have dramatically changed   said David Minkowski  head of production at Stillking Films  which co produced Amazon s neo noir fantasy  Carnival Row  and Hulu s historical series  Das Boot   in the Czech Republic  Call it the Game of Thrones effect  A lot of it is fantasy or historical that naturally gravitates to this part of the world   he told Reuters  adding that the company was now working on fantasy drama  The Witcher  for Netflix   The typical production centers are bursting at the seams  Dziedzic at the Film Commission Poland said she has also received requests from international companies wanting to use post Soviet locations and brutalist Communist architecture for science fiction series This has helped push international investment in regional production to record highs  leaving studios booked a year in advance and crews forced to turn away work  industry professionals say  There is now an ever increased premium on local crew relationships and good access to infrastructure and studios which need to be planned up to 12 months in advance of production   added Stillking s Managing Director Matthew Stillking  It s a boom time     likely to last several years as the sector becomes more competitive with a perfect storm of increased consumer viewing demand and more platforms needing content to compete for customers    IT WILL ROCKET Foreign investment in the Czech film industry leapt nearly 1 2 billion crowns to a record 4 8 billion   210 million  on 1 072 shooting days for 38 foreign series and films in 2018  according to the Czech Film Commission Investment is expected to remain at that level or higher this year  though Czech plans to increase cash rebates on offer for film makers from 20 percent now could be a game changer  It will rocket once the incentives are raised   Pavlina Zipkova  head of the Czech Film Commission  told Reuters   The government has not increased it yet but we strongly believe it will happen later this year  In Hungary  spending on a total of 333 productions last year amounted to 110 billion forints  385 million   with 84 percent of the investment coming from international productions including Hollywood blockbusters  Terminator  Dark Fate  and  Gemini Man  This was up from 108 billion in 2017  when  Red Sparrow  and  Colette  were made in Hungary but Havas at Hungary s Film Fund expects the new EU rules to accelerate the streaming fueled production boom The rise of streaming services has also shifted the types of productions in the region  Hungary attracts more blockbuster films these days while episodic series tend to gravitate towards the Czech Republic  said Tomas Krejci  founder of Milk and Honey Pictures and Prague Studios This helped Prague Studio s turnover jump more than 50 percent in 2018   and Krejci predicts demand will remain strong as top notch crews shooting historical shows are more than a third cheaper than in rival countries such as Spain  The demand for historical shows is getting stronger   Krejci said whose company has produced  Haunted  for Netflix and Amazon s  Patriot  and the second season of  Lore   Here it s not just the phenomenal historic architecture but also the vast amount of props  costumes and local talent that make it cheaper and easier to make these kinds of shows    1   22 8160 Czech crowns   1   285 6800

BRUSSELS   European Union leaders gave Britain six more months to leave the bloc  more than Prime Minister Theresa May says she needs but less than many in the bloc wanted  thanks to fierce resistance from France The summit deal in Brussels in the early hours of Thursday meant Britain will not crash out on Friday without a treaty to smooth its passage  But it offers little clarity on when  how or even if Brexit will happen  as May struggles to build support in parliament for withdrawal terms agreed with the EU last year With German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisting that Britain would not be forced out and that a chaotic no deal departure must be avoided if at all possible  there was never any real doubt that May would get an extension The drama was about its length and conditions French President Emmanuel Macron  reprising a role he took last month when May got a first  two week delay  pushed leaders into hours of debate over dinner as he fought a largely solo campaign to persuade them not to give the British up to another year Summit chair Donald Tusk and others argued that obliging May to accept a much longer deadline than the June 30 date she had sought could help swing pro Brexit hardliners within her own Conservative party behind her deal  fearing a long delay could see the British public turning against a withdrawal altogether But Macron  while irritating some peers who saw his stance as Gallic grandstanding  insisted that letting Britain stay in the Union any longer risked undermining the project of European integration that is one of his main policy goals  The result was a compromise on the date  with a deadline of Oct  31  for Britain to leave  deal or no deal    on condition that May holds an election on May 23 to return British members to a new European Parliament that convenes in July  and that it pledge not to disrupt key EU decision making before it leaves If May fails to win over lawmakers on the treaty or fails to hold an election  Britain will leave with no deal on June 1 MAY EYES BREXIT SOONThe prime minister was keen to stress that the extension to Oct  31    and several leaders refused to rule out further delays    did not mean she would not deliver Brexit sooner and before  as she promised her rebellious party  she steps down  I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension   she told reporters  as her team prepared for another round of talks on Thursday with the Labour opposition  to whom May turned for help last week  But the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear  So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach consensus on a deal that is in the national interest   she added  acknowledging the coming weeks would not be easy Tusk  a former Polish premier who has long tried to keep a door open for Britons to change their minds and stay  said the delay until Halloween gave time for London to ratify May s deal  tweak elements of the future EU UK relationship to Labour s liking    or give it a chance to  cancel Brexit altogether  Merkel  who eased tension at the start of the talks by sharing a joke with May over photographs of them both wearing very similar jackets  stressed a need for calm and order   We want an orderly exit by Britain   she said   And an orderly exit by Britain can be best ensured if we give it some time  FRENCH RESISTANCEMacron defended his resistance to giving Britain nine months or a year more  saying it was for the  common good   French officials  pointing to threats by some of May s pro Brexit potential successors  spoke of the EU facing  blackmail  by a future British government blocking decisions in Brussels  It s true that the majority was more in favor of a very long extension  But it was not logical in my view  and above all  it was neither good for us  nor for the UK   said Macron French pressure also tightened clauses referring to Britain not disrupting EU affairs if it stays in longer and a reference to a June 20 21 EU summit taking stock of the position again May addressed the other 27 for an hour at the start of the summit and failed to convince many  notably Macron  that she truly had a new strategy for securing ratification  Leaders are exasperated with May s handling of a tortuous and costly divorce that is a distraction from ensuring the bloc can hold its own against

MUMBAI BENGALURU   Early this year  a dozen of Bollywood s biggest names took a private jet from India s film capital of Mumbai to New Delhi for a private audience with Prime Minister Narendra Modi Subsequently  actor Ranveer Singh  who has nearly 22 million followers on Instagram  posted a smiling picture of himself hugging Modi  with a caption expressing his  joy  at the encounter  drawing more than 3 million likes  Bollywood is playing a lead role in Modi s campaign for a second term  endorsing him on screen and off  in both subtle and obvious ways  in a marked shift from the more transactional relationship Indian film stars previously had with politicians Modi asked filmmakers and stars to  talk about patriotism  and Indian culture and values   in their films  said film producer Mahaveer Jain  who organized the Jan  10 meeting  He recognizes the soft power of Bollywood  and the impact it can have  As people younger than 35 form nearly two thirds of India s population of about 1 3 billion  with more than 15 million voting for the first time in general elections that begin on Thursday  approval from the leading stars could be key Modi swept to victory in 2014  but this time  rural distress and concern about a lack of jobs threaten to make it tougher for his party to triumph in elections spread over a month  with counting set for May 23 In recent months  Modi has met privately at least four times with several of Bollywood s biggest personalities  most of whom have posted selfies with him on social media  accompanied by glowing captions  Together we would love to inspire and ignite positive changes toward a transformative India   read a caption on director Karan Johar s Instagram post of a star studded group selfie with Modi that won more than 1 million likes  He thanked the government for cutting taxes on movie tickets   There is perhaps no politician in the history of Indian politics who has been able to create a celebrity outreach program like Narendra Modi   said Joyojeet Pal  a University of Michigan professor who has analyzed Modi s social media feed since 2009 A BJP spokesman did not respond to Reuters  repeated requests for comment Bollywood s move to largely embrace Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party contrasts with the United States  where Hollywood has typically taken up liberal left causes and backed the Democrats  more lately lampooning President Donald Trump and the right wing Republican Party BIGGEST HITBeyond social media  Bollywood has released three movies with lead actors in prime ministerial roles this year  One   Uri   The Surgical Strike  proved the year s biggest hit  pulling in a gross of more than  35 million at the Indian box office In speeches  Modi and his ministers have repeatedly evoked the film  which indirectly lauds the prime minister and his national security adviser for planning a 2016 attack that India says hit terrorist camps in Pakistan administered Kashmir But it has no political leanings  says director Aditya Dhar   My film is a dedication to the Indian Army   Dhar told Reuters in January https   in reuters com article interview aditya dhar uri qa aditya dhar on uri the surgical strike idINKCN1P50J3   It is about the sacrifices they make for their countrymen   The film released the same weekend as  The Accidental Prime Minister   based on an unauthorized biography of Modi s predecessor  Manmohan Singh That film  which did not succeed at the box office  projected open contempt for Singh  painting him as ineffective and forced to bow to the whims of the Gandhi family  which heads India s main opposition party  the Indian National Congress  You can clearly say some of these films are propaganda films   said influential film critic Rajeev Masand   There is no confusion on the agenda there   The election panel has blocked the release of a biopic titled  PM Narendra Modi   initially set for the first voting day on Thursday  as a violation of election rules  A web series on Modi s life continues to be streamed online  HUGE INFLUENCER Not everyone is jumping on the Modi bandwagon More than 800 theater artists  actors and film makers urged voters not to back Modi last week  but barring a few  most were independent and documentary film makers lacking the reach of Bollywood s A listers  The man portrayed as the savior of the nation five years ago has destroyed the livelihoods of millions through his policies   they said on the website Artists Unite  We appeal to our fellow citizens to vote for love and compassion  for equality and social justice  and to defeat the forces of darkness and barbarism   The main opposition Congress party has also sought to woo Bollywood and a separate source said filmmakers were invited to meet its leader  Rahul Gandhi The agenda for that meeting is unknown and Gandhi s office did not respond to calls seeking comment  My Name is RaGa   a less publicized movie about Gandhi  is also set for release this month  Traditionally  Bollywood stars functioned as crowd pullers at the odd election rally  often for remuneration  Though many later took the plunge into politics  no political party has deployed them as subliminal brand ambassadors before  This is alarming because Indian cinema is a huge influencer   said Sandeep Chatterjee  professor of direction and screenplay at the Film and Television Institute of India  One can say people have a right to decide what they watch  but you cannot discount the influence Indian cinema has on people at large  especially young people

LONDON   Turkey s authorities have shown over the past month they are capable of squeezing the life out of the  35 billion  26 75 billion pounds  a day London lira market   but the cost of killing it off completely would be high for country itself The lira s 2018 plunge triggered a deep recession  and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s government may see the attraction of suffocating an offshore market it believes to be a hotbed of destabilising speculation Ankara knows that market greases the wheels of the  14 billion a year of foreign direct investment Turkey sucks in on average    nearly 60 000 companies had foreign capital there last year    not to mention helping to cover its  160 billion external funding gap  Nevertheless  Erdogan frequently blames foreign  speculators  for sending the lira sprawling  That in turn squeezes payments and the refinancing of Turkish companies  hard currency debts  sends household savings scurrying to dollars  ramps up inflation and interest rates and slams the brakes on the economy  So pressuring local banks late last month to stop lending lira to overseas counterparts looked like a deliberate ploy and one that had a striking resemblance to a capital control The cost of offshore borrowing in the Turkish currency surged by more than 1 000 percent overnight  leading to pain for short sellers but a frozen market Some life returned last week  but Societe Generale s head of emerging market strategy  Jason Daw  thinks the episode shows Ankara would like to nail it shut if only it could without completely choking investment  That seems to be the message  considering they squeezed the international positions so much   he said  adding it was relentless volatility that irked Ankara However  the offshore market has existed comfortably for years  Investors like it because it can be easier to get credit lines with a JP Morgan  Barclays or Citi than a smaller Turkish bank in Istanbul or Ankara Bank of England analysis shows  35 8 billion worth of daily offshore lira trading was going on late last year  It was even bigger  at  56 billion a day  in April before the lira crashed 40 percent Offshore currency and swap markets are typically freer of heavy central bank influence than domestic markets  but they are still vulnerable to the ebb and flow of local currency liquidity  And this    as illustrated last month    is where authorities do retain an element of control Simply by shutting off its funding auctions for a while and maybe a bit of behind the scenes leaning on the local lenders  the central bank could spike the swap rates and briefly seize the market   The lira only stabilised once offshore interest rates rose significantly above onshore rates   analysts at Goldman Sachs observed a few days afterwards as the recovery began  Interactive graphic on offshore lira trading  https   tmsnrt rs 2I7ceFq Graphic  Turkish lira in offshore markets png  https   tmsnrt rs 2I5F2ya SHORT MEMORIES The squeeze may have relented for now  but many countries  both emerging and developed  have periodically tried switching off speculation in offshore currency markets when battling currency runs in decades past  Thailand  Malaysia Argentina and Iceland are just a few examples The all tend to boil down to where households and companies are losing confidence in their country s currency  but authorities don t have the foreign exchange reserves to fight the run Not only does Turkey need foreign investors to buy its debt and provide FDI  but FX reserves are looking thin  especially as Turks are now stashing away record amounts of dollars Aberdeen Standard Investments  Kieran Curtis says that this hoarding means Turkey s banks effectively have a surplus of dollars on their books but a shortage of lira  He thinks for that reason Ankara won t want to mess too much with the offshore market    it is crucial for balancing the mismatch  By spooking the market  bank transaction costs could easily rise   It is not a sustainable business model   he said Having a London lira market was also a symbol of  great importance  for Turkey s free market credentials  said Ibrahim Turhan  a former deputy governor of the Turkish central bank   The fight against speculative attacks will be made with rational policies and good governance  not bans   he said Ankara would also need to make major improvements to bring more lira trading onshore  Authorities there have opened a local currency swap market under Borsa Istanbul which Turkish banks have started to use  But without foreign investors  traders say  the volumes won t achieve the necessary scale It has backed away from offering non deliverable forwards and there is no domestic interest rate swap market as there is not only in major markets but also in other emerging markets  such as Russia  Poland and Hungary So for now at least it looks like the international market will continue to recover  albeit with nagging worries about what happens next time the lira really lurches   It s too early to say if people that got burnt will come back   said one senior FX trader in London   But people tend to have very short memories  I am always surprised at how quickly people come back into the market   Graphic  Forex held by Turkish local individuals hits record high  https   tmsnrt rs 2CIv4OS   Additional reporting by Nevzat Devranoglu in Istanbul and

NEW YORK   Donald Trump isn t on the ballot for Israel s national election  yet he s a dominant factor for many American Jews as they assess the high stakes of Tuesday s balloting At its core  the election is a judgment on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  who has won the post four times but now faces corruption charges  In his battle for political survival  Netanyahu has aligned closely with Trump   a troubling tactic for the roughly 75  of American Jewish voters who lean Democratic  The world has come to understand that Netanyahu is essentially the political twin of Donald Trump   said Jeremy Ben Ami  president of the liberal pro Israel group J Street   Unlike his previous elections  there is a much deeper antagonism toward Netanyahu because of that close affiliation between him and Trump and the Republican Party  Netanyahu featured Trump in a recent campaign video  while Trump has made a series of policy moves viewed as strengthening Netanyahu in the eyes of Israeli voters  including relocating the U S  Embassy to Jerusalem  withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and officially recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory  It s troubling   said Halie Soifer  executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America   The U S  Israel relationship should not be about any two leaders or any two parties  The American Jewish community wants the relationship to remain on a bipartisan basis  Though it leans Democratic overall  the American Jewish community   numbering 5 5 million to 6 million   is not monolithic  Most older Jews remain supportive of Israel s current Middle East policies  as does the roughly 10  of the Jewish population that is Orthodox  Jewish billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has been a staunch financial supporter of Trump and the GOP Divisions among U S  Jews have been exacerbated by recent allegations of anti Semitism directed at the Democrats  two Muslim American congresswomen   Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib  Seizing on the controversy  Trump tweeted his support for a purported  Jexodus  movement that would encourage Jews to leave the Democratic Party  Republicans are waiting with open arms   Trump tweeted on March 15 Morton Klein  president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America  predicts such an exodus will take place because of the Democrats  decision to avoid explicit condemnation of the congresswomen Ben Ami scoffed at the notion  suggesting that Jexodus was a fantasy of pro Trump operatives  I ve yet to meet an actual Obama Clinton voter who s said publicly they re switching to vote for Donald Trump   he said   This is not real  It s completely made up  New York based journalist Jane Eisner  former editor of The Forward  a Jewish newspaper  said many American Jews have  Netanyahu fatigue    even some who supported him in past Among liberal Jews  Eisner said  there are strong worries that Netanyahu will push Israel s government even further to the right if he wins  perhaps moving to annex some land in the occupied West Bank with confidence that the Trump administration will not object Morton Klein conceded that some Jews have grown weary of Netanyahu  but predicted he would prevail  People would be nervous if he s not there   Klein said Jack Rosen  president of the American Jewish Congress  said any surge in Netanyahu fatigue should not be interpreted as a weakening of American Jews  support for Israeli  There is a sense of fatigue having one leader for 10 years   Rosen said   Just as we ve had Clinton fatigue and Bush fatigue  Among liberal and centrist American Jews  dismay with Netanyahu extends beyond his alliance with Trump  Some say he s been too harsh in his treatment of migrants  and they bemoan his backtracking on a promise to allow mixed gender prayer at the Western Wall  Perhaps most disturbing has been Netanyahu s alliance with an ultranationalist political party linked to a movement previously banned for anti Arab racism and incitement That political alliance was assailed as  repugnant  by Eric Yoffie  a rabbi from Westfield  New Jersey  in a March 27 op ed in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz  Yoffie also decried Netanyahu s  excessive enthusiasm  for Trump  Cordial relations are essential   wrote Yoffie  president emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism   But the sycophantic buddy movie that Bibi has produced with America s unbalanced and unpredictable president is something else altogether     Bibi s egregious and unnecessary embrace of everything Trump will cost Israel dearly  In Israel  a prevalent view  at least in pro Netanyahu ranks  is that the prime minister s friendship with Trump is paying unprecedented dividends  There is widespread sentiment that liberal American Jews  as a constituency  are dissipating due to intermarriage  and that the evangelical Christian community in the U S  is a more dependable ally for Israel At last year s ceremony in Jerusalem celebrating the relocation of the U S  Embassy from Tel Aviv  evangelical Christian pastors allied with Trump delivered the opening and closing blessings Netanyahu s main challenger in the election is Benny Gantz  a former military chief popular in Israel but with a relatively low profile in the United States  American Jews who dislike Netanyahu view Gantz as preferable  due in part to a less combative personality  but liberals note with frustration that the platform of Gantz s Blue and White party makes no mention of Palestinian statehood  and says that Israel will maintain control of parts of the West Bank Emily Mayer of IfNotNow  a group of youthful American Jewish activists opposed to Israel s treatment of Palestinians  is dismayed at how that issue has been marginalized in the Israeli election campaign  Regardless of the winner  the utter erasure of Palestinian humanity from this election cycle and the normalization of an undemocratic and immoral military occupation should alarm any Jew who cares about freedom and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians   Mayer said in an email    Associated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report  

The Federal Reserve  along with Congress  failed to take sufficient steps to revive the economy after the 2008 financial crisis  One simple measure of the inadequacy of the government s response is that inflation has remained persistently below the 2 percent annual rate the Fed regards as optimal  a sign of an underachieving economy Some liberals have complained for years about the Fed s lack of urgency as millions of Americans struggled to find jobs  or lived without significant wage increases  Since President Trump s election in 2016  a growing number of Republicans have decided they  too  favor stronger economic growth  Mr  Trump himself has been particularly outspoken  loudly and repeatedly pressing the Fed to reduce borrowing costs Lately Mr  Trump has gone even further  declaring he plans to nominate two of his political supporters  Stephen Moore and Herman Cain  to the Fed s board of governors  Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain are exceptionally unqualified to serve on the Fed s board  Both men argued for the Fed to reduce its economic stimulus campaign while Barack Obama was president and then began to insist the Fed should do more following Mr  Trump s election  Since the need for economic stimulus was greater during the Obama years  the positions taken by Mr  Moore and Mr  Cain demonstrate either a profound lack of understanding of monetary policy   or a view that the Fed should serve the political needs of the Republican Party  Or perhaps both  It s little consolation that they seem unlikely to influence the 17 current members of the Fed s monetary policymaking committee  If they are confirmed  it would upend a longstanding bipartisan commitment to filling the Fed s board with highly qualified technocrats who seek to serve the nation s long term economic interest But the Fed and its defenders must do more than try to bar the doors of its marble headquarters  The Fed s critics have a point  Congress has sheltered the central bank from political interference so it can make difficult decisions in the interest of the American people  The Fed needs to show it has learned from its disappointing performance over the last decade  It needs to articulate a plan to respond more effectively to the next downturn The core of the problem is the Fed s inflation target  Since the double digit inflation rates of the late 1970s  the Fed has focused on maintaining slow and steady inflation  In 2012  it formalized an annual target of 2 percent  But the Fed has fallen short of that mark in six of the last seven years  and its top officials predict it will miss the target again in 2019 After the 2008 crisis  the Fed repeatedly hesitated to provide larger doses of economic stimulus because it was concerned about overshooting the target  In plain English  the Fed allowed millions of Americans to remain unemployed or underpaid because it feared that prices would start rising more quickly  It is now clear the Fed miscalculated   and caused a lot of pain Low inflation also is a problem in its own right  It may seem odd to seek higher prices  but economists generally agree that a little inflation is a good thing  It keeps the economy at a safe distance from the prospect of a general decline in prices  or deflation  which can limit economic activity as people wait for still lower prices  Inflation also gives the Fed more room to cut borrowing costs during economic downturns  And inflation eases economic adjustments by allowing companies to cut real wages without cutting nominal wages The Fed is a deliberate animal  it has always preferred to fail by not doing enough  But there are signs the Fed is aware of the need for change  Jerome Powell  the Fed s chairman  said in March that low inflation is  one of the major challenges of our time   The Fed is hosting a conference in Chicago in June to gather advice from outside experts Already there are a number of interesting ideas in circulation  Mr  Powell s immediate predecessors  Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke  both have backed a proposal for the Fed to allow higher inflation after periods of low inflation   in effect  replacing the Fed s 2 percent annual inflation target with the goal of hitting a 2 percent average over time Others would like the Fed to set a 4 percent inflation target  or to replace inflation targeting entirely  Under one alternative  nominal G D P  targeting  the Fed would aim for a steady rate of growth in the value of the nation s economic output   a measure that includes the effects of inflation  During periods of slower growth in the inflation adjusted value of that economic output  the Fed would seek to compensate by allowing higher inflation All of these are fancy ways of saying that the Fed should have kept interest rates lower for longer after the 2008 recession  to deliver a significantly stronger dose of economic stimulus  and that it should show a little less fear of inflation the next time the economy needs its help By choosing one of these methods  the Fed can begin to demonstrate that it has learned the lesson RelatedOpinion   Paul KrugmanWhy Does Trump Want to Debase the Fed April 8

WASHINGTON   The global economy is slowing more than expected and a sharp downturn could require world leaders to coordinate stimulus measures  the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday as it cut its forecast for world economic growth this year The global lender s semi annual World Economic Report pointed to the U S  China trade war and a potentially disorderly British exit from the European Union as key risks and warned that chances of further cuts to the outlook were high Some major economies  including China and Germany  might need to take short term actions  the IMF said   This is a delicate moment for the global economy   IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said in a news conference to discuss the report Governments may need to open their pocketbooks at the same time  across economies  if the slowdown becomes more serious  Gopinath said  adding that loose monetary policy might also be needed The comments provided an eerie warning to the global officials gathering in Washington this week for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank  The world engaged in coordinated fiscal stimulus to counter the 2008 financial crisis  In its third downgrade since October  the IMF said the global economy will likely grow 3 3  this year  the slowest expansion since 2016  The forecast cut 0 2 percentage point from the IMF s outlook in January The projected growth rate for next year was unchanged at 3 6  More than two thirds of the expected slowdown in 2019 stems from troubles in rich nations  including members of the EU  In this context  avoiding policy missteps that could harm economic activity should be the main priority   the IMF said in its report  One potential misstep lies in Britain s indecision over how to leave the EU  Despite looming deadlines  London has not decided how it will try to shield its economy during the exit process The IMF s new forecast assumes an orderly  Brexit   but the Fund said a chaotic process could shave more than 0 2 percentage point from global growth in 2019  It said the Bank of England should be  cautious  on its interest rate policy  an apparent tip to wait before hiking borrowing costs The EU s economic growth is already slowing substantially  though the IMF said it still expects the slowdown in Europe and some emerging market economies will give way to a re acceleration in growth during the second half of 2019  The outlook for Germany  one of the main drivers of European growth  suffered from weaker demand for its exports  softer consumer spending and new emissions standards that have depressed car sales  Germany may have to quickly turn to fiscal stimulus measures  the IMF said  also calling on the European Central Bank to keep stimulating the regional economy  The IMF also cut Japan s growth outlook following a string of natural disasters  U S  DOWNGRADEThe U S  economy  while seen outperforming other rich nations  economies  also got a downgrade on signs that a fiscal stimulus fuelled by tax cuts was producing less activity than previously expected U S  Treasury yields slid on concerns about the global economic outlook  which also weighed on U S  stocks  The Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell 0 7  and the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both closed about 0 6  lower as the growth forecasts and renewed trade worries sparked by new U S  tariff threats on European aircraft and food products weighed on sentiment U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disputed the IMF s assessment that U S  growth was slowing and told lawmakers he was not concerned about a recent inversion of the Treasury yield curve   often a harbinger of recession  There s no question that growth outside of the United States  whether it be Europe or China  has slowed significantly   Mnuchin told a U S  House Financial Services Committee hearing   From everything we see  we see for the next few years still strong  robust U S  growth  CHINA S  GREEN SHOOTS The IMF said it supported the U S  Federal Reserve s decision to pause its rate hiking cycle  which the global lender said would support the U S  and world economies this year by easing financial conditions  The IMF raised its forecast for U S  growth in 2020 by a tenth of a percentage point to 1 9  The global lender said it was slightly boosting its outlook for Chinese growth this year   to 6 3    in part because an expected escalation in the U S  China trade war had not materialized  Still  America s ongoing tensions with China and other major trading partners continue to cloud the global economy U S  tariffs on Chinese imports are hitting Chinese growth and also weighing on Latin America and other parts of the world dependent on Chinese demand for commodities The IMF cut its 2019 growth forecasts for Canada and Latin America as well as for the Middle East and North African countries China was trying to rebalance its massive economy away from investment and exports when U S  President Donald Trump ordered higher tariffs on Chinese imports beginning in 2018  China responded with retaliatory tariffs on U S  goods In an ominous sign  the IMF said Beijing might need to unleash fiscal stimulus  to avoid a sharp near term growth slowdown that could derail the overarching reform agenda   Gopinath  the IMF chief economist  said the Chinese economy was showing some tentative signs of recovered growth  which she described as  green shoots    Reporting by Jason Lange  Additional reporting by David Lawder Editing by Andrea Ricci  Paul Simao and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   U S  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  who oversaw President Donald Trump s bitterly contested immigration policies during her tumultuous 16 month tenure  resigned on Sunday amid a surge in the number of migrants at the border with Mexico A senior administration official said Trump asked for Nielsen s resignation and she gave it  Trump  who has recently expressed growing anger about the situation at the border  said on Twitter   Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position  and I would like to thank her for her service  In another tweet  Trump said Kevin McAleenan  the current U S  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  would become acting DHS secretary In a tweet late Sunday  Nielsen said that she would stay on until Wednesday  I have agreed to stay on as Secretary through Wednesday  April 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are not impacted   she said Nielsen s departure was first reported by CBS News  Nielsen  46  had been DHS secretary since December 2017  Her departure had been repeatedly rumored over the past year  particularly after a wave of anger over the administration s 2018 family separation policy at the border with Mexico and most recently as U S  border officials estimated that 100 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in March  the highest level in a decade Another senior administration official said Trump s national security adviser  John Bolton  after a blowup with Nielsen late last year  also recommended to Trump that she should go Trump has made a clampdown on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his two year old presidency  leading chants of  Build that wall  at his rallies as he has sought to cut back on the number of newcomers entering the United States without proper documentation Many of the migrants picked up last month were Central Americans seeking U S  asylum Trump was so frustrated about the increase that he announced he would cut off U S  aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  He also threatened to close the border with Mexico  although he later backed off that proposal with a threat to impose tariffs on auto imports In her resignation letter  Nielsen asked for more from Congress and the courts  which have opposed such Trump administration initiatives as his effort to limit immigration from Muslim nations and the border wall  I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse   she wrote to Trump Trump also took aim at Congress in another tweet later on Sunday  saying   Country is FULL   and saying Democrats in Congress must  fix loopholes  and repeating his threats to close the border or impose tariffs if Mexico does not do more  Nielsen s resignation was the latest high profile departure from the Trump administration  and leaves just four women in his Cabinet  Among others  Trump currently lacks a permanent secretary of defense or chief of staff LIGHTNING RODNielsen s departure was announced two days after the Republican president abruptly said on Friday he was dumping his nominee to be the top official at U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE   Ronald Vitiello  saying he wanted someone  tougher  ICE is under the jurisdiction of DHS  which was formed following the Sept  11  2001  attacks on New York and Washington Repeatedly subjected to tough questioning by Democrats at congressional hearings  Nielsen became a lightning rod for criticism of Trump s policies  She was confronted by protesters last year at a Mexican restaurant in Washington Last year  Nielsen came under increasing pressure by critics to step aside after the Trump administration adopted the policy of separating migrant children from their parents as part of its  zero tolerance  approach intended to deter families from leaving home in the hope of entering the United States After criticism as pictures of children in cages were spread across the world  Trump signed an executive order in June ending family separations and requiring that families be held together in federal custody while the adults awaited prosecution for illegally crossing the border But the government reported that at least 245 children were taken from their families between that time and the first months of 2019 Trump insists that the arrival of immigrants across the southern U S  border constitutes a national emergency so important that he sidestepped Congress  refusal to provide him with billions of dollars he requested to build the border wall Representative Bennie Thompson  the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee  said Nielsen s tenure at DHS  was a disaster from the start  He said in a statement  however  that she should not serve as a scapegoat  blasting Trump for  terrible and cruel policies   Noting that the department now has neither a permanent secretary nor deputy secretary  Thompson called on the administration to work with Congress  in good faith  Before she was nominated as secretary  Nielsen worked as a deputy to former Marine General John Kelly  who headed DHS before becoming White House chief of staff  Kelly resigned as chief of staff on Jan  2

ISTANBUL ANKARA   It was midnight on election night when Turkey s main opposition party finally believed it had overturned a decade and a half of failure at the polls and delivered a stinging defeat to the country s master campaigner  President Tayyip Erdogan The candidate of the secularist Republican People s Party  CHP  for mayor of Ankara was comfortably ahead in the capital  but in Istanbul   the biggest prize in Sunday s local elections   Erdogan s ruling AK Party candidate had declared victory CHP politicians and supporters  who had endured more than a dozen election and referendum losses at the hands of Erdogan s Islamist rooted AKP since 2002  were well accustomed to crushing disappointment once the ballots were counted This time was different  At around 12 a m  we realized that we were clearly the winners of the election  that we had won   said Suleyman Celebi  an aide to CHP Istanbul candidate Ekrem Imamoglu The party s own data  he said  showed they had defeated Erdogan s close ally and former prime minister Binali Yildirim  despite an exhaustive and bitter two month campaign waged by the president and backed by an overwhelmingly pro government media Once they saw the numbers  Imamoglu and his team refused to back down   We believed after that that there was no turning back  and that we would win   Celebi told Reuters That newfound confidence  supported by initial results the next morning showing Imamoglu had narrowly beaten Yildirim  was forged in an opposition campaign that contrasted sharply with Erdogan s high profile  confrontational election strategy The softly spoken Imamoglu  spurning the kind of mass rallies which Erdogan addressed daily  sought to win over a broad spectrum of voters with a positive message  meeting many of them face to face in a campaign which even his opponents acknowledged struck a chord with the electorate Celebi said Turks  tiring of  divisive and polarizing language  from their leaders  warmed to a new style of politics   This time we saw an open will to vote for Ekrem Imamoglu across all parts of society   he said The CHP made a formal alliance with the breakaway nationalist Iyi  Good  Party and also won votes in Istanbul from supporters of the pro Kurdish HDP party  which chose not to field a mayoral candidate there to boost Imamoglu s chances  DENTED AURAConfirmation of defeat in Istanbul   a city of 15 million people   and Ankara would not reduce Erdogan s sweeping presidential powers  but would seriously dent the aura of invincibility he has built up during 16 years of ever tighter control over the country  His AKP  which has challenged results in both Ankara and Istanbul  still won 51 6 percent of the national vote together with its nationalist MHP alliance partner  down from 53 7 percent in parliamentary elections last year Three party sources who spoke to Reuters all said there were flaws in a campaign which struck a relentlessly belligerent tone  linking Erdogan s opponents to terrorists and painting the vote bleakly as a  matter of survival  for Turkey  Maybe we should have given another message instead of  survival    said one source at AKP headquarters in Ankara who described it as ill suited for voters worried about living standards and local services  As early as January  AKP officials were sounding the alarm over falling public support amid high inflation and rising unemployment Authorities responded to soaring food prices by setting up stalls in Ankara and Istanbul selling subsidized vegetables That too may have backfired  the same source said  as TV footage of people queueing for food revived images of  old Turkey  and the chronic inflation of the 1990s   Long lines being formed disrupted the perception of the AK Party   he said Another party source said the AKP was still missing former campaign manager Erol Olcok  a close friend of Erdogan who masterminded AKP election victories before he was killed on an Istanbul

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Friday called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and take additional steps to stimulate economic growth  his latest attempt to put the traditionally independent central bank under his thumb Speaking to reporters before traveling to the southwestern border  the president once again criticized the Fed s interest rate increases in 2018  saying  they really slowed us down   Mr  Trump  who is presiding over one of the longest sustained economic expansions in United States history  also said the Fed should do more to give the economy a lift   including resuming a stimulus program that he opposed when it began under President Barack Obama Mr  Trump s comments came on the same day the Labor Department reported strong job growth  with employers adding 196 000 jobs last month  His remarks also coincide with his efforts to install allies at the Fed as he heads into a re election campaign that will largely be a referendum on the state of the economy  While the economy is still strong and unemployment remains low  the effects of the president s  1 5 trillion tax cut are waning and his trade war has begun to hurt some American industries  as well as contributing to slower growth in China  Most forecasters see growth slowing this year  though Mr  Trump s economic advisers continue to see it speeding up But the president appears to be taking no chances  On Friday  he escalated his previous critiques of the Fed by pressing for it to resume the type of stimulus campaign it undertook after the recession to jump start economic growth  That program  known as quantitative easing  resulted in the Fed buying more than  4 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities as a way to increase the supply of money in the financial system  As the economy recovered  the Fed began to reverse that program  slowly winnowing its portfolio of bonds in a process known as quantitative tightening  Well I personally think the Fed should drop rates   Mr  Trump said   I think they really slowed us down  There s no inflation  I would say in terms of quantitative tightening  it should actually now be quantitative easing  Very little if any inflation  And I think they should drop rates  and they should get rid of quantitative tightening  You would see a rocket ship  Despite that  we re doing very well  The Labor Department s numbers signal a rebound from an unexpectedly lackluster February  It was the 102nd straight month of job gains  Wages were also up  with average hourly earnings in March 3 2 percent higher than a year earlier  And unemployment remained low at 3 8 percent  Read more about the March jobs report  which showed a return to solid growth  The president has become increasingly bold in his efforts to influence the Fed  which he and his advisers blame for economic growth falling short of the 4 percent annual rate last year as he promised  He has repeatedly criticized his handpicked Fed chairman  Jerome H  Powell  and has described the central bank as a counterweight to his economic policies The Fed raised interest rates four times last year  to the current range of 2 percent to 2 25 percent  drawing frequent rebukes from Mr  Trump  Such criticism is unusual for presidents  who typically avoid commenting on monetary policy But the Fed has since diverted from what had been a steady march of interest rate increases  in the face of stock market turmoil  growing domestic and global economic risks and pressure from Mr  Trump  The central bank does not expect to increase rates at all this year and has cut its growth projections to 2 1 percent for 2019 As he enters the 2020 campaign  Mr  Trump is banking on a much faster pace of growth than the Fed and most outside economists say is likely  Global growth is moderating  with slowdowns in Europe and China underway  And there are signs of weakness in the United States  where chief executives see investment  hiring and sales growth all slowing this year and business economists say the risks of undershooting economic growth are higher than overshooting Democrats denounced Mr  Trump s comments  saying they showed his disregard for the traditional independence of the Fed and his desire to use its powers to help him win re election  There s no question that President Trump is seeking to undermine the long term stability of the economy and independence of the Federal Reserve to boost his own re election prospects   said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  the top Democrat on the Finance Committee Larry Kudlow  Mr  Trump s top economic adviser  said on Friday that the president was concerned about a global slowdown and wanted the Fed ensure the American economy continued to grow  We are facing a worldwide slowdown  You know  recession  arguably   Mr  Kudlow said in an interview on Bloomberg TV   Europe is not doing well  Germany itself may be in recession  That troubles us  Mr  Kudlow denied that the president was trying to infringe on the Fed s independence and said he simply wanted it to keep things thriving  We re not pressuring  We re not going after their independence   he said   We just don t want any threats to this rebuilding  reviving  growing economy  But in recent days  Mr  Trump has made it increasingly clear that he will do what it takes to keep the Fed heading in the direction he wants The president said on Thursday that he planned to nominate Herman Cain  a Republican who abandoned his 2012 presidential campaign in the face of sexual harassment allegations and who started a political action committee to combat what he claims is  misinformation  about Mr  Trump  to a seat on the Fed s seven member board  Mr  Trump also plans to nominate Stephen Moore  an adviser and conservative economist who has become a vocal critic of the Fed s interest rate increases Those selections are a marked shift from his previous nominations to the board  The president has tended to tap largely conventional candidates  not loyalists or those with starkly contrarian views  His choice of Mr  Powell for chairman was seen as a vote for consistency on the Fed  given Mr  Powell s approach was expected to be   and indeed has been   in line with his predecessor  Janet L  Yellen  who called for a moderate pace of rate increases Mr  Trump s three other Fed appointments have also been fairly unsurprising   Richard Clarida  whom he appointed as vice chairman  was a Columbia University economist and a scholar in monetary policy  Randal K  Quarles  who oversees bank supervision  worked in the financial industry and at the Treasury Department in previous Republican administrations and Michelle W  Bowman was the state bank commissioner of Kansas Wall Street analysts  economists and at least one Republican senator warned on Friday that Mr  Trump s choice of political actors could wind up compromising the Fed in a way that could be detrimental to the health of the economy  In our view  the selections could raise questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and could be perceived as an attempted politicization of monetary policy   researchers at Barclays wrote in a note to clients  adding   the experience of each candidate does not seem to be the main reason the Trump administration is considering their nominations  Senator Mitt Romney of Utah  who ran against Mr  Cain for the Republican nomination  told Politico that he would prefer nonpolitical appointees  I would like to see nominees that are economists first and not partisans  I think it s important that the Fed be a nonpartisan entity   Mr  Romney said   The key is that someone is outside of the political world and is an economic leader  not a partisan leader  It is unclear whether Mr  Moore or Mr  Cain  who are still undergoing background checks and have yet to be formally nominated  will be confirmed by the Senate  Mr  Trump has previously faced pushback on two of his Fed choices  neither of whom were considered highly contentious but nonetheless failed to gain traction Nellie Liang  an economist and financial regulation expert  withdrew from consideration after financial industry lobbyists worked against her nomination and Senate Republicans made clear they would not vote to confirm her  And Marvin Goodfriend  a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a former monetary policy adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond  Va   languished in the last Congress after lawmakers questioned his previous views on inflation For now  most Senate Republicans have said they will wait for confirmation hearings before determining their votes Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the Republican leader  has remained mum on both selections for the Fed  But aides and senators close to Mr  McConnell said that he had made it clear that he had no intention of moving ahead quickly with either nomination  giving the president and his staff ample time to vet both men and consider other candidates  

We were around 30 miles shy of Dire Dawa  Ethiopia  when the train hit a cow  its impact signaled by an abrupt drop in speed and a sharp judder rippling through the couplings  What s happening   I

The day before we intended to depart  we went to buy tickets at Lebu Station  The new line s western terminus was a cavernous mustard colored building topped with twin cupolas  which sat incongruously

years ago  Dire Dawa grew over the century into a major transit hub for Ethiopian exports  not least khat  a mild herbal stimulant  which is farmed intensively in the surrounding hills  But the place we were more interested in was a 30 mile minibus ride east  The train had availed us the chance to visit the Islamic outpost of Harar ImageA woman served coffee from a jebena  a traditional Ethiopian

encircled by 15 foot walls  which is widely considered to be the fourth holiest site in Islam  We stayed in a  gegar   a traditional Harari home which had been converted into a guesthouse  where we slept in a garret that was formerly a storage room for grain  In the adjacent main room  the owner and her friends drank thick coffee on ornate carpets  It was an oasis that belied the kaleidoscopic

designed to intoxicate the senses  From the main square  our preferred route into the labyrinth was via Makina Girgir  the tailors  road  so named for the sewing machines that line it  girgir being

carrying a basket of meat scraps  then crouched in a clearing and called out into a patch of scrubland  We looked on as eight spotted hyenas emerged from the shadows to feed from their hands  Over the years  this nightly ritual has become a draw for tourists  who gather to shoot photos under the beam of car headlights  But Emaj told us it also has a more supernatural purpose  to keep the dogs close

nostalgic about all that old iron  Ethiopia was a place of such tangible antiquity that development invariably exacted some jarring collateral damage  I couldn t help but ponder whether  amid the promise of economic development  the train foreshadowed something more regrettable  It seemed unlikely  for instance  that Harar s ambient mysticism would endure once the outside world infiltrated its walls These were a westerner s self indulgent thoughts  though  I remembered how  on the first leg to Dire Dawa  I d chatted with Aschale Tesfahun  a political science lecturer at Dire Dawa University  who d eulogized about the train   My life has become easier because of this train  but it s also a major advantage for all Ethiopia   he d said  I m sure my ruminations would have reached some kind of conclusion if the train had been conducive to coherent thought  But by now our entire carriage had been taken over by Djiboutians bent on one final khat blowout before reaching home  and the

until we arrived at a desiccated plain  Here  close to the geothermal hot spot of the Afar Triple Junction  where three tectonic plates converge  a forest of pinnacles appeared on the horizon  We had reached Lake Abb At least  we had reached what used to be Lake Abb  All that could be seen of the lake itself was a navy blur far to the north  Abdallah told us that a recent Ethiopian irrigation project on the Awash River had disrupted the lake s inflow  The water level  always subject to seasonal fluctuations  had now retreated drastically  marooning the otherworldly landscape of limestone towers for which Abb is famed  The scene we d imagined  with colonies of flamingoes strutting around a topaz shore  was instead a dust bowl  friable and desolate Though I had to swallow some disappointment to see it  Abb s fumaroles  built up over millennia by the accretion of calcareous mineral deposits  still presented an astonishing panorama  In the densest areas  they formed canyons

s chimneys fade to silhouettes from a simple campsite  felt like the culmination of a pilgrimage  This was the place we d been most keen to see We were back on the move the next morning  fishtailing through the sand on our way to Lake Assal  when we stopped at a camp of Afar tribespeople  the nomadic pastoralists who live in the African Horn s eastern badlands  Abdallah s cousin lived there with his wife and seven children  and he welcomed us into his tent  a simple construction of plaited palm fronds draped over a scaffold of sun bleached sticks When I emerged  blinking into the sun  a group

KANSAS CITY  Mo    Pack away the sidewalk tables and flip flops  break out the boots and shovels Nature was showing its fickle side on Wednesday  with blizzard conditions  heavy snow and frigid air pounding parts of the Rockies and the Plains  just a day after the weather was sunny and idyllic  Schools and highways were shut down  hundreds of flights were canceled  and some communities braced for floods The storm  caused by a low pressure system moving east from the Pacific Ocean  dropped temperatures by up to 50 degrees in places like Denver  where it was sunny and in the mid 70s on Tuesday but reached the mid 20s by Wednesday night  The low pressure system was affecting areas from Colorado to Michigan  with heavy snow and thunderstorms  and even down into Texas  where dry conditions and high winds led to wildfire warnings While the whipsawing forecasts drew groans  they did not come as much of a surprise to those familiar with springtime in the Plains and the Rockies  In Colorado  that s not uncommon at all   said Natalie Sullivan  a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder  Colo   noting that April is historically the state s second snowiest month of the year  behind March   We have warm conditions  and then a weather system will come through and bring cold air from a different region  and then   boom   you have snow coming down  Ahead of the storm on Wednesday  Gov  Jared Polis activated the Colorado National Guard  and about 50 soldiers were prepared to respond to stranded drivers  State officials also shut down a highway in the eastern part of the state and part of a highway that cuts through the mountains  citing numerous accidents  Reopening is up to Mother Nature   the Colorado State Patrol said on Twitter Even before the low pressure system reached the Rockies  it wreaked havoc on the West Coast  knocking out power in Los Angeles and kicking up dust storms in Nevada  according to AccuWeather Officials in states across the Midwest watched anxiously for weather dangers Much of the region is still reeling from severe flooding brought on by storms and rising rivers last month  The floods inundated small towns and created a humanitarian crisis on the Pine Ridge Native American reservation  where tribe members found themselves trapped in their homes with little access to food Officials in Hamburg  Iowa  worked quickly to add a temporary five feet tall levee to the town s current levee system before the Missouri River crests by Sunday or Monday  as they expect  Floodwaters inundated much of the town of 1 100 people last month after heavy rain accumulated on frozen ground in the region  We ll build that levee and vigilantly watch throughout the night in case flood does come   said Cathy Crain  the Hamburg mayor More pressing than Hamburg s weather  Ms  Crain said  was the snow and rain in cities to the north  such as Yankton  S D  When precipitation hits those areas hard  it swells the Missouri River and flows down into Hamburg  We are so busy we don t have emotions   she said   We are just moving to recover and to protect our town  Meteorologists predicted as much as two and a half feet of snow in parts of eastern South Dakota Forecasters were hoping that the long term effects of this storm would not be as severe as those that set off the flooding last month  A heavy snowfall takes time to melt and run off into rivers and streams  reducing the chance of flooding  meteorologists say  while heavy rain brings faster runoff and greater danger  Warmer temperatures in recent days have also thawed the ground  meaning it should better absorb moisture  Read more about how an overwhelming bout of snow and flooding set off a humanitarian disaster at Pine Ridge   Still  Gov  Kristi Noem of South Dakota ordered state offices closed on Wednesday  Schools also closed in Rapid City  S D   where several inches of snow fell and the streets became icy  State officials closed a roughly 125 mile stretch of Interstate 29 on Wednesday  from Brookings to the North Dakota border It was not all that unusual to have a heavy snowfall in Rapid City in April  said Domico Rodriguez  the general manager of Hotel Alex Johnson  But this was different  he said  because the two degree wind chills sweeping through the city came just three days after he was out playing softball in 70 degree weather  It s

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  On April 6  something known as the GPS rollover  a cousin to the dreaded Y2K bug  mostly came and went  as businesses and government agencies around the world heeded warnings and made software or hardware updates in advance But in New York  something went wrong   and city officials seem to not want anyone to know At 7 59 p m  E D T  on Saturday  the New York City Wireless Network  or NYCWiN  went dark  waylaying numerous city tasks and functions  including the collection and transmission of information from some Police Department license plate readers The shutdown also interrupted the ability of the Department of Transportation to program traffic lights  and prevented agencies such as the sanitation and parks departments from staying connected with far flung offices and work sites The culprit was a long anticipated calendar reset of the centralized Global Positioning System  which connects to devices and computer networks around the world There has been no public disclosure that NYCWiN  a  500 million network built for the city by Northrop Grumman  was offline and remains so  even as workers are trying to restore it City officials tried to play down the shutdown when first asked about it on Monday  speaking of it as if it were a routine maintenance issue  The city is in the process of upgrading some components of our private wireless network   Stephanie Raphael  a spokeswoman for the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications  said in an email on Monday  She referred to the glitch as a  brief software installation period  By Tuesday  the agency acknowledged the network shutdown  but said in an emailed statement that  no critical public safety systems are affected  Ms  Raphael admitted that technicians have been unable to get the network back up and running  adding   We re working overtime to update the network and bring all of it back online  The problem has raised questions about whether the city had taken appropriate measures to prepare the network for the GPS rollover Ms  Raphael did not respond to questions about what the city had done to prepare for the rollover  she said that the city pays  37 million a year to Northrop Grumman to maintain and operate NYCWiN  A Northrop Grumman spokesman referred all questions to the city  If the city s paying  40 million a year to maintain software infrastructure  first  when it goes down  the Council and the public should know about it   said Councilman Brad Lander of Brooklyn  who learned about the shutdown when he was told of it by The New York Times  And two  if it s mission critical  then it should be clear  the effort to get it up and running  and account for those things that are lost  Mr  Lander  who sits on the City Council s technology committee  said that the committee might hold a hearing to look into the cause of the shutdown and how it was handled Many computerized systems use the Global Positioning System as a timekeeper because it is convenient and easy to connect to  according to a Department of Homeland Security advisory about the reset posted on the agency s website Approximately every 20 years  the GPS needs to reset the way it keeps track of weeks  and Saturday  April 6  was the date selected for the most recent reset  The reset also came with an improvement in timekeeping that means the next rollover will not be needed for about 157 years According to Homeland Security  which first issued a notice about the rollover a year ago  newer systems were considered to be safe but older equipment might need updates to software or hardware Ms  Raphael would not provide a list of agencies that use the system But a Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications alert that went out on Saturday showed that 38 Police Department license plate readers had gone down  The city maintains a system of license plate readers mounted at fixed locations and on patrol cars  which it uses to scan license plates  That has helped it in routine crime fighting  such as finding stolen vehicles  and its antiterrorism work Phil Walzak  a police spokesman  said the department had hundreds of license plate readers  most of which did not rely on the NYCWiN system  He said that patrol cars with readers mounted on them were stationed at key locations affected by the shutdown and that  the N Y P D  has not experienced disruption to operations  investigations or services  Saturday s alert also reported that 12 389 traffic signal controllers were down  According to the information technology agency s website  the Transportation Department s Traffic Management Center uses the network  to centrally monitor and wirelessly program traffic patterns during rush hours  special events and emergencies  While traffic signals continued to operate normally  a city official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the shutdown and asked not to be named  said that there was concern that as they remained disconnected  the timing of individual signals could drift slightly and they could eventually come out of sync with one another Laura Anglin  the deputy mayor for operations who is responsible for the information technology agency  refused to answer questions about it on Wednesday afternoon as she entered City Hall Asked if the city had taken the necessary steps to prepare for the GPS rollover  she said   Talk to the press office  The disruption also affected the transportation department s Real Time Traffic Information webpage  where people can look at the video feeds from hundreds of cameras posted around the city  The webpage showed that many cameras were not working on Wednesday The alert indicated there were also disruptions to the city payroll system  known as CityTime  and systems used by the departments of health  sanitation and parks The wireless network was intended to fill a gap in the ability of city agencies to communicate with one another and get access to information  a problem that was exposed during the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center  when police and fire department officials could not talk to one another because their radios used different frequencies The network began operating in 2008  but it quickly drew criticism for being underused and failing to live up to its promise  

Delve into the books of the Mexican writer and musician Julin Herbert and how obedient   how chaste   so much contemporary nonfiction can suddenly seem in comparison  Does Herbert write memoirs  Essays  Novels  His books are mash ups of memory  investigation and fictional ornamentation  marked with a fond disrespect for genre   much like life Herbert wrote his previous  prizewinning book   Tomb Song   in his mother s hospital room  as she lay dying from leukemia  It is as much farce as elegy   his dreamy  druggy interludes vie with deathbed scenes and recollections of a childhood of poverty and abandonment  spent in the brothels where his mother worked  changing her name  with the nonchalance with which other women dye or perm their hair    Lorena  Vicky  Juana   The source  I ve often thought  of Herbert s comfort with the murk and multiplicity of truth  The title was a twist on  cradle song    a lullaby  Herbert kept vigil over his mother in her final days  her  best loved and most hated son   His new book  like the last  is translated by Christina MacSweeney   one of the great Spanish translators of her generation  It s another kind of tomb song  this time for the motherland   The House of the Pain of Others  tells the story of a  small genocide  that took place in the city of Torren  over the course of three days in 1911  during the Mexican Revolution  Three hundred Chinese immigrants were shot and bludgeoned to death in the streets  their corpses mutilated  their belongings  businesses and homes ransacked The crime has had a strange afterlife  It has been misunderstood and misrepresented   many of Torren s inhabitants still blame outsiders  marauding revolutionaries and drug cartels  almost anyone  to avoid their own complicity   But it has never been truly forgotten  Oral and printed versions circulated almost immediately in its wake  and academic studies followed  The story of the massacre  wants to be told   Herbert writes   It refuses to die  This book is merely a version of that refusal  The challenge was to find a form  Herbert begins by describing the books he does not want to write  a conventional nonfiction narrative or a novel   the version of the killings that existed in popular imagination is fiction enough   What didn t exist was a crnica  in the hybrid Mexican sense of the term  with its blend of literature and journalism  objectivity and subjectivity  I decided to write an ambiguous story  a stylized cross section of history that would bring together the events of the past  and the dents they have left in the present  and in me    he writes  He has created  a medieval book   he tells us  his own efficient hype man   A historical antinovel  overwriting  a stockpot with bony prefixes to season a greasy literary field that has run out of meat  ImageJulin HerbertCreditGerma n SillerI share your confusion  Not least because after the buildup  and garbled metaphors   what Herbert trundles out is fairly straightforward  a dense  detailed narrative of the massacre   although not without a few flourishes The book opens with an epigraph from  Chinatown   the film s classic line   Forget it  Jake  It s Chinatown   and then a heading announcing   This is a western   Setting is fate  we are to understand   and Herbert implicates the entire society in the killings  its patrimony of violence  eugenics and amnesia   Mexico is full of pits filled with the bodies of people who disappeared   Herbert wrote in his short story  Z    A few years ago in Coahuila  a whole town disappeared  300 people were found buried in a common grave  And none of these cases ever get solved   Other stories of disappearances gather at the margins of this new book   43 students who went missing in 2015  the repeated torching of historical archives The title of the book comes from the nickname of the local soccer stadium  and encapsulates  to Herbert  Mexico s xenophobia   Mexican anti Chinese sentiment did not begin with the slaughter in Torren  nor did it end with that event  Before the small genocide  the fantasy of annihilation had set up camp in the press  in coffeehouse conversations  jokes  laws  segregation  public demonstrations and vituperation until things came to blows  Or go back even further  Anti Chinese sentiment seethed long before the arrival of the first immigrant in the Americas  it sprang up  from the thorny territory of the imagination   nurtured by reports from spurned missionaries to China who concocted stories of  irremediable pagans  child murderers  that were enthusiastically taken up by American tabloids   Sinophobia became a best seller  It s the unearthed American connection to the massacre that is Herbert s most interesting contribution  He s a skittish reporter  more content to chat with taxi drivers than squeeze stories from his subjects   In one deflating scene  he encounters one of the leaders of Torren s Chinese community who expertly sidesteps his questions   But in combing through various rumors   that the Chinese opened fire first  that the murders were carried out by Pancho Villa and his men   he makes a powerful admonishment about familiar narratives about racism The dominant view of the massacre has been of a spontaneous explosion of violence fueled by working class resentment of immigrants  the cheap labor they provided and their growing foothold in Mexico  Herbert argues the opposite case  It was Mexico s upper classes who initially  adopted the anti Chinese prejudice of the leading United States citizens of the day   he argues  looking to editorials and chilling anti immigration  satires   Long before any labor related grievances cropped up  it was  a middle class phobia    and contagion   that spread  stoked by the Mexican government The bodies of the 300 Chinese immigrants were dumped in mass graves or left to rot  There was no apology  no restitution   in fact  intimidation of the community only continued after the killings  The great strength of Herbert s book  written with such shame and fury  is that it is not framed as epitaph but as dispatch from a live crime scene  attentive to the silences  the still seething resentments  relinquishing nothing to history  

Good Friday   Want this by email  Sign up here    It doesn t take a genius  to know capitalism needs fixingCapitalism helped Ray Dalio build his investment empire  But in a lengthy LinkedIn post  the Bridgewater Associates founder says that it isn t working anymore   Mr  Dalio writes that he has seen capitalism  evolve in a way that it is not working well for the majority of Americans because it s producing self reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have nots     Disparity in wealth  especially when accompanied by disparity in values  leads to increasing conflict and  in the government  that manifests itself in the form of populism of the left and populism of the right and often in revolutions of one sort or another     The problem is that capitalists typically don t know how to divide the pie well and socialists typically don t know how to grow it well     We are now seeing conflicts between populists of the left and populists of the right increasing around the world in much the same way as they did in the 1930s when the income and wealth gaps were comparably large     It doesn t take a genius to know that when a system is producing outcomes that are so inconsistent with its goals  it needs to be reformed  Stay tuned  Mr  Dalio says that he ll offer his solutions in another essay Elon Musk and the S E C  need their  reasonableness pants A federal judge gave Elon Musk and the S E C  two weeks to resolve a dispute about whether Mr  Musk violated a settlement he reached with the commission  Matthew Goldstein of the NYT reports Mr  Musk s tweeting

Twitter posts that include potentially market sensitive information His lawyers insist that the tweet didn t contain material information  One of them said yesterday that the S E C  s policy on what needs to be vetted was  murky   Judge Alison Nathan of Federal District Court in Manhattan wondered if there was a  lack of clarity  and whether the settlement should be modified or struck down  Take a deep breath   Judge Nathan told both sides  She added that they should put on  their reasonableness pants  to find common ground This is  something of a victory for Mr  Musk  who could have been fined if he was found to be in contempt   Mr  Goldstein writes  But Judge Nathan told Mr  Musk that  regardless of how powerful a person he is  a  court order is not optional  More  Tesla shares fell

BASRA  Iraq   The southern Iraqi city of Basra is struggling to cope with a growing drug problem that has overcrowded prisons and strained police resources  only months after violent protests over poor municipal services Basra s prison system is clogged up and creaking  On a recent day in one police station  Reuters reporters saw about 150 men  their heads shaved  squatting in two small  cramped holding cells Arrests of drug users and dealers have shot up in the past year  further stretching prison services and police in a sign that the problems with municipal resources that prompted protests in Basra last summer have not gone away  Drugs spread because the youth are lost  they have no money  they are sick of life  It s escapism   Major Shaker Aziz  a senior member of Basra police narcotics unit  told Reuters  Prison authorities tell us   Ninety percent of inmates are convicted on drug charges  stop sending them   So we keep them here   Aziz said of the holding cells The situation in prisons  worsened by a lack of treatment centers for recovering addicts  highlights the contrast between the wealth Basra province produces   its oil contributes over 90 percent of state revenues   and its poor living conditions Once known as the Venice of the East  Basra city  which has a population of 4 million  lacks clean water and does not have enough electricity to power air conditioners in the scorching summer heat  Unemployment is widespread  especially among youth Thousands protested against the conditions  unemployment and corruption last summer  when searing heat made matters worse and hundreds were treated in hospital after drinking unclean water  Protesters set ablaze government buildings and political groups  headquarters  and clashed with police  Officials fear a repeat of the violence this year  and while the drug problem is a concern in several areas of Iraq  Basra suffers from it the most STEADY RISEBasra is struggling even though Iraq declared victory in the four year war against Islamic State in 2017  and the city never fell to the militant Sunni Islamist group The number of drug arrests has risen year on year since 2015  Aziz said  By March  police had picked up 15 kilograms  33 lb  of illegal drugs this year  half of 2018 s entire haul  Some 50 to 60 people are arrested each week on drugs related offences  compared to more than 1 000 all last year  he said  Methamphetamine  known popularly as crystal meth  is the most widespread drug  said a police spokesman  Colonel Bassem Ghanem  Opium  cannabis and pill abuse are also common Basra s police department says 97 percent of drug users arrested in 2018 were unemployed  and more than two thirds were 25 or younger  All the drugs come from abroad  said Colonel Ismail al Maliki  who heads the Basra police narcotics unit Basra Police Chief Rashid Fleih said in November that 80 percent of drugs entering the city come from Iran  Tehran denied this but officials still point the finger indirectly at Iran  using euphemisms such as  neighboring countries  Preventing drug trafficking is a serious challenge for Iran which borders Afghanistan  the world s largest opium producer  and Pakistan  a major transit country for drugs Iraq once had the death penalty for users and dealers but passed new legislation in 2017 under which judges can order rehabilitation for users or sentence them to jail for up to three years  In the absence of rehab centers  they are jailed  Under the new law  the health ministry was given two years to provide rehab centers Local health officials pledged to reopen and upgrade a 44 bed rehabilitation center this month but the police say 44 beds is not enough  All of Basra s oil and we can t afford rehab   said Aziz Asked about the situation  the state owned Basra Oil Company said it has pledged  5 million for a rehab center  SMOKING FOR FREE Inside a training complex on the edge of Basra province  police have re purposed a building as a makeshift rehab center for users nearing release About 40 men live in comparatively comfortable conditions  sleeping six per room with access to television  a gym and books  Clerics  officers and teachers lecture on the sinfulness and dangers of drug use Experts say recovering users need treatment and rehabilitation when they first stop using  not towards the end of sentences  Prisoners say they suffer the worst withdrawal symptoms during the first 20 days  unable to eat or sleep  This is just a model  to get the health ministry to build real centers   said Ghanem  the spokesman Prisoners interviewed by Reuters were chosen by police  who sat in on interviews  Some were handcuffed One user turned dealer said he was recruited a year after he started buying  wooed by the idea of free crystal meth  I paid 50 000 dinars   40  per gram as a user  I only paid 20 000   16  as a dealer  I would sell some and smoke some  I was smoking for free   he said  He described a network of dealers that went up to a  big boss  whom he would not identify to police out of fear for his life  He faces a minimum of five years in jail  Some said they were falsely arrested  Asked if the police offered suspects lighter sentences if the provided them with information  one police officer said they rarely needed to   They always cooperate   he said  asking not to be named as he was not authorized to discuss the matter   Additional reporting by Dubai newsroom  Editing by Timothy Heritage  

DUBAI LONDON   Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the United States had made  a vicious move  in designating the Revolutionary Guards as a foreign terrorist organization  and Tehran vowed to take action against U S  forces in the region  They wish to plot against our Sepah  the Guard corps      it is in the front line of confronting enemies of our  1979 Islamic  revolution and has always defended the country     America has failed to block our advances   Khamenei  who controls the Guards  was quoted as saying by the state media  In spite of all the pressure over the past 40 years  Americans have failed to do a damn thing and their vicious move will bear no fruit   Khameni said  a day after a decision by U S  President Donald Trump that is likely to raise tensions in the Middle East Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also defended the corps as protectors of Iran  saying in a televised speech that the United States  holds a grudge  against the Guards who have  sacrificed their lives to protect our people  our revolution  Comprising an estimated 125 000 strong military with army  navy and air units  the Revolutionary Guards  IRGC  also command the Basij  a religious volunteer paramilitary force  and control Iran s ballistic missile programs  The Guards  overseas Quds forces have fought Iran s proxy wars in the region The United States has already blacklisted dozens of entities and people for affiliations with the Guards  but not the organization as a whole The IRGC commander dismissed Washington s decision and said the Guards would upgrade their military capabilities   This U S  move was quite laughable since the Revolutionary Guards are in people s hearts     The Revolutionary Guards will increase their defensive and offensive capabilities in the coming year   Mohammad Ali Jafari was quoted as saying by the state broadcaster The long tense relations between Tehran and Washington took a turn for the worse last May when Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers  reached before he took office  and reimposed sanctions  Tehran retaliated by naming the United States Central Command  CENTCOM  as a terrorist organization and the U S  government as a sponsor of terror The Iranian Armed Forces  general staff  Iran s most senior military body which also oversees the IRGC  said it would  use all its means to fight  against CENTCOM  and a Guards commander on Tuesday warned the U S  Navy to keep its distance  Mr Trump  tell your warships not to pass near the Revolutionary Guards boats   ISNA news agency reported a tweet from Mohsen Rezaei as saying  Saudi Arabia  Iran s arch regional rival and a Washington ally  welcomed the U S  action on Tuesday but Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said it  could have negative repercussions on Iraq and the region  Abdul Mahdi  speaking to reporters  said Baghdad had tried to head off Trump s decision and added that Iraq would do all it could to bring calm to the region since it maintained good relations with both Tehran and Washington Acting U S  Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told Fox News on Tuesday that listing the IGRC as a terrorist group was a policy decision by the administration and was meant to have  non military effects   such as pressuring the Iranian economy  We re going to continue to work in Iraq to strengthen security forces  We recognize Iraq s sovereignty  It s our role in country to build security and we ll continue to do that   Shanahan said Turkey  a NATO ally of the United States  was also critical   Such decisions will lead to instability in our region and once you start stepping outside international law  it is unpredictable where it will stop   Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a press conference in Istanbul For its part  France called for steps to avoid any escalation of tensions in the Middle East Revolutionary Guards commanders have repeatedly said that U S  bases in the Middle East and U S  aircraft carriers in the Gulf are within range of Iranian missiles  Tehran has also threatened to disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if the United States tries to strangle Iran s economy by halting its oil exports  OUR PATIENCE HAS LIMITS In a show of support  Iranian lawmakers wore Guards uniforms to parliament on Tuesday  chanting  Death to America  as Iran marked the annual National Day of the Revolutionary Guards  the semi official Fars news agency reported   America s decision to label the Guards as a terrorist group was the peak of stupidity and ignorance of

MEXICO CITY   Walmart s Mexico unit has penalized food companies supplying groceries to rival Amazon  pressure that has forced some to pull their products from the world s largest online retailer  four people familiar with the matter said The tough tactics come as the two giants battle for supremacy in one of their most important foreign markets  one that Walmart currently dominates  Walmart last year demanded discounts from food businesses whose products it found priced lower on the Mexican website of Amazon com Inc  the people said  even though suppliers had no say in the Seattle retailer s decision to undercut Walmart on price  Two suppliers told Reuters they moved swiftly to pull their brands from Amazon  wary of jeopardizing their relationship with Walmart de Mexico  The companies  both of which sell common pantry goods  said Walmart accounts for more than half their supermarket sales in Mexico Walmart would not discuss its competition with Amazon in Mexico or the allegations made by suppliers  It told Reuters it does not dictate with whom vendors can do business  But it acknowledged it always presses for the lowest prices  particularly if competitors are giving shoppers a better deal   We could never tell anybody that they can t sell to someone else   Ignacio Caride  Walmart Mexico s e commerce head  told Reuters   If we think there s an opportunity to lower our prices  because we see better prices at other retailers  we re going to negotiate for that access   he said The company said in a statement that it aims to offer the lowest possible prices to benefit consumers  and doesn t subsidize losses for some products with revenues from others  Amazon declined to comment  Walmart is Mexico s largest retailer  commanding nearly 60 percent of the country s supermarket sales through more than 2 400 Walmart  Superama  Sam s Club and Bodega Aurrera stores  Its online business in Mexico is growing fast  but it represented just 1 4 percent of revenue last year Graphic   Walmart  giant of Mexican supermarkets  https   tmsnrt rs 2I7GyA7Amazon launched its Mexican website in 2015 and is now one of the country s biggest online retailers  It began selling groceries here in August Supermarket analyst Bill Bishop said Walmart wants to avoid a repeat of its experience in the United States  where Amazon quickly took the lead in online grocery sales  Walmart Inc s Mexico unit is its second largest overseas market by sales after the United Kingdom  on par with Canada Graphic   Walmart s top 10 foreign markets  https   tmsnrt rs 2HZqhgp They re worried that Amazon will grow in Mexico   said Bishop  co founder of retail advisory firm Brick Meets Click in Barrington  Illinois   They re saying  Be aware of the fact that we re not going to make it easy for you to grow here   he said  The two Mexican suppliers who spoke to Reuters said they were caught in the crossfire  They said their wholesale prices were the same for both retailers  but that Amazon chose to sell their products to consumers more cheaply than Walmart did Instead of lowering its retail prices to match those of Amazon  Walmart took it out on them  the vendors said  Walmart docked their payments by the retail price difference  multiplied by the amount of stock in its inventory  a move that cost them tens of thousands of dollars collectively  the people said Both said they entered into talks with Amazon shortly afterward to drop their products  They said they could not afford continued financial clawbacks from Walmart  Nor could they risk losing their biggest customer  despite the huge sales potential offered by Amazon s platform  It s a threat  and it s coercion   one of the people said of Walmart s strategy Emails between Amazon and one of the food companies  seen by Reuters  support the version of events described by suppliers  Two other people familiar with the matter who have expertise in e commerce in Mexico gave similar accounts  A cellphone message sent by another supplier to one of the e commerce professionals discussing its woes with Walmart  reviewed by Reuters  likewise confirmed the situation PLAYING HARDBALLExperts say Walmart s pressure on its suppliers in Mexico is unlikely to have legal repercussions  Miguel Flores  a former member of Mexico s competition commission  said a government investigation into abuse of dominant market power would be complex  lengthy and hard to prove Mexico s competition regulator declined to comment Walmart  the world s largest bricks and mortar retailer  and Amazon  the No  1 online seller  are vying for consumer loyalty worldwide Both companies have been pressuring suppliers for the lowest prices on goods from t shirts to bicycles  And Walmart has spent big to build up its shopping website  delivery network and cloud computing infrastructure to compete with Amazon online Still  Amazon has raced ahead in online food shopping  It notched  3 4 billion in U S  grocery sales last year compared with Walmart s  2 billion in U S  online food sales  according to Boston based research firm Edge by Ascential Amazon s grocery selection in Mexico currently is limited to non perishables  such as coffee  beer  pasta and canned vegetables  Walmart offers a wider selection  including fresh foods such as lettuce and chicken Walmart brought its concerns about Amazon s lower prices to a number of food suppliers in Mexico  including multinational firms  around the time that Amazon launched its food and drinks web page  said two of the people in Mexico s e commerce industry who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of business relationships They said some of the biggest firms figured out ways to appease Walmart  such as packaging their products for Amazon in sizes different from those sold at Walmart  they said But many of the smaller companies lacked the know how to negotiate  they said  Bishop  the supermarket analyst  said Mexican suppliers feel enormous pressure to stick with Walmart  at least for now   The dilemma is that Amazon is a very rapidly growing channel   he said    Reporting by Daina Beth Solomon in Mexico City  Additional Reporting by

LONDON   Just a month after the European Central Bank halted plans to normalise policy and delayed a rate increase into 2020  further signs of weakness in the economy and a whiff of panic among investors is putting the central bank back in the spotlight No policy changes are expected at Wednesday s ECB meeting  especially since some board members are travelling to Washington for the International Monetary Fund s spring meetings But talk of tiered rates to ease pressure on banks  global recession fears and a sense of alarm that pushed 10 year German bond yields below zero percent for the first time since 2016 suggest the ECB news conference may prove lively We look at five key questions on the radar for markets 1  How close is the ECB to action to offset the impact of negative interest rates on banks A debate on whether to  tier  the negative interest rates that banks pay on the idle cash they park at the ECB is now underway  judging by recent ECB comments and the minutes from the March meeting   It s not an obvious next step  but one that the ECB will have to face at some point   said James Rossiter  senior global strategist at TD Securities   We don t expect anything official in the ECB s statement  but it will be difficult for  ECB chief Mario  Draghi to avoid questions on this  Dutch central bank Governor Klaas Knot has said he would need to see clear evidence that negative rates were hurting lending to the real economy  ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said last week that while the bank is studying ways to cut its charge on banks  deposits  euro zone lenders should look closer to home for the causes of their meagre profits The debate is important because if the ECB introduces tiered rates  that might suggest it is preparing to keep interest rates low  below zero percent  for longer than anticipated  No surprise then  that money markets have scaled back expectations of a rate rise and even started to factor in the risk of a rate cut this year  Graphic  When will the ECB raise interest rates   https   tmsnrt rs 2WMPcao 2  What about TLTRO III  can we expect more details In March  the ECB offered some details of what TLTRO III will look like  the loans will have a two year maturity and be offered on a quarterly basis from September until March 2021 The ECB s March meeting minutes showed the bank is still ironing out details Key questions for investors now are what interest the banks will have to pay on the loans and where the funds can be deployed  Barclays analysts  for example  expect banks will be given an incentive to take up the loans through better borrowing rates than the main refinancing operations  MRO   which provide the bulk of liquidity to the euro zone banking system  Euro zone bank stocks and government bonds are sensitive to any TLTRO news  Yields on short dated Southern European bonds have dropped  suggesting investors expect Italian banks in particular to take up the loans  Graphic  Euro zone bank stocks cheer signs of multi year loans  https   tmsnrt rs 2WKE3H0 3  Does the ECB see any green shoots for the economy The ECB is not expected to change its assessment that risks to the economy are tilted to the downside but officials are worried about the downside risks to the growth and inflation forecasts  Unexpectedly weak manufacturing activity data from Germany rattled markets last month  and a brief inversion of the U S  bond yield curve fuelled concerns about global recession risks Germany s leading economic institutes last week slashed their 2019 forecast for growth in Europe s biggest economy and warned growth might be even lower if there is a no deal Brexit Not all the data have been bad  and economists point out a pick up in data from China    the world s number two economy    and signs of strength from the euro zone services sector Graphic  Euro zone economic data  https   tmsnrt rs 2Vq73DG 4  How concerned is the ECB that ultra loose policy has failed to lift inflation expectations Even after last month s unexpectedly dovish tone from the central bank  inflation and inflation expectations remain low Draghi has long predicted a rise in underlying inflation  only for the data to disappoint him and force the ECB to ask for even more time to lift prices A closely watched underlying inflation figure that excludes volatile food and energy prices slowed to 1 0 percent in March  its weakest reading since April 2018 Economists note the timing of Easter distorts the inflation numbers and that the April data should prove more encouraging  It might not feel or look like it  but inflation has been delayed rather than derailed   said Jefferies senior European economist Marchel Alexandrovich The ECB will be hoping that s the case  especially since inflation expectations have tumbled  A key market gauge of long term inflation expectations tracked by the ECB is near its lowest level since 2016  It is down 20 basis points this year    more than it fell the whole of 2018 Graphic  Below target inflation  https   tmsnrt rs 2WLvvQ1 5  Is the ECB ready for a no deal Brexit Draghi told European Union leaders recently that the ECB  the Bank of England and the European Commission have made all the necessary preparations for a no deal Brexit  according to a recent report But Draghi and other officials have also stressed that markets are not fully pricing in the risk of Britain s exit from the EU without a deal    a warning the ECB chief may repeat this week  A no deal Brexit might also affect market liquidity  the EU commissioner in charge of financial services said last week  Any clarity on Brexit is likely to be met with relief by investors and boost sentiment  The ECB is no doubt paying close attention For an interactive version of the below chart  click

JERUSALEM   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he would annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he wins another term in office  a last minute pre election promise likely to enrage Palestinians and the Arab world In an interview with Israeli Channel 12 News three days ahead of the April 9 poll  Netanyahu was asked why he had not extended sovereignty to large West Bank settlements  as Israel did without international recognition in east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights  both captured in the 1967 Middle East war   Who says that we won t do it  We are on the way and we are discussing it   Netanyahu said   You are asking whether we are moving on to the next stage   the answer is yes  we will move to the next stage  I am going to extend  Israeli  sovereignty and I don t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlements  The veteran right wing Israeli leader  who has dominated Israeli politics for a generation  is fighting for his political survival against former top general Benny Gantz  a political novice campaigning on a centrist platform Netanyahu has cast Gantz as a weak leftist who would endanger Israel s security by giving territorial concessions to the Palestinians But Netanyahu  who has fought the election campaign under the shadow of corruption allegations  is also competing for votes with far right parties who advocate annexation  His comments are likely to appeal to hardline voters  who oppose ceding lands Palestinian leaders immediately reacted with anger Saeb Erekat  the chief Palestinian negotiator and a close aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  said   Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity  particularly with the Trump Administration s support and endorsement of Israel s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine  In Gaza  Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri urged Abbas s western backed Palestinian Authority to halt its security cooperation with Israel in the occupied West Bank  Netanyahu s dreams of annexing the West Bank will never be achieved and we will not allow that to happen   he said  It is time for  the PA  to stop security coordination with the occupation  and to get united in the face of the challenges  WEST BANKSettlements are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart Israeli Palestinian peace talks  frozen since 2014 After decades of settlement building  more than 400 000 Israelis now live in the West Bank  according to Israeli figures  among about 2 9 million Palestinians according to the Palestinian Statistics Bureau A further 212 000 Israeli settlers live in East Jerusalem  according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs The Palestinians and many countries consider settlements to be illegal under the Geneva conventions that bar settling on land captured in war  Israel disputes this  citing security needs and biblical  historical and political connections to the land The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank  east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip  all territory Israel captured in 1967  Israel has annexed east Jerusalem and withdrawn from Gaza  The West Bank remains under Israeli military occupation with limited Palestinian self rule Netanyahu s remarks follow a series of announcements and policy changes by U S  President Donald Trump that were seen to favor Israel In March  Trump broke with decades of international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights  territory Israel captured from Syria That followed his December 2017 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel  and to move the U S  embassy there  Both moves delighted Israel  infuriated Palestinian and Arab leaders  and were opposed by most U S  allies With Trump s moves on Jerusalem and The Golan  the Israeli leader may feel emboldened to advocate for annexation  U S  officials have said they would unveil a long awaited Trump administration Middle East peace plan after the Israeli election  but prospects to restart negotiations appear dim The Palestinians have been boycotting the Trump administration over its Jerusalem moves and other recent decisions they view as pro Israel bias ELECTION CAMPAIGNThe U S  State Department declined to comment about Netanyahu s remarks  which were viewed in the Israeli media as an attempt to draw right wing votes rather than an immediate change of policy Netanyahu has been plagued by corruption allegations throughout the election campaign  after Israel s attorney general publicly announced in February that he intends to indict Netanyahu Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in three cases of alleged bribery and fraud  but the allegations could cloud his political future and that of any government he might head  possibly leading to a new election His main election rival  Gantz  has vowed to pursue peace with the Palestinians  but he has also stopped short at embracing their quest for statehood A spokeswoman for Gantz declined comment on Netanyahu s remarks  On Friday  the last day polling is allowed  Gantz s centrist Blue and White party was projected to take 30 seats  more than the 26 forecast for Netanyahu s right wing Likud  according to a poll in Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper But this and other polls also projected a majority of the Knesset s 120 seats will go to the parties in Netanyahu s right wing bloc  giving Netanyahu a slim but workable majority A few days before the previous Israeli election in 2015  Netanyahu vowed there would never be a Palestinian state under his watch but then backtracked on that statement after a rebuke from Trump s predecessor  Barack Obama  Last year  however  Netanyahu told members of his right wing Likud party that Israel and the United States were discussing the possibility of Israel annexing settlements  The White House swiftly denied that  While vowing that he would not evacuate settlers from their homes  Netanyahu has also said in the past that the future of the settlements should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians   Reporting by Maayan Lubell additional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah  Editing by Stephen Farrell  Peter Graff and Diane Craft  

At War is a newsletter about the experiences and costs of war  Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Friday Each year since the late 1990s  public surveys have found that Americans have a high confidence in the country s armed forces  often higher than for any other American institution  This public confidence largely endured even as American plans in Afghanistan and Iraq repeatedly failed  and as thousands of men and women in uniform died and tens of thousands more were wounded in wars that did not achieve what the military and its leaders set out to do For many people who served in these recent wars  living within the services  stifling bureaucracies or laboring in operations or circumstances that eroded their confidence in the Pentagon and the brass  these results can feel both familiar and odd  How do the services seemingly get a pass  Is public support reflexive  a species of approval as automatic as some of the thank you for your service gestures that are a feature of life as a service member or veteran The disconnect between public support and military performance extends beyond the failures in the wars  It s a feature as well in how the military handles issues away from the battlefields  including  as presented this week in At War  in cases of sexual harassment and public health On April 3  Patricia Kime wrote about the dangers of lead exposure in military service and the multiyear odyssey of Stephen Hopkins  a Special Forces veteran who suffered  crippling nausea  constant dizziness  a skyrocketing heart rate  and later  migraine symptoms  abnormal thirst and muddled thinking   His symptoms began in 2005  Hopkins received a proper diagnosis   chronic lead exposure   in 2012  and only after he collapsed and his parents drove him to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center  The military  Kime s reporting found  has resisted wider monitoring of its members for exposure  and has not followed earlier warnings That soldiers are exposed to lead while on the job isn t news for the Army  A 1996 study by the Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine noted that soldiers on bases were at risk for exposure to  unhealthy levels of lead  from firing ranges  battery repair  lead paint and building demolition  The center recommended fully implementing  existing Army policies  programs and procedures for lead exposure reduction  and including lead  as a priority pollutant in   pollution prevention programs   Yet Hopkins and others say they never received explicit warnings of potential lead exposure or guidance on proper range hygiene The Army Thought He Was Faking His Health Issues  Turns Out He Had Chronic Lead Poisoning After years of misdiagnoses  Stephen Hopkins learned that lead in his bones was making him sick  Now he s calling for the military to increase testing for metal poisoning in troops April 3  2019I Followed My Father Into the Marines  But It Was Different for a Woman I faced constant sexual harassment in the corps  It was a side of the military neither of us wanted to see April 4  2019On April 4  At War published an essay by Cristine Pedersen  a former Marine Corps cryptologist who followed her father into the service  Pedersen was raised in a Marine ethos  a climate of almost religious devotion to the corps  She completed her demanding training and volunteered for deployment  only to have her good faith service betrayed  Pedersen was subjected to misogyny and repeated sexual harassment  and to small unit leaders who often did not act upon her complaints  For much of her service  she withheld the sordid details from her father  worried that he too might play down her suffering or be inclined not to believe her   My father and many Marines I served with   Pedersen wrote   failed to grasp both the extent of the abuses and their costs  In the summer of 2015 I let my enlistment expire  and I started college three weeks later  I felt exhausted by my career and angry that my father still felt so loyal to an institution that had repeatedly dehumanized me  How to square this kind of deep loyalty to the armed forces and high public support with a long record of failures  Pedersen proposed an answer that aligns with the mission of At War   You can simultaneously love an institution and recognize how it is failing  The truest form of commitment is perhaps to bring these failures to light  The Latest From At WarAfghan War Casualty Report  March 29 April 4April 4  2019Bad Food  Broken Down Trucks  What It s Like to Be a U S

WASHINGTON   Joseph R  Biden Jr  on Friday twice jokingly referred to complaints from several women that he had made them uncomfortable with his physical contact  and then offered a convoluted apology about their concerns and his behavior  I m sorry I didn t understand more   he told reporters about his hugs and kisses to women over the years   I m not sorry for any of my intentions  I m not sorry for anything that I have ever done  I ve never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman  Speaking at an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers conference in Washington  the former vice president used his first public remarks since the complaints emerged to try to push past the weeklong controversy that has overshadowed his expected presidential campaign  In his address  he largely stuck to his long running political themes  highlighting the importance of uniting a divided nation and restoring the  great American middle class    save for two notable asides  Read more  Biden didn t rush into 2020  The race came to him anyway  As he took the stage  he hugged Lonnie R  Stephenson  the union s president   I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie   he said  and the largely male crowd burst into laughter The joke came as Mr  Biden was fending off criticism from some Democrats  who worry that the 76 year old is out of step with the party s current sensibilities around gender and race  In recent days  he has struggled to address complaints from women that his hugs  kisses and other expressions of his physically intimate style of politicking were unwelcome  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  Even as Mr  Biden sought to move past the accusations  they were plainly on his mind Several minutes into his remarks  Mr  Biden spotted children in the audience  After welcoming them to the stage  Mr  Biden wrapped his arm around a young boy   By the way  he gave me permission to touch him   he said  to laughter  Everyone knows I like kids more than people   he added In his comments to reporters  made just a few feet from where President Ronald Reagan was nearly assassinated in 1981  Mr  Biden all but announced his third presidential bid  saying he had been  told by the lawyers  that he had to watch his words to avoid triggering certain campaign finance rules that start with an announcement  He indicated that he viewed a late entry into the crowded field as a strategic advantage  Give everybody else their day  Then I get a shot  and then we re off to the races   he said But Mr  Biden also said he  wouldn t be surprised  if more women came forward  He acknowledged that his physically intimate style of campaigning would have to change   a shift he compared to his efforts to adjust to the practice of snapping selfies with voters  It s going to have to change somewhat how I campaign   he said   It s a new thing  It s important  and I m sure it s going to take a while for it to settle out  But it s settled out for me  But the public joking by Mr  Biden struck a nerve among some of the women who had expressed discomfort with their interactions  Biden s consent joke is a clear indication Biden doesn t get it and doesn t take the voice of the women who have come forward seriously   said Amy Lappos  who told  The Hartford Courant that Mr  Biden had crossed  a line of respect  in their 2009 encounter at a fund raiser in Connecticut And Lucy Flores  a former Nevada assemblywoman who published an essay last week that described Mr  Biden touching and kissing her inappropriately at a 2014 campaign event  wrote on Twitter   It s clear  JoeBiden hasn t reflected at all on how his inappropriate and unsolicited touching made women feel uncomfortable  To make light of something as serious as consent degrades the conversation women everywhere are courageously trying to have  Tarana Burke  the founder of the  MeToo movement  tweeted that Mr  Biden s making light of the controversy was  disrespectful and inexcusable  VideoResponding to complaints by several women about unwanted physical contact  former Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr  said   I m sorry I didn t understand more  I m not sorry for any of my intentions  CreditCreditTasos Katopodis Getty ImagesOthers praised Mr  Biden s remarks as an indication that he was listening to criticism of his behavior and trying to change Celinda Lake  a pollster who specializes in female voters  said Mr  Biden s comments would resonate within a Democratic primary electorate in which a majority of voters are expected to be over 50   and may identify with Mr  Biden s struggles to understand shifting norms around interactions between men and women  I thought he showed that he accepts responsibility  recognizes the issues and is changing   said Ms  Lake  who worked on Mr  Biden s 2008 presidential bid   No one is perfect  His intent was clear  And he is changing  And Mr  Biden s comments added more grist for a controversy spinning in several directions at once  Judith Shulevitz  who writes on feminism and other topics  including as a contributing op ed writer for The New York Times  said the furious backlash about Mr  Biden s long public behavior reflected opposition to his candidacy more than his suddenly controversial personal style  Don t pretend to be having an elevated discussion of public policy when you re conducting character assassination   she wrote in Politico   You have come to bury Uncle Joe  not review his record  Own up to it  The union conference offered a friendly and comfortable setting for Mr  Biden  but it represented only one element of an increasingly diverse Democratic Party base  Mr  Biden proclaimed he felt at home with the crowd  liberally sprinkling his comments with the mild profanity that he often deploys at political rallies  We ve gotten so damn sophisticated  We ve gotten so damn elitist   he said  referring to what he said was a tilt away from valuing blue collar labor   I hate the way things have changed over the last 15 to 20 years  He used the bulk of his speech to critique economic inequality and partisanship  offering an argument for American renewal that could form the basis of his campaign  He also leveled a full throated indictment of Mr  Trump  perhaps previewing an opening salvo  What in the hell is happening  Our children are listening   he said   This country can t afford more years of a president looking to settle personal scores  Some Democrats view the former vice president  with his decades of legislative experience and a folksy  blue collar political brand  as the most formidable potential challenger to Mr  Trump  Mr  Biden  who also enjoys broad name recognition  leads in most early polling of the race for the Democratic nomination  Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker  But others fear that Mr  Biden  who would enter the White House as the oldest president in American history  and his team are unprepared to deal effectively with the political pitfalls posed by his decades long legislative record and old fashioned style  Mr  Biden was slow to respond personally to the furor surrounding the women s complaints  relying at first on statements issued by aides and supporters As criticism mounted and more women came forward  Mr  Biden released an online video on Wednesday  in which he tried to explain his approach to  connecting  with people over the years  He has described himself as a  tactile politician  who tries to comfort people with hugs  kisses and touches on the shoulder when they appear nervous or upset In the seemingly homemade two minute video  Mr  Biden promised to  be more mindful and respectful of people s personal space  in the future  Reaction to his comments was divided  with critics questioning the lack of a clear apology for his behavior and supporters praising his willingness to address the issue Mr  Trump taunted Mr  Biden about the accusations on Thursday  tweeting a 15 second video that mocked Mr  Biden  accompanied by the text  WELCOME BACK JOE   With his remark  the president seemed to be practically inviting a re examination of his own record with women  including multiple claims of sexual harassment and the  Access Hollywood  tape that nearly derailed his 2016 campaign While Mr  Biden fashions himself as a fierce defender of women s rights  frequently citing his work as the architect of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act  he has already faced obstacles in his efforts to win over female Democrats  Women are expected to make up a majority of voters in the Democratic primary  which includes six female candidates Recent comments that he wished he  could have done something  to treat Anita Hill s claims of sexual harassment with more respect during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991 drew fierce backlash from critics  who pointed out that Mr  Biden had been chairman of the Senate committee that questioned Ms  Hill  His shifting position on abortion rights over his 36 years in the Senate has also drawn fresh scrutiny

LONDON   Following are the five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders this week and the Reuters stories related to them 1  THE I WORDAs the U S  yield curve makes up its mind whether to invert or not  investors seeking reassurance that we are in a Goldilocks era of non inflationary growth will get to scour two monthly price gauges this week  On Wednesday  the Labor Department is expected to report that its March Consumer Price Index rose 0 3 percent on the month and 1 8 percent over the year   a reading that would reinforce subdued underlying inflation and validate the Fed s almost about face after four hikes last year      CPI   a proxy for overall inflation that factors into cost of living adjustments for Social Security   rose 1 5 percent year to February  the smallest increase since September 2016  The latest reading of the Fed s favorite inflation measure rose 1 8 percent in the year to January  below its 2 percent target     Fed officials have started alluding to a new economic reality of slowish growth and little upward price pressure  Even as wages creep higher  improved productivity curbs firms  costs Minutes of the March Fed policy meeting  to be released on Wednesday  will be cross checked for references to the new  patient  approach and  muted  inflation  The March producer price index  a glimpse of pipeline price pressures  is scheduled for Thursday Graphic  U S  Core CPI and PCE   https   tmsnrt rs 2CYPJ1h2  MARIO TO THE RESCUE Just a month since the European Central Bank put plans to normalize policy on hold and delayed a rate hike into 2020  further signs of weakness in the economy and a whiff of panic among investors puts the spotlight back on the central bank A woeful set of German industrial orders data this week pushed German Bund yields back into negative territory and though a U S  China trade deal could be in sight  it looks like difficult times ahead for Europe  No policy changes are expected at Wednesday s ECB meeting  especially since some board members are traveling to Washington for the International Monetary Fund s spring meetings But talk of tiered rates to ease pressure on banks  global recession fears  Brexit  and a sense of panic that has pushed 10 year German bond yields back below zero percent  all suggest ECB chief Mario Draghi s news conference may prove lively Investors will also keep an eye out for further details on cheap loans known as the targeted long term refinancing operations  TLTROs     one of the few policy tools left in the kit after the end of QE    and what the ECB will do to incentivize banks to take it up  Graphic  German Bund yields hover around zero   https   tmsnrt rs 2HYkJ5L3  WATCH YOUR CHINA An unexpected recovery in China factory activity surveys offered investors a glimmer of hope the stimulus injected in one of the world s major growth engines may be yielding results  Trade data due out on Friday could provide the next clue that could help investors regain confidence as they gauge whether the slowdown is bottoming out That said  the recovery remains feeble and analysts believe it is still highly dependent on how the trade negotiations with Washington go  Markets took some hope from an announcement by U S  President Donald Trump on Thursday that Washington and Beijing could declare a trade deal within four weeks  while Chinese President Xi Jinping was reported as saying progress was being made  But Trump also warned Beijing it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without a pact Many believe the Chinese economy may still need more stimulus either way  On Sunday  China announced it will step up its policy of targeted cuts to banks  required reserve ratios to encourage financing for small and medium sized businesses that play a central role in economic growth  Beijing has been urging banks to continue lending to struggling businesses  especially smaller private concerns that account for more than half the country s economic growth and most of its jobs Graphic  China reserve requirement ratios and the yuan   https   tmsnrt rs 2CXO8c74  THE LONG GOODBYEAfter British Prime Minister Theresa May s request to the European Council to delay Brexit until up to June 30  the focus now shifts to a summit on Wednesday of the EU s 27 other leaders to discuss a proposal to offer Britain a flexible extension of up to a year With the British parliament have failed three times to approve May s withdrawal agreement with the EU  she started talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the hope of breaking the Brexit deadlock  With Britain s departure now set for April 12  May s government is running out of time Yet markets are not getting too excited about things just now  While one month risk reversals for the pound  a gauge of demand for the British currency in the derivatives market  have rebounded from a 2 1 2 year low hit last month  they still remain far below levels seen earlier this year  indicating overall sentiment remains bearish Implied volatility measures also indicated caution with one month gauges for the pound remaining elevated despite a dip this week compared to the

investors from around the globe gather in Washington for the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank  A Group of 20 central bankers and finance ministers meeting takes place

I started playing Dungeons   Dragons right around the time I completely gave up on Facebook  It was a little less than a year ago  as the first stories broke about the Cambridge Analytica scandal  I was sick of the social media idea of friendship  defined as likes or shares or  X knows the same 50 people you know   So when my friend Kate suggested we start a game of Dungeons   Dragons  I thought   Yes  I m going to get together with people face to face  without any hearting or retweeting  and we re going to eat chips and fight those damn cultists who are trying to resurrect the evil  five headed dragon queen Tiamat  Until then  I had played a little D D as an adult  but I hadn t joined a group that met regularly  But I am basically the target demographic for  Stranger Things   Like the characters on that show  I played D D in the 1980s with a group of geeky guys every day at lunch throughout the sixth grade  slaying vegepygmies in a crashed spaceship and meeting the great demon Lolth in her sticky transdimensional web  Kate became our dungeon master  the narrator of our adventure  who sets the scene using maps  dice  flowery language and silly accents  We were joined by seven other friends around my dining room table  eager to take on the roles of fighting monk  rogue  sorcerer  warlock  paladin  bard and cleric  As soon as Kate told us to fill out our character sheets  I remembered the feeling of sheer awesomeness that had drawn me to the game when I was 11  I was about to become an Aarakocra cleric  a bird person with a divine connection to nature who could call down lightning  raise winds  grow plants from the barren earth and heal the dying with a touch But D D isn t only about inventing a more badass version of myself  with wings and magic powers instead of sneakers and a laptop  I was also drawn to the idea of building a social group whose baseline assumption was that we d see one another regularly  There s a sense of purpose to the gathering Using a few maps spread on the table  we chart our course  explaining to Kate and one another what we want to do next  And when Kate leaves us on a cliffhanger  there s no  Hey  I ll text you later and maybe we can meet up   Of course we ll meet up again  The point of the game isn t to win  it s to go adventuring together Wizards of the Coast  the parent company of Dungeons   Dragons  reported that 8 6 million people played the game in 2017  its biggest year of sales in two decades  That mark was eclipsed in 2018  when D D sales reportedly grew 30 percent  All of those D D consumers are snapping up the Fifth Edition  a new rule set released in 2014 that emphasizes a flexible approach to combat and decision making  New players don t need to learn as many arcane rules to get started  and sales of D D starter kits skyrocketed  Adding to the newfound popularity are thousands of D D games broadcast on YouTube and the live stream service Twitch   Critical Role   a popular livestream and podcast  features actors playing the game  This surge of interest is no doubt also inspired by shows like  Stranger Things  and the D D esque world of  Game of Thrones   We want to escape into fantasy worlds where we know who the bad guys are and our spells to banish evil actually work  In this way  D D is similar to online games like World of Warcraft  where people take on imaginary identities  form a guild and shout at one another using headsets while fighting orcs  What makes D   D different is that we can never forget about the human beings behind the avatars  When a member of my group makes a bad choice  I can t look into his face and shout insults the way I would if we were playing online  He s a person  and my friend  even if he also inexplicably decided to open an obviously booby trapped trunk  get a faceful of poison and use up my last remaining healing spell  As technology advances  will it continue to blur the lines between public and private  Sign up for Charlie Warzel s limited run newsletter to explore what s at stake and what you can do about it   But online  my friend would be just another dude with leathery blue skin  not someone whose face might crumple in sadness if I m a jerk  There s a toxic distance created by online gaming and social networks that allows us to pretend we re not socializing with friends  Our empathy gets switched off  That may be one reason gamer arguments over fake countries and nonexistent knights can morph all too easily into hate based social movements in the real world Plus  even when things get heated during our D D game   and they do   none of us can win by getting 10 000 of our  friends  to harass the person we disagree with There are  of course  genuine friendships forged in online game worlds and on social media  and I don t mean to dismiss those  But after months of playing D D with my friends  I m socializing on Twitter and other social media less than I did before  I don t click to see hundreds of half lives flash before me in an instant  Instead  I look forward to an evening with a handful of people What drove me away from Facebook wasn t just the fake friending  It was that fake friendship could be weaponized  used by a hostile government or group to manipulate us  When we fantasize together  in person  we always know that the bot army isn t real  We know that an insult can hurt  But online  we wear masks over masks  I still love the internet  but I d rather have a real friendship with a half elf bard than a thousand faceless followers RelatedMore on gaming and

Investment fees have dropped so low that you may have assumed they have gone as far as they can  and the cost cutting story is just about over Well  think again  Something mind boggling is on its way Fees are on the verge of falling below zero  Major companies will soon be paying customers to invest with them  That  at least is the conclusion of the investment research firm Flowspring  which says the fund price wars are about to be fought in the previously unexplored territory of negative fees  Zero may seem to be the lower bound for fees  but it s not   Warren Miller  Flowspring s chief executive  said in an interview   As we ve learned from interest rates  zero is a psychological barrier  not a real one  The fund industry is tottering on that barrier right now  Negative fees are coming  In a provocative essay   The Game Theory of Fund Price Wars   Mr  Miller writes that competitive fee cutting has brought us to the edge of a new  negative fee universe that is probably better for individual investors than it is for investment companies He compares the cost cutting frenzy to a dollar auction game  a behavioral finance staple in which participants bid for a dollar bill  Once the game starts  the  winner  of the dollar bill often ends up paying far more than  1  Playing the game is  in itself  a trap In the fund industry  Mr  Miller said   This auction game has already started  even if people don t all realize it  Consider that last month  a start up  Salt Financial  filed a registration statement indicating its intention to market a negative fee stock fund this spring  The fund s expense ratio will be minus 0 05 percent  The Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet weighed in The Salt Financial filing says that the company s founders plan to subsidize the fund until it attracts  100 million in investments  At that point  the subsidy  which amounts to no more than  50 000  would end  So would the fund s negative fees  which would jump to 0 29 percent In short  this negative fee fund is a first step  It is a promotional gambit  not a permanent strategy  It is difficult to break through in the current marketplace and reach investors   Tony Barchetto  one of the fund s founders  said in an interview   We will be offering negative fees on a temporary basis  for our own strategic reasons   he added The strategy has already gotten plenty of attention in the fund industry   It s the most creative and effective use of  50 000 in marketing money that I ve heard of in a long time   said Jon de St  Paer  the chief executive of Charles Schwab Investment Management I spoke with representatives of BlackRock  Fidelity  Schwab  State Street and Vanguard   large companies that offer index funds with fees of zero or close to it  None said they were planning to offer negative fee funds right now  but none categorically ruled out doing so Yet if the Salt Financial venture is successful  other negative fee funds will probably follow  For many companies  that would be a small step  Mr  Springer said Fidelity has already slashed fees to zero   yes  nothing at all   for four of its index funds  Other major companies are offering funds with costs so close to zero that the difference is scarcely measurable  And even if big companies aren t advertising their offerings as negative fee funds  some index funds are virtually there already Understanding this requires a quick descent into mutual fund plumbing   Hold your breath  This won t take long   As a Morningstar report recently explained  most large mutual funds and exchange traded funds  or E T F s  are permitted to lend some of the securities they hold  often to short sellers  who borrow the securities in the hope of selling them later at a cheaper price Vanguard  for example  says that for several of its low cost index funds  the revenue that flows back into the funds from securities lending is so great that there is effectively no net cost to investors right now  In fact  the reverse is true   You could say these funds are paying investors to hold them  but we d never promote it as such   John Woerth  a Vanguard spokesman  said in an email Vanguard Small Cap E T F   which has a published expense ratio of 0 05 percent  is one such fund  Securities revenue  plus what Vanguard called  skillful portfolio management   has enabled that index fund to beat the index it tracks over the past few years  said Rich Powers  who leads Vanguard s exchange traded fund operation Fidelity  which has been slashing costs and offers index funds that are cheaper than comparable Vanguard funds  also funnels securities lending revenue back into its index funds   We re doing everything we can to keep costs low for our investors   said Kathleen Murphy  president of Fidelity Investments   2 4 trillion personal investing business Last year  the Fidelity Small Cap Index Fund  with an expense ratio of only 0 025 percent  generated more than 0 20 percent in securities lending revenue  which it returned to the fund  Nicole Goodnow  a Fidelity spokeswoman  said In effect  Mr  Miller of Flowspring said  numbers like that make it possible for fund companies to make money even when they charge customers less than what he described as  a nominal fee of zero   Furthermore  once they entice you into becoming an investor  most fund companies can extract revenue in many ways As always  buyer beware  Low cost isn t everything  A bad investment or service is still bad  even if there is no fee attached For the most part  the cost cutting revolution that Jack Bogle at Vanguard started decades ago has been a good thing  As I recently wrote  the low prices charged by investment managers have been dropping so much that they are dampening overall inflation to the point that the impact is showing up in government statistics  But as low costs spread  new problems may crop up Consider the pitfalls of business models that don t require customers to pay direct fees  Facebook  Google  Twitter  Snapchat and others are examples  They mine their users  personal data and generate immense revenue  although it is an understatement to say that not everyone is happy about this No fee or negative fee investment companies will have vast amounts of information about their clients  The successful ones will find ways of making money from customers who believe  initially at least  that they are getting a free lunch And if investment companies take greater risks with the assets entrusted to them to offset the fees they have given up  people of modest means will probably suffer  Greater scrutiny from regulators may be required to forestall far greater problems Nonetheless  cost counts for a lot  The downward fee spiral remains good news for millions of people  even if the fees drop below zero  

CALEXICO  Calif    President Trump traveled to this small border town two hours east of San Diego on Friday to highlight what he and his aides say is an out of control crisis caused by a surge of Central American families who have overwhelmed law enforcement facilities at the border Just a day after retreating from his threat to shut down the entire border with Mexico  Mr  Trump accepted a plaque from border agents and sheriffs in front of a 30 foot tall section of border wall   the physical embodiment of his immigration agenda   and met with border officials  lawmakers and administration officials at the Border Patrol station here  We re really making progress at letting people know this is an emergency   the president said   It s a colossal surge and it s overwhelming our immigration system and we can t let that happen  Critics argue that the wall is not a solution to the surge of families that have arrived in recent months since most of the families are not trying to sneak into the country undetected  On the contrary  most are seeking Border Patrol agents to turn themselves in  either at the ports of entry or between them But Mr  Trump insisted on Friday that his efforts to seal off the border from undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers was necessary because  we don t have room  That means you can t take  em   I don t think anyone has ever expressed it like that but I am expressing it like that   Mr  Trump added   When it s full  it s full  Asked on Thursday night why the president was not using the national emergency he recently declared to seek funds to provide humanitarian relief to the families who have been apprehended recently  Kirstjen Nielsen  the secretary of homeland security  conceded that the focus on the wall is  partly  a stunt  Well  I think part of that is just a   it s an optic   she told Chris Cuomo  the host of  Cuomo Prime Time  on CNN   To have the president stand in front of the wall indicates immediately to any viewer that he s at the border  But I think his message will be about the dual crisis and how we need Congress to act  to give us the authorities to address  Mr  Trump  however  hailed what he called the  tremendous impact  of the wall in Calexico and said that his administration expected to build 400 miles  worth of wall in the next two years In fact  the small section of wall that Mr  Trump stood in front of   next to a field of solar panels   is not evidence that the president is building the wall he repeatedly called for during his 2016 presidential campaign but merely an upgrade to an existing section of fencing  The two mile section was completed in October  Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Weeks after declaring a national emergency at the border because Congress refused to fund construction of his border wall  Mr  Trump recently threatened to close the legal ports of entry between Mexico and the United States   potentially disrupting billions of dollars  worth of trade and halting the travel of a half million people each day But on the eve of his trip here  Mr  Trump backed down in the face of hard criticism from the business community and top officials in his own party  Senator Mitch McConnell  the Republican leader  predicted that a complete border shutdown would have a  potentially catastrophic economic impact  on the country Mr  Trump responded on Thursday by initially saying he would give Mexico a year to stop Central American migrants from traversing Mexico on their way to the United States  He added that if Mexico did not do its part  he would first impose tariffs on Mexican cars before shutting down the border Later in the day  Mr  Trump denied that he had put off a border shutdown for a year  saying that it could still happen if he decided that Mexico was not doing enough to keep migrants from traveling to the United States  We ll start with the tariffs and see what happens   he said In his visit here  Mr  Trump thanked Mexico for deporting migrants at its southern border  which he said  they have never done before  in three decades  and suggested he had delayed closing the border because of their heightened efforts But it is false that Mexico only recently began enforcing its southern border at Mr  Trump s urging  according to data  experts and the Mexican government  Marcelo Ebrard  Mexico s foreign minister  told reporters on Tuesday that Mexico had been consistent in its immigration policies It deported 40 000 to 190 000 migrants every year from 2011 to 2016  data from Segob  Mexico s internal affairs agency  shows  In 2016  Mexico deported nearly 150 000 migrants from Honduras  El Salvador and Guatemala compared with 107 000 deportations of migrants from those three countries in 2018  In the first two months of 2019  Mexico deported more than 13 000 migrants from the countries Contrary to Mr  Trump s repeated claims this week  Mexico s immigration laws are not harsher or  stronger  than the United States  illegal crossing are decriminalized in Mexico and considered a minor offense  Experts said they were not aware of any changes in the laws or enforcement practices  On the contrary  the discourse of President Lpez Obrador has been more humanitarian than that of the former president  granting work permits and making efforts to find last minute shelters   said Karla A  Valenzuela  a professor at Ibero American University in Mexico City who specializes in migration Dr  Valenzuela said an uptick in detentions and removals in recent weeks was not necessarily indicative of intensified enforcement  but rather more linked to increased flows from Central America Meanwhile  the president s re election campaign released a video on Friday blasting Democrats for their position on the border  a clear indication that Mr  Trump intends to use the issue of border security for his political benefit  no matter the facts on the ground The video shows leading Democratic presidential candidates  including Beto O Rourke  Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren  mocking the idea of a wall at the border  We do not need any walls   Mr  O Rourke is shown saying  The headline in the video says  bluntly   Democrats do not want to keep Americans safe  and adds   It s time for Democrats to stop playing political games with national security  A response from the Democratic National Committee assailed the president s visit as nothing more than a photo opportunity  to try and build nonexistent support for his unnecessary and ineffective border wall   Instead of doing anything to address the issues that matter most to the people of Calexico  Trump is actually making things worse   the committee said  

The main exhibition at the Venice Biennale is arguably the most coveted gig in curating  It s the centerpiece of the international art world s highest profile event  and gives the chosen curator instant prestige  But it s a tricky one to get right The show  held every two years  sprawls across two sites   one a columned pavilion in a public park  the Giardini  the other a set of former shipbuilding workshops in the Arsenale   and pulls together work by a huge number of artists  In 2017  there were 120 of them  in 2015  there were 136 This year  the number will be down  There will be just 79 artists or artist partnerships  but each will show at both venues  offering radically different works at the two sites  These are some of the changes introduced by the curator Ralph Rugoff in an exhibition titled  May You Live in Interesting Times   opening May 11 and running through Nov  24 For the past 13 years  Mr  Rugoff  a 62 year old New Yorker  has steered the Hayward Gallery  a public institution not far from Tate Modern in London  With a series of thoughtful  but also playful  shows  he has put the Hayward on London s contemporary art map In Venice  his show will compete for attention with 90 others held in national pavilions  as well as with numerous  collateral events   and face a pitiless lineup of critics  Yet in an interview at his Hayward office in London   a windowless basement room with flat pack furniture and a single framed poster resting on a ledge   Mr  Rugoff appeared characteristically coolheaded ImageThe columned pavilion in the Giardini  a public park  is one of two sites for the main exhibition of the Venice Biennale CreditAndrea Avezzu La Biennale di VeneziaThe Venice Biennale  has the potential to be the world s greatest art exhibition  Each iteration is a different story   Mr  Rugoff said   Sometimes it rises to the occasion  sometimes not   Bigger isn t always better   he said   The exhibition format doesn t always lend itself to gargantuan scale  in general  Do you want to see movies that are 20 hours long  Compared to a normal exhibition  that s what a Biennale is like  Mr  Rugoff said he had also avoided giving the exhibition a theme because there were 300 biennials around the world each year with similar themes  all he wanted was for the artists to represent the times we live in  At a time when governments were distorting facts and the internet gave people only the news they wanted to hear  contemporary art was about  simultaneously juggling different perspectives   he said  It  opens up your brain  The chosen works will be both  experimental  and  classical   because  art should give us pleasure as well as provide critical insight   Mr  Rugoff said  Artists will include established names   Julie Mehretu  who has never been in the Biennale show   George Condo  Danh Vo   and emerging ones  Nabuqi and Yu Ji of China  and Soham Gupta of India  all born in the 1980s Mr  Rugoff was appointed in December 2017 on the recommendation of Paolo Baratta  the Biennale s president  because of his consistent focus on the general public rather than on what Mr  Baratta called  the periphery   meaning the dealers  auctioneers and collectors who swarm the Biennale in the pre opening  vernissage  week  many hoping to buy or sell the art on view The event s true audience is its visitors  Mr  Baratta said   615 000 of them in 2017  up 23 percent from 2015   The institution of the vernissage is the greatest enemy of the Biennale  because it gives a totally deformed image of it   he added   If you just see the Biennale in those three days  you ll say the Biennale is a place for yachts  ImageThe Arsenale  a set of former shipbuilding workshops  is the other venue for the Biannale s main exhibition CreditAndrea Avezz La Biennale di VeneziaMr  Rugoff shrugged off the conspicuous wealth   Whether or not there s 10 yachts or 20 yachts parked near the Biennale  it doesn t really impede my experience   he said  Rich individuals were  a very small percentage  of Biennale visitors  he added  the vast majority  don t care who owns  the art  and  don t care whether the dealer sold it at the opening day or not  Mr  Rugoff grew up in Greenwich Village in New York  one of two sons of a film distributor  He recalled watching lots of movies as a boy  and being dragged to art galleries by his parents After studying semiotics at Brown University  he moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s   I had never smelled night blooming jasmine   he said   I thought   This is amazing  truly paradisiacal    Initially trying his luck at scriptwriting  he switched to journalism and to art criticism  the semiotics degree  he said with a chuckle   gave you the academic equivalent of street cred   By 1990  he had started curating on the side  After his first exhibition   Just Pathetic    about art that embodied failure   Mr  Rugoff recalled thinking   This is more fun than writing about someone else s show  He moved to London in 1998 and co curated the Serpentine Gallery s  The Greenhouse Effect  show in 2000  That year  he was hired to run San Francisco s C C A  Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts  and suddenly found himself able to  try out a lot of ideas  with several exhibition slots each year Six years later  he applied for the Hayward job  It was  a very  very big leap  from his six member San Francisco team  he said  The Hayward is part of the Southbank Centre  a multidisciplinary institution with a staff of about 500 people ImageMr  Rugoff s thoughtful programming at the Hayward Gallery has put the institution on London s contemporary art map CreditPoulomi Basu for The New York TimesIn 13 years at the Hayward  Mr  Rugoff has run the institution quietly and ambitiously  He has curated strong solo exhibitions  Ed Ruscha  Tracey Emin  Andreas Gursky  Carsten Hller   and programmed or curated group shows such as the 2008  Psycho Buildings   which turned a sculpture terrace at the gallery into a boating lake for an exhibition of artists  takes on architecture Hayward shows  are in a way essays  and are very idea rich   said Nicholas Serota  who was the Tate director from 1988 to 2017 and is now the chairman of Arts Council England  the organization that distributes public arts funding   He takes an idea and tries to explore the way in which artists have been addressing that idea  Mr  Rugoff also  responds very positively to artists whose ideas are slightly playful   Mr  Serota added  artists who  take a very serious subject and address it in a way which is with a light touch rather than heavy handed  Curating the Biennale has become challenging in the digital age  said Thierry Raspail  founder of the Lyon Biennale  which Mr  Rugoff curated in 2015   Before 1990  there was a kind of aura around the Venice Biennale  and a lot of good will  because of a global lack of information   he said   Today  there s a glut of information   making it hard to  announce something that s new  Recent Biennale curators haven t had it easy  The 2017 show  curated by Christine Macel   doesn t rise  doesn t cohere   wrote The New York Times s Holland Cotter   Thematic tension and critical drive are missing   Robert Storr  the 2007 curator  was described by Jerry Saltz in New York Magazine as having  abstained altogether from mounting one of the ball busting  conjectural  venturesome whales we call biennials  How will Mr  Rugoff do  There are always people who ve got an ax to grind  or people who ve got a point to make   Mr  Serota said   I think controversy is inevitable  whatever he did  In that sense  Mr  Serota said   he can t win  really   

WASHINGTON   President Trump welcomed Egypt s president  Abdel Fattah el Sisi  to the White House on Tuesday  and bestowed on his ally what he most eagerly sought  a ringing endorsement of his strongman rule Mr  el Sisi  64  a former general who took power in a military coup in 2013  is seeking to amend the Egyptian Constitution to allow him to run for two more six year terms  which would keep him in power until 2034 When Mr  Trump was asked about the amendments  he professed not to know anything about them  but declared   I can just tell you he s doing a great job  Great president  Mr  el Sisi s visit came on the same day that another key ally of Mr  Trump s in the Middle East  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  was facing voters in a tight election  In the weeks leading up to that vote  the president tried to shore up Mr  Netanyahu s fortunes with a series of gestures  chief among them American recognition of Israel s sovereignty over the Golan Heights It also came as Mr  Trump called a third ally  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia  who has been under a cloud since reports that he ordered the killing in October of a Saudi dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi Mr  Trump and Prince Mohammed discussed Saudi Arabia s  critical role  in stabilizing the region  the campaign to isolate Iran and  the importance of human rights issues   according to a White House statement For Egypt s leader  Mr  Trump offered only the trappings of an Oval Office welcome  though one with flashing cameras and looming boom mics  Back home  where Mr  el Sisi has methodically stifled dissent and tightened his grip on power  that could prove more than enough validation  The single and only reason for President Sisi to visit the White House right now is to obtain a strong endorsement from President Trump to stay in power   said Amy Hawthorne  the deputy director of research at the Project on Middle East Democracy   He has calculated that he can intimidate his opponents and potential opponents with a show of support from Trump  Before their session  Mr  Trump said the two men would discuss trade and counterterrorism  He said nothing publicly about Egypt s human rights record  which was always checkered but has deteriorated under Mr  el Sisi  who has brutally suppressed the Muslim Brotherhood and turned Egypt into a society in which a person can be arrested over an objectionable Facebook post  Mr  Trump s daughter Ivanka also met with Mr  el Sisi to discuss the empowerment of women Mr  Trump said nothing about several Americans currently detained in Egypt  Earlier in the day  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the issue with Mr  el Sisi  according to the State Department For his part  Mr  el Sisi said relations between Egypt and the United States had never been stronger   All the credit goes to you  Mr  President   he said through a translator   Thank you very much for your support on all fronts  In fact  some analysts said  the United States alliance with Egypt is at an awkward moment  Mr  Trump has focused most of his energy in the region on assembling an Israeli and Persian Gulf alliance against Iran ImageProtests near the White House on Tuesday over Mr  el Sisi s visit  In Egypt  Mr  el Sisi has methodically stifled dissent and tightened his grip on power CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times When you think of Trump s agenda in the Middle East  Egypt doesn t offer that much   said Brian Katulis  an expert on Egypt and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress   What s interesting to me is that Trump   who is always asking  what s in it for us     is even doing this meeting  Moreover  Egypt  which still receives roughly  1 3 billion a year in American military aid  recently agreed to buy 20 fighter jets from Russia  potentially exposing individual Egyptians to American sanctions Mr  Trump s decision on the Golan Heights rankled Egyptian officials  as did his earlier order to move the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  Both moves run counter to the spirit of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel  brokered 40 years ago by President Jimmy Carter They could also make it harder for Mr  el Sisi to voice wholehearted public support for the Israeli Palestinian peace plan being drafted by Mr  Trump s son in law and senior adviser  Jared Kushner The administration has said it would present the plan sometime after the Israeli elections  but the White House  like the Israeli public  will have to await the results of Tuesday s vote to determine whether Mr  Netanyahu or his opponent Benny Gantz  are able to form a governing coalition There is less suspense in Egyptian politics these days  Analysts said Mr  el Sisi s constitutional amendments  which also include a provision that would expand the military s role  have drawn no public enthusiasm  But the electoral system is set up so that they can prevail with a simple majority even if voter turnout is low To coincide with Mr  Sisi s visit  his critics began an online petition on Tuesday to oppose the amendments  The website was quickly blocked inside Egypt  the government has previously blocked several other independent or critical websites or online publications But the petition remained accessible outside Egypt and the website counter indicated that more than 67 000 people had endorsed it   a number that could not be confirmed  Egypt has permitted almost no public criticism of the proposals or organizing against them  but street signs urging a  yes  vote are common in Cairo  These amendments were cooked up inside the regime   Ms  Hawthorne said   They ve had only Potemkin debates about them  President Barack Obama kept Mr  el Sisi at a distance  But it was his second White House invitation from Mr  Trump  who has obviously established a rapport with him  At a meeting in Saudi Arabia in May 2017  the two lavished praise on each other  with Mr  Trump even declaring   Love your shoes  Boy  those shoes  Some of Mr  Trump s affection may be explained by his general affinity for strongmen  At a recent speech to Republican supporters  the president recalled an exchange he claimed to have had with President Xi Jinping of China  who  like Mr  el Sisi  pushed for an extension of his term Mr  Trump said he referred to Mr  Xi as a king  which prompted the Chinese leader to demur that he was only a president  I said  No  you re president for life  and therefore you re king    Mr  Trump said he replied If Mr  el Sisi succeeds in his drive to extend his term  he would serve as Egypt s president until the age of 80   unless he changes the Constitution again  

TOLEDO  Ohio   Lots of workplaces have a hot seat  At the Jeep assembly plant in Toledo  Ohio  there is a  sweet seat  In the production line where Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicles are made at the rate of about one a minute  a panel must be screwed into the bottom of the vehicle  It used to be back breaking work for two union members to carry the panel and screw it on as the vehicle moved down the line  Occasionally  they would miss screws Now two workers sit comfortably on adjacent chairs that follow the vehicle  Lasers point out where the screws go  reducing errors  What is remarkable about the so called  sweet seat  at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV s Toledo plant is that like many other innovations here  it originated with United Auto Workers union members on the factory floor  Production workers here create proposals to simplify tasks that are  too heavy or too hard   said millwright Greg Harman  who is on a team of 10 UAW workers that implements those ideas  A handful of automakers have adopted aspects of a similar system  pioneered by Japan s Toyota Motor Corp  The uncommon level of union collaboration with Fiat Chrysler  FCA  management in Toledo offers a road map for union negotiations this summer with Detroit s Big 3  FCA  General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co  According to officials at the automakers  their key focus in this year s contract talks will be on productivity and profitability in the face of an anticipated downturn in vehicle sales and non unionized competition from the likes of Toyota  Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Volkswagen AG That clashes with union demands to maintain healthcare benefits and boost job security  and comes on the heels of GM s warning that it could shutter a car factory in Lordstown  Ohio  along with three other UAW represented plants  GM S move drew harsh criticism from President Donald Trump  and prompted the UAW s new president to bulk up the strike fund   serving notice the union is not afraid of a fight over jobs At a time when national UAW membership fell 8 percent in 2018 after rising for nine consecutive years  and has failed to organize a single U S  assembly plant owned by a European or Asian automaker  FCA s Toledo plant has more than tripled its workforce to 5 700 workers since 2009  For a graphic  click https   tmsnrt rs 2I4S0waThe biggest reason  Americans  love with the Wrangler and other high margin SUVs The Wrangler became so hot that FCA started running the plant virtually round the clock  So UAW Local 12  which represents workers at the Toledo plant  pushed for a flexible system under which workers could choose to work between four and seven days per week   a first for any FCA plant  Temporary workers fill in the gaps  and Local 12 sought more protections for those workers  including providing a clear path to full time employment status  Our members went way  way  way beyond the call of duty to provide what the company s needs were   said Mark Epley  the plant s union chairman   It s a competitive market out there and we know that any plant can be taken away at any time  Thanks largely to its success at FCA  UAW Local 12 has hit a 40 year high in membership through organizing workers at many other companies in the area  including a Dana Inc plant where workers make Wrangler axles SANTA ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE Success at Toledo took years to build  A decade ago  when the former Chrysler Corp was going through its government funded bankruptcy  Toledo had a reputation as the automaker s worst run plant  As Italian automaker Fiat S p A took control of the Chrysler  then Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne turned to Fiat executive Mauro Pino with a challenge  which legacy U S  Chrysler plant should they use as a proving ground for what Fiat called  World Class Manufacturing   a version of Toyota s lean production strategy but adapted to the Italian automaker s culture Pino chose Toledo with the idea of turning the worst performing plant into the best  He had two years to prove he could turn the plant around  he told Reuters in an interview outside Cleveland  where he now runs an Eaton Corp aircraft parts plant Pino found a workforce of around 1 700 people  demoralized by Chrysler s bankruptcy  The plant produced just over 140 000 vehicles in 2009  He began working to win the workers  trust  He dressed as Santa Claus before Christmas 2010 and handed out candy canes to workers on the line  greeting each by name  workers at the plant recall  Pino also pushed for more productivity but did so by asking workers how they would redesign their own cumbersome jobs      Usually you need to convince people to change  but when they saw what we were doing they started coming to us   he said   The new system gave everyone a voice   said Cheryl Reash  a 36 year worker at the plant  Tracy Seymour  also at the plant nearly 36 years  said the team of 10 millwrights   a team started by Pino   came up with a system for parts kits that eliminated the need for vast amounts of inventory on the line  That made it possible for workers to build 10 different engine types without having to bend over  lift heavy objects or walk off the line in search of parts  I wouldn t run without their equipment   Seymour said   It would be impossible  RUNNING HOTOver time  workers and managers at Toledo worked to unplug bottlenecks up and down the assembly line   Why we succeed and exceed is that union and management came together   Seymour said Soaring customer demand for sport utility vehicles also helped the Toledo plant  As workers cranked out around 500 000 Wrangler and Jeep Cherokee SUVs annually from 2014 to 2016  the plant s two production lines began running at well over 100 percent capacity  according to data from AutoForecast Solutions  This level of capacity utilization is rare in the industry Still  Fiat Chrysler could not keep up with demand in both the United States and in the 105 countries where the Toledo made Wrangler is sold To ease the crunch  the company proposed moving the Cherokee to another factory so Toledo could make more Wranglers  In return  Local 12 was promised another new product  Baumhower said the local accepted the move based on that promise The plant is now ramping up production of the Gladiator pickup truck  which shares many parts with the Wrangler and is getting glowing reviews in the automotive media But while FCA s Toledo success shows what can happen when a Detroit automaker and its union work together  it also shows how a strong local can also punch back  In February 2018  for instance  Local 12 publicly protested an FCA plan to replace 88 UAW represented truck drivers with contractors  forcing the company to back down  We re good at getting along if you want to get along   said Bruce Baumhower  who has been president of Local 12 for 26 years   And we can fight all day if you want to pick a fight    Reporting By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman  Editing by Joseph White and Edward

VALLDEMOSSA  Spain   Majorca has long been a haven for the Spanish royals  Juan Carlos  the former king  and his family have their vacation palace on the island  and local business dignitaries even once bought the monarch a luxury yacht So it might seem odd that residents of the island town of Valldemossa  population 2 000   where Juan Carlos holds the title of honorary mayor   were asked to vote in a straw poll last Sunday on whether Spain should retain the monarchy or become a republic The nonbinding poll  sponsored by a local political party  was held without an official census and at a makeshift polling station next to the food and handicraft stalls of Valldemossa s weekend market  The removal of the monarchy was approved by 97 votes to 25  with one person casting a blank vote ImageTourists mostly visit Valldemossa to see its medieval monastery  in which the composer Frdric Chopin and the writer George Sand spent a winter in the 1830s CreditSamuel Aranda for The New York

month  called by the Socialist government after its national budget was rejected  At the same time  Spain is struggling with a secessionist challenge in the northeastern region of Catalonia  What really matters is that we re now finally able to discuss openly the role of the monarchy   said Ddac Alcal i Villa  who represents the organizing party  known as  The Valldemossa We Want  and who is in charge of the town s education and culture  Similar votes were scheduled for Sunday in several other towns on the island  following Valldemossa s lead The Spanish royal family returned to the throne in 1975 when Juan Carlos became king two days after the death of Gen  Francisco Franco ended a long period of dictatorship  But two years earlier  the authorities in Majorca  knowing of Juan Carlos s fondness for sailing and their island  offered to convert a palace called Marivent into his vacation home  even though the property s former owner had bequeathed it to become a museum

a referendum on secession in October 2017 even though it had been declared unconstitutional  Former Catalan separatist leaders are now on trial before the Spanish Supreme Court  accused of staging a rebellion in their effort to declare independence The fight over independence has split Catalan society down the middle  and in Majorca and the rest of the Balearic archipelago  where the Catalan language is also spoken  nationalist parties have been gaining votes  Even if our situation isn t comparable to that of Catalonia  it could become so in a few years if we don t put a brake on this   said Xavier Pericay  a regional lawmaker who helped found Ciudadanos  a centrist party that has led the fight against Catalan secessionism   The republicans and the separatists might appear to focus on different issues  but they are pursuing the same goal  which is to scrap anything that represents the power of the state   he added Separatists and anti royal militants also found common ground after Felipe stepped into the Catalan conflict in October 2017  accusing the region s separatist leaders of  inadmissible disloyalty  after holding the referendum  which took place amid clashes between the Spanish police and voters   The king made a decisive intervention in Catalonia  but that of course helped bring together those who agitate against the monarchy and those who have pushed for an independence referendum   Mr  Pericay said Some voters in Valldemossa said they wanted to remove the monarchy as an outdated institution  but had no desire for Majorca to split from Spain  They also noted that people had already taken to the streets across the country in 2014 to demand a referendum on the monarchy after King Juan Carlos announced his abdication  Removing the monarchy is about having a modern state   said Mr  Alcal i Villa  calling it a broader issue  over which there is more consensus than any territorial question   

Each week  we review the week s news  offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry  Want this newsletter in your inbox  Sign up here Hi  I m Jamie Condliffe  Greetings from London  Here s a look at the week s tech news Mark Zuckerberg has a vision that he d like Congress to share Lawmakers seem to agree that there are too few tech companies with too much power  and that Big Tech needs to be regulated  What they can t agree on is how do it  Break companies up  tax them more  apply privacy rules  remove liability protections  The list goes on  There are lots of options  none particularly well developed  and little consensus on what might work Mr  Zuckerberg  the chief executive of Facebook  appeared to take advantage of this when he made his own proposal for regulation in a Washington Post op ed  According to Corynne McSherry  the legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation  a digital rights group  Mr  Zuckerberg s proposals were  an effort to get ahead  of the many suggestions already on the table and  shape what happens down the pike  The proposals were not earth shattering  most had been suggested by policymakers already  or even put into effect in other parts of the world  But Mr  Zuckerberg fleshed them out into one of the more actionable calls for tech regulation that we ve yet seen They may seem like an appealing first draft of the rules to some lawmakers  An obvious question is  Should they be  Legislation is written by legislators  and that is what they re elected to do   no industry can replace that   said Jason Oxman  the chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council  a trade association  He added that  the tech industry will want to make its voice heard   and that  it s certainly our hope that Congress will balance a need to encourage innovation  with issues like maintaining privacy Ms  McSherry said she was  very concerned  about the idea that policymakers might look to the chief executives of Silicon Valley for guidance on what they should do  It s sort of asking the foxes how best to guard the henhouse   she said My colleague Mike Isaac read between the lines of what Mr  Zuckerberg wrote  And all of his proposals appear to suggest regulation that would strengthen Facebook   by allowing Facebook to squash competitors  say  or better enable it to meld its main platform with its other properties  Instagram and WhatsApp If regulation is to genuinely curb Big Tech s power  Congress may be better served by spending less time on theatrical tech C E O  testimony and more time listening to the technologists who built the systems they re trying to regulate and to the people who use them Fooling A I  at the wheelDon t panic  but some stickers could help run an autonomous car off the road Driverless cars use artificial intelligence  often based on so called neural networks  to interpret camera images  Such software can identify a stop sign  But small visual tweaks to an object  barely observable to humans  can fire connections in neural networks to convince them they re looking at something else  like a speed limit sign Researchers from the Keen Security Lab  part of the technology company Tencent  reported that a similar trick forced an autonomous car to switch lanes  Tesla s Autopilot software  they showed  uses only camera data to detect lanes  and small visual tweaks to a road surface could cause its neural networks to think road markings were veering  In tests  stickers on a road caused a Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode to swerve into another lane Tesla said in a statement that  a driver can easily override Autopilot at any time by using the steering wheel or brakes and should always be prepared to do so  But it demonstrates the fragility of current A I   You would expect the system to behave robustly   said Marta Kwiatkowska  a professor of computing systems at the University of Oxford   If you change the input very slightly  the output should change only very slightly  Solving the problem isn t just about improving A I  The entire system needs to be made more robust by creating additional checks using other sensors  Ms  Kwiatkowska said   We need to engineer these systems better   she said With harmful content  it s complicatedThere s a lot of awful stuff online  Not liking it is easy  Actually overcoming it is hard Silicon Valley workers are aware of the problem  On Tuesday  Bloomberg published a report that said YouTube executives had ignored employee proposals to  change recommendations and curb conspiracies   Their suggestions were reportedly  sacrificed for engagement  Executives  like YouTube s chief product officer  Neal Mohan  insist that the algorithms may be designed to keep people watching but not to recommend things like extremist content  even if that s what they end up doing  After all  it  doesn t monetize   he said  because advertisers  don t want to be associated with this sort of content  But recommend they do  so calls for rules that force content takedowns are unsurprising  The most recent  a law passed in Australia on Thursday  which threatens big fines for companies if they fail to swiftly remove violent material Sadly  it may not be that easy to solve the whole harmful content problem   First  defining  harmful  is a minefield  As Ms  McSherry of the Electronic Frontier Foundation put it to me  one person s harmful content can be another s political expression   That feeds a second issue  In the United States  moves toward mandatory takedowns of specific kinds of content could quickly run afoul of the First Amendment   Third  the technical challenge is huge  Tech companies have struggled for years to do it with the most troubling of content  and promises that A I  will solve the problem have yet to bear fruit None of this excuses the proliferation of harmful content online  But it helps explain why progress is so slow And some stories you shouldn t

WASHINGTON   Attorney General William P  Barr vowed on Tuesday to release a redacted version of the Mueller report  within a week   defending his handling of the special counsel investigation s findings as a bid for transparency as Democrats accused him of politically motivated behavior Mr  Barr said he would explain his redactions and was open to negotiating with lawmakers about revealing some of the delicate information that he and law enforcement officials are blacking out from the highly anticipated report before he sends it to Congress and the public  This process is going along very well  and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid April stands   Mr  Barr said at a House budget hearing   And so I think that from my standpoint  within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public   Read Mr  Barr s top takeaways from the Mueller report  But he was less forthcoming about aspects of his review  declining to say whether President Trump had been briefed on the report after Justice Department and White House officials had said for weeks that the president has not been updated on its contents  And he did not explain why he cleared Mr  Trump of committing an obstruction of justice offense when Mr  Mueller s team declined to make a decision Democrats assailed Mr  Barr s decision to send a four page letter to Congress in March outlining the main findings of the investigation by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  pointing to complaints by members of the special counsel s team that Mr  Barr failed to fully portray the extent of how damaging their conclusions might be for Mr  Trump  The American people have been left with many unanswered questions  serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report   said Representative Jos E  Serrano  Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department Mr  Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the  bottom line  conclusions from Mr  Mueller s inquiry into Russia s election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired  as well as whether President Trump tried to impede the inquiry  He said that Mr  Mueller declined an opportunity to read his March 24 letter before Mr  Barr sent it to lawmakers  And Mr  Barr warned that trying to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism  I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize   Mr  Barr said   because I think any summary  regardless of who prepares it  not only runs the risk of being under inclusive or over inclusive  but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once  Mr  Barr pushed back on Democrats  complaints that they did not have the report  reminding them that they would be able to read it in days  And as for his four page letter  he suggested that had he not written it  lawmakers would have bitterly complained if they were given no information or insight into Mr  Mueller s conclusions during the redaction process  In my judgment  it was important for people to know the bottom line conclusions of the report while we worked on necessary redactions to make the whole thing available   said Mr  Barr  adding that he anticipated that the redactions would take weeks The back and forth came during an unusually contentious House appropriations subcommittee hearing  where Mr  Barr also defended the Trump administration s hardening stance on immigration and the Justice Department s decision to stand down rather than appeal a federal judge s decision to strike down the Affordable Care Act Mr  Barr also revealed that the Justice Department inspector general  Michael E  Horowitz  is wrapping up an examination of parts of the Russia investigation  including accusations that law enforcement officials abused their powers to wiretap Carter Page  a former Trump campaign adviser  Mr  Horowitz could reveal the results as early as May or June  Mr  Barr said Though Democrats have for weeks demanded to see the full text of the Mueller report and all underlying investigative materials  Mr  Barr reminded them that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Monica Lewinsky scandal  In 1998  Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence  including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation Under the current regulations  the special counsel delivers a confidential report of investigative decisions to the attorney general  who is free to decide what to release  I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can   Mr  Barr said To that end  Mr  Barr repeated his promise that lawmakers would receive a redacted report in mid April and that he would testify about its contents soon afterward  He said that he would identify which of four categories redacted material fell into   secret grand jury testimony  classified information  materials that could affect current investigations and information about peripheral third parties  Those were the same types of information that Democrats have fought to protect when Republicans tried to obtain documents from the Justice Department Though Mr  Barr said he was open to negotiating whether the department could share some of the redacted details after releasing the report  he took a harder line on grand jury testimony  While Congress can request it in the context of a legal proceeding  he said he was not obligated to honor such a request Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  said that once he received the redacted report  he would issue a subpoena for the complete document and petition a court for the grand jury testimony  If it doesn t have everything we require to do our work  which is to say the entire report and underlying evidence in it  we will issue subpoenas forthwith   Mr  Nadler told reporters on Tuesday Democrats were taking other steps to try to get ahold of information pertinent to the Russia investigation  Representative Adam B  Schiff  Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  told reporters later on Tuesday that he believed requirements that the intelligence agencies regularly update their congressional oversight committees on significant developments could allow a side door view into the findings of Mr  Mueller and the investigators who worked with him Mr  Schiff said he had made a request along those lines in recent weeks but had not yet received a response Justice Department officials have said that they have not shared the report or briefed the White House on its contents  so the demurral raised the possibility that the situation had shifted  Mr  Barr is likely to be pressed on the matter on Wednesday  when he is scheduled to testify before Senate appropriators Mr  Barr visited Capitol Hill to answer questions about the Justice Department s proposed  29 2 billion budget for the next fiscal year  which includes money for 100 new judges for immigration courts  which are part of the department  not the judicial system He also echoed the president s increasingly hard line stance on immigration  which has touched off a purge of Department of Homeland Security officials who Mr  Trump believes impeded his goal of shutting the southwestern border entirely Mr  Barr called the situation along the border with Mexico  unprecedented  and said that part of the Justice Department s request for an additional  72 1 million for immigration enforcement would pay for the new immigration judges to tackle a backlog of cases Democrats  who see health care as one of their top campaign issues  also assailed Mr  Barr and the Justice Department for declining to appeal a Texas judge s decision to strike down the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that the sweeping health care law was unconstitutional Under fire for the decision  Mr  Barr said   I m a lawyer  I m not in charge of health care   But his comment belied the fact that his refusal to defend a law on the books can effectively shape policy While Mr  Barr would not disclose any discussions with Mr  Trump over the health care law  he said that he would follow the wishes of the president so long as his request was legally defensible  

CHRISTCHURCH  New Zealand   On a small farm on the outskirts of Christchurch in New Zealand  Omar Nabi digs a small hole and sharpens a knife as he prepares to slaughter a sheep as a blessing to his father   a victim of the mass killings at the Al Noor mosque Hunched between his father s collection of rusted cars  Nabi softly said a prayer and slit the animal s neck  facing it towards Mecca  He removed the pelt and prepared the meat for cooking  Blood was pooled in a hole where he plans to plant a tree  No part of the animal was wasted  he said Nabi first slaughtered a sheep when he was 11  each step supervised by his father  Nabi is now 43  My father was my whole life    I give thanks for my father  he s done a lot   he said  His father  Haji Daoud Nabi  had hoped to build a small mosque on the property  a plan his son intends to complete   This means a lot to me  Dad put a piece of heaven in Christchurch  Several weeks after an attack on Muslim worshippers that killed fifty people and left dozens wounded  the lives of survivors and the families of victims have changed irrevocably  Some survivors feel emboldened  others are haunted by memories of the attack and haven t been able to return to the mosque Burying loved ones brought relief to many families  but reminders of their losses are never far away  from an empty seat at a dinner table to the prospect of Ramadan celebrations in a few weeks The shootings on March 15 shook New Zealand and prompted the government to tighten gun laws and launch a powerful national inquiry into the country s worst peacetime massacre  An Australian man  a suspected white supremacist  has been charged with 50 murders and 39 attempted murders  For a photo essay of survivors of the attack and victim s families  please click this link  https   reut rs 2WSIG1M IN LIMBOSurvivor Mark Rangi  59  feels his future is in limbo following wounds to both legs  The New Zealander  who lives in Sydney  had never been to Al Noor Mosque before the attack After visiting relatives in a nearby town  he had attended the mosque before his return flight to Sydney so he could seek spiritual guidance on the direction of his life  Instead  he ended up running for his life  bleeding heavily from shrapnel wounds in his legs  After surgery  he is able to walk slowly but Rangi is doubtful he can return to work as a baggage handler in Sydney  I wouldn t have a clue  what to do now   I want to be independent   he said from a youth hostel where he is staying  overlooking piles of flowers placed in a makeshift memorial   I m very lucky that I didn t get injured worse  so I m grateful for that  SOMETHING S MISSINGIn a one storey house a short drive from Al Noor mosque  Zahra Fathy turned pages in a photo album compiled by her husband Hussein Moustafa  who died in the massacre  As part of the customary four month and 10 day mourning period  she wears simple  unadorned clothing and spends most of her time at home  It s hard to stay thinking about what happened  so I have to escape this and think about what s next   she said Her husband had spent time at the mosque on most days  organizing its library of religious texts and tending to a vegetable garden  which provided the community with pumpkins  rocket and broccoli She is now considering visiting her extended family in Alexandria  Egypt  where she and her husband both grew up  for Ramadan  Being all on your own during Ramadan is tough   said her son  Mohammed  who flew home from a new job in Saudi Arabia on learning of his father s death After some trepidation  Mohammed worshipped last Friday at the Al Noor mosque for the first time since his father s death  I m praying in the same area  the same corner that my dad used to pray  I wanted to do that   he said   It was a bit emotional at first  I got a few tears  it was quite tough  I kept imagining him next to me  I kept looking around  looking for the bullet holes  Before Ramadan  Zahra and her family plan to mark the graduation of her youngest son  Zeyad  22  who also returned to Christchurch from a new job  in Canberra   He was very  very proud of you   Zahra told her son The family had an active WhatsApp messaging group to stay in touch  Zeyad had shared a recent trip to Europe  where his father had also traveled as a young man  and to Egypt  His father had provided long history lessons on the places Zeyad visited and was overjoyed his son was meeting his Egyptian relatives  Now  the WhatsApp group is not so active  It feels like something s missing  It s hard to explain  I think it just feels weird if we use it   Zeyad said SENSE OF MISSIONIn a sleepy Christchurch suburb where he owns a homeopathy business  Farid Ahmed has worked to bring his community and his country together  Farid  a wheelchair user  survived the shooting but his wife Husna was killed He spent one recent Sunday going door to door to thank his neighbors for their support  When his neighbors heard of his wife s death   they came running    they were in tears   he said   That was wonderful support and expression of love  His message of forgiveness and peace to avoid  a heart that is boiling like a volcano  has made headlines around the world and was broadcast in a heartfelt speech at a national memorial service  I admire him  I couldn t do that   said a neighbor  a Christian who lives four doors down   We ve learnt a lot about Islam over the last few days   it s  crazy how similar our two faiths are  COPINGAcross the city  survivor Sardar Faisal has thrown himself with vigor into helping co ordinate dozens of volunteers who prepare meals and run errands for the widows of victims of the attack  As a result  he realized he was not spending much time with his own wife and young children  Maybe it s survivor s guilt  maybe it s empathy because whenever I visit the affected families  the only thing I think about is that when I was in that area  they were being shot  the bullets that I heard   he said over tea at a friend s house On the day of the shootings  Faisal was late to the mosque  an uncharacteristic trait that possibly spared his life  When the gunman burst in and started shooting worshippers at prayer  Faisal was in the bathroom  just about to wash in preparation for prayer and so was able to hide from the gunman What he saw and heard that day haunts him  he said  He struggles to focus at work and suffers nightmares as deadly scenarios  almost like a video game  run on repeat through his sleep REBORNAlongside sorrow and pain  others feel the close call has reinvigorated their lives  It gave me courage   said Hazem Mohammed  originally from Baghdad  who played dead in Al Noor mosque as the gunman stood over him  wounded and surrounded by the bodies of fellow worshippers   I cry for two reasons  The first half because I lost friends  they are gone   he said   And the other tears  these tears are for joy  because I was reborn again on Friday the 15th of March 2019    Reporting by Charlotte Greenfield and Edgar Su in Christchurch  additional reporting by Jill Gralow  Natasha Howitt and Tom Westbrook  Editing by Neil Fullick  

CHARGED The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration By Emily BazelonIf you aspired to high office in the 20th and early 21st centuries  this was sound advice  Get thee to a prosecutor s office  Politicians from both parties  from Democrats like John Kerry to Republicans like Rudolph Giuliani  parlayed prosecutorial perches into political power and nationwide fame The basic recipe for using a prosecutor s post as a springboard into politics required being  tough on crime   protecting the public by putting criminals behind bars  The vast majority of state and local prosecutors in the United States are elected  and taking a punitive tack was generally considered to be the path to re election   and  frequently  election to higher office  Prosecutors had strong incentives to be harsh rather than lenient  or merciful  when dealing with defendants  and those incentives helped shape the criminal justice system as we know it today  In the words of the law professor and historian Jed Shugerman  a scholar of prosecutors turned politicians   The emergence of the prosecutor s office as a steppingstone for higher office  has had  dramatic consequences in American criminal law and mass incarceration  These consequences are on full display in  Charged  The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration   by Emily Bazelon  a lecturer at Yale Law School and staff writer at The New York Times Magazine  In  Charged   a persuasive indictment of prosecutorial excess  Bazelon argues that the lawyers who work in the more than 2 000 prosecutors  offices around the country   conducting investigations  filing criminal charges and trying cases  or  much more commonly  striking plea bargains    bear much of the responsibility for over incarceration  conviction of the innocent and other serious problems of the criminal justice system ImageEmily BazelonCreditNina Subin We often think of prosecutors and defense lawyers as points of a triangle on the same plane  with the judge poised above them  equal contest  level playing field  neutral arbiter   Bazelon writes  But this is a misconception  As the Brooklyn district attorney  Eric Gonzalez  puts it to her   It s all about discretion  Do you authorize the arrest  request bail  argue to keep them in jail or let them out  go all out on the charges or take a plea bargain  Prosecutors decide  especially  who gets a second chance  To show how prosecutorial power operates in the real world  Bazelon follows two young defendants through the system  Kevin  a pseudonym   a 20 year old from the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn who is charged with illegal gun possession  and Noura Jackson  a teenager from Memphis who is accused of murdering her mother Their cases are very different   one involving a victimless crime  the other the most heinous crime of all   and so are the district attorneys  Kevin s prosecutor is Gonzalez  an aspiring reformer and the first Latino to serve as Brooklyn s district attorney  while Noura s is Amy Weirich  a hard charging attorney in the traditional law and order mold  Bazelon uses these contrasting cases to demonstrate that having the right  or wrong  prosecutor can make a huge difference   between justice tempered with mercy and grave injustice Bazelon tells the tales of Noura and Kevin in rich  novelistic prose  which at its best puts one in mind of Adrian Nicole LeBlanc s book  Random Family   2003   about a troubled family from the Bronx in the grip of the criminal justice system  Consider the opening to Noura s story  the most gripping section of  Charged    The blood was everywhere  Spattered on the floor of the hallway  on the doorframe of the bedroom and on the bedposts  Soaked into the sheets and pillows  and covering the body splayed on the floor at the foot of the bed  Jennifer Jackson was naked  Her face was covered by a wastepaper basket  Her chest and torso and hands were slashed  the pale skin torn by the blade of a knife  She d been stabbed a total of 50 times  Bazelon interweaves Kevin s and Noura s stories with a remarkable amount of academic research by law professors  criminologists and other social scientists  The endnotes  replete with charts and graphs  run to more than 50 pages and acknowledge intellectual debts to such thinkers as Angela J  Davis  Paul Butler  Michelle Alexander and William Stuntz  This combination of powerful reporting with painstaking research yields a comprehensive examination of the modern American criminal justice system that appeals to both the head and the heart The study of criminal justice is the study of power  and as a veteran legal journalist  Bazelon has long been concerned with this theme  Her last book   Sticks and Stones   explored the culture of bullying and painted a nuanced portrait  rejecting a simple dichotomy between blameworthy bullies and innocent victims   Charged  is considerably less balanced   in  say  its discussion of plea bargaining  which Bazelon  convincingly  asserts is used to excess without sufficiently acknowledging its necessary role in the system  or of pro prosecutor rulings by the Supreme Court  which she analyzes almost entirely from a public policy perspective with little focus on their legal reasoning  This could cause readers who do not share Bazelon s politics to dismiss her core argument  But to the extent that it s a polemic   Charged  reflects its author s passion for her subject   As a journalist   she writes   I ve never felt a greater sense of urgency about exposing the roots of a problem and shining a light on the people working to solve it  ImageBazelon doesn t go easy on prosecutors  but at the same time she believes that American prosecution can heal itself  Discussing a group of young  diverse  reform minded prosecutors whom she calls  the New D A s   she argues that  prosecutors also hold the key to change  They can protect against convicting the innocent  They can guard against racial bias  They can curtail mass incarceration   In a lengthy appendix  she offers  21 Principles for 21st Century Prosecutors   a road map for those interested in reducing incarceration and increasing fairness in the justice system Which of Bazelon s two visions for the future of American prosecution will carry the day  a continuation of the deplorable status quo or a revolution in fairness led by  the New D A s   Recent developments offer reason to be hopeful  As was true of the factors that led us to the current sad state of affairs  it s all about incentives The movement to reform the criminal justice system enjoys support from across the political spectrum  from Black Lives Matter activists trying to protect minority communities to libertarians like the Koch brothers troubled by government overspending  In December  Donald Trump  who campaigned for the presidency on a law and order platform  signed the First Step Act  a bipartisan package of sentencing and prison condition reforms This broader criminal justice reform reflects  and also contributes to  changing views of prosecutors  No longer simply the women and men who wear the  white hats   prosecutors today are seen   and properly so   as major players in the criminal justice system who can do great harm as well as good As a result  in some cases  a prosecutor s record is no longer a political asset but a liability  or at least a mixed blessing  Take Kamala Harris  whose stints as San Francisco s district attorney and California s attorney general fueled her rise to the United States Senate  She now finds her quest for the Democratic presidential nomination complicated by decisions she made in her past positions  She has come under attack largely for having been too aggressive as a prosecutor  a historical novelty in American politics If prosecutorial service is no longer a golden ticket to a successful political career  then being a prosecutor could lose some of its luster to young lawyers seeking power and prestige  Perhaps that s a good thing  In these often overlooked but incredibly important posts  we need people committed to advancing the interests of justice  not just their own ambitions  

Growing up in central Connecticut in the 1980s  Joshua Siegel loved everything about flying  He couldn t afford flying lessons  let alone his own plane  but he kept dreaming By his 20s  he had achieved some financial success and was able to take advantage of a new tax deduction meant to spur private plane sales in the aftermath of the Sept  11 terrorist attacks Using the tax break  he deducted the entire cost of a new Cessna more quickly than he could have otherwise   five years versus 20 years or more  The plane was restricted to business use  but it fulfilled a childhood dream for virtually no money  My cost to fly  between 2001 and 2005  was free   he said  After that  he sold the plane  and had to pay tax on the sale The deduction   known as bonus depreciation   was enhanced in Republican lawmakers  sweeping tax overhaul  which was meant to strengthen manufacturing by offering a tax break to any business that invested in equipment or machinery  But because it also allowed the full cost of a plane to be deducted in the first year of ownership  it has bolstered sales of new and used planes Shipments of general aviation aircraft rose nearly 5 percent in 2018 from the year before  according to data from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association  an industry trade group Mr  Siegel  now the chief executive of StoneCastle Partners  which invests in community banks  said he used the tax deduction to buy a used plane last year and was planning to use it again when he takes delivery of a 2019 Cirrus SR20  which cost  600 000  Better still  the tax break is structured so that most of his plane costs  like fuel and maintenance  will be deductible  too The tax deduction s benefits are twofold First  it allows a business to deduct the cost of the machinery  dollar for dollar  in one year  Typically  business equipment is amortized over a multiyear schedule  which is calculated based on how long the equipment might last  a formula known as useful life Second  the updated version extends the deduction to used equipment  In theory  some people might trade up to something newer  while others might buy something used that they would not have bought otherwise ImageAnthony Edwards  in a scene from the 2013 television series  Zero Hour   is a certified pilot CreditPatrick Harbron ABCAdding used aircraft to the deduction has been a boon to sales  said Lewis Liebert  chief executive of Performance Flight  an aircraft training  management and chartering company  Buying used without bonus depreciation was a big reach for some people   he said It has also helped the aircraft market   The inventory of used aircraft was too high  and it created a disparity in value  that hurt sales of new planes  he said It may seem tantalizing to use this tax deduction as a way to get a free plane  but it s not that simple On the face of it  anyone can deduct 100 percent of a plane s purchase price and maintenance expenses if the plane is used for nonrecreational purposes or leased to a flight school  After the first year  to keep the deduction  the owner has to ensure that the plane is used at least 50 percent of the time for business Mr  Siegel said he put his used plane  a 2011 Cirrus  into a rental program through Performance Flight at Westchester County Airport in White Plains  and he intends to do the same with his new plane  This arrangement  called a lease back program  fulfills the Internal Revenue Service requirement on business use Thomas Rossomondo  a certified public accountant who works with FlyWealthServe  a consulting firm that specializes in aviation  said qualifying for bonus depreciation was more nuanced than it seemed To be able to deduct the full cost  for example  the owner could use the plane 50 percent of the time for business  25 percent for flight training and 25 percent for personal but non entertainment use  An example of the last one  he said  would be transporting relatives somewhere  a violation would be taking the same relatives to Disney World  There are gray areas   Mr  Rossomondo said  But he said that FlyWealthServe s clients wanted to be compliant because of the auditing risks associated with such a large deduction   They don t want to create red flags  over and above taking depreciation for a plane   he said If the I R S  finds an owner is not in compliance  the penalties are severe  The owner could lose the deduction and be required to depreciate the plane over a longer period  which could be five to seven years depending on the type of aircraft  said Jerald D  August  tax partner and head of the international tax and wealth planning practice group at Fox Rothschild  That substantially increases the cost paid for the plane  You need to be a stickler for record keeping   Mr  August said Additionally  not all states allow the same level of bonus depreciation that the federal government does  In Connecticut  someone buying a plane would not get a break the first year  but can depreciate the plane s cost over four years  said Michael D Addio  tax lawyer and principal at Marcum in New Haven ImageA tax break allows the owner of a plane to deduct its entire cost in one year if it is used for business CreditJoel Barhamand for The New York TimesAt the end of the plane s life  though  the owner could get hit with something called depreciation recapture  a term used for belatedly paying taxes that were deferred  Mr  Rossomondo said  Of course many plane owners might simply buy another plane and start the depreciation cycle all over again  Eventually  you re going to sell your last aircraft and you re going to have to recognize the gain   he said If the plane does not continue to be used at least 50 percent of the time for business  the owner may be subject to depreciation recapture before it is sold Aside from benefiting business owners and family offices with the means to buy planes  the loophole offers an advantage to recreational pilots who rent by the hour by providing new  safe planes to fly The actor Anthony Edwards  who played Goose to Tom Cruise s Maverick in the 1986 action movie  Top Gun   learned to fly a plane in 2011  25 years after the film made Navy fighter pilots cool  I am the guy who comes in and rents and makes it possible for others to buy planes   said Mr  Edwards  who takes lessons at Performance Flight   What impresses me is  there are new planes coming in  and as a pilot  you get to experience state of the art  Rentals start at  400 an hour  not cheap  but a far cry from the cost of buying a plane But as enticing the tax deduction is for some enthusiasts  others balk at the I R S  restrictions  Dr  Randall V  Ehrlich  an orthopedic surgeon who lives in Greenwich  Conn   and has three offices around New York  decided not to use the bonus depreciation incentive  He said he could fly to two of his offices more quickly than driving  but he did not like the constraints imposed by the deduction or the lease back structure  I might get out of the office early and might want to go fly  If the plane is being used by someone else  that would make me very unhappy   Dr  Ehrlich said   Or spur of the moment  we might fly down to Philadelphia for the afternoon  You lose some of the fun  Even without the lease back component  the tax deduction could still have allowed him to write off the full value of his plane  which cost about  800 000  if he used it just for business in the first year  But the I R S  rules are meant for pieces of equipment with a strict business use  not a Saturday jaunt to grab lunch But following the rules can provide an extra perk  rental income from the fight schools  I normally wouldn t have bought a new plane   Mr  Siegel said   I d buy a used plane  but now  with a new plane  there s significant income each month   

BEIJING   Whatever deal Washington and Beijing reach over the trade war  President Trump has already scored a big victory  Companies are rethinking their reliance on China  The two sides are nearing an agreement  with Mr  Trump saying on Thursday that an  epic  trade pact could be weeks away and that he may soon meet with President Xi Jinping  China s top leader  But already  spurred by tariffs and trade tensions  global companies are beginning to shift their supply chains away from China  just as some Trump administration officials had wanted  The move  known as decoupling  is a major goal of those who believe the world has grown far too dependent on China as a manufacturing giant  As Beijing builds up its military and extends its geopolitical influence  some officials fear that America s dependence on Chinese factories makes it strategically vulnerable  Now companies in a number of industries are reducing their exposure to China  GoPro  the mobile camera maker  and Universal Electronics  which makes sensors and remote controls  are shifting some work to Mexico  Hasbro is moving its toy making to the United States  Mexico  Vietnam and India  Aten International  a Taiwanese computer equipment company  brought work back to Taiwan  Danfoss  a Danish conglomerate  is changing the production of heating and hydraulic equipment to the United States Mr  Trump s victory in this department is not unalloyed  Despite his promises to bring jobs back to the United States  most of the work is shifting to other countries with lower costs  Reshaping global supply chains also takes time  and China will remain a vital manufacturing hub for decades to come Still  chief executives say the trade war has prompted a fundamental reassessment of China as the dominant place to make things  Even Chinese companies are expanding overseas  although they still have most of their production in China   China was the factory of the world   said Song Zhiping  the Communist Party chief at the China National Building Materials Group  a state owned giant   Things are changing  That s why Chinese companies are going out of China  A spokeswoman for the United States trade representative s office declined to comment While Mr  Trump portrays his trade fight as a clash over jobs  proponents of decoupling within the administration see the effort as a way of contending with a stronger  more aggressive China   Epic  China Trade Deal Near Completion  Trump Says  but Haggling ContinuesApril 4  2019Already  China dominates the market for items like solar panels  and has emerged as the world s largest producer of cars  car parts and many other sophisticated products  It plans to build jetliners  advanced computer chips  electric cars and other goods of the future Any deal is likely to leave in place new American tariffs on cars  aircraft parts  equipment for nuclear power plants and other items that administration officials see as essential for economic and security reasons  But more broadly  the trade hawks hope companies in other industries will also find friendlier countries in which to do business China emerged as a manufacturing powerhouse over the past two decades  The work force was low cost and relatively skilled  The Communist Party prevented the emergence of independent labor unions  Subcontractors abounded  meaning companies could strongly negotiate for lower supply costs  China built an extensive network of highways and rail lines  It has a vast and growing local customer base  meaning companies don t have to go far to sell their products  Businesses flocked there  China accounted for one quarter of the world s manufacturing by value last year  up from 8 percent in 2000  according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization The value created in China by manufacturing last year was bigger than in the United States  Germany and South Korea combined  But wages and other costs in China have been rising for years  A growing number of businesses complain that Chinese officials too often favor local competitors or don t do enough to stop intellectual property theft The prospect of more trade fights only adds to the reasons to diversify  which also include threats elsewhere like Mr  Trump s threat to close the border with Mexico and Britain s troubled exit from the European Union  Localization will matter more   Joe Kaeser  the chief executive of Siemens  one of Germany s largest conglomerates  said in an interview late last month on the sidelines of the China Development Forum in Beijing   You re more resilient to political discussions  China may not necessarily oppose some of the efforts to decouple  Beijing has long hoped to shed low skilled  polluting manufacturing jobs and move higher up the value chain   The total size of the work force is falling  the labor cost is rising and we are losing our competitive advantage in low cost industries   Miao Wei  China s minister of industry and information technology  said at the China Development Forum  He added that the country would focus instead on high tech  innovative industries  Still  Chinese officials must walk a fine line  As the country s economy slows  an abrupt shift of work out of China could lead to job losses and instability ImageCompanies around the world are trying to diversify their supply chains  which means relying less on Chinese exports CreditChinatopix  via Associated PressDecoupling efforts appear to be in their early stages  A broad survey by UBS of chief financial officers at export oriented manufacturers in China late last year found that a third had moved at least some production out of China in 2018  Another third intended to do so this year  The typical company was moving the production for about 30 percent of its exports  UBS found Companies now want to depend less on one place  which means looking for an alternative to China  Bill Winters  the chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank  said at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  this year   People who are concerned at the prospect of greater tariffs on Chinese exports  for example  are looking to move export facilities from China to other countries  including Chinese companies   Mr  Winters said  Countries seeking to displace China have begun pointing out that exports from their countries are less likely to face tariffs  For companies with operations in China   the trade war between the United States and China creates a new uncertainty   Airlangga Hartarto  Indonesia s minister of industry  said in an interview in Davos The ability to diversify depends on the industry  Some auto parts companies have run their American factories more hours each day to avoid tariffs on Chinese made goods  said Razat Gaurav  the chief executive of LLamasoft  a supply chain management company in Ann Arbor  Mich  By contrast  he said  manufacturers of smartphones and smartphone components   which have generally not been hit by Mr  Trump s tariffs   have found few places to move work because China dominates that supply chain  Still  some in that industry are shifting too  such as Sony s closure of a Beijing smartphone factory last month after expanding production in Thailand ImageChinese companies play a key role in the solar panel industry CreditGilles Sabrie for The New York TimesFor now  companies are looking for alternatives  Steve Madden  the shoe company  is moving production to Cambodia  Hasbro  the world s leading toymaker  has a goal for the end of next year  to be 60 percent out of China   by shifting production to the United States and elsewhere  Brian Goldner  the company s chairman and chief executive  said in a recent conference call  Though much of the work leaving China is going to other low cost countries  some companies are following Mr  Trump s suggestion that they move production to the United States Danfoss  a Danish maker of heating and cooling systems as well as sensors and transmitters  has seen rising costs in China  especially for skilled labor  said Kim Fausing  the company s chief executive and president  It is also looking for ways to reduce transportation related emissions of global warming gases When Danfoss bought an American heating systems company a year ago and found that the company had recently shifted some work to China  it acted quickly   The first thing we did after we acquired it was we moved everything back  to the United States  where Danfoss already had a dozen factories  Mr  Fausing said The first round of 25 percent tariffs that Mr  Trump put in place last July included hydraulic parts long manufactured by Danfoss in northeastern China  The company transferred production of these parts to the United States as well  There is not much of a difference between the costs in China and the United States   Mr  Fausing said   You have to have a very good case today to justify producing something in China and shipping it to the U S  Ana

BATON ROUGE  La    The Louisianans who were summoned to decide whether Grover Cannon killed a police officer were Asian  black  Hispanic and white  They were caregivers and engineers  state workers and self employed But Adrienne Harreveld  a law student working for the defense team in Mr  Cannon s death penalty trial  noticed something else  In a city with one of the South s largest public universities  not one member of last month s jury pool in East Baton Rouge Parish seemed all that young On Wednesday  court officials explained why  A  computer glitch  prevented the parish s jury database from updating properly  Since 2011  more than 150 000 people   including thousands born after June 2  1993   may have been inadvertently left off the jury rolls  potentially starving young defendants of jurors who were roughly their age Across the country  computer reliant jury coordinators have for years confronted database problems that kept otherwise eligible potential jurors from being called to the nation s courthouses  Although they are typically unintentional  such systematic exclusions raise constitutional concerns and threaten the integrity of the jury system  legal experts said  It is a vital government function that isn t that hard to get right  so it s at least a bit surprising to see errors today that you might think had been eliminated 20 years ago   said David N  Rosen  a lawyer who was involved in a jury selection debacle in the early 1990s in Connecticut   It counts as something that sounds hard to believe until you think a little more about it  and then it becomes all too easy to believe  In the Connecticut case  a truncated data field somehow identified all Hartford residents as dead  preventing them from being considered for federal juries  In Kent County  Mich   hundreds of thousands of people  many of them black  were not in contention for jury summonses in the early 2000s because a glitch led to only part of a master list being used to pick potential jurors  The Indiana Supreme Court in 2002 overturned a death sentence after  a flawed program  excluded nearly one third of a county s jury pool  And in the nation s capital  a programming error once kept Washingtonians with misdemeanor convictions from jury duty  I think they probably happen more frequently than we know about  but it s only rarely you can look out into the jury assembly room and say   There s something wrong right now    said Paula Hannaford Agor  the director of the Center for Jury Studies  a project of the National Center for State Courts About 15 percent of Americans are called for jury duty each year  their ranks drawn from sources like rosters of licensed drivers and registered voters  With millions of names in the mix  a decentralized legal system  and harried judges  clerks and lawyers trying to stem backlogs  researchers and court officials said jury database errors can happen at plenty of points along the way There can be input errors  they said  or miscrafted algorithms  There can be software limitations  wrongly clicked buttons and stale data   all seemingly innocuous snafus that carry constitutional implications in a society where the courts have long grappled with how juries can  and cannot  be constructed  The courts have  for example  set down restrictions on lawyers using race or gender to exclude potential jurors Age has been a trickier legal matter  even though some research suggests that jurors  ages can influence lawyers on both sides of a criminal case  Prosecutors  some researchers say  are more likely to seek older jurors  while defense lawyers often prefer younger ones Judge Ramona L  Emanuel had other worries  chiefly pretrial publicity  when she moved jury selection in Mr  Cannon s case four hours to the southeast of Caddo Parish  where Officer Thomas LaValley was killed in 2015  When Judge Emanuel picked East Baton Rouge Parish  home of the state capital  there was little obvious reason to believe that the local jury system was compromised or outdated But once potential jurors began reporting to the courthouse overlooking the Mississippi River for Mr  Cannon s trial  his defense team realized that people between the ages of 18 and 25 had not been called for the case or  for that matter  any other in East Baton Rouge Parish in recent years  This is not a small or insignificant omission   said Kerry Cuccia  a defense lawyer   It is an error of mammoth proportions  Court officials repeatedly testified on Wednesday that they did not know how thousands of names had been  stripped  from a computer server after routine database updates in 2013  2015 and 2017  But the error  however it occurred  left the parish working from a roster of potential jurors that had been assembled in 2011 Ann McCrory  the court s judicial administrator  said updated names had been  dumped into our system   but  without explanation   within a few weeks  they re gone  She and other officials denied any deliberate effort to exclude potential jurors  but they said an inquiry was underway  and that the system would ultimately be righted  I know what happened  I don t know how it happened yet   Gary Dower  the president of Judicial Systems  the Texas company that helped maintain the East Baton Rouge Parish jury database  said when he testified by telephone on Wednesday Prosecutors said the errors were not significant enough to warrant stopping the proceedings in Mr  Cannon s trial  which will be held in Shreveport once a jury is picked in Baton Rouge  There was absolutely no intent  no plan  no system to exclude   said Suzanne Williams  a prosecutor  who complained that the defense s focus on 18  to 25 year old residents was  arbitrary  But Mr  Cannon s lawyers insisted that under state and federal court precedents  a new jury pool should be empaneled   a step that could delay Mr  Cannon s trial for an uncertain period  He shouldn t have to go forward with this jury panel   another lawyer  Dwight M  Doskey  told Judge Emanuel on Wednesday afternoon as Mr  Cannon s khaki clad legs shook beneath the defense table   This trial should be stopped  Andrew Guthrie Ferguson  a law professor at the University of the District of Columbia  said that in a high profile  extraordinarily sensitive case like Mr  Cannon s  the backgrounds of jurors were particularly important  Younger jurors  he said  might more closely relate to the defendant and his life experiences  This is an age that grew up in an era of Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter  and their consciousness about shootings and police and shootings involving the police was filtered through a different experience that may not actually be shared in some ways by others   said Mr  Ferguson  a star of the video that Washington s Superior Court jurors see after they arrive at Judiciary Square In other cases  some people have complained that the machinations over jury selection were  in effect  stall tactics by desperate defense lawyers  In the Indiana case  two members of the State Supreme Court expressed frustration that  a computer glitch  would vacate the views of 24 jurors and two trial judges It is not yet clear whether East Baton Rouge Parish s troubles will lead to new trials for people who have already been convicted of crimes  But some legal scholars said that appellate courts could look favorably on arguments that the parish did not fulfill a fundamental duty to ensure a representative jury pool  It affects not only our case  it affects other cases  too   said District Attorney James E  Stewart Sr  of Caddo Parish  whose office is prosecuting Mr  Cannon and who expressed no misgivings about Mr  Cannon s chances for an impartial jury Mr  Stewart  a former appellate judge in Louisiana  added   It s new ground  It is not even fully settled how the database error will affect Mr  Cannon s trial  in part because Judge Emanuel has warned that the defense s complaints about the jury pool were tardy On Thursday morning  she rejected the defense s arguments and allowed jury selection to proceed  In the afternoon  the Louisiana Supreme Court overruled her  

 Bibi  King of Israel  That is a shout from his fervent supporters that might have given pause to King David  let alone King Solomon  But Benjamin Netanyahu  despite all his faults and all the allegations of corruption and cynicism that surround him  is on his way to becoming Israel s longest serving prime minister It is an extraordinary accomplishment for a man who grew up in the shadow of a difficult and demanding father and a hero brother  killed at the age of 30 in command of one of Israel s most storied military ventures  Operation Entebbe  The 1976 operation rescued hostages held at Entebbe Airport in Uganda Both brothers served in the military s elite commando unit  Sayeret Matkal  But Bibi survived to put a more lasting stamp on the young state through his political and economic policies  his toughness toward rivals  He has an instinctive sense of what drives Israelis   the search for security in one of the most unstable regions of the world  a Jewish state built on

an obvious one  Born in Israel  he grew up partly in the United States where his father  a deeply conservative scholar of Judaic history  was teaching He returned to Israel after high school  fluent in English  to make a distinguished career as a commando in Sayaret Matkal  where he rose to captain and was wounded several times He then returned to the United States  using the more Anglicized name Ben Nitay  later changed to Benjamin Ben Nitai  to get degrees in architecture and business management  By 1978  he was already appearing on American television  where his English made him an ideal guest to discuss Israel He found his way into diplomacy and politics in the early 1980s  when he was appointed deputy chief of mission to the Israeli Embassy in Washington  He then served as ambassador to the United Nations before returning to Israel to enter politics in earnest He joined the Likud in 1988 and was elected to Parliament ImageMr  Netanyahu  accompanied by Government

Yitzhak Rabin of the Labor party and his willingness to give up territory to reach peace with the Palestinians in the Oslo accords  After Mr  Rabin was assassinated in 1995  Mr  Netanyahu was criticized for language approaching incitement  a criticism he said he found deeply wounding But he defeated Washington s favorite candidate  Shimon Peres  in the 1996 elections by pushing the theme of security in the midst of a badly managed conflict with Lebanon and a series of terrorist bombings by Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad  He became the youngest prime minister in Israeli history and the first to be born in the independent state That same year  1996  Mr  Netanyahu represented Israel for the first time in summit meetings organized by President Clinton  who was eager to build on Oslo to create a more lasting peace Then and later  in the 1998 Wye River summit  Mr  Netanyahu proved a difficult partner  He was willing to appeal to American Jews and Israel supporters in Congress to heighten political pressure on Mr  Clinton not to press Israel to go farther than he judged wise His relations with the Palestinian leader  Yasir Arafat  were always tense  and the two never came to trust one another enough to reach the peace that Mr  Clinton thought was within grasp ImageVice President Al Gore watching as Yasir Arafat  King Hussein of Jordan  President Clinton and

But after the failure of his Labor Party successor  Ehud Barak  to reach peace with the Palestinians at long meetings at Camp David and again  just before Mr  Clinton left office  Mr  Netanyahu returned to politics  But he lost out to Ariel Sharon  then went on to serve in his cabinet  After a period in opposition  Mr  Netanyahu became prime minister again in 2009 and has remained in office since But his relations with American presidents continued to be fraught  and he and President Obama developed a deep mutual disdain Mr  Obama pushed too hard too early to try to get Israel to stop settlement building in the occupied West Bank  while Mr  Netanyahu believed that Mr  Obama was putting Israel at an existential risk by trying to do a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program While Iran denied it was aiming to develop nuclear weapons  Mr  Netanyahu compared the threat of Iran to Israel and the Jews to the late 1930s in Europe  when Hitler took power He tried to defeat the deal in every setting  from the United Nations  where he famously held up a cartoon bomb with a thick red line representing Iranian uranium enrichment  to the U S  Congress itself  where he remained very popular  especially among Republicans ImageDuring his second tenure as prime minister  Mr  Netanyahu had an icy relationship with President Obama CreditStephen Crowley The New York TimesImageThe Iron

Israeli troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip  a step he opposed  Mr  Sharon dumped the keys to Gaza in the street  but they were picked up by the more radical Hamas  which seized control of the Palestinian territory from the more moderate Fatah faction led by Mr  Arafat s successor  Mahmoud Abbas Under Mr  Netanyahu  Israel made regular raids and airstrikes to try to stop rockets from Gaza hitting southern Israel  prompting criticism about the deaths of Palestinian civilians in a place many compared to an open air prison  largely sealed off from the world by Israel and Egypt But Mr  Netanyahu has refrained from any comprehensive reinvasion of Gaza and has had quiet talks through Egyptian mediators with Hamas to try to keep Gaza from imploding and dragging Israel into a larger war  especially another one with the Iranian armed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon At the same time  he has been making inroads with other Sunni Arab nations despite the continuing decline in relations with the Palestinians  pushing Israel s solidarity with them against Iran ImageAn Israeli tank near the town of Sderot at the border with Gaza during the seven week war with Hamas in 2014

streets all over Israel named after Yonatan Netanyahu Only when Mr  Netanyahu s father  hawkish and dominating  died in 2012 at the age of 102  Israelis said the prime minister could feel liberated enough to try to make peace with the Palestinians But that has been a hope long deferred  as previous efforts at peace have proven hollow  Both the Israelis and Palestinians have pulled back from the deeply difficult compromises  both territorial and religious  that would be required for a lasting settlement of the unfinished war of 1948 49 ImageMr  Netanyahu  with his father Benzion Netanyahu

immunity  He may still be brought down by criminal indictments if he cannot fend them off with the power of his office But he appears to have won a fifth term regardless   not because Israelis think he is the nicest or cleanest man in the kingdom  but because they believe that he has kept them safe and made them wealthier  and that he has influence over Washington and a strategy to maintain Israel s security while reducing its isolation in the region If he forms a government in the coming weeks  as expected  Mr  Netanyahu will be on track to surpass Israel s founder David Ben Gurion as

This article is part of David Leonhardt s newsletter  You can sign up here to receive it each weekday The politics of climate change can sometimes feel unwinnable The oil and coal industries spend large sums of money to spread falsehoods  The leadership of the Republican Party echoes those falsehoods  Many voters  struggling with slow growing living standards  are hostile to policies that would address climate change   namely  increases in energy prices  And so far the top tier Democratic presidential candidates haven t put the issue at the center of their campaigns But for all of these challenges  I think there is a more promising political approach than many people realize  In the upcoming issue of The Times Magazine  I ve written an essay about it  and it is online now The brief version  Americans are skeptical of policies that directly raise the cost of energy  such as a carbon tax or cap and trade program  But polls show that most Americans are in favor of policies that promote clean energy even if those policies indirectly raise the cost of energy  One example is a mandate requiring utility companies to use more clean energy  most states already have such a mandate  and Michigan and Nevada have recently made theirs tougher  Another example is federal spending to subsidize clean energy   a program  in other words  that looks like a Green New Deal Obviously  programs like these don t eliminate the costs of moving away from dirty energy  But they can change the political calculus  When a policy calls attention to the costs of the transition  as a carbon tax does  people are wary  When a policy calls attention to the benefits  people often have a more favorable attitude and are willing to accept slightly higher costs  As a result  many climate activists have been changing their political strategy in recent years   It makes sense to set a goal   as Rhiana Gunn Wright  a climate policy expert  told me while I was reporting the magazine story  When people understand the goal   like a clean energy economy   they are much more open to solutions than when the policy discussion focuses on mechanisms for reaching that goal  Even if the country adopted a sensible climate policy today   and it s inconceivable under President Trump   it is too late to avoid some of climate change s terrible damage  But it s not too late to make a big difference My article is part of the Magazine s climate issue  and you can find more of it here  The theme is deliberately scary   Putting a Price on the End of the World  Also  the writer Nathaniel Rich has just released a book based partly on his August 2018 cover story for the Magazine on the history of climate policy  Last night  Nathaniel and I talked about climate change at the Brooklyn Public Library  and you can watch the conversation here  Related  Thomas Friedman argues that smart climate proposals could well be damaging to a president who has denied climate change at every chance he s gotten   If Democrats approach this right   he writes   they can win on this issue in 2020 and make Trump the laughingstock  If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter  you can subscribe here  You can also join me on Twitter   DLeonhardt  and Facebook Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

LONDON   The beginning of the end of Theresa May s Brexit strategy was an emotional address to the nation in which she blamed parliament for the delay in Britain s departure from the European Union The televised speech on March 20 was one of the few times in nearly three years as prime minister that she has followed her instincts rather than the counsel of her closest aides  said a source close to May Venting her anger at parliament  which had already rejected her deal twice  she said Britain s departure had been blocked by political infighting for which she was not responsible Her move backfired  spelling the end of attempts to agree terms acceptable to hardline Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party and to Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party  which props up her minority government Twelve days later after another rejection of her deal by parliament  she did the unthinkable  She turned to the opposition Labour Party and its leader  Jeremy Corbyn  for talks to try to secure support for the deal and persuade the EU to give her more time to win parliament s backing For a woman who has spent most of her adult life campaigning for the Conservatives  it was no easy decision  But it underlined May s shifting ambitions in the pursuit of Brexit  After promising not to seek a new term as prime minister at the next election  and offering to quit sooner if parliament backs the divorce deal she agreed last year with the EU  her remaining goal is to get a deal through parliament that would allow her to leave with some kind of legacy Protecting her party s fragile unity  damaged by divisions over Brexit  was no longer the prime aim  Over the last few days people have been asking me what on earth s happening with Brexit   May said in a relaxed video address in a sitting room at her country residence on Sunday  explaining how her deal could not get through parliament   Now there s lots of things on which I disagree with the Labour Party on policy issues  but on Brexit I think there are some things we agree on     It ll mean compromise on both sides  but I believe that delivering Brexit is the most important thing for us  Authority has slipped away from May in other ways too  Exasperated lawmakers have seized control of important parts of the parliamentary agenda  passing legislation to hem her in  She has also been forced to turn to an increasingly irritated EU  where leaders meeting on Wednesday will decide on the length of any Brexit delay  while May sits outside the room and awaits their judgment BAD MOVE  BAD INSTINCTS It was never meant to be like this  But three years after Britain voted to leave the EU  that decision is mired in uncertainty As the prime minister herself says  Britain might never leave   something she believes will betray the voters who backed Brexit in a 2016 referendum  won by a margin of 52 48 percent  It would also spell a failure for her premiership But for many  she must shoulder much of the blame for the unraveling of Brexit  From losing her majority in an election she did not need to call to failing to build a consensus around a deal that pandered to both sides of the debate but persuaded neither  May has too often stubbornly stuck to just one plan It was always going to be an uphill struggle for the resilient but reserved former interior minister who hails from the Conservative Party s heartlands of southern England May took over a party and a country in crisis over Britain s relationship with the EU   an issue that helped claim the scalps of three Conservative predecessors  David Cameron  John Major and Margaret Thatcher May was seen as a steady choice to take over when Cameron quit in the chaos following the referendum She had campaigned  albeit lukewarmly  to stay in the EU but swiftly made honoring the referendum result her mission  The hope was that May could appeal to the eurosceptics and the pro EU lawmakers in her party      ZERO RESPECT For months  she papered over the cracks  offering a clean break from EU institutions for Brexit supporters  and close economic ties for remainers But by trying to please both sides  she never managed to persuade either to swallow the compromises needed to secure a deal with Brussels May won some admiration for soldiering on yet her critics say she lacked the guile to carry her party and see Brexit through Many opposition members of parliament  and more moderate members of her party  say May focused too much on appeasing hardline Conservative eurosceptics and ought to have held cross party discussions quickly to involve more sides     But the failure to do that and this focus on holding the party together  in my view is an unedifying spectacle   said one former aide Her frustration after almost two years of EU talks boiled over in her March 20 TV address   You are tired of the infighting  You are tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows   she said   You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with  I agree  I m on your side   The backlash was swift  with some lawmakers accusing May of encouraging violence against them in an unashamedly populist speech  ELECTION DISASTERIt all started to go wrong less than a year after May became prime minister When she took over  the Conservatives held a slim majority in parliament  May had always said she wouldn t call an election to reinforce her legitimacy but by early 2017 she was riding high in the polls and saw an opportunity to boost her majority and  hopefully  make the Brexit process smoother She triggered a snap election in June 2017 but it didn t go well  May was uncomfortable with a campaign which she thought was trying to make her look presidential but did  not suit her in any way   the former aide said Her poll lead dwindled and while the Conservatives did win the most seats in parliament  May lost her majority and was forced to turn to the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party  DUP  to stay in power  You can look at the election in two ways  You can say   Well  she s the PM  she should have taken control  said it wasn t working and changed it    the former aide said  Or you can say   She got the professionals in  she stood everywhere she was told to stand  said everything she was told to say  wore everything she was told to wear and did the ultimate professional job   The result left her hostage to the DUP and a group of hardline eurosceptics in her own party  which ultimately proved her undoing when it came to trying to secure parliament s agreement on the terms for leaving the EU     BACKSTOP BLUNDERThe DUP opposed any deal that risked a hard border between Northern Ireland  which is part of the United Kingdom  and Ireland  which is in the EU  It also opposed any deal that meant Northern Ireland would be treated differently to the rest of the UK as this would be tantamount to splitting up the union But when May agreed the terms of Britain s withdrawal in December 2017 it included a so called Irish backstop  a mechanism to avoid a hard border in Ireland that also risked keeping Northern Ireland alone in a customs union with the EU The DUP insisted it could not back the deal but she endorsed it anyway in November the next year Keeping the Northern Irish border open was also the main stumbling block for the eurosceptics in her party  as they feared promising close economic ties could trap Britain in the EU s sphere indefinitely When she presented a July 2018 compromise  some pro Brexit ministers balked  It was ultimately swiftly rejected by the EU Foreign minister Boris Johnson and Brexit secretary David Davis quit and his successor  Dominic Raab  also resigned over a later plan to try to square the Irish border circle     NO CARDS LEFTOver the two years of talks  European leaders often complained that they did not know what the British negotiating position was  or what London wanted  By contrast  the bloc s 27 other states presented a united front  By early 2019  May s habit of sticking to set phrases rather than shifting position to appease her critics was increasingly enraging lawmakers   A source close to Boris Johnson said that in his meetings with May  he would say  you can save Brexit  you can be a hero  but she sat silently  sometimes nodding  sometimes saying  No  no Boris  it cannot work like that  And when setbacks happened  May s independence from her party colleagues often turned into further isolation May addressed Conservative lawmakers on March 27 and offered to quit to get her deal through a third time But the DUP stuck to its guns  hardline eurosceptics refused to budge   and May lost again  Labour s Corbyn  a socialist May had often said was unfit to rule  became her last hope for a compromise that parliament could back  In the end  she may simply have been the wrong person for the job  Putting someone in charge of a project they don t believe in doesn t work   said Brexiteer Conservative lawmaker Bernard Jenkin   Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan and William James  Editing by Giles Elgood  

As young people rightly demand real solutions to climate change  the question is not what to do   eliminate fossil fuels by 2050   but how  Beyond decarbonizing today s electric grid  we must use clean electricity to replace fossil fuels in transportation  industry and heating  We must provide for the fast growing energy needs of poorer countries and extend the grid to a billion people who now lack electricity  And still more electricity will be needed to remove excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by midcentury Where will this gargantuan amount of carbon free energy come from  The popular answer is renewables alone  but this is a fantasy  Wind and solar power are becoming cheaper  but they are not available around the clock  rain or shine  and batteries that could power entire cities for days or weeks show no sign of materializing any time soon  Today  renewables work only with fossil fuel backup  Germany  which went all in for renewables  has seen little reduction in carbon emissions  and  according to our calculations  at Germany s rate of adding clean energy relative to gross domestic product  it would take the world more than a century to decarbonize  even if the country wasn t also retiring nuclear plants early  A few lucky countries with abundant hydroelectricity  like Norway and New Zealand  have decarbonized their electric grids  but their success cannot be scaled up elsewhere  The world s best hydro sites are already dammed Small wonder that a growing response to these intimidating facts is   We re cooked  But we actually have proven models for rapid decarbonization with economic and energy growth  France and Sweden  They decarbonized their grids decades ago and now emit less than a tenth of the world average of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour  They remain among the world s most pleasant places to live and enjoy much cheaper electricity than Germany to boot They did this with nuclear power  And they did it fast  taking advantage of nuclear power s intense concentration of energy per pound of fuel  France replaced almost all of its fossil fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years  Sweden  in about 20 years  In fact  most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power This is a realistic solution to humanity s greatest problem  Plants built 30 years ago in America  as in France  produce cheap  clean electricity  and nuclear power is the cheapest source in South Korea  The 98 U S  reactors today provide nearly 20 percent of the nation s electricity generation  So why don t the United States and other countries expand their nuclear capacity  The reasons are economics and fear New nuclear power plants are hugely expensive to build in the United States today  This is why so few are being built  But they don t need to be so costly  The key to recovering our lost ability to build affordable nuclear plants is standardization and repetition  The first product off any assembly line is expensive   it cost more than  150 million to develop the first iPhone   but costs plunge as they are built in quantity and production kinks are worked out  Yet as a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission put it  while France has two types of reactors and hundreds of types of cheese  in the United States it s the other way around  In recent decades  the United States and some European countries have created ever more complicated reactors  with ever more safety features in response to public fears  New  one of a kind designs  shifting regulations  supply chain and construction snafus and a lost generation of experts  during the decades when new construction stopped  have driven costs to absurd heights These economic problems are solvable  China and South Korea can build reactors at one sixth the current cost in the United States  With the political will  China could replace coal without sacrificing economic growth  reducing world carbon emissions by more than 10 percent  In the longer term  dozens of American start ups are developing  fourth generation  reactors that can be mass produced  potentially generating electricity at lower cost than fossil fuels  If American activists  politicians and regulators allow it  these reactors could be exported to the world in the 2030s and  40s  slaking poorer countries  growing thirst for energy while creating well paying American jobs  Currently  fourth generation nuclear power receives rare bipartisan agreement in Congress  making it a particularly appealing American policy to address climate change  Congress recently passed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act by big margins  Both parties love innovation  entrepreneurship  exports and jobs This approach will need a sensible regulatory framework  Currently  as M I T  s Richard Lester  a nuclear engineer  has written  a company proposing a new reactor design faces  the prospect of having to spend a billion dollars or more on an open  ended  all or nothing licensing process without any certainty of outcomes   We need government on the side of this clean energy transformation  with supportive regulation  streamlined approval  investment in research and incentives that tilt producers and consumers away from carbon All this  however  depends on overcoming an irrational dread among the public and many activists  The reality is that nuclear power is the safest form of energy humanity has ever used  Mining accidents  hydroelectric dam failures  natural gas explosions and oil train crashes all kill people  sometimes in large numbers  and smoke from coal burning kills them in enormous numbers  more than half a million per year By contrast  in 60 years of nuclear power  only three accidents have raised public alarm  Three Mile Island in 1979  which killed no one  Fukushima in 2011  which killed no one  many deaths resulted from the tsunami and some from a panicked evacuation near the plant   and Chernobyl in 1986  the result of extraordinary Soviet bungling  which killed 31 in the accident and perhaps several thousand from cancer  around the same number killed by coal emissions every day   Even if we accepted recent claims that Soviet and international authorities covered up tens of thousands of Chernobyl deaths  the death toll from 60 years of nuclear power would still equal about one month of coal related deaths  Nuclear power plants cannot explode like nuclear bombs  and they have not contributed to weapons proliferation  thanks to robust international controls  24 countries have nuclear power but not weapons  while Israel and North Korea have nuclear weapons but not power  Nuclear waste is compact   America s total from 60 years would fit in a Walmart   and is safely stored in concrete casks and pools  becoming less radioactive over time  After we have solved the more pressing challenge of climate change  we can either burn the waste as fuel in new types of reactors or bury it deep underground  It s a far easier environmental challenge than the world s enormous coal waste  routinely dumped near poor communities and often laden with toxic arsenic  mercury and lead that can last forever Despite its demonstrable safety  nuclear power presses several psychological buttons  First  people estimate risk according to how readily anecdotes like well publicized nuclear accidents pop into mind  Second  the thought of radiation activates the mind set of disgust  in which any trace of contaminant fouls whatever it contacts  despite the reality that we all live in a soup of natural radiation  Third  people feel better about eliminating a single tiny risk entirely than minimizing risk from all hazards combined  For all these reasons  nuclear power is dreaded while fossil fuels are tolerated  just as flying is scary even though driving is more dangerous Opinions are also driven by our cultural and political tribes  Since the late 1970s  when No Nukes became a signature cause of the Green movement  sympathy to nuclear power became  among many environmentalists  a sign of disloyalty if not treason Despite these challenges  psychology and politics can change quickly  As the enormity of the climate crisis sinks in and the hoped for carbon savings from renewables don t add up  nuclear can become the new green  Protecting the environment and lifting the developing world out of poverty are progressive causes  And the millennials and Gen Z s might rethink the sacred values their boomer parents have left unexamined since the Doobie Brothers sang at the 1979 No Nukes concert If the American public and politicians can face real threats and overcome unfounded fears  we can solve humanity s most pressing challenge and leave our grandchildren a bright future of climate stability and abundant energy  We can dispatch  once and for all  the self fulfilling prophesy that we re

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  Jabbar Collins spent 16 years in prison before it was discovered that detectives had pressured the main witness against him to lie about Mr  Collins s role in the 1994 murder of a rabbi The Brooklyn district attorney s office knew the detectives had pressured the witness but never informed the defense  court papers said  A federal judge later called the prosecutor s conduct  shameful  and a  tragedy  The conviction was vacated and the city paid Mr  Collins a  10 million settlement in 2014  But the prosecutor was never called to account for how he handled the case Last week  Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo approved legislation to create a special commission to investigate local prosecutors for such allegations of misconduct  The commission would have the authority to sanction prosecutors and  in extreme cases  remove them from office The governor has said the panel is the first of its kind in the country  The state s prosecutors have already vowed to challenge it in court as unconstitutional  setting the stage for a fierce legal battle that could land in the state s highest court  The new bill is just another political stunt  with no hope of surviving judicial scrutiny   said David Soares  a Democrat who is the Albany County district attorney and the president of the state s district attorney s association  The commission  impermissibly intrudes on core law enforcement functions   Mr  Soares  a Democrat  added But supporters of the legislation said cases like Mr  Collins s show why the state needs an independent entity to investigate prosecutors  In that instance  the assistant district attorney  Michael F  Vecchione  was never publicly disciplined for withholding information The supporters point out that district attorneys  who are immune from civil suits for their official actions  are seldom penalized for acting unethically In recent years  people seeking to overhaul the state s criminal justice system have increasingly focused on prosecutors  who wield enormous power through their discretion in charging decisions and plea bargaining with little or no oversight Nine of 10 cases are settled with a guilty plea and so usually evidence is never tested at trial  The steps an unscrupulous prosecutor might take to get a conviction  like hiding evidence favorable to the defense or coercing a witness to give certain testimony  seldom becomes public  legal scholars said  The cases where misconduct comes to light is often by serendipity   said Barbara O Brien  a law professor at Michigan State University and the editor of the National Registry of Exonerations   We just have no idea how many times they don t get caught  While district attorneys contend that such misconduct by prosecutors is rare  defense lawyers have pointed to the role prosecutors have played in the growing number of wrongful convictions that have been uncovered because of advances in DNA evidence  Also  a greater understanding about the prevalence of false confessions has emerged  defense lawyers said The prosecutors  who are elected officials in the executive branch  argue that the 11 member commission violates the separation of powers rule because members are appointed by the judiciary and the Legislature If it survives the challenge  the State Commission on Prosecutorial Conduct will have the power to investigate the state s 62 district attorneys to determine whether their conduct is unethical  unprofessional or unlawful  The commission would be able to conduct hearings  compel witness testimony  issue subpoenas and request any records or materials deemed relevant to its investigation It was Mr  Cuomo s second time signing the bill into law  The first time  in August  Mr  Cuomo had urged legislators to amend the legislation to address his concerns about its constitutionality  particularly the separation of power rule  But he said the new bill was returned with few changes ImageMr  Collins s conviction was vacated in 2010 CreditRuth Fremson The New York Times Despite my desire for a bill strong suited for the legal challenges that it will surely confront   Mr  Cuomo  a Democrat  said in his approval memo   my commitment to the creation of this commission and the promise that it brings for a more transparent  and just criminal justice system remains unshaken  The governor s office and the Legislature will each appoint four members  while the chief judge will appoint three  No members have yet been named to the commission Lawyers for the prosecutors asked a judge this week to block the formation of the panel  arguing the law illegally expands the role of the chief judge and blurs the lines between powers of the executive  the judiciary and the Legislature Jacob Gardener  a lawyer representing the district attorneys  said the prosecutors did not oppose oversight or criticism  but believed the law was  marred by constitutional defects  Public defenders applauded the creation of the panel as a critical step toward reducing the number of wrongful convictions and for holding prosecutors accountable for unethical practices  About 300 people have been exonerated in New York  dating back to the 1980s  and official misconduct was listed as a contributing factor in many of the cases  according to data in the National Registry of Exonerations  We have a responsibility to our client and prosecutors have a responsibility to justice   said Tina M  Luongo  the chief criminal defender for the Legal Aid Society   Someone needs to be held responsible when it goes wrong  In Queens  for instance  defense lawyers said prosecutors there never faced meaningful sanctions for the wrongful conviction of Shih Wei Su   who was convicted in 1992 of attempted murder for a shooting at a pool hall  He served 13 years in prison before a federal appeals court judge ordered a new trial  after discovering that a prosecutor  Linda Rosero   knowingly elicited false testimony from a crucial witness  to get the conviction Ms  Rosero maintained that she was unaware the Queens district attorney s office had made a deal with the key witness  promising him he could go free on an unrelated case if he testified  Ms  Rosero said she had been  nave  inexperienced and  possibly  stupid   A grievance committee later issued Ms  Rosero an admonition  which amounts to a warning  but took no other action In a letter to the grievance committee  Mr  Su said   Is 13 years worth of my life worth only an admonition  The new law prevents the commission from looking into a prosecutor s conduct in investigations in which no charges have been filed  or from examining cases still being tried  Still  the state s prosecutors have said the panel will create a chilling effect and could make the state s lawyers reluctant to pursue difficult cases out of concern that their work would be subject to public scrutiny  One reason prosecutors have immunity in civil lawsuits is because they re supposed to seek justice and not worry   Hey  what is this going to mean for me    said Daniel R  Alonso  a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan Some current and former prosecutors have also argued the commission is unnecessary  Grievance committees in New York s four appellate divisions already review complaints about lawyers in the state  including prosecutors One recent and egregious example was the case of Mary E  Rain  the district attorney of St  Lawrence County  a rural territory on the Canadian border in northern New York  In 2018  Ms  Rain was disbarred from practicing law for two years  after complaints emerged that her office had used an inmate to improperly obtain jailhouse confessions and for using questionable tactics in a high profile murder case Still  lawmakers who support the new commission say that Ms  Rain s case is an exception  in practice  grievance committees rarely punish prosecutors for unethical behavior  Alphonso B  David  counsel to Mr  Cuomo  said that  in effect   there are currently no mechanisms in New York to challenge prosecutorial misconduct  In Mr  Collins s case  the prosecutor  Mr  Vecchione  denied wrongdoing and continued to work until 2013  He resigned after his longtime boss  the Brooklyn district attorney  Charles J  Hynes  lost a bid for re election  If prosecutors  either through negligence or recklessness  cause someone to suffer the death penalty or life in prison   should there be no consequence at all   Mr  Collins s lawyer  Joel B  Rudin  said  

TEL AVIV   As if facing indictment on bribery and other charges were not a big enough problem for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  along comes a rugged  retired army chief called Benny Gantz  an Israeli hero straight out of Central Casting  to challenge the  King of Israel   Gantz  in his gruff authenticity  gets under Netanyahu s skin  A mensch ousts manipulator dethronement in Israeli elections on Tuesday can no longer be ruled out It s still a long shot  however  Netanyahu  seeking a fifth term after a total of 13 years in power  is fighting not only to extend his rule but also to stay out of jail   He has to leverage political success into stopping the criminal process   Dan Meridor  a former minister of intelligence and deputy prime minister in a Netanyahu government  told me  This tends to focus the mind Netanyahu  who has the strong backing of President Trump  is at his shrewdest and most ruthless when backed into a corner  He has vowed to start annexing the West Bank  wherever an Israeli settler may be  in a last minute gambit  The support for him that popularized that regal  melekh yisrael  epithet is fanatical  despite the accusations from the attorney general that the prime minister traded official favors for gifts and for flattering news coverage   A blood libel   Netanyahu calls the charges  To the last  he will summon every specter of the  Arab loving left  in a bid to hang on  That he will stop at nothing is by now well known I wish I could say this election was about something   the Palestinian conflict  the bottoming out of the middle class  Iranian threats   other than Netanyahu  It s not  This gives it an almost ritualistic quality  Israelis have gotten used to going through the ballot box motions and then bowing to their  magician   The prime minister s instincts are as feral as Trump s  His hold on the Israeli imagination is tenacious  The question is whether this grip can be broken in a country where the start up economy is humming  the American Embassy is in Jerusalem  and military conflict has been contained  A lot of Israelis feel good  or good enough  about Netanyahu s nation Israel is a changed country  The land for peace left died  It broke as a political camp  the idea was orphaned  Separation supplanted peace as Israel s aspiration  Palestinians  for many Israelis  continue their eerie passage into abstraction  a process cynically encouraged by the Trump administration  A half century on  it seems the White House is circling back to Golda Meir s  There is no Palestinian people   The one politician who put the peace issue front and center  the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni  dropped out   from the campaign and from politics altogether  If you are left  you will lose   Polly Bronstein  who heads a movement to empower the political center  told me  Yes  it s that simple Enter Gantz  59  son of a Holocaust survivor  born and raised in an agricultural cooperative  paratrooper  chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces  with his candid blue eyed gaze  his less than perfect English   Let me up front you    Ladies and Gentlemens    his Sabra quintessence and his weary yet resolute air reminiscent of murdered Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin ImageBenny Gantz  leader of the Blue and White Party  speaking at a campaign event in Ashkelon  Israel  CreditCorinna Kern for The New York Times Strength and moral power come together   he told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  or Aipac  to vigorous applause in Washington last month   Moral  is not a word Netanyahu can utter with a straight face  Gantz  whose new Blue and White party borrows the colors of the Israeli flag  produced a black and white photograph of his mother  weighing 90 pounds  as she emerged from Bergen Belsen  It may be too much to ask of Israel  in its harsh neighborhood  to be a  light unto nations   But it must surely stand for something more ennobling than graft Blue and White is the latest in a series of parties   Kadima   Forward    Yair Lapid s Yesh Atid   There is a future   and Isaac Herzog s Zionist Union   that have tried over the past decade to create a centrist alternative to Netanyahu  Likud and the prime minister s increasingly rabid crew of rightists  ranging from the religious Messianic to the racist nationalist  They all failed Although fragmented  the half dozen right wing parties including Likud still appear to have a more plausible path to a Knesset majority than any potential Gantz coalition  But it s close and unpredictable  with many voters undecided and the question open of which small parties make the threshold for Knesset admission The forebears of Blue and White could not convince an Israel drifting right on the back of Russian immigration and Palestinian violence of the security and viability of a post Netanyahu Israel  Now three former generals   Gantz himself  Moshe Ya alon and Gabi Ashkenazi   are screaming security  security and security  Lapid  the fourth party leader  brings a touch of razzmatazz The presence of Ashkenazi  a Mizrahi Jew  is important because Jews of North African and Middle Eastern stock have always formed a Netanyahu stronghold  The prime minister has cleverly exploited their old resentments of the liberal left that dominated Israel in its early decades I said the election was about Netanyahu  In fact  because of the prime minister s attacks on democratic institutions and his legal troubles  it s about more than one man s fate  The vote is about the nature of Israeli democracy  perhaps its very existence  Gantz  in an interview this month with The Times of Israel  hammered on this point  saying  the trend is very  very  very dangerous  and that democracy  is at stake  Netanyahu  applying a by now familiar illiberal playbook  one whose elements he helped forge and that has seen such success from Budapest to Washington  has attacked a free press  He has set out to undermine an independent judiciary and embraced a form of nationalism that  like Trump s  sees enemies and traitors everywhere The country s basic law that was passed last year declared Israel the nation state of the Jewish people alone  despite the fact that Arab citizens make up a fifth of the population  When Netanyahu says  as he did this year  that Israel is  the nation state  not of all its citizens  but only of the Jewish people   he eviscerates the core idea of democratic citizenship  No longer is everyone equal before the law  What then are the others  second class shadows From there  it is but a short step to making that monarchical sobriquet perfectly fitting  Netanyahu is not only facing bribery charges  He has also admitted that  in an extraordinary arrogation of powers  he authorized the sale of advanced German made submarines to Egypt  without telling the National Security Council  without telling the head of Mossad or the defense minister  without telling the military chief of staff  He says he did tell the attorney general  The attorney general denies this  The reason   State secrets   says Netanyahu  Oh  please The prime minister has also acknowledged that he made some  3 million on investments in a company that supplied the German shipyard that built the Egyptian submarines and warships for Israel  Still  he insists he did not  make a shekel  on the submarines and that the stock was sold before the deals were made  The whole thing stinks   Itamar Rabinovich  a former Israeli ambassador to Washington  told me  Gantz s view  as expressed in The Times of Israel  was   If it walks like a duck  if it quacks like a duck  maybe it s a duck   He added   We are speaking about a corrupt man who is destroying the country  The danger is evident  a conflation of Netanyahu s legal and political battles that subverts the rule of law to save him  Already  his justice minister  Ayelet Shaked of the New Right party  has been lambasting the Supreme Court s powers  portraying it as the liberal elite s means to dilute the will of the people and accusing it of a  coup  against democracy Everyone here is talking about a  French law   This is what Israelis call the legislation that Netanyahu would try to pass  if he wins  that would grant the prime minister immunity from prosecution while in office  Get that done  eliminate the Supreme Court s power to rule such a move unconstitutional  maybe engineer an eventual passage from the prime minister s to the president s office  and he s home free  He really is king at last Of course  the rightist parties Netanyahu would try to woo into doing this would exact a price  like that promised annexation of part of the West Bank  the death knell for a two state peace   Trump s recognition of Israel s authority over the Golan Heights has encouraged the annexationists  and lawlessness in general   Next up  Area C  the 60 percent of the West Bank under exclusive Israeli control  It may not happen  but the drift under Netanyahu toward one state in all but name between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River  with millions of disenfranchised Palestinians  is relentless  The status quo is an illusion   Meridor told me   It moves  You end up in one state that contains people who don t vote  that is not Jewish in terms of numbers  and that is not democratic   In this sense  too  another Netanyahu victory would undermine Israeli democracy Between Israel and that fate stands Gantz  He s no dove on Palestine  but I believe he would at least attempt to engage in serious negotiation with the Palestinians  who do  after all  exist   so closing Netanyahu s decade long kick the can chapter  He s a political neophyte  but that Rabin air feels significant and he has identified something important  The word  moral  has to mean something for a country that gathered Jews bound during the millennial diaspora by a covenant of ethics and that rose from the ashes of the Nazi crematories  In  unity   an oft repeated word  Gantz has identified another important idea eroded for too long by the master of division who has increasingly split Israel into rival tribes When you ask Israelis about their election  they often draw an analogy with soccer   You play for 90 minutes   they say with a half amused  half bitter shrug   and then Germany wins   Except  of course  that Germany has been losing a lot of late  Perhaps that s a sign  It s time  Gantz can take it from here RelatedMore on the Israeli electionOpinion   Hagai El AdDemocracy  Israeli StyleApril 7  2019As Netanyahu Seeks Re election  the Future of

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  A long limbed man carrying a black bag moved with purpose through the morning bustle of Flushing  Queens  He walked into the hush of the Chun Fook funeral home and down the marble steps to where the paperwork of death is handled An employee in black led him into the privacy provided by a wooden screen  On a table draped with a gold cloth sat a small white box  and behind it  a framed portrait of the man s sister and only sibling  Song Yang In late November 2017  she either jumped or fell from a fourth floor window as the police were banging on her door to arrest her  once again  for prostitution  She landed hard on 40th Road  a truncated street known for restaurants  illegal massage parlors and women on its sidewalks calling out  Massage  Massage  Song Yang was 38 Her brother and mother  Song Hai and Shi Yumei  rushed from their remote home in northeastern China to unfamiliar Flushing  where they spent the next 15 months  Distrustful of the police account  Mr  Song  36  began his own investigation into her death  distributing information wanted posters  swapping tips with reporters and interrogating his sister s sex work colleagues He became convinced that the police had thrown his sister from the window  and that the authorities were engaged in a cover up  It did not matter that surveillance video demonstrated otherwise  or that an inquiry by the Queens district attorney s office found no evidence of police misconduct  Bitter suspicion infused his grief But Mr  Song s investigation had stalled  Money had run out  Visas had expired  And a wife and 5 year old son were waiting  It was time to return to China Time to bring his sister home The funeral home employee  Kevin Liu  opened the box  He explained to Mr  Song that the certificate of cremation   needed for customs   was inside  along with a sealed bag containing Song Yang s ashes Mr  Song raised the delicate matter of payment for more than a year s rental of storage space   about  600  But the funeral home was well aware of the family s woes  Whenever the brother and mother visited Song Yang s remains  the mother was known to weep without pause Mr  Liu settled on  200  Then  at Mr  Song s request  he wrapped the box in a cloth of red  the color meant to convey wishes for safe passage of the soul Mr  Song removed a black backpack from his bag  and the two men carefully placed the box and the portrait inside  Mr  Liu helped to strap the bag to Mr  Song s back  shook his hand  and said   Yilu shunfeng  Have a safe

intersection at Roosevelt Avenue  where he had once grabbed his sister s  boss   an elusive  square headed man known as Lao Li  Song Yang had paid him as much as  400 a night for a 40th Road apartment and the illusion of protection Their tense encounter had attracted a crowd  as Mr  Song waved down a police car and insisted that this  boss  be arrested  Explaining that things do not work that way in the United States  the police had allowed Lao Li to scurry away  leaving Mr  Song confused and angry He continued on  deaf to the street songs of immigrants  A woman hawking beauty treatments  A man promoting tax services  A peddler selling Chinese language books  including  F B I  Mind Reading   U S  Federal Agents Teach You to See Through People  Mr  Song turned right on 40th Road  He walked along the sidewalk on the south side  where his sister had once called out to men Song Yang had come with her much older husband to Flushing in 2013  after an economic downturn in Saipan forced them to close the two restaurants they owned  With her husband unable to work  she had scrambled to find a job  Before long  she was offering sex for money on 40th Road  a dangerously vulnerable job She was beaten  robbed and sexually assaulted  She was also arrested a couple of times  which she feared might thwart her chance to secure legal residence in the United States Arrested again in late September 2017  Song Yang became despondent   I ve fallen so low I can t be saved   she wrote in a WeChat message to a lawyer trying to help her   Without purpose  without direction  what meaning is there to keep on living  On the night of Nov  25  she fell prey to another sting  this time by a team of 10 police officers who had nicknamed her  Jane Doe Ponytail   She escorted an undercover officer up to her fourth floor apartment in the tired building at 135 32 and offered him sex for  80  but he demurred and left  Almost immediately she saw  on a surveillance monitor in the apartment  the images of police officers ascending the stairs Song Yang hurried to a small balcony overlooking 40th Road  She hit the pavement a few feet from the undercover officer  just as he was exiting the building ImageThe balcony  upper left  and the facade of the building have been renovated since Song Yang s death  CreditTodd Heisler The New York TimesNow her brother was looking up at the balcony from the exact spot where she had fallen  He entered the building and climbed the tile steps leading to her old apartment  where another massage operation called Heaven on 4th had opened shortly after her death  But renovation work blocked the stairwell  and a sign in Chinese on the window of the first floor restaurant explained what was happening FOR RENTThird floor  fourth floorSuitable for all kinds of officesPrice negotiableThings had changed along 40th Road For one thing  the police were targeting johns  in keeping with a stated policy to focus less on the employees of illicit massage parlors and more on their owners and customers The police also began enforcing nuisance abatement laws  One of the first operations had targeted a massage parlor in a building across the street from 135 32   one run by Song Yang s old  boss   Lao Li  The authorities had padlocked its doors and plastered its windows with  CLOSED By Court Order  and  RESTRAINING ORDER  signs Finally  a task force of several city agencies   including the police  fire and buildings departments   began focusing on property and business owners  zeroing in  for example  on apartments with illegal subdivisions and faulty plumbing fixtures ImageIn recent months there has been a crackdown on illicit massage parlors along 40th Road  including one across the street from where Song Yang worked and later died CreditTodd Heisler The New York TimesIn addition  the news coverage that followed Song Yang s death   including the account in The Times   had increased the political pressure to address the sex business along 40th Road  City Councilman Peter Koo  who had long received complaints about women overtly soliciting sex on the street  began calling landlords to put them on notice No more renting to illegal businesses  Mr  Koo said he had warned them  And make sure your tenants do not sublease space to shadowy operations One recent afternoon  a woman who calls herself DongDong  and who often wears a pink bomber jacket  emerged from a 40th Road restaurant carrying takeout   We ve all split up   she said in Mandarin   We can t stand on the street anymore  Later that night  though  DongDong was lingering  mostly alone  outside her old haunt  She and other women now connect with customers after midnight  and then lead them to locations on other Flushing streets The 40th Road cacophony

and brother were leaving that night for John F  Kennedy International Airport  It would take them a full day of travel to return home to China s northeastern province of Liaoning  where the family plans to bury Song Yang on a mountainside Ms  Shi  66  sat bent on her bed  She is a much frailer woman than when she first arrived more than a year ago  Several months ago she required hip replacement surgery after tripping or being knocked down on Main Street  She began talking of her gratitude to the United States But the face of her son  sitting across from her  darkened with every word of praise for a government that he believed had caused and covered up his sister s death  Suddenly  he threw a suitcase lock in anger  It hit a wall and clattered to the floor  All that s left of my sister are her ashes in a box   he said  He listed other sorrows  A mother who was now broken  physically and emotionally  A father whose hair had turned white  A wife and son he had not seen in more than a year  I feel like Job from the Bible  The small room became smaller in the ensuing quiet  In the corner were the eight large pieces of luggage  Nine  now  with the black backpack containing the remains of their beloved Song Yang  who had fallen in Flushing Song Hai wondered aloud how he would carry it all

Land where there was none before  A careful ratio of places to live  work  eat and recline on lawns  A sense of being in New York  but not quite of it At first blush  Hudson Yards and Battery Park City  cities within a city on the western edge of Manhattan  would seem kindred spirits But Hudson Yards  which is to wrap up by 2026  will have taken 18 years to complete its gleaming clump along 10th Avenue   and it remains to be seen how quickly the rest of the neighborhood will develop  Battery Park City  which lumbered across the finish line in 2011  took 45 years to fully form Battery Park City stretches across more space along the Hudson River in the financial district  but a similar number of buildings make up the two master planned  mixed use communities  which have both also enjoyed tax breaks and other public benefits Why Hudson Yards was able to come together quickly  relatively speaking  has a lot do with how the approach to creating whole cloth neighborhoods has changed over the years  as the private sector has stepped in to fill voids left by the government  according to city officials  brokers and developers But also  vibes have changed  What was architecturally appealing a few decades ago now seems staid  Planners say that if the past was about fitting in  the present is all about standing out  In the end  they add  Battery Park City and Hudson Yards represent very different theories about development  Hudson Yards represents the 21st century  and Battery Park City represents the end of the 20th century   said Mitchell L  Moss  a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University   They are just totally different  ImageLooking east at Hudson Yards from the High Line in 2017  much of what was under construction is now open CreditEdward Caruso for The New York TimesGround GameBoth Hudson Yards and Battery Park City hatched from efforts to remake once industrial areas that were not living up to their potential  Dirt unearthed during the construction of the first World Trade Center in the mid 1960s  plus sandier fill  allowed Battery Park City to essentially be sewn onto the edge of Manhattan  creating a bumped out shoreline where rotting piers for fruit and vegetable shipments had stood before  But to make the 92 acre swath more than just a park required a huge investment  in sea walls  water pipes and electrical lines  And constructing that infrastructure fell to the state  which had to borrow a lot of money to make it happen  In 1972  the Hugh L  Carey Battery Park City Authority  the neighborhood s quasi public governing body  had to sell  200 million in state guaranteed bonds   considering inflation  about  1 2 billion in 2019 dollars   to set the table for development But by 1979  there was still almost nothing to show for it   The barren and beachy terrain drew sunbathers for years  With payments on those bonds coming due  and little in revenue to pay its debt  the Authority had to sell even more bonds   65 million worth  to avoid default  Doubling down on their bet  officials were buying time until rent producing structures went up  It wasn t until 1982 that the first building  the Gateway apartment complex  with 1 712 units  opened Hoping to avoid another dragged out process  the city took a different tack with Hudson Yards  a 28 acre parcel being developed by the Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group at the heart of the neighborhood of the same name  where other projects are also underway Most of the Hudson Yards site is ribbed with railroad tracks  by way of the John D  Caemmerer West Side Storage Yard  where Long Island Rail Road trains rest before heading back to Nassau County To create the development site  the tracks had to be covered  But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority  which controls the property  wisely avoided building that platform itself  said Tom Wright  the president and chief executive of the Regional Plan Association  an urban research group ImageThe John D  Caemmerer West Side Storage Yard  between West 30th and West 33rd Streets  from 10th to 12th Avenues  in 2004  Hudson Yards has risen from a platform built over the tracks CreditJames Estrin The New York TimesBy punting to Related and Oxford  which paid  1 billion for the rights to the site and built the deck  the M T A  made sure taxpayers wouldn t be on the hook  said Mr  Wright  whose group supports the project  Battery Park City required the public to take on a lot more risk   he said  But with the Hudson Yards model   whether Related goes belly up  or not  is not our problem  Other Advantages for Hudson YardsAs a private entity  Related  the lead developer  was also able to work relatively quickly and avoid being subjected to shifts in public opinion  If the M T A  had been responsible for building the platform  for example  a subway crisis might easily have diverted its attention and stalled the project A bit of forethought also worked in the project s favor  In the 1980s  when the Transportation Authority was undertaking a  196 million project to turn a defunct freight depot into the 30 track Hudson Yards rail yard  Richard Ravitch  who was then the chairman  realized the air above the new yard had great potential So he added enough space between the tracks to allow columns to stand between them  while also fortifying the ground to support huge weights  The groundwork for Hudson Yards was laid In 2008  the state received six proposals to develop the site and initially awarded development rights to Tishman Speyer  which controls Rockefeller Center  But as the Great Recession gathered steam  Tishman  which lost a key anchor tenant  Morgan Stanley  soon backed out  and Related took over Having fewer people calling the shots may also have helped  Battery Park City was constructed by a parade of companies  including Milstein Properties  LeFrak Organization and Zeckendorf  plus commercial builders But Hudson Yards is the result of a single company  which is a huge advantage  said Daniel L  Doctoroff  the deputy mayor under Michael Bloomberg who pushed hard for the rezoning that created Hudson Yards as part of the city s unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympics  ImageFormed from soil excavated during the construction of the original World Trade Center  Battery Park City was more beach than neighborhood in 1977  especially in its northern section CreditFred R  Conrad The New York TimesImageToday  the once sandy spot is home to Rockefeller Park  which offers lawns by the Hudson River  as buildings fill the horizon CreditTony Cenicola The New York Times What s very different is that one developer built the commercial and residential and retail space   said Mr  Doctoroff  who has firsthand knowledge of both places  Early in his career  he worked at 200 Vesey Street in Battery Park City for Lehman Brothers  the investment bank that was one of the neighborhood s first office tenants  He is now chief executive of Sidewalk Labs  a city focused technology company headquartered at 10 Hudson Yards  the area s first commercial tower As part of the Olympics proposal  a football stadium that would have become the home of the New York Jets would have been built on the western half of the train yards  but state officials spiked the plan in 2005 in the face of community opposition Mr  Doctoroff said he is still proud that the rezoning of the broader Hudson Yards neighborhood has allowed warehouses  parking lots and billboards to give way to stylish modern towers The Evolution of Battery Park City While Battery Park City may embody the lessons of the urbanist Jane Jacobs  who favored short blocks  Hudson Yards can feel derived from her opposite  master builder Robert Moses  whose approach was often big and muscular The fits and starts history of Battery Park City is also evident in its varied designs Plans for Battery Park City went through multiple iterations  It started with a 1966  towers in the park  plan for apartment buildings to house World Trade Center employees that Ada Louise Huxtable  the architecture critic for The New York Times  called  sterile high rise towers in vacuous open space   The plan estimated about 90 000 residents  a far cry from the 16 000 there today  By 1969  the Authority had scrapped that plan in favor of a more architecturally ambitious one  from Philip Johnson and other architects  that featured a mix of six sided towers and smaller buildings with walls that sloped like pyramids  A third version in the 1970s added more offices  but was revised again in 1979 because corporations had started migrating to the suburbs to escape a crime troubled metropolis ImageBy the water in Battery Park City  with the domed Winter Garden  the centerpiece of Brookfield Place  an office and retail complex  in the distance CreditTony Cenicola The New York Times I think the original designers were people that didn t like the city very much  because they kept giving a cleaned up view of what the city could be   said Stan Eckstut  the architect who  along with Alexander Cooper  was tapped for that fourth version Aiming for a traditional extension of Manhattan  Mr  Eckstut aligned streets with existing ones in the financial district  while creating small blocks  in a Jacobs type gesture Today  Battery Park City is probably best known for its brick and stone buildings  many from the 1980s  after developers finally came around  although there are exceptions  like the parabolic Visionaire  a condo high rise built in 2008  The last two apartment buildings to go up  in 2011  were the rentals Liberty Luxe and Liberty Green  Many blocks have an unvarying appearance  the urban equivalent of a subdivision  and critics have pounced on that conformity Rent regulated housing is a modest percentage of the total  But a portion of payments collected by the Authority   residents don t pay property taxes  but fees that are similar   goes to New York City to be spent on affordable housing development elsewhere in the city  though it has been tapped for other purposes  Last year  the city took in  197 million  according to the Authority People who work in Battery Park City are clustered in Brookfield Place  a warren of interconnected office buildings interspersed with shops formerly known as the World Financial Center  whose enclosed  climate controlled walkways evoke  in a sense  Johnson s vision  Also inside is the Winter Garden  an airy  skylighted space with 16 palm trees that holds events like Best Brews  a New York focused craft beer tasting In 2015  after a four year   300 million effort  landlord Brookfield Properties revealed a renovation of the retail spaces  including Le District  a 30 000 square foot French style market and Hudson Eats  a food hall dedicated to New York only restaurants ImageThe Shed  an arts center at Hudson Yards that opened in early April  telescopes out from the base of 15 Hudson Yards  a condo and rental complex    CreditTony Cenicola The New York TimesBrookfield also installed high end shops  but the mall s anchor tenant  a multilevel Saks Fifth Avenue department store  closed this winter after less than two years  Competition for upscale shoppers is stiff because Westfield  a sprawling mall in the nearby Oculus transportation hub  is a quick walk away Outdoor green spaces include Teardrop Park  whose rocky walls recall the Catskills  and Rockefeller Park  whose wide open lawns offer Hudson views  The sentiment seems the same between us and Hudson Yards  It s  I want to be in a Manhattan that doesn t feel like Manhattan    said Wesley Stanton  a salesman with Douglas Elliman Real Estate  But from a sales perspective  it s very different   Mr  Stanton said  While apartments at 15 Hudson Yards  a condo that opened this winter  average  3 300 a square foot  he noted  prices in Battery Park City are lower  as at the Ritz Carlton condo  where units average  2 300 a square foot From a Train Depot to High End ShoppingThe blocks at Hudson Yards  by contrast  don t feel as plugged into the street grid  The view ahead when walking west on West 31st Street  which ends at the development  is of the site s soaring seven story mall and the tall logo of its most prominent tenant  Neiman Marcus Streets like West 33rd will eventually bisect the site  and there are other ways in  But the site poses an inconvenient hindrance  in the form of that platform  which in places is the equivalent of three stories in the air  Mr  Doctoroff said  If parts of the site feel like a Moses style superblock akin to Lincoln Center  that s likely the explanation  he added Since 2012  when Related broke ground  buildings have been slow to arrive  But last month  much of the first phase  between 10th and 11th Avenues and West 30th and West 32nd Streets  opened to the public  The second phase stretches west to the West Side Highway  and the platform over that portion of the rail yards has yet to be built Inside the mall  upscale shops like Cartier  Rolex and Molton Brown line conventional looking corridors  Dining options seem light years ahead of the food courts of old  including Thomas Keller s TAK Room  David Chang s Kawi and the Drug Store  a  nonalcoholic bar   There is also a compact outpost of Citarella  the gourmet grocery chain  while Battery Park City leans on a pair of Gristedes Trees and greenery  for now  are limited  But public spaces that recently opened include Vessel  a shiny sculpture that encourages climbing  and the Shed  an all purpose and telescoping arts center  ImageHudson Yards  New York s newest master planned neighborhood  at night  seen from Weehawken  N J CreditChang W  Lee The New York TimesThere was hardly free rein at the site  said Marianne Kwok  a director of the architecture firm KPF  which has worked from the get go on the platform  site plan and buildings  Designers had to sift through  two telephone book size books of rules and regulations   said Ms  Kwok  who analyzed Battery Park City  among other neighborhoods  for inspiration Unlike in Battery Park City  each Hudson Yards building had to have a singular appearance  some towers angle and others curve  Every corporate tenant  wants to have brand   Ms  Kwok said  Indeed  Hudson Yards is also a far cry from the homogeneous Rockefeller Center  the 1930s complex considered a master planning pinnacle   Individuality is now what s desired   she said It may be working  A hefty 82 percent of the office spaces in the eastern half of the site  which is mostly commercial buildings  has been spoken for  even though some of the buildings are not yet open  according to Related Tackling mostly offices first was an important decision  Mr  Moss said   The game plan is genius   he said  adding that an office tower can be filled with a handful of tenants  unlike an apartment building  which needs hundreds of them and can take much longer to fill         g 0405 REA HUDSON BATTERY LIST web box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g 0405 REA HUDSON BATTERY LIST web box  g

For decades  the Friars Club has been America s temple of comedy  a fraternity of jokesters and others who relish the rimshot and proudly regard bad taste as a core virtue How bad Jack Black showed up to be roasted and dropped his pants on the red carpet  Gilbert Gottfried thought it would be funny to try a 9 11 joke just weeks after the attacks  Mourners at Milton Berle s memorial service could not stop talking about his legendary  euphemism here  I saw him sink a four foot putt with it Ba dum bum Despite the Friars  puckish vulgarity   or maybe because of it   their Manhattan headquarters  a six story landmark townhouse known as  the Monastery   has long been a cradle of celebrity  and the club s roasts are the stuff of legend  Frank Sinatra  Ed Sullivan and Jerry Lewis all directed its affairs  and it was an entertainment force during an era when television had a handful of channels and America a smaller constellation of stars But fewer and fewer tastemakers visit the Monastery these days  Membership has dwindled  Bills have piled up  The club lost its tax exempt status as a fraternal organization in 2010  Some members question how their money is being spent  Dissension reigns Federal agents raided the offices in 2017  carting off boxes of files  Earlier this year  they charged the club s executive director  Michael Gyure  with filing false personal tax returns The club s governing board told members last month that the federal investigation was over and that the club faced no further accusations  It is our hope   the board wrote in a letter   that now that this cloud has lifted  many good Friars will return so that the Club can go forward to recreate the fraternal environment which made the Friars famous  But a review of emails  tax records  Friars  correspondence and financial records   and four dozen interviews with former and current Friars and staff members   reveals that the club s problems ran deeper than one director s faulty tax returns The club s foundation held charity events that raised  3 million but cleared only  13 000 for charity  an outcome that led the volunteer board to cease operations in 2015  The club hired a man convicted of defrauding charities  who called himself the  King of Cons   as a consultant  Former staff members described questionable spending and sloppy bookkeeping  including a  160 000 loan to the executive director without interest that was never written down Though the club looks as it always has   bars on the first and second floors  gym on five  Luigi s barbershop on four next to the card room   many Friars and former Friars remain upset  and have been meeting to discuss what to do next ImageA landmark building  the headquarters of the Friars Club since 1957 is a six story townhouse on East 55th Street that is affectionately called  the Monastery  CreditVincent Tullo for The New York TimesEven some governing board members have thrown up their hands in frustration  complaining they have been used as a rubber stamp by Mr  Gyure and a few members on the executive committee of the board  This is not a board that was running the club  or fully informed of what was going on in the club   said Lou DiBella  a sports and entertainment executive who quit the board in January   I believed that it was a group of guys who ran the club in the shadows  Mr  Gyure  pronounced  Jury   pleaded guilty in January to the tax matter and is facing a possible prison term when he is sentenced in May  But the club paid a portion of his legal fees and says it will keep a job open for him  His crime  members of the executive committee said  was not directly related to his work Several committee members acknowledged  though  that the club had lacked proper financial controls  and that too much power had rested with the executive director  Members say they want to be more involved   said Jeffrey Citron  a new member of the committee   They want more transparency  We re going to try to give it to them  Mr  Citron said there were no financial shenanigans  and that the club s reputation had been hurt by bitter dissidents who spread false rumors about the management of the place Stu Cantor  a former leader of the club  disagreed  He said the club had suspended members  including himself  just for raising questions  They re blaming all the great longtime members for destroying the club because they left   he said in an interview   It s totally backward  The reason all the wonderful long term members left was because they were running the place into the ground  Once an entertainment epicenterThe object of all this Friar affection  and disaffection  is a 115 year old club that began as a hangout for theater press agents and grew into an institution whose membership rolls read like a timeline of showbiz history  George M  Cohan   the Broadway macher and  Yankee Doodle Boy  songwriter   was once the abbot   Think president   He brought in Irving Berlin  Through the years Chevy Chase  George Burns and Johnny Carson have been members  and the subjects of the insult filled celebrity  roasts  for which the club is known NBC  ESPN and Comedy Central all televised the roasts at various points  and the broadcast revenues supplemented the club s annual dues  which are now  5 165 ImageFrom left  Johnny Carson  the roastee Jerry Lewis and Alan King in 1971  Right

are retired Since 1957  the club has been housed in a baronial English Renaissance townhouse on East 55th Street  where the dining room serves chicken chow mein named for Jimmy Fallon  Friar  inducted 2009  The bar on the second floor is named for Barbra Streisand  Friar  1988  though she was not the first woman in the club  That honor went to Liza Minnelli who was selected earlier that year About 20 percent of members are women now  though the club retains an atmosphere of male privilege  Mr  Berle s infamous appendage  long referenced in Friar lore  remains its spirit animal Carol Scibelli  Friar  1998  remembers the first time she saw Buddy Hackett holding court in the bar  Mr  Hackett  a dough faced borscht belt comic known for roles in the films  The Music Man  and  It s a Mad  Mad  Mad  Mad World   was chatting with a group of male comedians  Ms  Scibelli couldn t resist joining the conversation  Who the hell is this broad   she remembers him bellowing But Ms  Scibelli  a comedian who promotes herself as the  funniest widow on earth   wasn t offended  The club once drew burlesque dancers and vaudeville stars  and their bawdy  off color humor is part of the club s DNA  I was a little embarrassed  but I was also happy that Buddy Hackett knew I was alive   Ms  Scibelli said  A financial pratfall and an odd hireIn recent years  the club s financial problems were no secret to the staff members who paid the bills Con Edison would threaten to turn off the electricity  Vendors went half paid  The club fell several hundred thousand dollars behind on its state sales tax Herb Slavin of M  Slavin   Sons  a fishmonger who supplied the club  said he stopped delivering in 2017 because it couldn t pay its tab   Whenever you called   he joked   the person that was in charge had died  Many current and former members said that for years they never realized how deep the deficits ran  though they did notice the added assessments that kept popping up on their dues bills  The Operating Assessment  The Capital Improvement Fund ImageMany of America s most popular entertainers have been Friars  Clockwise from top left  Irving Berlin  Frank Sinatra  Milton Berle

leadership attributed the shortfalls to rising prices and falling membership  But former staff members said in interviews that they questioned how the club spent money even as it struggled to pay its bills  Pricey dinners by board members would be reimbursed  The club seemed to commit to expensive hotel banquet fees without shopping around  I found it very strange that when I started to bring up these things  everybody got very quiet  very upset  nobody wanted to talk about it   said Tom Lowery  who briefly served as the club s controller in 2017   So I share the frustration of members who started to get agitated  Mr  Lowery only lasted two months  until  he said  he was fired for opening a piece of mail addressed to a club officer  He said it was not uncommon for employees to open and sort mail for the officers  The club said he had resigned Nancy DeSomma  who worked in accounts payable for three years until she was laid off in a 2017 downsizing  said she found the bookkeeping to be sloppy She said  for example  that she was instructed to cut checks for Flatbush and Church  an entity owned by a club officer  Bruce Charet   I never saw paperwork   she said   I was just told to make a check out to it  In an interview  Mr  Charet said he had submitted invoices and that he had been reimbursed for expenses incurred in helping to produce events  which often meant securing performers and celebrity attendees  There are 20 dinners and lunches that you have to go to to deliver one person   he said Mr  Charet later stepped down from his officer post after a club receptionist accused him of sexual harassment  Mr  Charet denied her charges  She filed a lawsuit in 2016  and the case was ultimately settled Mr  Gyure  the club s executive director  was also paid fees in addition to his salary for helping to produce events The strangest payments  former staff members said  went to Aaron Tonken  a fund raising consultant hired in 2014  six years after his release from federal prison where he served four years for defrauding charities In his book   King of Cons   written in 2004  Mr  Tonken described how he raised the profile of charity events he ran by luring celebrities with cash and lavish gifts   I call it taking from the needy to feed the greedy   he wrote ImageMichael Gyure  right  executive director  is to be sentenced soon for failing to report income and expenses from the club on his tax returns  He is pictured here at the roast of Terry Bradshaw  left  with Jerry Lewis  the Friars  abbot at the time CreditAndrew H  Walker Getty ImagesArthur Aidala  a Friar who answered questions on Mr  Gyure s behalf  said Mr  Tonken had presented Mr  Gyure a letter of recommendation from law enforcement officials attesting to his changed character Mr  Tonken said the club paid for travel costs  hotel stays  meals and even some of his rent  Three former club employees confirmed paying multiple expenses for him  Kristen Cure  a former administrative assistant  remembered searching for a birdcage the club could buy for one of his pet parrots and refilling a cash card for his use  I just came to work  ate  hung around in his office   Mr  Tonken said of Mr  Gyure  who he said asked him to keep their business relationship quiet  Please don t let other staff know about our arrangement   Mr  Gyure wrote him in a 2014 email   It is our business only  In a letter from November 2014  Mr  Gyure thanked Mr  Tonken for his work on a benefit dinner the month before  honoring the billionaire Carlos Slim and the actor Robert De Niro  Thanks to your efforts we were able to raise a significant amount of funds that will go toward donations to the charities affiliated with the event   Mr  Gyure wrote Of course  that depends on how you define the term  significant  Spending money for charityThe first annual Lincoln Awards concert  sponsored in 2015 by the Friars Foundation  the club s charitable arm  also turned out to be the last annual Lincoln Awards The event  at the Kennedy Center in Washington  had been promoted with much fanfare as a new opportunity to recognize the contributions of American veterans  Hosted by Brian Williams  it included tributes to 10 deserving recipients and performances by Nick Jonas  Harvey Keitel and Whitney Cummings  among others  Actors have Oscars   USA Today wrote in a preview of show   Live theater  the Tony Awards  Journalists receive Pulitzers and scientists Nobel Prizes  Now there is the Lincoln   for veterans  But the foundation  which had been operating as a charity since 1977  all but shut down later that year ImageAaron Tonken at prison in California where he spent four years after having been convicted of defrauding charities  He was later hired as a fund raising consultant for the Friars Club CreditReed Saxon Associated PressThe club and the foundation had a complicated relationship  Though they had separate boards and books  they were closely linked  with the club staff  led by Mr  Gyure  organizing foundation events under a longstanding agreement that the club  with its show business acumen  was best suited to run what were in effect entertainment events Members of the foundation s volunteer board became concerned  they said  that the club was spending too much on events like the Lincoln Awards that seemed to cost a fortune to produce but spun off little for the foundation s board to give away as charity In the last fiscal year that it fully operated  the foundation held three events that took in  3 million  but spent all but  13 000 in the process  The foundation  tapping funds from additional sources  paid out  198 000 that year  The general discomfort got so high  we decided we d pay the bills and we d give away the rest of the money to charity and close   said John Catsimatidis  the Gristedes supermarket chain owner and one of the foundation s directors The Lincoln awards had taken in  1 5 million in revenue  but ended up operating at a  79 000 loss  according to the charity s audited financial statement The expenses included  596 000 for entertainment  even though some performers had donated their services  The club flew Mr  Williams  who was not paid  and other performers to Washington on a private jet  according to two people with knowledge of the club s arrangements   Mr  Williams was later edited out of the broadcast after his inaccurate account of a helicopter ride in Iraq drew public criticism  Mr  Aidala said the show had been envisioned as a  fun raiser   not a fund raiser per se  and the charitable benefit had been the night out it provided for hundreds of servicemen and women who attended free But even before the Lincoln Awards  Mr  Catsimatidis said  the directors had become concerned about the spending surrounding the events  For the Carlos Slim charity dinner in 2014  the club spent 93 percent of the  1 47 million it took in  according to the foundation s tax filing  More than  444 000 was spent to stage and cater the event in the Waldorf Astoria ballroom in New York  When the vast majority of the money is spent on events that don t generate significant revenue  that s concerning   said Ashley Post  a spokeswoman for Charity Navigator  an organization that assesses charities Michael Matuza  the president of MBM Entertainment  a company that produced the entertainment portion of the dinner  said he did not know how the club could have spent so much on top of what it cost to rent the Waldorf   It feels high   he said ImageThe Lincoln Awards  a charity event run by the club and designed to honor veterans and their families  took in  1 5 million in revenue but operated at a loss CreditPaul Morigi Getty ImagesMr  Aidala accused the foundation leaders of legally  cooking the books  to make it appear as if the charity had made less than it actually had  It was  he said  another outgrowth of the tensions between club leaders and foundation leaders that led the charity to cease actively operating  Club leaders said it will eventually resurface Mr  Catsimatidis scoffed at any suggestion that numbers had been manipulated  He had paid for his daughter s wedding at the Waldorf and said he found the cost of the charity event outrageous But the foundation paid for the dinner  he said   even though some of us on the board didn t believe it passed the smell test  Can the laughing resume Nancy DeSomma remembers the day in 2017 when federal agents clambered up the stairs of the Monastery toward the sixth floor offices where the club kept its books She knew  she said  the place was under investigation  A federal agent had appeared at her Brooklyn apartment weeks earlier  looking to chat about what she had learned while doing the accounts payable Sondra Beninati  a member then  also was not surprised by the raid  She had long been frustrated by what she saw as a lack of transparency regarding the club s finances  so when a federal agent contacted her and asked her to wear a taping device  she agreed  She went  wired up  she said  to a membership meeting in the club s Frank Sinatra dining room Ms  Beninati loves the club  she said  and wants to see it restored to good health  At one point  she refused to pay her dues until she received an audited financial statement  She was suspended  and ultimately booted from the club   It felt like getting kicked out of your house   she said For the many members who viewed the federal investigation as an unmerited nuisance  its apparent end has fed the hope that the club may be able to go back to being a place for laughs  a few drinks and maybe a bit of singing  We ourselves did not know what this was going to uncover   said Mr  Citron   We were the most relieved when we found out it uncovered nothing  But some members are disappointed that the investigation did not answer their longstanding questions about the club s financial health and management ImageStewie Stone  a comedian who was once on the executive committee of the club  has said he was disappointed in the way the place has been run in recent years CreditAndrew Toth Getty ImagesMr  DiBella  the former board member  said the board often was not consulted about financial decisions and played no role in selecting the club s lawyers or accountants Executive committee members said they are working to improve the club s oversight  to catch up on any unpaid bills and to ensure that major financial decisions are properly reviewed by the governing board They defended keeping a job open for Mr  Gyure  even if he goes to prison  His new title will be  executive producer   they said  and he will have no control over the club s financials  He made some mistakes in his personal life having nothing really to do with the club   said Mr  Citron   People make mistakes  But as a friend  a manager  as a force at the club  a lot of people love him  Mr  Gyure pleaded guilty to not having reported income he received from the club in the form of  273 000 in expenses and a  160 000 loan that was forgiven  according to the government s court papers Two former members of the executive committee  Stewie Stone and Mr  Cantor  said in interviews that Mr  Gyure had actually been suspected of taking the  160 000 without authorization  but the club leaders at the time forgave him and agreed to treat it as a loan  They re comedians   what the hell do they know   said Mr  Cantor  who sat on the executive committee at the time Mr  Gyure s lawyer  Paul Shechtman  disputed that account  saying Mr  Gyure had asked and received permission to take an advance on his salary and later repaid it  partly through salary reductions Still  for the members who have seen friends ejected  the idea that Mr  Gyure would be

on Madison Avenue  and his apartment a few blocks away  But he became disappointed in what the club had turned into  When you know something was so good   he said   you don t like it when it ends
