programs high risk pools insure people expensive health needs encourages insurance strategies discounts young customers stripped benefit plans tend mainstream insurance less useful people serious health needs proposal leaves legacy Medicaid program That choice neutralizes possible political line attack substantially diminishes program possible cost savings court case Affordable Care decided judiciary timetable clear long White House develop replacement plan since certainly least months develop proposal aligned president recent promises Doing easy however Health care United States
