RICHMOND  Va    More than a dozen state lawmakers filed onto the stage  summoned by the smiling leader of their state  Ralph S  Northam  the governor of Virginia On the governor s right were a handful of House Democrats  who as a group in February said they were  no longer confident in the governor s representation of Virginians   after learning of a shocking racist photo on Mr  Northam s medical school yearbook page On his left were mostly Republicans  including the speaker of the House  Delegate Kirk Cox  who d declared that Mr  Northam s  ability to lead and govern is permanently impaired  Some on stage were members of the legislative black caucus  which called the yearbook photo  disgusting  reprehensible  and offensive  and  a complete betrayal  Even so  as Mr  Northam took out a pen at the event last week and signed bills to overhaul the state s foster care system  the lawmakers of both parties stood behind him  grinning and clapping This is the strange  suspended state of Virginia politics  just two months after scandal after scandal seemed to be devouring the state s government from the top down In the space of a week in early February  the public was stunned by revelations about each of the three highest statewide elected officials  all Democrats  the racist photo in the governor s yearbook  accusations of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor  and the attorney general s appearance in blackface at a party in college  Protesters and news crews swarmed the Statehouse  Calls for resignations came from fellow Virginia Democrats  Republicans and even 2020 presidential candidates And then   It just went poof   said Natalie Draper  a librarian sitting in the back of a coffeehouse last week in Richmond   It s like it never happened  Virginians have various theories as to how this surreal normalcy set in Some say the whole mess was so exhausting and embarrassing that by the time the legislature adjourned on Feb  24  the outrage had burned itself out  Others point to polls that showed Virginia voters were considerably less hungry for resignations than their representatives were  Some political observers mused about more fundamental changes to the life span of scandal  describing President Trump s approach to bad press as if it were a revolutionary medical breakthrough  Don t apologize  move on  and everybody will talk about something else next week   is how Ben Tribbett  a Democratic strategist  described it   Maybe we ve been doing it wrong over the last 100 years  For the Democrats  perhaps above all  there are the blunt political realities  Whatever may happen in the 2021 election for governor  every seat in the Republican controlled Virginia General Assembly will be up this November  and Democrats have a chance to take back power in at least one chamber of the legislature  That will be hard enough now  given the bales of fodder Republicans now have for attack ads  But the idea of trying to raise money and hold rallies while spurning the three highest officeholders in the state came to be seen by many Democrats as just a needless handicap Betsy Carr  a Democratic delegate  said shortly after stepping off the stage last week with Mr  Northam that voters  want to move on    They want positive things to happen  they re concerned about the elections   she said That sort of hard pragmatism is common among Democratic figures these days  But it is not unanimous  Many younger people in the party  in particular  are frustrated by what they see as the leadership s hurry to move on from the scandals rather than come to grips with them ImageGov  Ralph Northam and his wife  Pam Northam  third from left  posing for photos after the dedication of a historical marker for the civil rights leader Dr  Dorothy Height at a library in Richmond CreditParker Michels Boyce for The New York Times Winning is important   said Taikein Cooper  the 30 year old chairman of the Prince Edward County Democratic Party   but we also have to have some morals  In the immediate wake of the scandals  the governor all but disappeared  either avoiding public events or being explicitly disinvited from them The gears of state government kept turning   bills were signed or vetoed  cabinet secretaries did their work   but Mr  Northam s public resurfacing was slow  beginning with an appearance in early March at the third annual Public Safety Unmanned Aircraft Systems Conference Still  it is only in recent days that his public schedule has approached normal   or at least  something that looks normal from the outside  I think groups are struggling with   What do we do  What do we do about inviting him  Do we want him the centerpiece of an announcement    said Mr  Cox  the House speaker  who spoke with Mr  Northam at the bill signing for the first time since February   It s going to be pretty hard to say we re just going to have a normal governorship for the next three years   Mr  Cox said Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax  too  has been showing up at public events more often  But rather than trying to change the subject from the allegations against him  he dives right into them  even unprompted  as he did on the last day of the legislative session in a surprise speech comparing himself to a victim of lynching Mark Herring  the attorney general  has taken questions from the public on a few occasions since his own blackface scandal broke  But when he talked recently with reporters in Washington  after a Supreme Court hearing on gerrymandering  no one asked him about the episode Democrats fully acknowledge that there is unfinished business in all this  But they cite the lack of resolution as a reason to slow down on those immediate calls for resignations  Most people wanted to give the governor time to sort out what had happened   said State Senator Scott A  Surovell   I think a lot of people question whether he s in that picture  and they re waiting for more information about who s actually in it  Initially  Mr  Northam apologized for appearing in the yearbook photo  which shows a man in blackface makeup standing next to someone wearing a Klan robe and hood  But since then  he has insisted that he is actually not either of the people in the picture  and he has pledged to get to the bottom of the matter  The mechanism for that appears to be an inquiry that began last month  conducted on behalf of Eastern Virginia Medical School by the law firm McGuireWoods That investigation into the role of racism in the past and present culture of the school was also examining the circumstances of the infamous photo  No findings have been announced yet  and the investigation is expected to wrap up in the next few weeks Still  Mr  Northam made another pledge around the time he announced that he was staying put  to focus for the rest of his term on addressing racial inequities in American life  a theme he now repeatedly emphasizes in speeches The governor  welcomes the opportunity for future conversations  on improving racial equity  said a spokeswoman  Ofirah Yheskel  who pointed out various measures the governor has supported in recent weeks that reflect  his focus on the equity issues  One of the chief barometers of Mr  Northam s success on this front has become the opinion of the legislative black caucus  to which other Democrats have readily deferred since the scandals broke  Members of the caucus have laid out their priorities in meetings and conversations with the governor  and they say he has mostly abided ImageAt a memorial service for Dr  Dorothy Height at a church in South Richmond  Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax spoke about Dr  Height s advocacy against lynching  false accusations and denial of due process  themes he has hit repeatedly since the scandals erupted CreditParker Michels Boyce for The New York Times He s been trying hard  from what I can see   said Delegate Lamont Bagby  the chairman of the caucus   He s stumbled on his own feet a couple times  I think he would agree to that   But Mr  Bagby gave his approval to the governor s choice of bills to veto and amendments to propose over the past few weeks  and he said he believed that long delayed but badly needed conversations about race had begun At a Baptist church in Richmond on a recent Sunday afternoon  Mr  Northam delivered brief remarks referring to lingering inequities at a ceremony in honor of Dorothy Height  a grande dame of the civil rights movement  He was followed at the pulpit by Mr  Fairfax   the first time they appeared in public together since the scandals erupted The contrast was stark Mr  Fairfax began with praise for Ms  Height s  oratory around the issue of anti lynching   but it quickly became clear he was also talking about other matters  She saw what was happening in this country  where people were being falsely accused   Mr  Fairfax said   They were not given due process  They were having their lives in so many ways impacted negatively  in some ways taken away  because people wanted not to get to the truth but ultimately wanted things changed in a negative way for nefarious reasons  It was barely subtext  and he would revisit these themes more forthrightly two nights later at a Women s History Month mixer in Hampton  Va   an event sponsored by the local chapter of the N A A C P  After the lieutenant governor gave a short speech on his fight against  fabricated claims and false allegations   the crowd erupted in cheers of support Like Mr  Northam  Mr  Fairfax has insisted on an investigation into the accusations against him  He contends that he is being accused of sexual assault and rape for encounters that were consensual His demands for an investigation are echoed by fellow Democrats  as Mr  Northam s are  But it remains unclear where exactly such an investigation is to come from  If it s proved in a court of law  something needs to be done  but we re not there yet   Ms  Carr  the lawmaker  said Prosecutors in North Carolina and Massachusetts have been in contact with the two women who accused Mr  Fairfax   Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson   but there has been no public indication yet that a criminal investigation has been formally opened  Republican lawmakers announced plans for an investigative hearing  and both accusers have said repeatedly that they are willing to testify publicly as part of a bipartisan process  but Democratic lawmakers have balked  seeing such a hearing as a fruitless exercise prone to partisan grandstanding  At this point  there are few other obvious options  We are actually engaged in initiating processes that will make the truth known   Mr  Fairfax said at the event in Hampton  speaking over the live jazz music and pleas for him to join in group photos  He declined to elaborate further On Sunday  a lawyer for Mr  Fairfax issued a news release saying that Mr  Fairfax had undergone polygraph examinations administered by a former F B I  agent  and that the results  demonstrated that Lt  Gov  Fairfax was telling the truth  in denying the allegations  A spokeswoman said these exams were separate from the  processes  that Mr  Fairfax had spoken of earlier And so life goes on in Virginia  with the legislature coming back this week for a quick session and with the political jockeying getting underway before the primaries in June  Democratic lawmakers who are asked what may come next on the scandal front have no concrete answer  most say their constituents would rather hear about roadwork  school financing and health care Those  after all  are matters that state politicians can actually change  as opposed to the things that apparently they cannot  The calls for resignation have not been rescinded   Delegate Jeff Bourne  a member of the legislative black caucus  said a few days before appearing with the governor at a bill signing ceremony   But I think it s one of those things where we are operating in the current state of affairs  And the current state of affairs is that the governor and lieutenant governor are still there   

OTTAWA   After promising an open and collaborative way of doing politics  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada on Tuesday axed from his party two prominent former female cabinet ministers who have been at the center of a festering political crisis about his handling of a criminal case Trying to divert the country s attention from the controversy  Mr  Trudeau was in a tough spot politically The two women were seen by many as symbols of his progressive feminist government  But within his Liberal Party  they were seen as untrustworthy backstabbers who kept the firestorm alive for weeks with new morsels of information feasted upon by the press and opposition parties The problems began two months ago when accusations surfaced that Mr  Trudeau and his aides inappropriately pressured Jody Wilson Raybould  the former justice minister and attorney general  to settle a criminal corruption case against SNC Lavalin  a major corporation based in Montreal  A criminal conviction would bar the company from government contracts for a decade Mr  Trudeau has denied that anything inappropriate took place  He said he proposed a civil resolution of the case  with a monetary penalty  because a loss of government contracts by SNC Lavalin would jeopardize thousands of Canadian jobs Still  the criminal prosecution has continued And since then  the standing of the Liberals has fallen in the polls  And Mr  Trudeau s image as a fresh force who practiced politics in a new and transparent way has been severely battered With their re election hopes dimming less than seven months before the national vote  several Liberal members of Parliament have openly expressed frustration with Ms  Wilson Raybould  who resigned from the cabinet on Feb  12  and with Jane Philpott  who was president of the Treasury Board  and later resigned in solidarity with her  It s become clear that Ms  Wilson Raybould and Ms  Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team   Mr  Trudeau told an emergency meeting of the Liberal members of Parliament Tuesday evening   Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided  We cannot afford to make that mistake  He added   In learning to do things and doing them differently  we ve encountered difficult moments  Ms  Wilson Raybould said on Facebook on Tuesday night that she will speak with her supporters about what to do next  I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles   values that must always transcend party   she wrote In a separate Facebook message posted Monday night  Ms  Philpott expressed dismay about not being able to make her case to the national caucus before she was exiled from it  The need has never been greater for a measured re evaluation of how the government should respond to this issue   she wrote   What I have heard from Canadians is that they want to know the truth   Jenny Kwan  a member of the New Democratic Party from British Columbia  said Mr  Trudeau s action undermined his claim of being a feminist  This is about really speaking truth to power and the government shut it down   she said But Carolyn Bennett  the minister of Indigenous Relations  tried to repair any damage  telling reporters after Mr  Trudeau spoke that the prime minister s commitment to feminism was not a sham  It s not about gender   she said  saying that her former colleagues had to go simply because they could not be trusted Until Tuesday  Mr  Trudeau had studiously avoided criticizing either of his former ministers   I ve approached this situation with patience and understanding   he said ImageThe former attorney general  Jody Wilson Raybould  appearing before the House of Commons Justice Committee in February CreditSean Kilpatrick The Canadian Press  via Associated PressBut he called last week s revelation that Ms  Wilson Raybould secretly recorded a conversation with the country s top public servant  unconscionable The two were discussing the case against SNC Lavalin  which has been charged with bribing Libyan officials during the dictatorship of Col  Muammar el Qaddafi Mr  Trudeau s government was asking Ms  Wilson Raybould to consider using a new measure  similar to ones in the United States and some European countries  that would allow the company to avoid conviction in exchange for a substantial financial penalty A criminal conviction would have barred the company from government work  which could potentially have imperiled thousands of Canadian jobs  Mr  Trudeau and his aides have repeatedly denied any impropriety Ms  Philpott also angered her Liberal colleagues by saying in a magazine interview that Ms  Wilson Raybould was being blocked by the government from revealing important information about the case While Mr  Trudeau made the decision to expel the two former members  a movement within the caucus to remove them began escalating over the weekend Wayne Easter  a former cabinet minister and veteran member of Parliament  told the Canadian Press news agency on Monday that recording the call without the knowledge of Michael Wernick  the clerk of the privy council  was  as low as you can go  He added   Jody Wilson Raybould  Should be gone  Gone  Should ve been gone long ago  While neither woman found many allies within their party  they have been celebrated by opposition members of Parliament for their actions In a statement  Andrew Scheer  the leader of the opposition Conservatives  said their expulsion showed that  if you tell the truth  there is no room for you in the Liberal Party  The Conservatives are filibustering debate on Mr  Trudeau s budget legislation in a bid to force a public inquiry into the matter Hours before she was removed from the Liberal caucus  Ms  Wilson Raybould urged her colleagues  in an unapologetic letter  to allow her to remain in the party  Now I know many of you are angry  hurt and frustrated   she wrote   And frankly so am I  I am angry  hurt and frustrated because I feel I was upholding the values that we all committed to  In her statement on Monday evening  Ms  Philpott dismissed the criticisms of several of her former colleagues  I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal  of trying to bring down the prime minister  of being politically motivated  and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson Raybould   Ms  Philpott wrote   These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods  I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister  Nor did Jody Wilson Raybould  The two former cabinet ministers will not be allowed to seek re election under the Liberal Party banner in October s election and are likely to face Liberal opponents in their electoral districts if they choose to run for re election Unless they join one of the opposition parties  they will also not have access to party financial  logistical and polling resources Both were political neophytes during the last election  in 2015  Ms  Philpott is a doctor and Ms  Wilson Raybould a lawyer who was also an Indigenous leader in British Columbia  Neither has a well developed  personal political machine Mr  Trudeau s efforts to turn political attention away from the case have so far faltered On Tuesday  he ended his announcement with a campaign style speech in which  among other things  he highlighted the government s efforts to mitigate climate change and attacked the Conservatives  plan to kill carbon taxes  

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  In recent days  President Trump has used Twitter to warn Mexico that he may close the border  to suggest that The New York Times and The Washington Post be stripped of their Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the special counsel s Russia investigation and to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates in 2018 And if Mr  Trump had his way  Brandon Neely  among others  would be blocked from seeing any of those tweets Mr  Neely  a police officer in Houston  is one of an untold number of Twitter users who have been blocked by Mr  Trump  These users  if they are logged into their accounts  cannot see the president s tweets and are unable to reply to them or see others  responses The president s actions led Mr  Neely  along with six others blocked by Mr  Trump  to sue him  saying he had violated their First Amendment rights  A federal judge in Manhattan ruled against Mr  Trump last year  finding that the president s Twitter feed was a  public forum  and  that his blockings were unconstitutional Mr  Trump appealed the ruling  and the case went before a three judge panel in Manhattan last week  The judges seemed skeptical of Mr  Trump s contention that he was acting in a personal  not official  capacity when he blocked people Circuit Judge Barrington D  Parker asked Mr  Trump s counsel  a Justice Department lawyer  why blocking  points of view the president doesn t like  isn t  just a quintessential First Amendment violation  How the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rules in the Trump case may have larger implications  as elected officials around the country expand the use of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter  Federal judges are grappling with the question of how the First Amendment may apply to those accounts Blocking on social media is not a partisan phenomenon  In 2017  for instance  ProPublica sent letters asking all 50 governors and 22 federal agencies whether they had blocked people on social media  Five Republican governors  four Democrats and four agencies responded with information about people they had blocked  Many agencies and more than half the governors did not respond In New York  the issue has arisen with Representative Peter King  a blunt and occasionally combative 14 term Republican congressman who represents parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island  Recently  one of his constituents collected the names of about 70 people who said they had been blocked from commenting on Mr  King s Facebook page  He s like this big tough guy  but he doesn t want to hear any criticism whatsoever   said the constituent  Jacqueline Hassett  who has been blocked and has met with lawyers about the possibility of suing Mr  King The seven Twitter users who sued Mr  Trump have been unblocked  following the lower court ruling   Anybody blocked by the president can still  in theory  view Mr  Trump s tweets  In an entry on its F A Q  page  Twitter tells users   If the account you ve blocked isn t logged in or is accessing Twitter content via a third party  they may be able to see your public Tweets   Other judges have issued similar rulings  Earlier this year  the Fourth Circuit  in Richmond  Va   upheld a lower court ruling that the Democratic chairwoman of the Loudoun County board of supervisors had violated the First Amendment rights of a constituent by blocking him on Facebook for about 12 hours Elsewhere  a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that three state assemblymen violated the First Amendment when they blocked a liberal advocacy group on Twitter  Jerry Brown  the former Democratic governor of California  produced records in 2017 showing that he had in the past blocked more than 1 500 people on Facebook and Twitter  and Paul Gosar  a Republican congressman of Arizona who in 2017 wrote a post on Facebook titled   So you re upset I blocked you on Facebook  Here s why I don t care  a three part series   said last year in a court filing that he was no longer blocking anyone Jameel Jaffer  the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University  which filed the Trump case and argued the Loudoun County appeal  said that social media accounts may be seen as public forums if they are used to make announcements related to government duties  engage with constituents about policy or if they use government resources   if  for example  staffers create posts  Public officials all over the country are using social media often as the main means of communicating with their constituents   Mr  Jaffer said   We want to make sure those officials aren t insulated from criticism  make sure participants in those digital spaces aren t deprived of the opportunity of hearing other citizens  divergent views and make sure these spaces retain their vitality and integrity and aren t transformed into echo chambers  In many ways  Mr  King s Facebook page reflects his public persona  It includes pictures of him in a Long Island diner with retired firefighters  a video of him at a St  Patrick s Day parade and a description of a meeting with an Israeli diplomatic official The page also includes announcements that he was backing legislation to fund the Sept  11 Victim Compensation Fund  co sponsoring a tax deduction bill and introducing a resolution calling for the extradition of people in Cuba who have been charged with crimes in the United States Mr  King said during a telephone interview that he has the right to block who he wants on his Facebook page because it does not use government resources  he also contends that it is separate from his congressional work  He said that his campaign committee pays to boost his posts  which are meant to function like re election ads  I wouldn t have to give any opponent an opportunity to comment on my campaign brochure   Mr  King said  adding that he only blocks some of his critics  usually those who make inappropriate remarks or comment frequently Mr  King has interacted with commenters  thanked supporters and sparred with critics  When a constituent from West Sayville  Chris Ann Rogers Pellegrino  asked on Facebook in 2017 for a  special outside investigation into Trump Russia ties   and told Mr  King she hoped he was loyal to  the fabric of our democracy  his reply was   My loyalty is to the Constitution  not the liberal zeitgeist  Ms  Rogers Pellegrino said she was blocked almost immediately after posting her message  Another constituent  Danielle Miller  said she was blocked last year after disagreeing with a post by Mr  King that said kneeling protests by professional football players were  rooted in the false narrative of police bias against black men  Several constituents who had been blocked said they were concerned that limiting criticism would create a misleading impression that Mr  King s positions are more reflective of his district than they actually are Christine DiBiase Martorana  from Seaford  said she was blocked after posting she was disappointed in Mr  King s  continued emphasis on Islamic terrorism  and asking for his thoughts  on non Muslim terrorists   Meg Rowe  from Brightwaters  said she was blocked after stating that she was keeping track of how many people Mr  King was blocking  It s infuriating  honestly   said Ms  Rowe  who in 2017 began a Facebook page called  Blocked by Peter King  to document blockings and the removal of posts   We just want some avenue to talk with him  even if we disagree  because it s his job to listen to us   

Hi  Welcome to On Politics  your guide to the day in national politics  I m Lisa Lerer  your host  Get On Politics delivered to your inbox  He kissed a senator s wife on the lips  He joked about the attractiveness of several senators  teenage daughters and granddaughters  And he told a female senator to  spread her legs  because she was  going to be frisked   A  MeToo moment That s not how it was seen at the time  No  that was just Joe Biden  hamming it up as he swore in the new senators  In his time as vice president  the ceremony became an annual spectacle in Washington  with his behavior even earning an affectionate nickname   Bidening  Those jokes  hugs and kisses may look different now  An essay published Friday night by Lucy Flores  a former Nevada legislator  that accuses Mr  Biden of leaning into her  smelling her hair and kissing her head in a way that made her uncomfortable at a 2014 campaign rally  has thrust the possible presidential candidate into a major generational reckoning  A second woman came forward Monday and accused Mr  Biden of touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable  Mr  Biden entered the Senate in 1973   before abortion was legal  before the Watergate hearings  before VCRs  before the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was born  and certainly before any serious national conversation about consent Whether the 76 year old Mr  Biden can get right with his party s current mores around race and gender may be the most fraught question hanging over his presidential aspirations In the  MeToo era  we talk a lot about  open secrets   But Mr  Biden s touchy feely behavior wasn t a secret at all  It was photographed  televised and widely discussed  And  for years  it was viewed as a political asset  Mr  Biden was a skilled retail politician  according to the conventional wisdom  someone who could work a room  charm a crowd  win them over booth by booth in a New Hampshire diner This weekend s accusations could transform that strength into a weakness In response to Ms  Flores s account  Mr  Biden said he didn t believe he had ever acted inappropriately in public life but was willing to  listen respectfully  to those who may feel differently  Ms  Flores flipped the frame  saying Mr  Biden s perception didn t matter  How his actions made her feel was more important   Frankly  my point was never about his intentions  and they shouldn t be about his intentions   she said in an interview with CNN   It should be about the women on the receiving end of that behavior  Now  the political world finds itself litigating a series of thorny questions  Does intent matter  Are we allowed to think that a back of head kiss is  not as bad  as a mouth kiss  even though they are both kind of gross  Can a progressive male politician issue a denial  while still saying he believes women The debate  which should come as no surprise to Mr  Biden or his team if they ve been following the news over the past two years  will ultimately be decided by voters  should Mr  Biden jump into the race Last month  Mr  Biden referred to himself as a  tactile politician  during a speech in Dover  Del

conservative majority on the state s highest court  But it will tell us something about the political mood in a key battleground state that Democrats lost by a little more than 22 000 votes in 2016 and carried two years later While Supreme Court races are technically nonpartisan affairs  they ve become heavily politicized events  with millions of dollars pouring in from political groups  In this year s contest  conservatives back Judge Brian Hagedorn and liberals are behind Judge Lisa Neubauer The candidates faced off in a bitter debate last month that featured accusations of lying and questions of temperament A win by Judge Neubauer would leave liberals in a strong position to retake control of the court the next time a seat comes up in 2020  when Democrats typically benefit from the larger turnout of a presidential year  The court could face several big political decisions  including questions around the redistricting that will follow the 2020 census and determine the makeup

Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico  a trusted ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was seen as a possible candidate to replace her when she retired  announced on Monday that he would run for the Senate in 2020 He will seek the seat held by Senator Tom Udall  also a Democrat  who said last week that he would retire at the end of his term Mr  Luján s decision makes him the latest aspiring House speaker to move on because of Ms  Pelosi s longevity  Chris Van Hollen  now a senator from Maryland  and Xavier Becerra  now attorney general of California  are also among the former Democratic House stars who have since sought other offices An easygoing  well liked member of the House who currently serves as deputy speaker  Mr  Luján has represented New Mexico s Third Congressional District since 2008  He also led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  the party s arm that supports House candidates  in the 2016 and 2018 elections  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 election  Mr  Luján tipped his cap to Mr  Udall in a statement on Monday  calling him  a champion for New Mexico  and arguing that  New Mexico needs another champion  in the Senate He pointed to his legislative record on issues like health care and the environment  while promising to uphold what he called  New Mexico values   I was born and raised in New Mexico  on the small Nambé farm I still call home   Mr  Luján said in the statement and in a video on social media   My mother retired after 33 years with the local public school district and my late father   a union ironworker and state representative   instilled in me the importance of hard work  the idea that no job is too big or too small  and a love for New Mexico that guides me every day  In a telephone interview on Monday  Mr  Luján said that leaving the House was one of several  tough decisions  he had to make in deciding to run for the Senate  But he said he was hopeful that Democrats could flip the Senate in 2020  and  we can t do that unless we keep New Mexico blue  He enters the race at a time when New Mexico has evolved into a safely Democratic state  After voting for George W  Bush in 2004  the state has turned progressively bluer and currently has no Republicans in its congressional delegation Mr  Udall won his Senate seat in 2008 after the retirement of Senator Pete V  Domenici  the last Republican to represent New Mexico in the chamber  In that same election  Mr  Luján captured Mr  Udall s old House district  Mr  Udall is the scion of a political dynasty in the West  Democrats are likely to have an advantage in the race for Mr  Udall s Senate seat  and Mr  Luján  46  is just one of several lawmakers who could seek it  New Mexico was among the states that saw a tide of young and diverse Democrats sweep to power during last year s midterm elections  and some of those newly elected officials may now consider running The state elected a Latina chief executive  Gov  Michelle Lujan Grisham  and sent two new women to the House  Representative Deb Haaland  58  who became one of the first Native American women elected to Congress  and Representative Xochitl Torres Small  34  a former aide to Mr  Udall who carried a conservative leaning district that hugs the border  We re a small family and we have to work closely with one another   Mr  Luján said of the congressional delegation from New Mexico  But he added later   I would not have jumped into this race unless I felt I was the strongest candidate  There are also a handful of prominent Republicans in the state  including Susana Martinez  the former governor  and Richard J  Berry  the former mayor of Albuquerque  It is unclear if any would be interested in mounting a long shot campaign  and Ms  Martinez left office deeply unpopular Mr  Udall offered no hint as to a preferred heir when he announced he would retire  but he has indicated that he intends to remain involved in politics and government  

When it comes to explaining why Facebook  YouTube and Twitter have become hotbeds for extremism  propaganda and bigotry  there s a tendency to overcomplicate things  That s understandable  The algorithms that govern the platforms are unknowable trade secrets  There are  in some cases  billions of users to account for  There are meaty issues of free speech and copyright law playing out in real time across borders  Technology is confusing  And  yes  it s true that the tech companies are dealing with thorny problems that most likely have no universally satisfying outcome  Big Tech s problems are indeed dizzying and manifold  but the last few years have taught us that there s an Occam s razor quality to any explanation of the toxicity of our online platforms  The original sin  it seems  isn t all that complicated  it s the prioritization of growth   above all else and at the expense of those of us who use the services The most recent example came on Tuesday morning when Bloomberg News published a story chronicling YouTube s struggles to quash misinformation  conspiracies and incendiary content  According to the report  current and former YouTube employees said that the company had ignored warnings to change YouTube s recommendation engine and that they were  in some cases  discouraged from seeking out videos that might violate YouTube s rules to preserve a sense of plausible deniability  Employee fears  were sacrificed for engagement   Ambitious goals were set to hit one billion hours of viewing a day  and algorithms were tweaked accordingly   We were so in the weeds trying to hit our goals and drive usage of the site   one former senior manager confessed in the piece   I don t know if we really picked up our heads   As technology advances  will it continue to blur the lines between public and private  Sign up for Charlie Warzel s limited run newsletter to explore what s at stake and what you can do about it  The story shouldn t be shocking  Reports from inside YouTube echo insider tales from other large tech platforms   a familiar pattern of ruthless optimization for users and of attention gone wrong The YouTube employee s quote reminded me of a conversation I d had a few years back with a former member of Twitter s product team   Leading up to I P O   it was all about revenue growth  from C E O  on down   the employee told me  suggesting that  in a frantic race to look good for Wall Street  the company deprioritized fixing systemic issues  including its rampant harassment problem  Others inside Twitter back then agreed   I did see a lot of decisions being made in terms of growth when it came to how to handle abuse  which I get   Leslie Miley  a former engineering manager at Twitter  told me at the time Growth at any cost  It s a mantra familiar inside Facebook as well  as an internal memo surfaced last year by BuzzFeed News revealed   We connect people  Period  That s why all the work we do in growth is justified   a Facebook senior executive  Andrew Bosworth  wrote in the memo in June 2016  In a separate section  while advancing the argument that more human connections via Facebook are a  de facto good   he appears to grapple with the downsides of connection   Maybe it costs someone a life by exposing someone to bullies   maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools   he wrote Mr  Bosworth has suggested the memo was a thought experiment   I don t agree with the post today and I didn t agree with it when I wrote it   he said  But Facebook s rapid rise to two billion plus users  numerous privacy debacles and a steady stream of reported negative revelations suggest that  like its counterparts  the company s quest for expansion trumped pressing concerns of privacy and transparency  A New York Times investigation last year reported that   bent on growth   Facebook executives  ignored warning signs  that Facebook could  disrupt elections  broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe  Scale is also seductive at an engineering level  bottom line aside  Adding users and engagement  in one interpretation  might signal that you re giving people what they want  In 2017  I asked a former senior Facebook employee if staff members had felt a sense of blame for Facebook s inability to stop the spread of misinformation that plagued the platform during the 2016 election  Not exactly  the employee explained   They believe that to the extent that something flourishes or goes viral on Facebook   it s not a reflection of the company s role  but a reflection of what people want  And that deeply rational engineer s view tends to absolve them of some of the responsibility  probably  We want to hear from youOpinionLosing Your Privacy in the Digital Age  Share Your StoriesFeb  13  2019We can see this sensibility today in the way the platforms tend to obfuscate and deflect responsibility  Just last week  a YouTube executive argued that its recommendation algorithms weren t designed to nudge users toward more extreme videos  Similarly  Twitter has and will continue to argue it was not designed specifically to be disproportionately hostile to women and people of color  And Facebook will argue that it was certainly not designed to help foreign countries interfere in our elections But this defensive posture seems only concerned with intent  Even if we take the platforms at their word that they did not intend to profit from extremism or to become hubs for radicalization online  that doesn t mean it doesn t happen  Intent is far less important than the actual outcomes  And the outcomes appear to suggest that these platforms were intentionally designed to keep you glued to your screen for one more video  one more retweet  one more outraged share of a hate read  How can the mess be unwound  Can it be fixed  Those are the complicated questions  But the answer as to how we got here in the first place is much less complicated than Big Tech wants you to think  Intentionally or not  it was designed this way  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear

The House Intelligence Committee has asked one of the top contractors to President Trump s inaugural to provide it with documents about the event  a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday  opening up a new line of inquiry into the planning and financing of the ceremonies The committee asked for documents from and an interview with Stephanie Winston Wolkoff  who had been a close friend of the first lady  Melania Trump  and who had helped plan the celebrations and parties around the inaugural  the person said  The request was disclosed by a lawyer for Ms  Winston Wolkoff in a letter this week to the inaugural committee It is unclear what was requested  or why the intelligence committee is now involved  But it adds a new layer to the existing federal investigations into the inaugural committee  which was run by Thomas J  Barrack  a close friend of the president  with help from some former Trump political aides  They include Rick Gates  who previously pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  and who has been cooperating with various investigations for more than a year In February  federal prosecutors issued a subpoena to the inaugural committee demanding that it turn over documents about donors  finances and activities  The subpoena sought documents related to all of the committee s donors and guests  any benefits handed out  including tickets and photo opportunities with the president  federal disclosure filings  vendors and contracts Among other issues  federal prosecutors have been investigating whether foreigners illegally funneled donations to Mr  Trump s inaugural committee and a pro Trump super PAC in hopes of buying influence over American policy  according to people familiar with the inquiry The inquiry has been looking at whether people from Middle Eastern nations   including Qatar  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates   used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two funds  Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns  political action committees and inaugural funds A spokesman for the intelligence committee  Patrick Boland  declined to comment on the request it made for documents from Ms  Winston Wolkoff  Representative Adam Schiff  the California Democrat who is chairman of the committee  has said that the panel would investigate any  financial or other leverage  that  foreign actors  might have over Mr  Trump and his administration The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III A lawyer for Ms  Winston Wolkoff declined to comment  The Wall Street Journal reported the request from the intelligence committee on Wednesday Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have been investigating donors to and spending by the inaugural committee since last year Their investigation was prompted by a recording between Ms  Winston Wolkoff and Michael D  Cohen  the president s former personal lawyer and fixer  that the prosecutors found on Mr  Cohen s cellphone  In a separate case brought by those prosecutors  Mr  Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging hush money payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Mr  Trump Ms  Winston Wolkoff has been cooperating with that probe since last fall  earlier than inaugural officials knew  according to the letter from her lawyer A sealed court order prohibited Ms  Winston Wolkoff from disclosing the fact that she received a subpoena from the federal prosecutors in Manhattan  That order  which lasted for 180 days  recently expired  a person briefed on the letter from her lawyer said Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York  in Brooklyn  have also been looking into questions about donations to the Trump inaugural committee  They have been examining Mr  Barrack s ties to the Middle East  among other matters  according to the people briefed on the work The inaugural committee raised  107 million and spent more freely than those of previous presidents  In 72 days  it spent about  100 million  roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Presidents Barack Obama or George W  Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurations Ms  Winston Wolkoff  with a partner  set up a firm that oversaw broadcast rights for the inaugural events and worked on the documentary project featuring interviews with top inaugural committee officials  

For five days  Joseph R  Biden Jr  remained in the background as four women came forward saying they had been uncomfortable with the ways he had touched them  He put out three statements through a spokesman  but none of them was his own account or an acknowledgment of the discomfort he had caused On Wednesday  Mr  Biden decided he needed to address the matter   and his future as a possible presidential candidate   personally  Yet his approach was unusual  He released a seemingly homemade video  laying out his views on connecting with voters emotionally and even physically  and vowing to  be more mindful and respectful of people s personal space   In my career  I ve always tried to make a human connection   that s my responsibility  I think   said Mr  Biden  sitting on a sofa  his legs crossed   I shake hands  I hug people  I grab men and women by the shoulders and say   You can do this   But he added   Social norms have begun to change  they ve shifted  and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset and I get it  I get it  I hear what they re saying  The two minute video amounted to a tacit admission by Mr  Biden  76  and his aides that they needed to take more action than they had since Friday  when a former Nevada assemblywoman  Lucy Flores  published an essay in which she described Mr  Biden touching her inappropriately and kissing her on the head in 2014  On Tuesday  two more women told The New York Times that the former vice president s touches made them uncomfortable  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  And his new explanation immediately became part of a lengthening queue of remarks that have prolonged the speculation about whether he will run for president  Though he has not yet announced he would seek the 2020 Democratic nomination  Mr  Biden is widely expected to join the race soon  He began his video in a manner that suggested his entry is just a matter of time   Folks   he said   in the coming month I expect to be talking to you about a whole lot of issues  and I ll always be direct with you  Mr  Biden s aides said on Wednesday that he wanted to address the accusations about his physical contact directly after listening to the women who have criticized him  as well as many other female friends  family members and advisers  They said he was particularly affected by the comments of Speaker Nancy Pelosi  a longtime friend of his who is similarly rooted in an earlier political era  when she said Tuesday that  people s space is important to them  and what s important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it  Mr  Biden s campaign in waiting has not ruled out the possibility of a televised interview  but advisers indicated that he was more likely to address reporters when he delivers a speech to a union conference Friday in Washington  The aides spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations Wearing a blue suit jacket over a white shirt with no tie  Mr  Biden stared directly into the camera as he issued his statement  which lacked a direct apology to the women who have come forward  The hastily made video  which appeared to be filmed on a phone  was recorded at Mr  Biden s Northern Virginia home Mr  Biden tried to frame the issue around changing social norms  But some women say it is fundamentally about the invasion of personal space  and the change is that they now feel empowered to speak out  In Washington  Mr  Biden has been known throughout his political career for his tactile style of politics  with shoulder rubs  hugs and kisses that some women now say were troubling to them at the time Mr  Biden also stressed the role that personal connection had played in his political career  Over the years  knowing what I ve been through  the things that I ve faced  I found that scores  if not hundreds  of people have come up to me and reached out for solace and comfort   something  anything that may help them get through the tragedy they re going through    he said   It s just who I am  I ve never thought of politics as cold and antiseptic  Reaction to the complaints about Mr  Biden s behavior has been divided  and that carried over to his video address on Wednesday The writer Andi Zeisler  co founder of Bitch Media  cited the lack of an apology as a problem   Imagine all the time he could have saved   she wrote   by typing  I m sorry  I will do better   Alicia Garza  a prominent progressive activist  said on Twitter that she was  disappointed  with Mr  Biden s statement and called it  mealy mouthed at best   Try this   she added   I m so sorry that my actions had this impact on you  I will do the work to be better and do better  Others  across a range of the political spectrum  praised the video Several female Democratic lawmakers said they were happy to see him addressing the matter more fully  I think he needs to listen  and he s committed to doing that   said Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said   One thing I know about Joe Biden  He s a man of his word  If he says he ll do better then he ll do better   She added   And I do believe that if the women felt that he was inappropriate we have to respect how they felt about it  Amy McGrath  the Democratic former Marine fighter pilot who narrowly lost a House race in Kentucky last year  said in a tweet that Mr  Biden was  honest  humble  and cares deeply about our country  Jennifer Palmieri  a former senior aide to President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton  wrote in a tweet   In his own words and clearly heartfelt  Best thing he could do to help himself in this moment  By having Mr  Biden issue a video statement  his aides were able to get his message out directly and in more personal terms  without him sitting for a televised interview  where there would be a risk of misspeaking The former vice president is virtually certain to speak more about his behavior with women before he announces his candidacy because his staff does not want the first days of his campaign to be consumed with questions about the matter  It is unclear  however  whether he can defuse the issue if more women come forward to express their unease about previous encounters with him  I ll always believe governing   quite frankly life for that matter   is about connecting with people  That won t change   he said in the video   But I will be more mindful and respectful of people s personal space   The idea that I can t adjust to the fact that personal space is important   more important than it s ever been   is just not thinkable   I will   he said  his voice softening   I will   

On Election Day in 2016  the Republican Party was divided against itself  split over its nominee for president  Donald J  Trump In Ohio  a crucial battleground  the state party chairman had repeatedly chided Mr  Trump in public  amplifying the concerns of Gov  John Kasich  a Republican dissenter  In New Hampshire  the party chairman harbored deep  if largely private  misgivings about her party s nominee  The Republican Party of Florida was listing  hobbled by local feuds and a rift between donors loyal to Senator Marco Rubio and former Gov  Jeb Bush and those backing the man who humiliated both in the primaries Those power struggles have now been resolved in a one sided fashion  In every state important to the 2020 race  Mr  Trump and his lieutenants are in firm control of the Republican electoral machinery  and they are taking steps to extend and tighten their grip It is  in every institutional sense  Mr  Trump s party As Mr  Trump has prepared to embark on a difficult fight for re election  a small but ferocious operation within his campaign has helped install loyal allies atop the most significant state parties and urged them to speak up loudly to discourage conservative criticism of Mr  Trump  The campaign has dispatched aides to state party conclaves  Republican executive committee meetings and fund raising dinners  all with the aim of ensuring the delegates at next year s  convention in Charlotte  N C   are utterly committed to Mr  Trump  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  To Joe Gruters  who was co chairman of Mr  Trump s campaign in Florida and now leads the state party  the local Republican Party is effectively a regional arm of the president s re election effort  I ve had probably 10 conversations with the Trump team about the delegate selection process in Florida   Mr  Gruters said  adding of a potential Republican primary battle   The base of the party loves our president  and if anybody runs against him  they are going to get absolutely smashed  State and local Republican organizations typically operate below the radar of national politics  but they can be vital to the success of a presidential candidate  Party chairmen and their deputies are tasked with everything from raising money to deploying volunteers to knock on doors  and in many states they help choose delegates for the nominating convention ImageVal DiGiorgio is the chairman of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania  one of the most vulnerable states from Mr  Trump s 2016 coalition CreditHannah Yoon for The New York TimesFor Mr  Trump  who prevailed in 2016 as an outsider with little connection to his party s electoral apparatus  the ability to control the levers of Republican politics at the state level could make the difference in a close election or a contested primary  It also leaves other Republicans with precious little room to oppose Mr  Trump on his policy preferences or administrative whims   on matters from health care to the Mexican border   for fear of retribution from within the party Mr  Trump s aides have focused most intently on heading off any dissent at the Charlotte convention  To that end  two of Mr  Trump s top campaign aides  Bill Stepien and Justin Clark  have worked quietly but methodically in a series of states where control of the local party was up for grabs  They have lifted Mr  Trump s allies even in deep blue states like Massachusetts  and worked to make peace between competing pro Trump factions in more competitive states such as Colorado The devotion to Mr  Trump was on clear display Saturday outside Denver  where the state party gathered to elect a new chairman  Though Mr  Trump s unpopularity helped drive Colorado Republicans to deep losses last fall  there was no sign of unrest  Mr  Trump s name was emblazoned on lapel pins and a flag toted by one candidate for the chairmanship  and his slogan    Make America Great Again    was printed on the red hat from which the candidates drew lots to determine their speaking order Mr  Trump himself stayed out of the race  and campaign aides sent the White House a short memo last month urging the president not to pick sides between allies after Representative Ken Buck  a deeply conservative candidate  lobbied administration officials for support But when Mr  Buck claimed victory in the race for chairman  he described his mission in terms of unflinching loyalty to the president  The key is that we make sure that the voters of Colorado understand the great job the president has done   Mr  Buck said   That is what my job is  Mr  Trump faces at least a quixotic challenge in the Republican primaries from William F  Weld  a moderate former governor of Massachusetts  and other Republicans have toyed with entering the race  But advisers to Mr  Trump view it as an urgent priority to maintain Republican support  With low approval ratings among voters at large  including educated whites who once leaned Republican  Mr  Trump can ill afford additional fractures on the right ImageDevotion to President Trump was on display Saturday outside Denver  where the Colorado Republican Party met to select a new chairman for the coming presidential campaign CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesSo far  loyalty has prevailed  There is no challenge to the president   declared John Watson  a former supporter of Mr  Kasich who now leads the Georgia Republican Party   The party is in near unanimous lock step in support of him  certainly at the activist and delegate level  In some respects  the shift toward Mr  Trump in Republican state organizations has been organic  driven by the president s immense popularity with the party s most committed voters  In Arizona  an emerging presidential swing state  conservative activists in January ejected a chairman aligned with the Republican establishment in favor of Kelli Ward  a former Senate candidate with fringe views who tied herself closely to Mr  Trump But Mr  Trump and his aides have also taken a more active hand in shaping the party leadership around the country  mostly to their own great advantage  according to half a dozen Republicans briefed on the Trump campaign s loyalty operation  A division of the Trump campaign known as the Delegates and Party Organization unit has closely tracked state party leadership elections and occasionally weighed in to help a preferred contender In Michigan  for instance  Mr  Trump s campaign manager  Brad Parscale  recently endorsed a former state legislator  Laura Cox  to take over Michigan s discombobulated state party The Trump campaign has also taken steps to blunt the influence of a few Republican governors who are hostile to the president  In Massachusetts  Trump aides worked in January to help a hard line candidate  Jim Lyons  win the chairmanship against a candidate linked closely to the state s Republican governor  Charlie Baker  who is a critic of Mr  Trump   As a candidate  Mr  Lyons vowed to  make the Massachusetts Republican Party great again   In Maryland  where Gov  Larry Hogan has mused about challenging Mr  Trump  presidential loyalists in the party apparatus are prepared to flout Mr  Hogan s wishes in selecting delegates  In Maryland and some other states  convention delegates are selected by a combination of primary voters and members of the state party committee   constituencies overwhelmingly supportive of Mr  Trump  No other candidate  no matter if it s Governor Hogan  Bill Weld or anybody else  will get one single delegate out of Maryland   said David Bossie  the state s R N C  committeeman and an adviser to Mr  Trump Image The key is that we make sure that the voters of Colorado understand the great job the president has done   said Representative Ken Buck  the Colorado G O P  chairman   That is what my job is  CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesSome states are so fully in the grips of Trump enthusiasts that the campaign has sought to keep Mr  Trump neutral in local races  out of concern that he could alienate one supportive faction or another  In Rhode Island last weekend  the campaign dispatched an aide to answer questions from party activists about Mr  Trump s view of the race for state chairman  after Sean Spicer  the former White House press secretary  reportedly made calls on behalf of a candidate who was ultimately defeated  The Trump campaign made clear that Mr  Spicer had been acting on his own  a person familiar with the conversations said Last month  several top Trump strategists  including Mr  Stepien and Mr  Clark  informed the president directly on the efforts to lock down party organizations for his re election  people briefed on the meeting said  In a statement  Mr  Clark described the operation as part of a long run up to the 2020 convention  Like any good campaign operation  we are working to ensure that state party chairs and delegates reflect the will of Republican voters  who support President Trump in record numbers   Mr  Clark said   Our goal is to pave the way for a convention in Charlotte that gives the president a multiday platform to share his achievements with 300 million Americans  Though the Republican National Committee has stopped short of formally endorsing Mr  Trump  state chairmen elected with the help of Mr  Trump s campaign have defended him fiercely  even from Mr  Weld s long shot effort  When the former Massachusetts governor rolled out his campaign  Mr  Lyons blasted him harshly  as did Stephen Stepanek  a former co chairman for the Trump campaign in New Hampshire who now leads that state s Republican Party That hard edge approach has stirred some discomfort in New Hampshire  where some traditional Republicans prize the state s reputation for political independence and have resisted efforts to quash an open primary  Steve Duprey  a member of the Republican National Committee from the state  hosted Mr  Weld there in late March and argued that New Hampshire s  special role  as an early voting state required it to be open to candidates besides Mr  Trump  He said in an interview he believed primary competition was healthy  as a general matter  Our job is to be neutral and treat them all equally  period   argued Mr  Duprey  who was a close adviser to John McCain There are still elements of the Republican Party that have yet to fall fully in line behind the president  Republicans acknowledge  The party suffered serious defections in 2018 among moderate white voters who have historically tended to support Republicans  and some of the party s traditional financial backers have not yet committed to supporting him in 2020  Advisers to Mr  Trump acknowledge that mobilizing the party s major donor base remains one of the most important challenges for his campaign But there is no comparable reticence among the Republican Party s field captains in the states  At the meeting in Colorado over the weekend  Vera Ortegon  the state s R N C  committeewoman  alluded to the president s nagging Republican critics in the form of a stern warning  If you know any Never Trumpers   Ms  Ortegon said   send them to me   

WASHINGTON   The Senate on Monday blocked billions of dollars in disaster aid for states across the country as Republicans and Democrats clashed over President Trump s opposition to sending more food and infrastructure help to Puerto Rico Opposition came from both parties for different reasons  Most Republicans refused to endorse a recovery bill passed this year by the House  They cited Mr  Trump s opposition to the bill s Puerto Rico funding  as well as their own concerns that the bill lacked money for Midwestern states  like Iowa and Nebraska  that have since been devastated by flooding and tornadoes For their part  Democrats balked at a separate measure drafted by Senate Republicans that included the money for the Midwest  arguing that a proposed  600 million in nutritional assistance for Puerto Rico was not enough  The Republican legislation had no chance in the House The votes on both measures were procedural and needed support from 60 senators to advance to a full floor vote  Neither won the support required  It was unclear late Monday how lawmakers would overcome that impasse and end the delay in disbursing the disaster aid The effort begins anew on Tuesday  when Senate Democrats will propose a measure that would allocate billions of dollars that would help Iowa and Nebraska  as well as Puerto Rico  according to a Senate Democratic aide Mr  Trump has been pressuring Democrats to support a disaster relief measure that does not include the money they want for Puerto Rico  and he went on the attack late Monday on Twitter  The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any  place  in history   he tweeted Puerto Ricans  are great   he added  but  their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works  Varying forms of recovery legislation have been in limbo since December  when an initial version was tacked on to legislation that could have prevented the 35 day government shutdown  And while the House passed a relief package in January  it was ultimately left out of the compromise measure that reopened the government Some lawmakers were optimistic that a resolution could be found quickly  Democrats in both chambers have pushed for a select group of lawmakers to draft legislation that borrows from both measures  I m sure we ll start talking again   said Senator Richard C  Shelby  Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee  He compared the negotiating process to a three legged stool   You ve got the House  you ve got the Senate and the presidency   We re hopefully at a point where we can get some serious negotiations going   he said Still  senators from both parties tried to used the disaster relief votes to their political advantage Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  said that  tonight  my colleagues had the opportunity to choose action over obstruction   Shamefully   he added   Senate Democrats said no  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Democrat of California  said in a statement that  Congress used to set politics aside after major disasters and help victims in their time of need   partisan infighting won t rebuild a single home or school  Even Puerto Rican politicians could not agree on which of the measures to support  Gov  Ricardo A  Rosselló  a Democrat  urged lawmakers to endorse the House legislation  But Representative Jenniffer González Colón  a Republican  spoke out in favor of the Senate measure  Ms  González Colón is the island s sole representative in Congress  but she cannot vote Even before the votes on Monday  Republicans had tried to turn disaster relief into a 2020 presidential campaign issue  To my colleagues across the aisle who have been spending a lot of time in Iowa lately as presidential candidates   Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  said on the Senate floor   how are you going to look Iowans in the eye and justify a vote against moving this disaster relief bill ahead  Democrats have sought to frame Republican opposition as a slight against Puerto Rico  Nutrition assistance is not enough   Puerto Rico needs to rebuild   said Senator Patrick J  Leahy of Vermont  the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee  

PARIS   The president of Algeria resigned Tuesday night under pressure from the army following weeks of mass protests  closing out the reign of North Africa s longest serving leader but not ending a political impasse in a country where the street is demanding revolutionary change The state news agency said that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  who is ailing and paralyzed and has not spoken to his countrymen in seven years  had submitted his resignation His departure followed quickly after a statement from the chief of staff of Algeria s army  the traditional arbiter of political life in the country  calling for an  immediate  declaration from the constitutional council that Mr  Bouteflika was unfit for office Mr  Bouteflika  who was president for 20 years  had sought to prolong his rule  pushed by family members and others in Algeria s ruling elite who sought  the preservation of their narrow personal interests   the army chief of staff  Gen  Ahmed Gaid Salah  said Tuesday night The general s declaration was enough to force Mr  Bouteflika out  Only a day earlier  the president had said he would resign before the end of his term  April 28  but that was not quick enough for either the army or the protesters It was an inglorious end to a career that encompassed nearly 60 years  and some of the most treacherous politics in the Arab world  in a country that is one of the world s major oil and gas producers and is considered a bulwark against Islamist terrorism The Algerian revolution of 2019  peaceful and focused in its demand for radical change  is giving pause to authoritarian neighbors from Egypt to the Gulf to Sudan who have managed to thwart the street and had hoped that this kind of revolt was behind them Mr  Bouteflika began as the world s youngest foreign minister in the 1960s  as the henchman of one of Algeria s revolutionary leaders  and he spent long years in exile after being disgraced in a financial scandal at the end of the 1970s ImageAlgerian students taking part in a demonstration against the government in Algiers on Tuesday CreditMohamed Messara EPA  via ShutterstockHe came back to politics at the behest of the country s generals to salve the wounds of a savage civil war  becoming president in 1999 and quickly bolstering his reputation as a master maneuverer by reaching a deal with insurgent Islamists But in the end  hobbled by severe infirmity  manipulated by his immediate circle  and blinded   according to those who know him   by years in power  he pushed too far  seeking a fifth term in office That enraged a hitherto acquiescent population  which took to the streets on Feb  22 and has not left them since For now  Algerians appear to be stuck with much of the vestiges of the Bouteflika power structure  even with the president stepping down Clearly wanting to maintain control after his initial announced departure on Sunday  Mr  Bouteflika installed a new government on Sunday night  and  ominously  promised  important decisions  before he stepped down The words set off alarm bells throughout the country  Algerians  well aware of their president s reputation as a wily political operator  greeted the announcement with deep suspicion  They do not want  continuity  with any part of Mr  Bouteflika s long regime  They want a clean start Then on Tuesday night  the army  anxious to declare itself in sync with the broad based popular movement  said Mr  Bouteflika had to leave immediately What comes next is uncertain The ministers Mr  Bouteflika appointed as a parting gesture could remain in office for some months ImageThe Algerian Army chief of staff  Gen  Ahmed Gaid Salah  presiding at a military parade in Algiers last year CreditAnis Belghoul Associated PressThe protesters may want a clean break  but it is not certain that the army will go along with that  or with bypassing constitutional provisions that call for the appointment of the president of the Senate  a Bouteflika ally  as the temporary president until elections are held Algeria has known democracy only in fleeting interludes  The only election which clearly reflected popular sentiment was a vote for the Islamists in 1991  after which the army stepped in  canceled a second round and unleashed a brutal civil war that killed more than 100 000 people Yet the crowds that have clogged the streets of Algiers since Feb  22   remarkably peaceful  festive and determined   appear to believe that  if they are to have a democracy  the country must reconstruct everything afresh after decades of corrupt  authoritarian rule This is why they yell  Système dégage   or   System  get lost   The whole apparatus of the state with its phony legalism and its compromised nomenklatura  they insist  must go Like the master politician he is  Mr  Bouteflika  though barely capable of even a pained grimace  appeared to exploit the vagueness of the crowd s demands  The president   or at least those around him   spoke of  continuity  and a  transition  But the army had lost patience On Tuesday evening the standoff between General Salah and Mr  Bouteflika s circle sharpened as the general accused  certain individuals  of prolonging the crisis  An army statement quoted the general as wondering about  this handful of people  who have  amassed immense riches through illegal means   a clear jab at the businessmen around Mr  Bouteflika He called for the  immediate  application of the constitutional provisions that deem Mr  Bouteflika unfit At the end  Mr  Bouteflika was  playing a kind of liar s poker   Abdelaziz Rahabi  one of his former ministers who is now in the opposition  said in an interview Tuesday afternoon before the president resigned  The purpose  he said   to have guarantees for himself and his family  ImageIn 1963  Ahmed Ben Bella  left  then the president of Algeria  talked with Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algiers CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesIn his early days as a flamboyant  mustachioed foreign minister  Mr  Bouteflika symbolized the Third World pugnacity of the 1960s  Later  as a crafty leader  he drew a healing line underneath the shocking violence of Algeria s 1990s civil war  at the price of a willful national amnesia And always Mr  Bouteflika proved himself to be a survivor  He s had a reputation for being especially adroit and cunning  not a conviction politician  not someone who stood clearly for any principle   said Hugh Roberts  an Algeria expert at Tufts University His tenacity was a lesson learned over a very long career  In 1965 he helped his mentor  the army colonel Houari Boumediene  overthrow the revolutionary leader Ahmed Ben Bella After Mr  Boumediene s death in 1979  Mr  Bouteflika  faced charges of embezzlement and  almost went to prison   said the Algerian political sociologist Nacer Djabi Mr  Bouteflika had been accused of putting foreign ministry money in Swiss bank accounts  the journalist Mohamed Benchicou reported in his book   The Bouteflika Mystery   His reputation was blackened   said the political scientist Louisa Ait Hamadouche The lesson for Mr  Bouteflika and his circle   You ve got to stay in power  in the presidency  until the end   Mr  Djabi said  He can t reform    Mr  Djabi said    because he doesn t believe in democracy or politics  His former minister  Mr  Rahabi  said Mr  Bouteflika s obstinacy was dangerous  He s got a suicidal obsession with power   Mr  Rahabi said In throwing off Mr  Bouteflika in a so far peaceful revolution  and in forcing the army to take its side  the Algerian protesters have already scored gains beyond those achieved in many countries during the Arab spring of 2011  It s an entire population that is waking up after a long period of national hibernation   said Zoubir Arous  a sociologist  

WASHINGTON   The House voted Wednesday to condemn the Trump administration for pushing a federal appeals court to obliterate the Affordable Care Act  and it urged the Justice Department to defend the law in court The vote  240 186  was nonbinding  but it documented the House s support of the health law  which was passed nine years ago without the votes of any Republicans  With the resolution  Democrats sought to put Republicans on the record for failing to come to the defense of the health law s most popular provisions  such as protecting people with pre existing medical conditions and mandating coverage for  essential health benefits   like mental health coverage  prescription drugs  emergency services and maternity care Eight Republicans voted for it  One Democrat opposed  The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land  and it is the responsibility of the Justice Department and the administration to defend the law of the land in court   Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said   What are they doing  Just the opposite  Why  Because they don t believe in governance  That is why they are happy to shut down government  The resolution  which expresses the sentiment of the House but is not subject to approval by the Senate or by President Trump  states   The actions taken by the Trump administration seeking the invalidation of the A C A  s protections for people with pre existing conditions  and later the invalidation of the entire A C A   are an unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people  Republicans called it an empty gesture  This will do nothing for your health care   said the House Republican leader  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California   But what will it do  It will make a great press release  Representative Greg Walden  Republican of Oregon  said the resolution was a political screed and  doesn t do a darn thing to protect people with pre existing conditions   Democrats would rather play politics with health care and attack the president for political purposes  rather than work with us on what could and should be bipartisan solutions   Mr  Walden said Democrats relished the opportunity to test Republicans  commitment to health care  an issue sure to figure in 2020 elections  I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeatedly claim that they stand for protections for people with pre existing conditions and for other protections included in the Affordable Care Act   said Representative Frank Pallone Jr  of New Jersey  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee   Well  now is your chance to show it  A federal judge in Texas invalidated all of the Affordable Care Act in December  Last week the Trump administration told the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  in New Orleans  that it agreed with the judge s decision  California and other states that support the Affordable Care Act have appealed the decision If the entire law is struck down  millions of people could lose coverage provided through the expansion of Medicaid and through private insurance subsidized by the federal government ImageRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California  the House Republican leader  called the House resolution an empty gesture   This will do nothing for your health care   he said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesRepublicans have voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act  and many were reluctant this week to criticize the position taken in court by the Trump administration  But they said they would be ready to respond if the law falls to a legal challenge  If the court strikes down the Affordable Care Act  Republicans will act to protect those with pre existing conditions   said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas  the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee   We will work to make health care more affordable  guaranteeing that folks can see local doctors or go to their local hospitals  and we will preserve other important provisions  such as no lifetime limits and allowing kids to stay on their parents  plans until age 26  At the same time  Mr  Brady called the existing health law unconstitutional and called the resolution criticizing the Justice Department a  political stunt  The House Energy and Commerce Committee is working on legislation to hold down insurance costs and reverse what Democrats describe as the administration s efforts to sabotage the health law But Senate Republicans have been badly divided as they consider a response to Mr  Trump s announcement late Monday on Twitter that the party was  developing a really great HealthCare Plan  to replace the Affordable Care Act Some  averse to an election year fight on the issue  have said they would wait to see what Mr  Trump might propose  Some have praised him for raising the issue again  Back home  what we have right now is an unmitigated disaster   said Senator David Perdue  Republican of Georgia   As an elected official  it s our responsibility to bring solutions  And what President Trump is saying is that if Congress is gridlocked right now  which it is on this topic  then he wants to start a dialogue about what it is he stands for  And I applaud that  But Mr  Trump pulled back his request for a health law replacement after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  told him no such legislation would be coming before the 2020 election Opinion polls show that Democrats have a political advantage on health care  Asked why voters should trust Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act  after they failed in 2017  Senator Ron Johnson  Republican of Wisconsin  said   I would understand their skepticism  The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the health law s requirement for people to have insurance   the individual mandate   as an exercise of Congress s taxing power  Judge Reed O Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth ruled that the requirement became unconstitutional after Congress brought that tax penalty to zero in the tax cut signed by Mr  Trump in 2017  and he said that other provisions of the law could not survive because they were inextricably linked to the mandate Two Republican state attorneys general  Dave Yost of Ohio and Tim Fox of Montana  filed a legal brief this week saying there was  no basis  to strike down the whole law just because the individual mandate was unconstitutional They said the mandate could be severed from the health law without throwing out other provisions  like the protections for people with pre existing conditions  The Justice Department under Mr  Trump initially said that the mandate and the protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down  But last week  the department went further and said it agreed with the Texas judge who ruled the entire law was invalid  

WASHINGTON   House Republicans are expected as soon as Thursday to try to add an amendment on anti Semitism to a Yemen war resolution  giving Democrats a wrenching choice  Vote down the amendment amid charges that their party is coddling anti Semites  or approve it and kill a hard fought resolution aimed at ending American involvement in Saudi Arabia s war While Republicans are keeping a close hold over their plans  Democrats and Jewish groups are convinced that the minority will try the maneuver to derail the Yemen resolution and embarrass Democrats in one maneuver  In February  a similar last minute procedural motion to condemn anti Semitism caught Democrats off guard  and knocked the Yemen resolution off its fast track to President Trump s desk But this time  Democrats are prepared   and are already laying the groundwork to accuse Republicans of a cynical attempt to weaponize anti Semitism  In a closed door meeting this week  Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the No  2 Democrat and a vocal supporter of Israel  implored members to oppose any Republican motion  If anybody thinks that I m not supportive of an anti Semitism resolution  you don t know much about my history  and I m going to tell that to the members on the floor   Mr  Hoyer later told reporters   This is about Yemen  This is not about some extraneous  maybe very important  but extraneous and undermining  amendment The last minute push by Democrats illustrates the lingering unease in the caucus as Republicans seek to divide them on support for Israel  And it demonstrates a renewed resolve among leadership to take a hard line against allowing members to derail major pieces of legislation by signing on to Republicans  politically freighted procedural motions Republicans have twice successfully used the tactic to divide Democrats and put them on the spot over hot button issues  once on immigration and a second time on anti Semitism  Both amounted to embarrassing setbacks for Democrats  and both emboldened Republicans  who see an opening to woo Jewish voters  a core component of the Democratic base ImageRepresentative Ro Khanna  the lead sponsor of a Yemen resolution  described the Republican maneuver as  a divisive tactic of anti Semitism to block an effort to save lives in Yemen  CreditErin Schaff for The New York Times I don t see the issue going away   said Representative Lee Zeldin of New York  one of two Jewish Republicans in the House   Silence isn t an option  Debate over anti Semitism and Israel has been roiling Democrats for months after comments by one of their freshmen  Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota  that many construed as anti Semitic  Republicans have seized on the issue  Mr  Trump has tried to brand Democrats as  anti Jewish   despite his own history of trafficking in anti Semitic tropes Republicans used the conference last week of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  the nation s largest pro Israel lobby  to attack Democrats over Israel and anti Semitism  Speaking to the group s 18 000 delegates  Vice President Mike Pence asserted that the Democratic Party  has been co opted by people who promote rank anti Semitic rhetoric  The recent controversy spurred Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and the lead sponsor of the Yemen resolution  to conduct private meetings with his Democratic colleagues to prepare for a possible Republican effort to derail the resolution  This is a bill about preventing a famine for 14 million Yemenis   Mr  Khanna said in an interview   It s about saving lives and liberty of women and children  and I find it offensive that the Republicans would use a divisive tactic of anti Semitism to block an effort to save lives in Yemen  Even as Democrats rebuke the tactic  it is not going away  Some veteran Jewish lawmakers  notably Representative Eliot L  Engel of New York  the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  and freshmen in swing districts  privately worried that it would be difficult to vote against a resolution supporting Jews or the Jewish state  according to people familiar with the discussions And at least two House Democrats  Representatives Elaine Luria of Virginia and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey  suggested they would have difficulty doing so  Ms  Luria said she would vote in accordance with her values  And Mr  Gottheimer said   This is a matter of principle for me  I have always stood strong against anti Semitism and always will  Democrats have already voted twice to condemn anti Semitism  once when the Yemen resolution first came up for a vote  and a second time as part of a broader resolution condemning all forms of bigotry after the uproar over Ms  Omar  If they had not approved the first anti Semitism amendment  the Yemen resolution would have reached Mr  Trump s desk weeks ago  Because the amendment was attached  the Senate had to start from scratch on a new Yemen resolution ImageGraffiti in Sana a  Yemen  protesting American drone airstrikes CreditYahya Arhab EPA  via ShutterstockJewish House Democrats  led by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  responded to the Republican efforts by introducing their own resolution condemning the boycott Israel movement Mr  Khanna said Democrats needed to do more  by going on offense against Republicans Last week  for instance  Representative Mo Brooks  Republican of Alabama  read from Hitler s manifesto   Mein Kampf   on the House floor to compare Democrats and the news media to Nazis who pushed political propaganda  And Representative Louie Gohmert  Republican of Texas  invoked Hitler during a Judiciary Committee hearing in which he compared socialists to Nazis in an effort to tar the Democratic left  Where are the voices calling for censure  of Mr  Brooks and Mr  Gohmert  Mr  Khanna asked on Twitter Representative Max Rose  Democrat of New York and the first Jewish lawmaker to represent his district  which has a large Yemeni population  has strongly urged his colleagues to turn back any attempts to weaponize anti Semitism to derail the legislation  The ongoing war in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has taken thousands and thousands of innocent lives  devastating families in my community back home   Mr  Rose said   I don t play politics when it comes to national security or rising anti Semitism  Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for using my faith and this issue as a political wedge  The resolution  which condemns a nearly four year conflict in Yemen that has inflicted a devastating famine  has faced a long and difficult road in getting to Mr  Trump s desk  The House easily passed it in February  But by attaching the unrelated Republican resolution over anti Semitism  Democrats stripped the bill of its so called privileged status  which would have allowed the Senate to take it up quickly and send it to Mr  Trump The Senate eventually did pass the measure  and now it is back to the House for what is essentially a do over If it passes the House cleanly  the president has promised to veto it  the second veto of his term  

ISTANBUL   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confronted the prospect of a stunning political defeat on Monday  as local voting in Turkey showed his party had lost the capital  Ankara  and possibly Istanbul  its largest city and his key base of support for many years The results of the municipal balloting on Sunday from around the country was a telling barometer of Mr  Erdogan s weakened standing with voters  as Turkey s economy has fallen into a recession and he has assumed sweeping new executive powers Mr  Erdogan was not conceding defeat on the results in Istanbul  which were still unofficial  But the head of the High Election Council said the opposition mayoral candidate  Ekrem Imamoglu  was leading the Istanbul race by 27 806 votes  with only 24 000 remaining ballots to be counted  The mathematics of the issue is over   Mr  Imamoglu told a news conference  asserting there was no way that the candidate of Mr  Erdogan s Justice and Development Party  former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim  could catch up If the Istanbul results are confirmed  the Justice and Development Party is likely to appeal to the High Election Council ImagePresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan after voting in municipal elections in Istanbul on Sunday CreditBulent Kilic Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Erdogan claimed victory over all in the elections  pointing to results that showed his party 15 points ahead of the opposition Republican People s Party in districts nationwide But for the first time in his political career  Mr  Erdogan was tasting defeat not only in mayoral races in the center of Turkish political power  Ankara  but his hometown  Istanbul  the country s business center  Please do not be heartbroken with this result   he told supporters in an address Sunday evening   We will see how they are going to administer  Rusen Cakir  a veteran commentator  said on Twitter that the turnaround was as historic as Mr  Erdogan s arrival on the political stage  when  as an Islamist and former political prisoner  he first won the mayorship of Istanbul  The election today is as historic as the local election in 1994   Mr  Cakir said   It s the announcement of a page that was opened 25 years ago and is now being closed  If Mr  Erdogan s candidate loses the Istanbul race  it would be a severe blow to his party  which after 17 years in power has been showing a decline in popularity ImageTurks casting ballots at a school in Istanbul CreditChris Mcgrath Getty Images While losing Istanbul would be a nuclear defeat for Erdogan   said Soner Cagaptay  director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy   losing Ankara  which is shorthand for political power and government  is a pretty significant loss  In a sign of how seriously he regarded these elections  Mr  Erdogan held up to eight campaign rallies a day across the country  taking center stage in the municipalities as he portrayed the vote as a matter of  national survival  and a chance to cement his administration  in perpetuity  The declining economy was at the forefront of voters  concerns  After years of impressive growth  Turkey entered a recession in March  Unemployment is over 10 percent  and up to 30 percent among young people  The Turkish lira lost 28 percent of its value in 2018 and continues to fall  and inflation has reached 20 percent in recent months Investment analysts reported that Turkey was depleting its international reserves to bolster the lira in the run up to the election  Finance Minister Berat Albayrak promised to announce a package of new financial measures after the election  but investment confidence remains weak  The campaign showed Erdogan s desperation to win   said Asli Aydintasbas  a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations   He is vulnerable because of his declining votes  While Mr  Erdogan remains by far the most popular politician in the country  his party failed to secure a majority in parliamentary elections in June and was forced into an alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party  A referendum in 2017 that gave him sweeping new authority over the legislature and the judiciary was approved by just a narrow majority of Turks ImageA photograph released by the Turkish presidential news service showed Mr  Erdogan  center  at a rally in March with political allies CreditPresidency of TurkeyEven pro government newspaper columnists warned that corruption and cronyism in the municipalities were turning voters away from the ruling party  Opinion polls showed that a larger percentage of voters than usual remained undecided right up to the election  which officials of his party took as a sign of unhappiness among the electorate Opposition candidates offered change and promised to create jobs  improve education and bolster social services  And some were blistering in their criticism of Mr  Erdogan A former deputy prime minister to Mr  Erdogan  Abdullatif Sener  said that while the economy was tanking  Mr  Erdogan was building not only a second but also a third presidential palace  and spending millions to fly around on his presidential plane Municipal elections usually draw little notice outside Turkey  But the local votes for mayors  municipal councils and neighborhood administrators was seen as critical to Mr  Erdogan s grip on power The municipalities represent the core of his working class  conservative power base and a source of income for his party  said Aykan Erdemir  a former member of Parliament and a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies  a research institute in Washington Mr  Erdogan began his career as the mayor of Istanbul  and built his popularity on providing local services like garbage collection and mass transport ImageA member of the Turkish special forces giving gifts to supporters of Mr  Erdogan in Istanbul on Sunday CreditTolga Bozoglu EPA  via ShutterstockThe president intervened personally in the race for mayor of Istanbul  pushing his longtime ally Mr  Yildirim to run when the race promised to be close  He picked another former minister to run for mayor of Ankara  the capital Mr  Erdogan also adopted a more negative tone on the campaign trail than in previous elections  He threatened lawsuits  accused the opposition of criminality or terrorism  and whipped up nationalist anger at rallies  Conjuring up a clash of civilizations  he even played edited segments of a video of the mass shooting at mosques in Christchurch  New Zealand On the economy  Mr  Erdogan told supporters that the municipalities had nothing to do with the downturn  and that he as president would handle economic matters  In the weeks before the vote  the government set up municipal stalls to sell cheap vegetables to combat rising prices Most political analysts had predicted that however dissatisfied they were  supporters of his party  known as AKP  were unlikely to make the leap to vote for the opposition alliance  But some voters in the AKP held district of Uskudar in Istanbul said they were switching  We had enough   a middle aged voter  Mustafa Topal  said after voting   We had enough of this robbery  The system of ransacking led to my change  Younger people across the political spectrum have also voiced dissatisfaction  chafing at the lack of media freedom and the dearth of job prospects  said Ms  Aydintasbas  the European Council fellow  I think this is a growing trend that you cannot suppress   she said   There is a second generation of young urban kids who are not behaving like the AKP  They have yearnings not unlike those of the kids on the other side of the tracks   They feel it is odd   she added   to have Erdogan s picture all over town like a Central Asian republic  and every time you turn on the TV he is on   

WASHINGTON   House Democrats formally punted on releasing a budget blueprint on Tuesday  instead unveiling a bill that would increase military and domestic spending caps by more than  350 billion over the next two years The proposal frustrated fiscal hawks on both sides of the aisle and Democrats on the party s left flank who balked at the prospect of increasing military spending  It also meant that House Democrats  without a blueprint to counter the one the Trump administration released last month  had effectively opted out of outlining their own budget priorities in the face of a divided government and division within their caucus Several Democratic lawmakers and aides argued that with a Republican controlled Senate and White House  it would be futile to release a budget resolution  a nonbinding document that usually serves as a statement of priorities as opposed to actual policy  There is little chance that the budget proposals put forward by the Trump administration and the Senate Budget Committee could prevail in the House  By moving this bill forward  we will bring responsible governing back to the budget process  avoid uncertainty and the unrelenting threats of a government shutdown  and meet our obligations to the American people   said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky  the chairman of the House Budget Committee and a chief sponsor of the bill But the decision highlighted the friction within the Democratic Party over how to approach spending and what to prioritize in a budget document   and contradicted the new majority s promise for regular order  House Democrats are in disarray   Representative Steve Womack  Republican of Arkansas and the ranking member on the House Budget Committee  said in a statement   Their agenda is so full of contradictions that they re unable to govern  Republicans  with a majority in both the House and the Senate  failed to pass their own budget resolution last year  which Democrats denounced at the time Even before the Democrats  endeavor was released  Republicans had criticized it as hypocritical  with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California  the minority leader  echoing a mantra often used by Speaker Nancy Pelosi   Show me your budget  show me your values   They have no budget   Mr  McCarthy said last week at a news conference   Does that mean they have no values  But Mr  Yarmuth and other Democratic lawmakers said the legislation introduced on Tuesday would shift the focus to a more pressing issue  the spending caps enacted in 2011 under the Budget Control Act  which would automatically cut military and domestic spending by billions of dollars without action from Congress While Congress has made bipartisan deals to raise the caps for the current fiscal year  a failure to do so for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years would cut programs by  125 billion  I think the caps bill is exactly what s needed   said Joel Friedman  the vice president for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities   The Yarmuth solution is a better use of everyone s time and energy because of the political landscape we re facing  Lawmakers have generally waived the restrictions  first struck as part of a deal between congressional Republicans and President Barack Obama  in order to accommodate spending increases  Removing the caps would also jump start the process of funding the government in 2020  which Democratic leadership has said it wants to do well before the Sept  30 deadline  The budget resolution doesn t change the Budget Control Act numbers   said Mr  Yarmuth  who has spent the past few weeks meeting with members and discussing what a budget resolution would look like   The vast majority of the caucus thinks that s the No  1 priority  Fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill called for the release of a full budget  bemoaning the partisan decline of what they said was a fundamental responsibility for both parties  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the deal  which would also allow for funding increases to carry out the 2020 census and support tax enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service  would increase spending by roughly  2 trillion over the next decade  The way we ve been running our government is irresponsible   said Representative Stephanie Murphy  Democrat of Florida and a chairwoman of the Blue Dog Coalition  a fiscally conservative group of Democrats   It may take some political courage and some responsible governing  but we have to get back to a time when we set our priorities in a budget   We should be able to pass a bipartisan budget  and there was a time when we were able to do that   she added in an interview Democrats on the party s left flank said Mr  Yarmuth s proposal allocated too much money to military spending   money they argued should be directed toward domestic programs  You cannot be opposed to Trump s foreign policy of militarism and then vote for the budgets that carry it out   Representative Ro Khanna  Democrat of California and a vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus  said in an interview   The defense increases are totally unjustified  In a statement released late Tuesday  Mr  Khanna  a member of the Budget Committee  said he would encourage those  who are committed to a progressive agenda to join me in opposing defense funding for endless wars  It is unclear how Mr  Yarmuth s legislation will fare before a committee meeting on Wednesday afternoon Representative Steny H  Hoyer of Maryland  the majority leader  said he thought that Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  would try to delay a deal on the spending caps until the end of the year to have more leverage in negotiations  It shouldn t be difficult   Mr  Hoyer told reporters  But  he added   I think that s what the administration has concluded  that they ll have more leverage at the end of the year   

Just when it seemed that democracy was all but dead in Turkey  voters delivered a sharp electoral rebuke to their authoritarian president  Recep Tayyip Erdogan Unofficial results in municipal elections over the weekend show that Mr  Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party lost control of Ankara  the capital  and Istanbul  the financial center and launching pad for Mr  Erdogan s political career Mr  Erdogan was not on the ballot  and his party still controls Parliament  but the vote was the worst election defeat of his nearly two decades in office  And while he won re election last year  a 2017 referendum that only narrowly gave him new authority over the legislature and judiciary presaged his weakening support Opposition candidates in the municipal races capitalized on growing discontent with his repression and economic mismanagement  The results signaled that  if the opposition stays united and forward looking  it could mount a true challenge to Mr  Erdogan in the next presidential election  in 2023 The president s main rival  the Republican People s Party  and its allies promised political change  job creation  better education and improved social services  Opposition members carefully monitored vote tallies and have even slept on sacks of counted ballots to ensure they are not tampered with by Erdogan loyalists Meanwhile  the pro Kurdish People s Democratic Party s disciplined effort in the bigger cities to support Republican People s Party candidates most likely provided the winning margin in Istanbul and Ankara For more than a decade  Mr  Erdogan has dominated Turkey  promoting Islamic religious values and ruthlessly crushing those he sees as adversaries  Over the years  he has manipulated the system to accrue sweeping executive powers  control the army and crack down on civil liberties  His cronies largely control the media  but Turkey still jails more journalists than any other nation The president inserted himself directly into the local election process  handpicking a longtime ally  Binali Yildirim  to run for mayor of Istanbul and choosing a former minister to run for mayor of Ankara  Their losses could deprive the president of a vast patronage apparatus that has bolstered his rule  Appearing at as many as eight political rallies a day  Mr  Erdogan waged an aggressively negative campaign  accusing the opposition of criminality or terrorism  threatening lawsuits and fueling nationalist anger It s not surprising that voters saw the election as a referendum on Mr  Erdogan s rule  Turkey s economy fell into recession in March after years of enviable growth  The unemployment rate is now over 10 percent  and is as much as 30 percent among young people  In 2018  the value of the Turkish lira fell 28 percent  Inflation is at 20 percent  Voters  particularly the young  are also concerned about corruption among members of the Erdogan family and its allies  Mr  Erdogan s party is challenging the vote counts but said it would respect the results  despite his autocratic bent  Mr  Erdogan values the legitimacy that elections confer The United States and other Western democracies had been losing hope that Turkey can be a reliable ally given Mr  Erdogan s drift away from democratic values and NATO and toward Russia  The latest election results offer a chance to assure him that any tampering would widen that breach   and further endanger economic and military partnerships  One concern is that Mr  Erdogan could try to increase his flagging support by undertaking long threatened military operations against America s Kurdish allies in Syria  Such a move may backfire  particularly if the operations go poorly Especially now that Turkey s political opposition has shown it is alive and capable of pushing back  Opinion   Selim KoruHas Erdogan s Populism Reached Its Limits April 2  2019Erdogan  Turkey s Leader  Staring at Major Electoral DefeatMarch 31  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram

pension crisis  and fast  This is all hard   said David Axelrod  a longtime Chicagoan and political strategist   She s just pulled off an extraordinary political feat and that bespeaks a certain

political fighting that came to be known as Council Wars ImageHarold Washington  right  and his fiancée  Mary Smith  joined hands with State Senator Richard Newhouse as Mr  Washington declared victory in the 1983 mayoral race CreditKen Love Associated PressWhile Ms  Lightfoot is unlikely to encounter that level of organized resistance from the 50 member City Council  she will have to contend with it as a formidable governing body  theoretically powerful  thick with alliances and at least partly stocked with aldermen who supported Ms  Lightfoot s opponent in the mayoral race  Toni Preckwinkle  Historically  mayors like Ms  Lightfoot s predecessor  Rahm Emanuel  have held a firm hand over the council in setting the city s agenda  but Ms  Lightfoot s relationship with the aldermen is uncertain for now  None of them owe their elections to Lori  and so for the first time in perhaps 55 years  you may see the emergence of the kind of Chicago city government that during that time has only existed on paper   a weak mayor strong City Council government   said Marilyn Katz  a political consultant who worked on the Harold Washington campaign   What she uses to get them to vote for her proposals is unclear  David Orr  a former county clerk who served briefly as an interim Chicago mayor in the 1980s  said he thought Ms  Lightfoot s overwhelming margin of victory   she won all 50 of the city s wards   would ease her efforts to make inroads with the City Council  It s going to be a battle  O K    a battle in the sense that power never wants to give up what it s got   Mr  Orr said Ja Mal Green  an activist and former mayoral candidate who supported Ms  Lightfoot  said he believed that voters understood that Ms  Lightfoot could not instantly make all the changes she has pledged  She s not going to be able to make good on every promise   Mr  Green said   She ll be able to start the path for all the things that she promised  The City Council is not the only possible roadblock between Ms  Lightfoot and her ambitious agenda  Ms  Lightfoot  who promised in her campaign to kill what s left of the sputtering  Chicago machine   a system of patronage and corruption that once dominated city politics  will also face the challenge of working with Ms  Preckwinkle  who remains the president of the Cook County Board and will work in an office near Ms  Lightfoot Ms  Preckwinkle

through eight years in office She will quickly be tested  After running on promises to reduce gun violence  Ms  Lightfoot will take office just before summer  the season when shootings traditionally spike  No child should have to worry about the consequences of going to the park and no parent should have to keep their kids inside on a warm day for fear of violence   Ms  Lightfoot s campaign website said Generations of Chicago mayors have struggled to tamp down violence and root out police misconduct  sometimes making progress but never ending the problems  Ms  Lightfoot  who made the issues central to her campaign  will have to decide whether to pursue her promised changes with new leadership in the Police Department or keep Superintendent Eddie Johnson in his post Ms  Lightfoot s role with law enforcement is complex  She emerged in recent years as one of the chief critics of the police  and she led a panel that found patterns of excessive force  systemic racism and strained community relations in the department  But she has a background in law enforcement  including a stint as a federal prosecutor  and has worked in police oversight roles in Chicago  including as the president of the Chicago Police Board Vague Plan for a Financial MessPerhaps most of all  Ms  Lightfoot will be tested by the city s urgent fiscal woes All four of the pension funds are miserably underfunded  Ms  Lightfoot also must dream up a plan to solve an expected budget shortfall in the coming year  That all comes as Chicagoans are increasingly frustrated over mounting taxes and increased fees   and loath to even talk about digging up any more cash for City Hall  And the possibility of worse economic times could make matters even more dire  The city and state of Illinois descended into their worst in the nation financial condition during one of the longest economic expansions in U S  history   Laurence Msall  president of the Civic Federation  a watchdog group  said   Neither government is currently prepared to weather the storm in the event of a recession  particularly if it is deep or long lasting  The fiscal challenges have developed over decades and multiple mayors  and they loom  During a combative campaign  neither Ms  Lightfoot nor her opponent laid out a comprehensive plan to solve the problem  The hard part starts now   said Eric Adelstein  a political consultant in Chicago who helped with Ms  Lightfoot s campaign   There are huge challenges facing this city  It s an exciting moment  but these jobs are rough   

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration is preparing an economic relief package for Venezuela that would put United States dollars directly into the hands of Venezuelans in the event that the government of President Nicolás Maduro falls Larry Kudlow  the director of the White House s National Economic Council  disclosed the outlines of the plan on Wednesday as he called on Mr  Maduro to step aside and allow Juan Guaidó  the opposition leader whom the United States recognizes as Venezuela s interim president  to take office Plans for a comprehensive aid package for Venezuela come as President Trump is cutting aid to other countries  including Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  out of frustration over the way those nations have handled their migration policies  Mr  Trump has also threatened to cut funding to Puerto Rico  a United States territory  over its handling of federal hurricane relief funds  We have a lot of plans to revitalize the Venezuelan economy and to move very rapidly   Mr  Kudlow said at an event sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor   It would be a rescue plan  It would be a restructuring plan  Venezuela has been crippled for years by hyperinflation and a failing economy that has led millions to flee for Colombia and other countries  The nation has been further disrupted since January  when opposition political leaders refused to acknowledge as legitimate the re election of Mr  Maduro  The United States has thrown its support behind Mr  Guaidó  who declared himself interim president that month The administration is coordinating with regional banks in South America and the International Monetary Fund on a plan to stabilize Venezuela s teetering economy  Mr  Kudlow said  The Treasury Department  the National Economic Council and the National Security Council  he said  intend to use technology such as smartphones and apps to get American dollars to Venezuelans  There s many clever ways to get cash in there   Mr  Kudlow said   And the cash will not be bolívars  it will be dollars  The White House did not offer a timetable for the economic package or details about its scale  In recent months  the administration has imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela as part of a pressure campaign to topple the Maduro government  which has been receiving support from Moscow In March  Mr  Trump warned that Russia must  get out  of Venezuela after two Russian airplanes that were transporting military personnel arrived in Caracas  the capital of Venezuela  Russia has offered to send the Maduro government shipments of food and medicine as it struggles to confront soaring prices and widespread blackouts Mr  Kudlow said on Wednesday that more sanctions could be coming as the Trump administration seeks to ratchet up pressure on Mr  Maduro Venezuelans have been bearing the brunt of the political and economic turmoil in the country  Last month  the Red Cross received permission from Venezuela s government and its opposition leaders to roll out a global relief campaign that could help ease the humanitarian crisis Republicans and Democrats in Congress have expressed support for efforts to help revive Venezuela s economy  Senator Robert Menendez  Democrat of New Jersey  and Senator Marco Rubio  Republican of Florida  on Wednesday unveiled the Venezuela Emergency Relief  Democracy Assistance and Development Act  or the Verdad Act  to help bolster support for Mr  Guaidó The legislation would provide  200 million in aid for Venezuela and  200 million for neighboring countries to absorb refugees  It would also bolster sanctions against the Maduro government  We need to expand humanitarian assistance  address kleptocracy   formally support  Mr  Guaidó s efforts to restore democracy  Mr  Menendez wrote on Twitter  

WASHINGTON   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  using a little known provision in the federal tax code  formally requested on Wednesday that the I R S  hand over six years of President Trump s personal and business tax returns  starting what is likely to be a momentous fight with his administration Representative Richard E  Neal  Democrat of Massachusetts  hand delivered a two page letter laying out the request to Charles P  Rettig  the Internal Revenue Service commissioner  ending months of speculation about when he would do so and almost certainly prompting a legal challenge from the Trump administration Responding to questions from reporters in the Oval Office  Mr  Trump suggested that he would fight the request because  he said  he was being audited  I guess when you have a name  you are audited  but until such time as I m not under audit I would not be inclined to do that   he said  Read Mr  Neal s letter to the I R S  commissioner  The move by Mr  Neal came as other panels controlled by House Democrats were flexing their muscles  The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning authorized its chairman to use a subpoena to try to force the Justice Department to give Congress a full copy of the special counsel s report and all of the underlying evidence used to reach his conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 election And the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee said that he would soon ask for a vote on a subpoena of his own to compel Mazars USA  an accounting firm tied to the president  to produce a decade s worth of Mr  Trump s financial records  They have told us that they will provide the information pretty much when they have a subpoena   the chairman  Representative Elijah E  Cummings of Maryland  told reporters   And we ll get them a subpoena  Unlike the chairmen of other committees  Mr  Neal is not relying on a subpoena or standard congressional processes  Instead  he is invoking an authority enshrined in the tax code granted only to the tax writing committees in Congress that gives the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee the power to request tax information on any filer Mr  Neal gave the agency until April 10 to comply with the request  and if he receives the information  he will then confidentially review it with his committee staff The provision  which dates in some form to the Teapot Dome scandal of Warren G  Harding s administration  at least on its face gives the Trump administration little room to decline a request like Mr  Neal s  It only says that the Treasury secretary  shall  furnish the information  President Trump is the first president in nearly a half century to break precedent and refuse to voluntarily release his tax returns   said Representative Dan Kildee  Democrat of Michigan and a member of the Ways and Means Committee   The president is the only person who can sign bills into law  and the public deserves to know whether the president s personal financial interests affect his public decision making  The Treasury Department and the I R S  did not immediately respond to requests for comment But Democrats anticipate that the Trump administration will object to the request and force the matter into the courts  where its adjudication could take months or longer  Though the provision   No  6103 in the tax code   is invoked frequently by the committee  there is little precedent for using it to view the returns of a president who has not invited the scrutiny Republicans have vigorously argued against the request  saying that whatever justification Democrats produce will belie their true intent  to fish for information that could embarrass the president politically VideoThe House Judiciary Committee approved the authorization of a subpoena for a full copy of the Mueller report  The chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  said he would not issue this subpoena right away CreditCreditT J  Kirkpatrick for The New York TimesRepresentative Kevin Brady of Texas  the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee  called the request  an abuse of the tax writing committees  statutory authority   Weaponizing our nation s tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans  privacy rights   Mr  Brady said in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin   As you know  by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns  Defying modern presidential norms  Mr  Trump has refused since he became a candidate for president to release any of his tax returns  Democrats suspect the tax information could provide clues to wrongdoing by Mr  Trump  and they made getting the documents one of their top oversight priorities when they reclaimed control of the House in January  A New York Times investigation showed that the president engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father  Mr  Neal said he was making the request as part of his committee s oversight of  the extent to which the I R S  audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president   Under I R S  policy  the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year  Mr  Neal said the committee was considering legislation related to the issue  I take the authority to make this request very seriously  and I approach it with the utmost care and respect   Mr  Neal said in a statement   This request is about policy  not politics  my preparations were made on my own track and timeline  entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration  He added   I trust that in this spirit  the I R S  will comply with federal law and furnish me with the requested documents in a timely manner  In addition to Mr  Trump s personal returns for 2013 to 2018  Mr  Neal requested returns for Mr  Trump s trust and seven other core Trump business entities that control scores of other Trump operations  including his golf club in Bedminster  N J  He also asked the I R S  to share any information it had related to the entities  including whether they had been audited Liberal Democrats have complained for weeks that Mr  Neal  70 and a roll up your sleeves legislator  was dragging his feet on making the request  They have organized events in his district  taken out advertisements and produced legal briefs meant to make a case that he should act and act quickly Mr  Neal said throughout that he was chiefly concerned with crafting a request  alongside the House general counsel and the Ways and Means Committee staff  that could withstand legal challenge  I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative  legal and oversight rights   he said on Wednesday In the Judiciary Committee  the chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York  said he would not immediately issue the subpoena for the Mueller report  But the party line vote won by Democrats who control the committee ratchets up pressure on Attorney General William P  Barr as he decides how much of the nearly 400 page report to share with lawmakers  I will give him time to change his mind   Mr  Nadler said in his opening statement   But if we cannot reach an accommodation  then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials  The committee also approved subpoenas for five former White House aides who Democrats said were relevant to an investigation into possible obstruction of justice  abuse of power and corruption within the Trump administration They included Donald F  McGahn II  a former White House counsel  Stephen K  Bannon  the president s former chief strategist  Hope Hicks  a former White House communications director  Reince Priebus  the president s first chief of staff  and Annie Donaldson  a deputy of Mr  McGahn  

LAS VEGAS   Lucy Flores  the former Nevada politician who accused Joe Biden of inappropriately kissing her on the back of the head in 2014  rose from a tough childhood through top Democratic political circles before becoming an outspoken critic of sexism and harassing behavior in politics Flores was a high school dropout and former gang member who obtained a law degree and served two terms in the state assembly before making unsuccessful runs for Nevada s lieutenant governor s office and a Las Vegas area congressional seat She s now in the national spotlight after saying that the former vice president touched her inappropriately  Her assertion has brought new attention to Biden s well publicized affectionate mannerisms  raising questions about whether he s out of step with today s politics Flores now runs a Latina focused media company in Los Angeles  In an interview with The Associated Press  she said she wanted to bring attention to behavior by Biden that has often been brushed aside as a joke Noting that videos and photos have captured Biden s affectionate behavior toward women over the years  Flores said   Whether people want to believe me or not  frankly  I think at this point is kind of irrelevant  In a statement on Sunday  Biden said he has never intentionally behaved inappropriately during his many years in public life  If it is suggested I did so  I will listen respectfully   he said   We have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences  and men should pay attention  And I will The incident with Biden isn t Flores  first time speaking out about male behavior in politics In 2017  after several women accused former Nevada Democratic Rep  Ruben Kihuen of sexual harassment  Flores gave several interviews in which she recounted witnessing flirtatious  inappropriately close behavior by Kihuen toward other women Flores  who was Kihuen s high school classmate and a rival in a Democratic primary race for congress in 2016  served with him in the state legislature  He denied any wrongdoing She also backed allegations of sexism that a former female strategist for Bernie Sanders  2016 presidential campaign leveled against a former male staffer for the Vermont senator  Flores said she only interacted briefly with the man while she was a Sanders surrogate in 2016  But she later worked with the man at another company and said she experienced his  demeaning and sexist ways  Reuben D Silva  a former Democratic congressional candidate who lived in the same neighborhood as Flores and campaigned for Sanders with her  said he s known Flores as an outspoken advocate for women D Silva said he believes Flores and is proud of her speaking out  It doesn t surprise me that she s willing to even take on Joe Biden directly in the most high profile of ways  It s who she is   D Silva said Flores  a native of Glendale  California  has described overcoming a hardscrabble upbringing in Las Vegas as one of 13 children in a family with an often absent mother While serving in public office and campaigning in Nevada  she described joining a gang as a teenager  having an abortion at 16  dropping out of high school at 17 and serving nine months in juvenile detention for leading police on a chase in a stolen car  I was always the smart assed kid who was telling cops I knew my rights   she told a group of students in 2014   I really enjoyed the law and thought maybe one day I could be a lawyer  She said a second chance from a parole officer set her on a new course  leading her to eventually attend community college  earn a bachelor s degree at the University of Southern California and a law degree at the University of Nevada  Las Vegas in 2010 That fall  she was elected to the state assembly as part of a group of the first Latinas voted into the chamber  She served two terms  including a stint in leadership  before leaving to mount an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor Two years later  she lost to Kihuen in a three way Democratic primary for a Las Vegas area congressional seat Flores endorsed Sanders early in 2016 and the Vermont senator responded by urging supporters to contribute jointly to both campaigns  Sanders  backing bolstered Flores  campaign cache  providing as much as  600 000 of the  1 million she raised  according to Nevada political observers After losing in the primary  Flores was brought into Sanders  political orbit  She was selected as a board director of Our Revolution  a nonprofit political action group created during the 2016 campaign to help fund progressive candidates aligned with Sanders  Flores served on the group s board for more than a year  but grew disenchanted and left  she told the AP  because of the Sanders political organization s failure to bring qualified minority political leaders into his inner circle In her unsuccessful race for lieutenant governor  Flores tried to improve ties with the state s business community  But her campaign organization showed signs of instability  said several Nevada political observers  Two campaign managers departed early in that campaign before Flores settled on a third  Kristina Hagen  who remained for the duration of her Nevada race    Associated Press writers Tom Beaumont in Des Moines  Iowa  and Stephen Braun in Washington contributed to this report

CHICAGO   Former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot easily won the Chicago mayor s race Tuesday  earning support from every part of the city to defeat a longtime political insider and become the first black woman and openly gay person to lead the nation s third largest city Lightfoot  who had never been elected to public office  delivered a commanding victory over Toni Preckwinkle  who served in the City Council for 19 years before becoming Cook County Board president  Preckwinkle also is chairwoman of the county Democratic Party Lightfoot promised to rid City Hall of corruption and help low income and working class people she said had been  left behind and ignored  by Chicago s political ruling class  It was a message that resonated with voters weary of political scandal and insider deals  and who said the city s leaders for too long have invested in downtown at the expense of neighborhoods  Together we can and will make Chicago a place where your zip code doesn t determine your destiny   Lightfoot told a cheering crowd at her victory party   We can and we will break this city s endless cycle of corruption and never again   never ever   allow politicians to profit from elected positions  She said people are seeing  a city reborn    a place where race and  who you love  don t matter Chicago will become the largest U S  city to have a black woman serve as mayor when Lightfoot is sworn in May 20  She will join seven other black women currently serving as mayors in major U S  cities  including Atlanta and New Orleans  and will be the second woman to lead Chicago Preckwinkle said she called Lightfoot Tuesday night to congratulate her on a  hard fought campaign   While I may be disappointed I m not disheartened  For one thing  this is clearly a historic night   she told a crowd gathered in her South Side neighborhood   Not long ago two African American women vying for this position would have been unthinkable  And while it may be true that we took two very different paths to get here  tonight is about the path forward  Congratulations poured in for Lightfoot  56  who has one daughter with her wife  Amy Eshleman Brian Johnson  CEO of Equality Illinois  said the civil rights organization for lesbian and gay people was  thrilled  with the outcome  This victory is historic  and it is also an undeniably proud moment for the LGBTQ community   Johnson said Pete Buttigieg  the openly gay mayor of South Bend  Indiana  who s running for president in 2020  said on Twitter that Lightfoot  will be a terrific new leader for her city and in the community of American mayors  Lightfoot emerged as the surprising leader in the first round of voting in February when 14 candidates were on the ballot to succeed Mayor Rahm Emanuel  who decided against running for a third term Lightfoot seized on outrage over a white police officer s fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald to launch her reformer campaign  She got in the race even before Emanuel announced he wouldn t seek re election amid criticism for initially resisting calls to release video of the shooting  I m not a person who decided I would climb the ladder of a corrupt political party   Lightfoot said during a debate last month   I don t hold the title of committeeman  central committeeman  boss of the party  Preckwinkle countered that her opponent lacks the necessary experience for the job  This is not an entry level job   Preckwinkle said repeatedly during the campaign Joyce Ross  64  a resident of the city s predominantly black West Side who is a certified nursing assistant  cast her ballot Tuesday for Lightfoot  Ross said she believes Lightfoot will be better able to clean up the police department and curb the city s violence She was also bothered by Preckwinkle s association with longtime Alderman Ed Burke  who was indicted earlier this year on charges he tried to shake down a restaurant owner who wanted to build in his ward  My momma always said birds of a feather flock together   Ross said Truly Gannon  a 39 year old mother of four who works as a dietitian  said she wasn t bothered by stories that portrayed Preckwinkle as an insider aligned with questionable politicians like Burke  She supported Preckwinkle  based on her experience  I m not sure Lightfoot would be able to handle the job like Preckwinkle   she said The campaign between the two women got off to a contentious start  with Preckwinkle s advertising focusing on Lightfoot s work as a partner at Mayer Brown  one of the nation s largest law firms  and tagging her as a  wealthy corporate lawyer  Preckwinkle also tried to cast Lightfoot as an insider for working in police oversight posts under Emanuel and police oversight  procurement and emergency communications posts under Mayor Richard M  Daley But Preckwinkle had to spend much of her campaign answering for her ties to Chicago s political establishment  including Burke Despite the barbs on the campaign trail  the two advanced similar ideas to boost the city s deeply troubled finances  which include an estimated  250 million budget deficit next year and billions in unfunded pension liabilities Both candidates expressed support for a casino in Chicago and changing the state s income tax system to a graduated tax  in which higher earners are taxed at a higher rate   two measures lawmakers have tried for unsuccessfully for years to pass    Associated Press writer Don Babwin contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   A Connecticut woman said Joe Biden touched her inappropriately and rubbed noses with her at a 2009 political fundraiser  becoming the second person in three days to accuse the former vice president of unwanted physical contact as he considers a White House run  It wasn t sexual  but he did grab me by the head   Amy Lappos  43  told the Hartford Courant on Monday of her encounter with Biden at a Greenwich  Connecticut  event   He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me  When he was pulling me in  I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth  Lappos posted about the alleged incident in a Connecticut Women in Politics Facebook group on Sunday in response to an account by former Nevada state legislator Lucy Flores  who last week accused Biden of kissing her on the back of the head at a 2014 event The allegations could endanger a possible 2020 presidential run by Biden  who was vice president under President Barack Obama at the time of both alleged instances  He has been expected to announce a Democratic White House bid in the coming weeks and has been leading the Democratic presidential field in opinion polls Asked about the Connecticut allegation  a Biden spokesman pointed to Biden s statement on Sunday  when he said he did not believe he ever acted inappropriately during his many years in public life and on the campaign trail  I have offered countless handshakes  hugs  expressions of affection  support and comfort  And not once   never   did I believe I acted inappropriately   Biden said in the statement   If it is suggested I did so  I will listen respectfully  But it was never my intention  Biden has long been known for a warm and intimate campaign style  but his propensity for hugging and physical touching has come under new scrutiny in the  MeToo era as awareness about sexual assault and harassment has grown Lappos  a former aide to U S  Representative Jim Himes  told the Courant she felt uncomfortable when Biden approached her at a fundraiser for Himes  She said she was in the kitchen with three or four other volunteers when Biden moved toward her  I never filed a complaint  to be honest  because he was the vice president  I was a nobody   said Lappos  who is now a freelance worker with nonprofit agencies   There s absolutely a line of decency  There s a line of respect  Crossing that line is not grandfatherly  It s not cultural  It s not affection  It s sexism or misogyny  Lappos did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters Some Biden supporters rallied to his defense  Elizabeth Alexander  a former Senate and White House aide to Biden  wrote in a USA Today column that he supported women and was a champion for their rights even when it was not politically expedient   Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Howard Goller  

WASHINGTON   President Trump backed off plans to introduce a Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act after Senator Mitch McConnell privately warned him that the Senate would not revisit health care in a comprehensive way before the November 2020 elections Reversing himself in the face of Republican consternation  Mr  Trump said his party would not produce a health care plan of its own  as he had promised  until after the elections  meaning he will only try to fulfill his first term promise to repeal and replace his predecessor s signature program if he wins a second term The president s abrupt about face  announced on Twitter on Monday night after talking with Mr  McConnell  all but ensured that health care will take a central place in next year s campaign  elevating an issue Democrats consider one of their strengths  But it may take the legislative heat off Republicans exasperated by Mr  Trump s unexpected push to devise a wholesale replacement for President Barack Obama s health law in the coming months  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   Mr  McConnell  the majority leader from Kentucky  said on Tuesday   He did say  as he later tweeted  that he accepted that and that he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign  ImageListen to  The Daily   Trump Wanted to Scrap

over health care shows a sea change in the Republican stance heading into 2020 michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  President Trump has backed away from his call to replace the Affordable Care Act with a Republican alternative  Alex Burns on why the president s own party talked him out of it  It s Wednesday  April 3 alexander burnsSo last week was as close to a moment of total happiness as President Trump has had in a long time  music archived recording 1President Trump s legal team as well as many of those who are close to the president are saying they feel the Mueller report fully vindicates the president after nearly  archived recording 2There s no way to take this letter other than a huge win for the president archived recording 3To say White House officials are happily telling the American people I told you so  well  that would frankly be a bit of an understatement archived recording  donald trump And after three years of lies and smears and slander  the Russia hoax is finally dead  The collusion delusion is over alexander burnsThat s what makes it all the more surprising that his administration decided to dive right back into one of the most politically damaging fights of his whole presidency  which is health care archived recording 1The Trump Justice Department just announced a major reversal on Obamacare archived recording 2Today  he called the Affordable Care Act horrible and is mounting a push to kill it off archived recording 3Fresh off his Mueller investigation victory  some of his biggest supporters are questioning the timing archived recording 4Here you have a huge messaging win for the president and the White House with this Mueller summary  Why now  Why do this archived recording 5Why now  maybe even why at all michael barbaroAnd how does he dive back into that politically damaging fight alexander burnsHe directs the Justice Department to take sides in a lawsuit that has been making its way through the federal courts  It was brought by Republican legal officials in a number of states  It has been ruled on by one judge in Texas that the Affordable Care Act is invalid archived recordingA federal judge in Texas has just struck down Obamacare  True story  Judge Reed O Connor says the individual mandate  the part of the law that requires you to participate  is unconstitutional  And because it cannot be separated from the rest of the law  which it cannot be  the entire law is invalid alexander burnsIt is seen as a really long shot challenge to the Affordable Care Act  something that  in all likelihood  will probably not result in the law being struck down as a whole  but the White House was going to have to decide at some point whether they were going to defend the A C A  at the highest levels of the legal system or whether they were going to take sides against a law that s on the books that Congress failed to repeal when it had the chance  And that s what they did archived recording  donald trump We think it will be upheld  and we think it will do very well in the Supreme Court  And if the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out  we will have a plan that s far better than Obamacare michael barbaroAnd my sense is that under normal circumstances  the White House almost reflexively defends laws put on the books by Congress alexander burnsIt s a pretty extraordinary step for the president to take sides  not just against a law that s already on the books  but really the biggest piece of social legislation that s been passed in recent history  And he does it at the urging of some of his most conservative advisers in the White House  including the chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  archived recording  mick mulvaney And it s hard to know where to begin when you re talking about how bad the current health care legislation is for small business alexander burns  who  before he was a member of the Trump administration  was a hardliner in the House of Representatives waging war on the Affordable Care Act from Capitol Hill archived recording  mick mulvaney It s almost as if the folks who wrote this piece of legislation last year either have no idea how small business works or they don t care how small business works  Either way  the current health care legislation is a complete disaster for small business  and  alexander burnsThe argument that Mulvaney and others make is that if the president is going to run for re election as a guy who made promises and kept his promises  especially to conservative voters who still care a lot about getting rid of Obamacare  he has got to take every chance he has to go against it michael barbaroAnd given the dynamics of Congress  this is perhaps his best chance alexander burnsMaybe his only chance  because Democrats now control the House  There is really no shot for Republicans to pass a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act  So if they re going to take it down  they re going to take it down in the courts michael barbaroO K   well  what is the response to this announcement alexander burnsWell  Democrats are totally elated archived recording  nancy pelosi This is actually an opportunity for us to speak to the American people with clarity archived recording  chuck schumer It s a stark reminder of the difference between our two parties  Democrats are fighting to expand and improve health care coverage and lower costs while Republicans are trying to take it all away and raise costs alexander burnsThey have spent  at this point  several days on the defensive about some of the claims that they made about what was likely to be in Robert Mueller s report  They are desperate to get away from their own divisive fights about the nature of liberal health care policy  You have had  in the presidential primaries  in the House of Representatives  even in the Senate where Democrats aren t in control  just endless tugs of war between moderate liberals  very liberal Democrats  far left Democrats over what kind of health care system the country ought to have in an ideal world  Should it be European style single payer health care  Should it be a system that just totally does away with private health insurance  All these kinds of divisive debates on the left that have had Democrats tripping over each other  But President Trump weighs in the way he does on the Affordable Care Act  and all of a sudden all those conflicts hit pause archived recording  nancy pelosi Oh  no  please archived recording SINGING  Happy birthday to you alexander burnsAnd the timing on the Democratic side is sort of comical in that it is literally Nancy Pelosi s 79th birthday  archived recordingHappy birthday to you alexander burns  the morning after this Justice Department announcement comes out  And when you have Democrats singing  Happy Birthday  to her  there was this sense in the caucus that she had gotten the best gift a president could have given her michael barbaroWhat is the reaction from Republicans in Congress alexander burnsWell  real dismay and surprise and sort of horror archived recordingEven Republicans appear bewildered by President Trump s promise to make the G O P  the party of health care alexander burnsAnd not just from the few remaining relatively moderate Republicans archived recordingSome Republicans are nervous about that  including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy  According to Axios  McCarthy called the president and told him the decision made no sense  saying the health care battle helped Democrats win the House and several state capitals last year alexander burnsEvery Republican analysis of the midterm elections concluded that they lost the House because of health care more than any other individual policy issue  So if you are Kevin McCarthy  the new House minority leader  you are just appalled at the idea that your members are now going to have to have this fight all over again michael barbaroRight  We had talked about this with you during the midterms   that there had been this huge public shift on Obamacare and that voters who might have previously been against it now do not want it taken away alexander burnsThat s right  It was less of a thank you to Democrats than a punishment for Republicans  that Democrats never got the political boost back in 2010  2012  2014 that they hoped they would get for passing a big new social benefit  But what they did ultimately get was the benefit of voters turning against Republicans who wanted to take those benefits away  So Obamacare as a term  as a law  still kind of a mixed bag politically  but there are elements in that law  like protections for people with pre existing medical conditions  that are enormously popular  And Republicans look back on the last campaign  the one that ended really rather badly for them  and see that as  more than anything else  the fatal political mistake they made michael barbaroSo why would President Trump  the leader of the Republican Party  who had to have watched that same midterm that you re describing  why would he do this if the takeaway of that midterm is that the Affordable Care Act is no longer toxic and might even be liked by a wide cross section of Americans alexander burnsIn the president s public statements  and as far as we can tell based on his personal thinking  he recognizes that health care is a huge political vulnerability for Republicans  that the last thing they did on health care  that big repeal drive  was politically devastating to them  And his proclamation that they need to become the party of health care clearly reflects an understanding that a problem needs to be fixed archived recording  donald trump So we re going to get rid of Obamacare  And I said it the other day  The Republican Party will become the party of great health care  It s good  It s important michael barbaroI guess I can see President Trump s argument there  It feels kind of legitimate  Wouldn t it be smart for Republicans heading into the next presidential election  2020  to recognize that there are things that voters like about the Affordable Care Act  But in order for it to be a benefit for the Republicans and not the Democrats  they need to convince voters that the Democratic plan is a bad one and that Republicans will give them a better one alexander burnsRight  But giving voters a better version of health care provided by the Republican Party has always had to mean more than just getting rid of the system that currently exists  It s this strange kind of bifurcated mental space that Republicans have been living in politically  where they want to run against Democrats for trying to blow up the health care system and replace it with single payer  and  on the other side  they want to get rid of much of the existing health care system and replace it with something to be named later michael barbaroIn other words  they don t really have a plan to replace it alexander burnsThey don t  and they kind of never have  not a consensus plan that s supported by a broad cross section of the party and voters  And that s why when the president came out with this position through the Justice Department and then suggested that Republicans in Congress ought to come up with something great  the backlash from Republicans at the highest levels of the congressional party was swift and severe  The view among congressional Republicans was that this was just sort of a total fantasy coming from the president  The idea that they would not only come up with a plan and come up with a plan that would be popular and meet the standards that the president has laid out in rally after rally  but that they would do it within a year and then run on it in 2020 just seemed like it was cut from whole cloth michael barbaroIs there also a feeling among Republicans toward the president along the lines of  dude  we just want to stop calling attention to this issue  It s a losing issue for us  Stop drawing attention to it alexander burnsOh  absolutely  And if the concern among folks like Mick Mulvaney is that walking away from the fight looks like surrender  the view from a lot of Republicans on the Hill is they ve already lost  They can talk about how they lost  or they can talk about other stuff  and the president is choosing to talk about defeat michael barbaroRight  Instead of talking about what I had imagined Republicans would be talking about for the next couple of months and maybe even the next year  which is the Democratic fight over  Medicare for all   the Democratic fight over whether private insurance should even exist   I had expected that that would be the consuming discussion in the political world and in the political campaigns to come when it came to health care alexander burnsSo did I  and I think so did a lot of Republican candidates down the ballot preparing for 2020  There was always going to be tension in the Republican message about Democratic radicalism on health care  because if you are running in 2020 on the idea that Democrats are going to blow up the current system and replace it with European style medicine  you re kind of implicitly defending the status quo system as it exists under Obamacare  It s an extraordinarily awkward position for Republicans to be in  Can you be opposed to Democratic proposals to make the health care system even more liberal  even more regulated or structured by the government  without essentially defending the system that Barack Obama put in place  We don t know how they re going to walk that line  We don t know to what extent they ll even try  But the president s current approach  which is to say that Democrats will do something drastic and bad to your health care  and I m not quite going to tell you what I m going to do yet  doesn t seem sustainable michael barbaroSo what happens in the last 24 hours or so to this Trump led project to try to strike down  repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act alexander burnsWell  after days of other Republicans expressing public discomfort with where the president was headed  archived recording  mitch mcconnell So I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate alexander burns  Mitch McConnell  the Senate majority leader  conveyed in no uncertain terms to the White House that this was a non starter in the Senate  that the president was free to do what he wanted to do on health care  but that Senate Republicans were not going to be taking the lead on this  It was not a fight they wanted  period  full stop archived recording  mitch mcconnell So we don t have a misunderstanding about that  We will not be doing comprehensive in the Senate alexander burnsThe president seemed to have gotten the message archived recordingPresident Trump on the retreat archived recording  donald trump No  I wanted to delay it myself  I want to put it after the election alexander burnsAnd his response was to go onto Twitter and to declare that they are totally going to do all the things that he said they were going to do  but at a much later date  after the 2020 election michael barbaroRight  He cited the date 2021  We will do all this right after the election alexander burnsRight after an election when  in his construction  he would be re elected  Republicans would hold the Senate  and they would take back control of the House  So that s not just a delay of game  That is setting a whole bunch of other conditions on what would need to happen to get there michael barbaroWere you surprised  Alex  that the president backed down on this so quickly alexander burnsI was surprised by how fast it happened  I wasn t surprised that he sort of came up with a really big theory of what should happen next and then eventually let it disintegrate  because we ve seen that pattern a number of times  But to pick a fight this big and to stick with it for so little time is the definition of politically counterproductive michael barbaroSo now  we are basically back where we started  The Affordable Care Act is likely to remain the law of the land  So what did we learn from this weeklong ordeal alexander burnsWell  the biggest thing we learned is that the politics of health care have been turned on their head in the last couple of years  and that the Affordable Care Act is no longer a liability for Democrats  and that Republicans  whether they want to acknowledge it or not  have largely abandoned the fight  music  The fact that you had the senior most members of the congressional party saying so clearly to a president they helped elect and have loyally supported  we don t want to touch health care   it would have been sort of unimaginable to someone five years ago that that would happen with a Republican president in office michael barbaroAlex  thank you very much alexander burnsThank you  music alexander burnsTomorrow s my birthday  so this is like a little birthday special michael barbaroYay  Is that on the mic lisa tobinHappy birthday tomorrow michael barbaroWe ll be right back   MUSIC   Here s what else you need to know today archived recording  theresa may Despite the best efforts of M P s  the process that the House of Commons has tried to lead has not come up with an answer  So today  I m taking action to break the logjam michael barbaroIn her latest attempt to rally support for Brexit after a series of embarrassing setbacks  British prime minister Theresa May said she would seek a new delay for leaving the European Union and would begin negotiating a Brexit plan with her political rivals in the Labour Party archived recording  theresa may I m offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan that we would both stick to to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal michael barbaroThe attempt to work across the aisle with the Labour Party suggests that May cannot win enough support within her own Conservative Party to pass her Brexit plan archived recording  theresa may The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum that both the leader of the opposition and I could put to the House for approval  and which I could then take to next week s European Council michael barbaroUnless May secures another delay  Britain is currently scheduled to leave the E U  without a negotiated plan on April 12  That s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow The president s last attempt to replace Mr  Obama s health care program blew up in 2017 when his party controlled both houses of Congress  Democrats seized the House in last year s midterm elections in part on a promise to defend the most popular parts of the Affordable Care Act  so when Mr  Trump revived the issue last week  it distressed Republicans who consider it a political liability Mr  Trump had surprised allies by ordering his administration to ask a federal court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act and then promised a Republican replacement  Democrats  consumer groups  doctors  hospitals and insurance companies have said that 20 million people could lose health coverage if courts accept the administration s argument Mr  McConnell said he spoke with Mr  Trump on Monday afternoon to explain that the Senate would not return to the issue in a broad way before the next election   I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans  view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives   Mr  McConnell said But if that warning was meant to quiet the president  it did not work  Hours later  Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter   The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums  cost    deductibles than ObamaCare   In other words it will be far less expensive   much more usable than ObamaCare   he said in a string of three tweets posted Monday night   Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House  Democrats jumped at the opening  Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021   Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader  said at a rally in front of the Supreme Court   Translation  they have no health care plan  It s the same old song they ve been singing  They re for repeal  They have no replace  Mr  Trump appeared to be gambling that he could turn the tables on an issue that has long favored Democrats by portraying them as increasingly extreme  Even as party liberals  including some presidential candidates  embrace the idea of  Medicare for all   Republicans have used it to accuse Democrats of favoring a socialist  government run health care system that would close down all private insurers  I see what the Democrats are doing  it s a disaster what they re planning and everyone knows it   Mr  Trump told reporters on Tuesday at the White House   You re going to lose 180 million people under their private insurance  Wary of such attacks  the Democratic congressional leadership has played down a single payer system run by the government and advanced incremental measures to shore up the health care law and lower prescription drug prices Many Republicans in Congress were happy to assail Medicare for all but not enthusiastic about ditching Mr  Obama s program without a ready replacement  No plan of their own could pass the House  but it would invariably require policy choices that Democrats could attack Image The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   Speaker Nancy Pelosi said CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesEven some of the president s own advisers were confounded by his move  Soon after the president decided last week to intervene in a Texas court case on the side of invalidating the entire Affordable Care Act without a Plan B  Mr  Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with Ronna McDaniel  the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee  and Brad Parscale  Mr  Trump s campaign manager Both Mr  Parscale and Ms  McDaniel tried to tell the president that they could not understand what he was doing  according to a person familiar with the call Mr  Trump replied that if they did nothing  Democrats would continue to own the issue and the other option was being known as the party that could not figure out how to properly draft a health care legislative package  the person said In several private conversations since last week  Mr  McConnell told the president that he believed Democrats owned the dysfunction associated with the Affordable Care Act and that Mr  Trump was essentially letting them off the hook by inserting himself into the debate again  according to another person briefed on those discussions Mr  Trump denied on Tuesday that Mr  McConnell asked him to back off  saying   I wanted to delay it myself  because Republicans do not control the House   So if we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency   which I hope are two good assumptions   we re going to have a phenomenal health care   he said Seeking to capitalize on the issue  the House will vote this week on a resolution urging the Justice Department to reverse its position and defend the 2010 health care law in court  forcing lawmakers to take a side on the case  The American people deserve to know exactly where their representatives stand on the Trump administration s vicious campaign to take away their health care   said Speaker Nancy Pelosi The resolution  offered by a freshman Democrat  Representative Colin Allred of Texas  says that the Justice Department should  cease any and all efforts to destroy Americans  access to affordable health care  and reverse its position  in the court case  Texas v  United States Some of the president s senior advisers pushed him to join the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the entire current health care law  a more expansive position than the administration had taken previously  when it argued that protections for people with pre existing conditions should be struck down But others raised concerns  including the White House counsel  Pat Cipollone  Mr  Cipollone said that Attorney General William P  Barr had issues with joining the suit  too  But once the president made clear his mind was made up  the Justice Department went along without complaint  people familiar with the events said Among those objecting was Senator Susan Collins  a moderate Republican from Maine who sent a letter to Mr  Barr expressing her  profound disagreement  with the move  Rather than seeking to have the courts invalidate the A C A    she wrote  referring to the Affordable Care Act   the proper route for the administration to pursue would be to propose changes to the A C A  or to once again seek its repeal  The administration should not attempt to use the courts to bypass Congress  Mr  McConnell sought to calm Republican nerves  saying  there s no point in pushing the panic button  because the court system would take a long time to resolve the dispute  I don t think any of these policies are in any immediate danger   he said Mr  Trump has basically commissioned four Republican senators to devise a replacement for the Affordable Care Act  The group consists of two doctors  John Barrasso of Wyoming and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana  as well as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  a close ally of the president  and Senator Rick Scott of Florida  who was the chief executive of a large for profit hospital firm before he entered politics Mr  Scott said on Tuesday that he was focused on bringing down health costs  especially prescription drug prices   Obamacare has made health care way more expensive   he said   Co payments are up  Deductibles are up  Premiums have skyrocketed  When asked about developing a wholesale replacement for the Affordable Care Act  Mr  Scott responded   I m a business guy   adding   I didn t try to do grand bargains   

WASHINGTON   His border shutdown went from imminent to uncertain  A major health care push was declared and then delayed  Funding cuts were inserted in his proposed budget and just as quickly taken out President Donald Trump has been exploring the art of the climb down Trump pivoted on two big policy fronts this week  easing up on his threats to quickly close the southern border and deciding that a fresh effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act should wait until after the 2020 election The moves came as Republicans  outside groups and aides expressed anxiety about the potential economic and political fallout from Trump s proposals The president s swift backpedaling underscored his off the cuff style and suggested that more such drama is likely ahead as he tries to sync his policymaking with his re election campaign To many  the Washington whiplash was another reminder that Trump tweets first and governs later  Most presidents and even most CEOs  when they make a decision that is going to have financial impact or personnel impact  you seek a lot of input   said Republican strategist Rick Tyler   He doesn t do that  Even his own communications staff says he goes by his gut  The president s pronouncements and social media blasts are often surprise attacks  They can vanish as quickly as they emerge if political expedience warrants a different tack His announcement last week that the GOP was going to take on health care again despite a bruising and unsuccessful effort in 2017 stunned most in his own party and seemed driven in part by a lingering desire to fulfill his oft repeated 2016 campaign promise to repeal  Obamacare  He surprised his own education secretary with the declaration that he was reversing a plan to ax federal aid for the Special Olympics after the proposed cuts sparked a public outcry Few working for him ever want to get out in front of a Trump announcement for fear it will change at the last minute Trump s latest policy twists come after the conclusion of the special counsel s Russia investigation and as the president is turning his attention to his 2020 campaign His loose style also reflects his current leadership team  Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is viewed as a less controlling figure than previous chiefs  seeking to provide Trump with analysis and information  but not trying to restrict his conversations or steer his decisions After threatening last week to seal the border if Mexico did not immediately halt all illegal immigration into the U S   Trump on Tuesday appeared to be laying the groundwork for a delay  saying he was happy with steps taken by Mexico and that he would like to see Congress pass legislation revising the immigration system  Still  he held open the possibility of a border shutdown  saying   I m totally ready to do it  Trump has been threatening the closure privately for months  but his staff has been trying to slow him down with data about the economic impact and suggestions on ways to lessen the financial hit The president acknowledged the economy was on his mind Tuesday but played down those concerns  saying   Let me just give you a little secret  Security is more important to me than trade  On health care  Trump plunged into the fight again last week  prompted by a court deadline  But his motivations were always as political as they were legislative  with the president not wanting to cede a 2020 campaign issue to Democrats  And allies stressed Tuesday that the president had never laid out a timeline for legislation With his tweet Monday night  Trump made clear there would be no vote until after the 2020 election  though he insisted a GOP plan still was in the works His downgrade came after pressure from congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who said he told Trump  we were not going to be doing that in the Senate  Asked if he was acting at McConnell s behest  Trump insisted   I wanted to delay it myself  Heading into 2020  Trump sees border security and health care as key issues for his political base and he is expected to keep pushing them even if he dials back specific threats Speaking Tuesday night at the National Republican Congressional Committee s spring dinner  he declared that Republicans  should not run away from health care   If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose   Trump said    Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Kevin Freking contributed to this report  

ANKARA  Turkey   I am a 30 year old Turkish man  and for my entire adult life there has been a ritual to elections  There s a bitterly fought campaign  the polling day arrives  people vote  ballots are counted and Recep Tayyip Erdogan wins  He stands on the balcony of his Justice and Development Party s headquarters in Ankara and gives a victory speech to a cheering crowd  If you are part of that crowd  you feel as if you have become a little more important in the world  If you aren t  you feel as if you have become a little less relevant  This sequence of events has repeated itself for 17 years  On Sunday Turkey voted to elect the mayors of its 81 provinces and their municipalities  President Erdogan s party  known as the A K P   allied itself with the ultranationalist National Movement Party  the secularist main opposition Republican People s Party  the C H P   contested in partnership with Good Party  an outfit that splintered from the nationalists in 2018  The People s Democratic Party  the H D P    which is home to Kurdish left nationalists  cooperated with the opposition alliance in several major cities while running against the A K P  in the Kurdish majority southeastern provinces  It was a brutal contest  Mr  Erdogan personally campaigned every day and repeatedly accused his opponents of being terrorist collaborators  Most opposition candidates merely presented themselves as the non Erdogan option On Sunday night  Mansur Yavas  the C H P  candidate for Ankara mayor  was comfortably ahead of his rival from the A K P   which has controlled Ankara for 25 years  Despite the momentous developments in Ankara  all eyes were fixed on Istanbul  Ekrem Imamoglu  a young  energetic C H P  candidate  was briskly tallying up votes and catching up fast with Mr  Erdogan s chosen man for Istanbul  Binali Yildirim  a former prime minister and former speaker of the Turkish Parliament Our phones were exploding with WhatsApp messages  There was a photo of Mr  Yildirim writing a short victory speech  There was Mr  Imamoglu going on air and insisting that he was leading by his campaign s calculations  People were angry because the authorities stopped publishing results as Mr  Imamoglu caught up with Mr  Yildirim in the public figures Then a news flash  Mr  Erdogan was on the balcony  But something was off  As he stepped up to the crowd  he began singing along to the song booming into the night   These roses are for you  this soul is ours  Don t be sad  don t cry  Always smile   Mr  Erdogan s speech was short and vague  He said that he was honored to carry the popular vote  and that his party had done well in many provinces  none of which he named   Those who made false claims are welcome to it   he said   let us see how they govern   This was the closest he got to admitting the calamity  His A K P  had lost Ankara and Istanbul  apart from other major cities To understand the significance of this  it helps to know the dominant narrative of Turkish politics today  It goes something like this  Throughout its republican history  Turkey has been governed by a secular elite characterized by its impish adherence to Western imperialists A group of plucky conservatives kept challenging this system until  in 1994  a young Erdogan and his friend  now dismissed  won the mayoralties of Istanbul and Ankara  respectively  Amid the economic crises  weak coalition governments and civil unrest of the 1990s  Mr  Erdogan and his associates were islands of good governance  They served these great cities with distinction and earned a reputation of incorruptibility  In 2002  their movement  now under the banner of the A K P   was elected into national office  Under Mr  Erdogan s firm leadership  they grew the economy  fixed the bureaucracy and won up to half of the popular vote  Turkey was booming  the world talked about the  Turkish model  of majority Muslim democracy  By the mid 2010s  Mr  Erdogan had defanged the coup prone military and disenfranchised the corrupt elites of old  The jealous opposition parties joined shadowy outside actors in plotting the downfall of Turkey s great revival  Some of Mr  Erdogan s friends and allies betrayed him  but  the people  did not  When the economy slowed down  or the court system got clogged up  he asked people to sacrifice for the cause of what he called  New Turkey   a nation unshackled from Western domination and free to soar to new heights But the myth of New Turkey is paradoxical  It was built on doing practical things in the 1990s  like filling potholes  But to maintain the myth  Mr  Erdogan sometimes asked voters to ignore those practical things and simply to have faith in  the cause   On Sunday  there was a major breach in this wall of faith  especially in Istanbul  where Mr  Erdogan s love of the people first transmuted into government service  This was probably due to a combination of growing economic problems and an increasingly competent opposition  It is a close count in Istanbul  and the Supreme Electoral Council has asked for three days to check everything  As things stand  it seems that Mr  Imamoglu  the young and stubbornly positive candidate of the C H P   will get the job that started Mr  Erdogan s  great love affair  with the people 25 years ago If that doesn t happen  and the A K P  holds the city  people will know that Mr  Imamoglu went up against vastly unequal odds   the government s near monopoly on TV  its abundant use of state resources  its threats of litigation   and probably still won This could signal the limits of Mr  Erdogan s political strategy  Already in this election  opposition politicians mocked the president for calling ordinary voters terrorists  He strongly denied the claim and sued one of them  In a recently viral video  an old woman asked   Why should the man governing Turkey make a distinction between the people  Are those  opposition  parties always evil and you  Erdogan  are good  When populist rhetoric comes from a fresh face and aims at a calcified elite  it sounds plausible  When it has supplanted that elite  and it has reached its demographic limits  it begins to look ridiculous  And therein lies the problem of Mr  Erdogan s politics  He isn t honest with himself  He wants to dominate the political space and transform the country  but he isn t quite willing to engage in the scale of repression that would require  He demonizes his opposition as terrorist collaborators  yet still allows them to participate in elections  Mr  Erdogan s style of politics demands that he either crank up the intensity  or collapse under the weight of its own contradictions Selim Koru is an analyst at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara and a

WASHINGTON   In President Donald Trump s estimation  the 2020 census will be pointless unless a question is added that asks people if they are citizens That opinion makes him a distinct outlier in government  business and society  where the big census conducted every 10 years produces a gold mine of information on how people live and  of course  how many there are TRUMP   Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question  Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together     tweet Monday THE FACTS  Trump s disdain for conducting the once a decade census without a citizenship question is not shared by his own Census Bureau researchers  Nor is it consistent with the many operations of government and business that make billions of dollars in spending decisions as well as policy decisions based on the most accurate possible count of the U S  population According to January 2018 calculations by the Census Bureau  adding a citizenship question to the decennial census form would cause lower response rates among noncitizens  leading to an increased cost to the government of at least  27 5 million for additional phone calls  visits to the home and other follow up efforts to reach them  The Constitution requires a count every 10 years of  the whole number of persons in each state   long understood to include all residents of the U S The count goes to the heart of the U S  political system  It s used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House and how the electoral votes that decide presidential elections are distributed It also shapes how 300 federal programs distribute more than  800 billion a year to local communities  according to an analysis by the GW Institute of Public Policy at George Washington University  Communities and businesses depend on it  as well  in deciding where to build schools  hospitals  job training centers  grocery stores and more The GW institute s analysis of the effects of an undercount on five programs administered by the Health and Human Services Department  for instance  found that 37 states lost a median of  1 091 in the 2015 budget year for each person missed in the 2010 census Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has argued that a citizenship question is needed   or is  very important   as Trump puts it   to help the government better comply with the Voting Rights Act  But the Justice Department has been enforcing the 1965 law  which was passed to help protect minority groups  political rights  with citizenship data already available from other government surveys Meantime  civil rights groups and states with higher shares of immigrant populations such as California and New York cite a greater harm to the political rights of minority groups if a citizenship question in the decennial census dissuades immigrants from participating  resulting in diminished representation in the U S  House Not since 1950 has the census collected citizenship data from the whole population The Supreme Court this month is hearing the Trump administration s appeal of a federal judge s ruling in New York that Ross  whose department oversees the census  violated federal law by making an  arbitrary and capricious  decision that twisted contrary evidence  A judge in California also has ruled that a citizenship question would violate the Constitution s requirement to count the population    Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

Pete Buttigieg has some kind of magic right now  His campaign bio   Shortest Way Home   was the 25th best selling book on Amazon when I checked on Monday  That put him just a few dozen places behind Michelle Obama  and thousands or tens of thousands of places ahead of Kamala Harris  Bernie Sanders and the other candidates who have campaign books out now In a recent Iowa poll he surged to third place  His campaign just announced that it s raised an impressive  7 million since January  And I can t tell you how many Democrats in places as diverse as Nebraska  Indiana  New York and Washington have come up to me over the last few weeks raving about the guy  I met a superfan in Frederick  Md   who says that every few hours she calls the campaign to give another  10  This is the biggest star is born moment since Lady Gaga started singing  Shallow  Why are people so in love with the mayor of South Bend  Ind   who almost nobody had heard of until he did a CNN town hall on March 10 It s important to remember that when Democrats vote next year  they ll not only be choosing a policy alternative to Donald Trump  they ll also be making a statement about what kind of country they want America to be The Trump era has been all about dissolving moral norms and waging vicious attacks  This has been an era of culture war  class warfare and identity politics  It s been an era in which call out culture  reality TV melodrama and tribal grandstanding have overshadowed policymaking and the challenges of actually governing The Buttigieg surge suggests that there are a lot of Democrats who want to say goodbye to all that  They don t want to fight fire and divisiveness with more fire and divisiveness  They don t want to fight white identity politics with another kind of identity politics They are sick of the moral melodrama altogether  They just want a person who is more about governing than virtue signaling  more about friendliness and basic decency than media circus and rhetorical war Buttigieg s secret is that he transcends many of the tensions that run through our society in a way that makes people on all sides feel comfortable First  he is young and represents the rising generation  but he is also an older person s idea of what a young person should be  He d be the first millennial president  but Buttigieg doesn t fit any of the stereotypes that have been affixed to America s young people  Young people are supposed to be woke social justice warriors who are disgusted by their elders  Buttigieg is the model young man who made his way impressing his elders   Harvard  Rhodes scholar  McKinsey  the Navy  Young hipsters are supposed to flock to coastal places like Brooklyn and Portland  after college  Buttigieg returned to Indiana  Young people are supposed to be anti institutional  but Buttigieg is very institutional   his life has been defined by his service to organizations  not his rebellion against them Second  he is gay and personifies the progress made by the L G B T Q  movement  but he doesn t do so in a way that feels threatening or transgressive to social conservatives  He has conservative family values  it s just that his spouse is a husband  not a wife  He speaks comfortably about his faith and says that when he goes to church he prefers a conservative liturgy to anything experimental Third  he is a localist and a Washington outsider  but he carries no populist resentment and can easily speak the language of the coastal elite Buttigieg has spent his political career in Indiana  where pols are expected to go to county fairs and eat the catfish fillet and cheesecake on a stick  He wasn t alive when the Studebaker plant shut down in South Bend  but he has the trauma of Midwestern deindustrialization in his bones  He lives in a house near his mother where the mortgage comes to about  450 a month  On the other hand  he was friends with Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard  earned a first at Oxford and thrived as a corporate consultant Finally  he s a progressive on policy issues  but he doesn t sound like an angry revolutionary  Buttigieg s policy positions are not all that different from the more identifiable leftist candidates  But he eschews grand ideological conflict   The whole point of politics is everyday life   he said in his CNN town hall  His book is mostly about how as mayor he faced problems like snow removal and fixing potholes  His big achievements were renaming city streets  repairing the sewer system and tearing down derelict buildings  He says he ll do whatever works I ve only met Buttigieg once  when we were seated at the same table at a dinner in Detroit a few months ago  He was smart  modest and self effacing  and I can t square that impression with his assumption that at 37 he s qualified to be president of the United States  But maybe that s Buttigieg   he squares a lot of circles  He deftly detaches progressive policy positions from the culture war  He offers change without Sturm und Drang The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email

The chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and one of the state s leading political donors together sought to use campaign contributions to bribe the state s insurance commissioner  federal prosecutors said in an indictment that was unsealed on Tuesday The 23 page indictment   detailed with accounts of clandestine airport meetings and promises of millions of dollars in illicit donations   intensified the political tumult in a state already roiled by partisan warfare and a fraud tainted congressional election  And it also showed how  at least in the judgment of prosecutors  a leading political operative and one of his most important benefactors tried to shape government oversight in one of the nation s largest states  These men crossed the line from fund raising to felonies when they devised a plan to use their connections to a political party to attempt to influence the operations and policies of the North Carolina Department of Insurance   said John A  Strong  the special agent in charge of the F B I  office in Charlotte  N C The party chairman  Robin Hayes  faces the gravest set of charges of the four men who were indicted  Mr  Hayes was accused of bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud  along with several counts of making false statements  Three other people  including Greg E  Lindberg  the chairman of an investment firm in Durham and a prolific Republican contributor  were also charged Kearns Davis  a lawyer for Mr  Hayes  said the 73 year old Republican  steadfastly denies the allegations made against him in this case   In a separate statement  Anne Tompkins  a lawyer for Mr  Lindberg  said that Mr  Lindberg was  innocent of the charges in the indictment and we look forward to demonstrating this when we get our day in court  It was not clear whether the other men who were charged had lawyers A federal magistrate in Charlotte unsealed the case on Tuesday after the men were arrested   a public milestone in an investigation that began early last year with a tip from Mike Causey  the insurance commissioner According to the indictment  Mr  Lindberg  who has also given to Democrats  wanted Mr  Causey to oust a powerful regulator  in exchange for millions of dollars in campaign contributions   The targeted state official was in charge of overseeing North Carolina s regulation of a company that Mr  Lindberg owned  and Mr  Lindberg complained to Mr  Causey in February 2018 that the official was  deliberately and intentionally and maliciously hurting my reputation with other regulators  Mr  Lindberg said the official had been  lying  to Mr  Causey The next month  federal officials said  Mr  Lindberg and Mr  Causey met alone at the Statesville Regional Airport  What s in it for me   Mr  Causey asked Mr  Lindberg  according to the indictment Mr  Lindberg replied that he would support the commissioner s campaign for re election Mr  Hayes  one of the most influential political figures in the state  emerged as someone who could help carry out the plan  Federal officials said that Mr  Hayes knew at least some of the plot in May 2018 and  less than three months later  tried to disguise part of the bribe by arranging to transfer to the Causey campaign  250 000 that Mr  Lindberg had given to the state party Before the transfer  one of Mr  Lindberg s consultants  John D  Gray  called Mr  Hayes to say the men had  come to the conclusion that it would be better for all of us  if the money for the Causey campaign was funneled through the Republican Party  O K   well  if that s what you want to do  we can do it   Mr  Hayes replied  according to the indictment   It looks a little odd to have that much at one time  You know  we were talking about putting it over  you know  so much a month so it didn t jump out  but that s what you want to do  we can do it  Within weeks  prosecutors said  Mr  Hayes lied to F B I  agents about his efforts In a statement on Tuesday  Mr  Causey said his department  continues to cooperate with the federal authorities on this investigation   He otherwise declined to comment The indictment landed at a perilous moment for the Republican Party in North Carolina  Although Donald J  Trump carried the state in 2016  Democrats seized the governor s office that year  and last year s elections eroded the Republican supermajority in the General Assembly The party also suffered a stinging embarrassment in February  when the State Board of Elections ordered a new vote in the Ninth Congressional District after the Republican nominee s campaign financed an illicit voter turnout operation during the general election  Although no major Republican Party figures have been charged with wrongdoing  the man who coordinated the improper effort was indicted in connection with wrongdoing in earlier elections  and state and federal officials are conducting parallel inquiries into the general election  Read  A new election was ordered in North Carolina s Ninth Congressional District  On Monday  Mr  Hayes announced that he would not seek another term as state party chairman  In a statement announcing the decision  the party cited  recent  although temporary  issues with his mobility  After Mr  Hayes s indictment was announced on Tuesday  a lawyer for the state party  Josh Howard  said the party had become  aware of several indictments surrounding the conduct of a major donor to both major political parties and two of his associates  Mr  Howard  who spoke of the party s cooperation during the federal inquiry  did not mention that

WASHINGTON   The NATO secretary general gave a strong defense of the 70 year old military alliance between Europe and the United States  using a high profile appearance before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to urge allies to stand up to a more assertive Russia While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not looking for a new Cold War with Moscow  the alliance s leader  Jens Stoltenberg  said it was important to not be  naïve  about the Kremlin s intentions  Proffering a long list of Russian actions that threaten NATO allies  including the annexation of Crimea  the use of a nerve agent in Britain and Moscow s interference in democratic elections  Mr  Stoltenberg cited  a pattern of Russian behavior  that calls for the alliance to be more united than ever in its response  NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence   Mr  Stoltenberg said at the Capitol  He was in Washington for a meeting of foreign ministers from NATO member states But his remarks came in the middle of a poorly timed squabble between two of the alliance s fractious members   the United States and Turkey   with Russia as the potential beneficiary  Earlier this week  the Pentagon announced that it was halting the delivery of parts for F 35 fighter jets to Turkey because Ankara is pursuing plans to buy S 400 missile defense systems from Russia American officials do not want Turkey to purchase the Russian system and have warned that it could collect information on United States stealth fighter jets The Turkish foreign minister  Mevlut Cavusoglu  was adamant in a separate alliance event in Washington on Wednesday that Ankara will not budge   It s a done deal   he said   Turkey doesn t have to choose between Russia and any others  and we don t see our relationship with Russia as an alternative to others  But the Trump administration  so far  is being equally adamant  Turkey must choose   Vice President Mike Pence said at a NATO anniversary event   Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history  or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making such reckless decisions that undermine our alliance  Mr  Stoltenberg  in his speech before Congress  did not directly reference the F 35 squabble  But he characterized fights among alliance partners as  democracy   Open discussions and different views is not a sign of weakness   Mr  Stoltenberg said   It is a sign of strength  He also reaffirmed NATO s core mandate of collective defense   that an attack on one member state is viewed as an attack on all 29  But in doing so  Mr  Stoltenberg aired a principle that President Trump has questioned  exposing the new rift that has developed between his administration and the United States  most important allies Wednesday s speech was the first time that a secretary general of the alliance has been invited to speak on Congress s most high profile stage  and the platform afforded to Mr  Stoltenberg was in many ways a sign of lawmakers  concerns over Mr  Trump s commitment to NATO Mr  Stoltenberg  a careful diplomat  made no criticism of Mr  Trump  and instead credited the president with prodding the alliance to spend more on defense  Still  the overall theme of Mr  Stoltenberg s speech was to make the case for NATO  the value of which Mr  Trump has often questioned Lawmakers gave Mr  Stoltenberg a series of standing ovations  Legislation that has bipartisan support is making its way through Congress  and would explicitly prohibit any president from withdrawing the United States from the alliance without Senate approval In his speech  which was peppered with political and personal details  Mr  Stoltenberg said the military alliance has been good not just for Europe  but for the United States as well  He reminded lawmakers that the only time NATO has invoked Article 5   the pact of collective defense following attacks   was after the terrorist strikes against the United States on Sept  11  2001  The strength of a nation   Mr  Stoltenberg said   is not only measured by the size of its economy or the number of its soldiers  but also by the number of its friends   And through NATO  the United States has more friends and allies than any other power   he said   This has made the United States stronger  safer and more secure   

LOVE YOUR ENEMIES How Decent People Can Save America From the Culture of Contempt By Arthur C  BrooksArthur C  Brooks begins  Love Your Enemies  with a scene  a moment of grace  that occurred on the National Mall in Washington on Sept  16  2017  during a rally of Trump supporters  A counter demonstrator from Black Lives Matter  a man named Hawk Newsome  was  quite unexpectedly  invited to address the Trump supporters  Quite unexpectedly  he won them over   a little bit  anyway  Newsome ended by saying   If we really want to make America great  we do it together   The Trumpers cheered  and the better angels of our nature flapped about the Mall for a little while  The mystic chords of memory reverberated from one side of the American divide to the other Was that moment a model for the future  Or just an accident Love your enemies  In this America   Maybe this seems impossible to you   Brooks writes   You might say   There are some people who are simply beyond the pale  There are millions of awful people in this country who advocate ideas we cannot tolerate  They deserve our contempt  not our love   I have heard this sentiment from serious journalists  respected academics and mainstream politicians  I have thought it myself  That attitude is both wrong and dangerously radical  Anyone who can t tell the difference between an ordinary Bernie Sanders supporter and a Stalinist revolutionary  or between Donald Trump s average voter and a Nazi  is either willfully ignorant or needs to get out of the house more  Brooks beholds America s 21st century tribal feuds   which on a national scale add up to nothing less than a religious war  a clash of faiths and value systems   with a clear  intelligent eye and a hospitable attitude that is rightly focused on the spiritual dimensions of the problem  Only transcendence can open the way to better solutions down the road  The real swamp just now is in the American mind ImageAs for Brooks s mind  it is filled with unusual ingredients  He is the rational first mate Starbuck to the Ahab of American political looniness   a voice of civic urbanity  The outgoing head of the American Enterprise Institute  an influential conservative think tank in Washington  he is an advocate for free enterprise and a serious Catholic  a convert in his midteens  who has gone up into the foothills of the Himalayas to seek counsel from his friend the Dalai Lama  He draws not only upon neurology and behavioral science but also upon the ideas of Dale Carnegie s  How to Win Friends and Influence People   A policy analyst with a Ph D  who has studied applied microeconomics and mathematical modeling  he spent years of his somewhat hippie lefty youth playing the French horn with  among others  the Barcelona Symphony The essence of our woes  according to Brooks  is that ours is a  culture of contempt    My point is simple  Love and warmheartedness might not change every heart and mind  but they are always worth trying  and they will always make you better off   Brooks cites the interesting friendship of two professors at Princeton  the white conservative Robert George and the black socialist Cornel West  Their mutual respect and affection  despite their disagreement on practically everything  embodies  to Brooks  the answer to the culture of contempt  George says of West   When I call Brother Cornel  Brother Cornel   I mean he s my brother   As with these two professors  Brooks suggests  America s path forward lies in its learning to transcend self destructive  obsessive politics in order to think clearly and to use the intelligent competition of ideas to advance the country  Love Your Enemies  can be seen as an informal handbook of attitudes and behaviors  Castiglione for the Twitter age  The reader may be left torn between admiring it as an example of Kafka s  A book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us   or dismissing it with Hemingway s  Isn t it pretty to think so  That this is an age of contempt and ridicule is certainly true   Donald Trump vs   Saturday Night Live   and a lot that is far more scurrilous than that  But contempt and ridicule are ancient American political art forms   ones now brought to ferocious intensity by the internet and social media  The smartphone paradoxically engenders new levels of mindlessness It may be that American contempt and ridicule had their most entertaining expression a century ago in the work of H  L  Mencken  a master of bracing satirical bombast who was disgracefully unjust and cruel in many of his opinions  Mencken would probably have dismissed Brooks as a sentimentalist    an evangelist   in Mencken s scornful term  A useful and welcome evangelist  I d say

WASHINGTON   U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross refused to testify about his department s 2020 budget before a congressional panel on Wednesday  an act its chairman called one of  stunning disrespect  that left lawmakers facing an empty chair Ross  who was invited to testify at a hearing but instead tried to send aides to a speak on his behalf  has been criticized in the Democratic controlled House of Representatives over his efforts to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census  an issue now before the U S  Supreme Court Ross said in a statement after the hearing of a House subcommittee on Appropriations   I am disappointed that these Department of Commerce leaders have not been allowed to discuss their respective budgets for 2020  Ross has said he sought the citizenship question in the census to bolster the Voting Rights Act  But Democrats view it as an attempt to discourage immigrants and Latinos from participating in the census  which could lead to an undercount in Democratic leaning states Non citizens make up an estimated 7 percent of people living in the United States  The citizenship question has not appeared on the list of questions asked of all households since the 1950 census  but has featured since then on questionnaires sent to a smaller subsection of the population The U S  Constitution requires a census to count all residents  including non citizens  every 10 years  Results are used to draw political boundaries  allocate seats in Congress and distribute roughly  800 billion of federal funds  The top Republican on the Appropriations subcommittee  Robert Aderholt  said Ross failed to appear out of  concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself  Some have speculated it might turn into a debate over the 2020 census  Aderholt noted Ross had sent senior officials to answer questions the panel might have about the Commerce Department s  12 billion budget request  but the panel s Democratic chairman  Jose Serrano  ruled that out  That will not be happening  This subcommittee invited Secretary Ross to testify and he s the only one who will be allowed to testify at this hearing   Serrano told the panel as members sat before an empty witness table marked with Ross  name  The secretary s actions today show a stunning disrespect for the mechanisms of our democracy   Serrano added It is routine for department heads to field questions from lawmakers each year about their budget requests and other matters  A different House panel  the Committee on Oversight and Reform  voted on Tuesday to authorize a subpoena for documents from Ross about his efforts to include the citizenship question   Reporting by David Alexander and Mohammad Zargham  Editing by Peter Cooney and Grant McCool  

WASHINGTON   Pete Buttigieg announced Monday that his presidential campaign had raised more than  7 million in the first quarter of 2019  a significant sum for a mayor who was little known outside of South Bend  Ind   only a few months ago Mr  Buttigieg  37  is the first presidential contender to disclose an estimate of his fund raising total for the quarter  The haul is expected to place him  financially  in the upper half of a sprawling 2020 primary field that features a half dozen senators  This is a big number for us   Mr  Buttigieg wrote to supporters in an email on Monday   We are not part of the national political machine  We started with just about 20 000 people on our email list  and not many people even knew who I was  Mr  Buttigieg s announcement kicks off a highly anticipated moment in the 2020 campaign s opening phase  when the Democratic hopefuls will reveal their fund raising totals for the first three months of the year  Those results offer early evidence of who is generating excitement among the party s grass roots  an especially important factor this year given the intense focus on raising money from small donors  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  Already  Senator Bernie Sanders and former Representative Beto O Rourke have announced sizable fund raising hauls from the first 24 hours of their campaigns  Senator Elizabeth Warren has lagged in early fund raising  she is trying to distinguish herself from the Democratic field by forgoing high dollar fund raisers Presidential candidates must report their first quarter fund raising to the Federal Election Commission by April 15  It is up to the individual campaigns to decide when   or whether   to announce their totals before then  Mr  Buttigieg s quick announcement on Monday  immediately after the close of the first quarter  allowed him to command the spotlight  at least for a few hours  as he seeks to establish his candidacy as more than a long shot bid  Showing good numbers early is more impressive for a long shot candidate who doesn t have a big national identification   said Michael J  Malbin  the director of the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute There are signs beyond fund raising that Mr  Buttigieg is drawing interest  or at least curiosity  from voters  Searches for his name on Google have shot up in recent weeks  In a ranking of Democrats running for president or considering it  Mr  Buttigieg has risen from the bottom of the pack to No  2  trailing only former Vice President Joseph R  Biden Jr For most of this year  for example  Mr  O Rourke has drawn more searches than Mr  Buttigieg  but Mr  Buttigieg recently surpassed him  according to the Google data Mr  Buttigieg s fund raising haul of more than  7 million came from 158 550 donors  with an average contribution of  36 35  Mr  Buttigieg said in a video posted online late Monday  He added that 64 percent of the total came from contributions under  200 Mr  Buttigieg  who is technically still only exploring a campaign  said last month that he had exceeded the 65 000 donors needed to garner a spot on the Democratic National Committee s primary debate stage  even as some better known rivals have suggested they do not yet have that many Mr  Buttigieg s fund raising jumped after he appeared in a CNN town hall style event earlier in March and impressed Democratic activists and donors  as he fielded questions in rolled up white shirt sleeves and a blue tie  His campaign announced that he raised  600 000 in the 24 hours after his appearance Lis Smith  a spokeswoman for the campaign  described the televised forum as a turning point  Interest in Mr  Buttigieg had been rising before then  she said  but the CNN event  really brought everything to the next level   Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker  An openly gay veteran and former Rhodes scholar  Mr  Buttigieg has made numerous appearances on national television in recent weeks seeking to lift his political profile  Later last month he told supporters via email that he was setting a  500 000 fund raising goal by the end of the month  He hit the figure within 24 hours  his campaign said  He set another  500 000 goal  Again  he reached it in about 24 hours Mr  Buttigieg s fund raising is particularly noteworthy because he began his campaign with only a modest email list from which he could solicit donations   a stark contrast with rivals like Mr  Sanders and Mr  O Rourke  who built huge followings in their prior campaigns for president and Senate In addition  Mr  Buttigieg has spent relatively little money on advertising on Facebook  which many candidates use to expand their email lists  There s no sorcery involved in this   Ms  Smith said of Mr  Buttigieg s fund raising   It was because he really struck a chord  Unlike many of the Democrats in the race   including Ms  Warren and Senators Cory Booker  Kirsten Gillibrand  Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar   Mr  Buttigieg has not publicly sworn off federal lobbyist funds  Mr  Buttigieg is refusing to accept corporate political action committee money and recently signed a pledge to not take money from the oil  gas and coal industries Other candidates are still expected to post larger sums than Mr  Buttigieg for the quarter  Mr  Sanders raised  10 million in the first week of his presidential bid  a total that included  5 9 million from the first 24 hours  his campaign said Mr  O Rourke s campaign said it had raised  6 1 million in his first 24 hours as a candidate  On Sunday  it reached its goal of raising  1 million during the final weekend of the quarter  the campaign said  

PARIS   Algeria s ailing president  Abdelaziz Bouteflika  agreed Monday to step down by the end of the month  yielding to weeks of mass demonstrations demanding his ouster The initial reaction in Algeria was muted  and it was unclear whether the announcement would quell the protests  which have been calling for not only Mr  Bouteflika s resignation but the end of  the system  he led With no date set for a new election and no sign of the departure of Mr  Bouteflika s allies  some of his opponents were skeptical about the prospect of immediate  fundamental changes  Who is going to replace President Bouteflika   asked Smain Kouadria  a former member of Parliament and an activist in the opposition Workers  Party   All the senators are children of the system  So this announcement of his resignation is simply part of the rescue operation for a dying system  ImageProtesters demonstrating against Mr  Bouteflika in Algiers last month  The protests have only grown larger despite his previous concessions CreditRamzi Boudina ReutersMr  Bouteflika  82  who has ruled Algeria for 20 years  is paralyzed and has not publicly addressed the country since 2013  The protests began last month after he announced that he would run for a fifth term  and they have escalated each week With support from his former allies steadily dropping away  the final blow for Mr  Bouteflika came last week when the powerful army chief of staff called on the country s Constitutional Council to declare Mr  Bouteflika unfit to hold office But even though Mr  Bouteflika is departing  much of the ruling elite he put in place   which protesters refer to simply as  the system    is not On Sunday night  Mr  Bouteflika even appointed a new government  naming the general who had called for his ouster  Ahmed Gaïd Salah  deputy minister of defense  and reappointing Noureddine Bedoui  who is widely described as inflexible  as prime minister ImageAlgerian officials announced a new government on Sunday

likeliest to assume the position of interim president is the head of the senate  who has been close to Mr  Bouteflika for years A stage managed departure seemed unlikely to satisfy the street  which has increasingly helped drive the country s political agenda  an unusual development in Algeria s nearly 60 year  post independence history Even some opposition leaders who welcomed the news on Monday urged continued protests  It s a first important victory for the people   said Said Salhi  vice president of the Algerian Human Rights League   But we can t stop here  We ve got to demand positive change toward the emergence of a new  democratic republic   We ve got to continue to mobilize   he added   It s our only guarantee of movement toward final victory  which is the construction of a new republic of rights and liberties  ImageA protest demanding the resignation of Mr  Bouteflika on March 29  The protests began in February with demonstrations calling for him to desist from seeking a fifth term CreditRamzi Boudina ReutersThe situation in Algeria is fluid  with the balance of power appearing to shift every day  It is unclear how much more protest the army  which traditionally is the ultimate arbiter  will tolerate  Nor is it clear how radical the protesters will become in their demands There were other signs Monday of a shift in power  with the authorities seizing the passports of 12 businessmen on corruption allegations  according to Ennahar television  which is usually well informed  The government news service confirmed that corruption investigations had been opened against  some people  While it was not clear why the 12 were targeted  a businessman arrested on Sunday is considered a Bouteflika crony  Ali Haddad  the country s wealthiest man  who owns the country s top construction firm and has grown wealthy from lucrative state contracts  was arrested at the Tunisian border Mr  Haddad is known to be close to Mr  Bouteflika s hitherto influential brother  Said The question for Algerians now is whether Mr  Bouteflika s resignation will lead to real change or whether it is another in a series of feints intended to allow him and his system to retain power ImageNoureddine Bedoui  center  was re appointed as prime minister of Algeria s new government  He is widely described as inflexible CreditRyad Kramdi Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe protest movement began in late February with mass demonstrations calling for Mr  Bouteflika to desist from seeking a fifth term  After Mr  Bouteflika agreed to call new elections if he won the election  originally scheduled for April 18  the protests only grew larger Then he said he would not seek a fifth term  but would remain in office until a successor was chosen in an election that was indefinitely postponed  That offer only seemed to embolden the protesters  who demanded that he step down immediately and that his system had to go as well This is a far more complicated demand  and those who have been pulling the strings for years in Algeria   the army and an extensive nexus of politicians  top businessmen and high civil servants   have been improvising to keep up with the largely peaceful demonstrators  who have turned out in increasing numbers each Friday Mr  Bouteflika learned at the knee of his mentor  the revolutionary leader Houari Boumédiène  who ruled Algeria from the mid 1960s to the late 1970s  Like Mr  Boumédiène  Mr  Bouteflika installed an extensive patronage network and governed in partnership with the army  The system they and other Algerian rulers put in place is solidly anchored and will probably take more than a month s worth of popular demonstrations to dislodge The muted reaction on Monday suggested that Algerians know that  So Bouteflika is finished  Now everyone knows it   said Atmane Mazouz  a member of Parliament from the opposition Rally for Culture and Democracy party   The struggles now are only little positioning wars to control the next phase of the transition  But I am almost certain that the mobilization of Algerians will continue stronger than ever  because all the decisions being made now are seen by Algerians as a conspiracy against their revolution   

WASHINGTON   When Kamala Harris made her much heralded arrival in Washington as California s first black U S  senator  she made a curious early decision Within months of her swearing in  she sponsored a bill urging states to eliminate cash bail  denouncing the system as a scourge on the poor and communities of color That position would become a key part of her criminal justice reform platform  But her choice surprised some bail reform advocates back in California  In her seven years as a district attorney  and then six as attorney general  Harris was absent on the issue  they say  In fact  less than a year earlier  her office defended the cash bail system in a pair of federal court cases  shifting course only weeks before she entered the Senate  For her entire career she used some of the highest money bail amounts in the country to keep people in jail cells and saddle poor families with financial debt   said Alec Karakatsanis  an attorney who has brought several legal challenges to California s bail system   and as soon as she had no influence on that issue practically  she announces she has a different view on it  Now a presidential candidate   Harris is casting herself as a progressive who consistently leveraged her power in the justice system to further civil rights causes and advocate for the disadvantaged  She has pledged a wholesale overhaul of the country s fractured criminal justice system  arguing for marijuana legalization  bail reform and a moratorium on the death penalty But when she had a chance to take a bold stand on these issues as a top law enforcement officer  Harris often opted for a careful approach or defended the status quo  Observers of her career note some of her key positions  like her opposition to cash bail  came at politically opportune moments  after public views had shifted on race  inequality and bias in the justice system  I never had a sense she was forward thinking or reforming   said John Raphling  a bail reform advocate and senior researcher at Human Rights Watch who faced off against Harris s state Justice Department as a criminal defense attorney   Bail reform is a trendy issue  and a lot of politicians are jumping on it and saying this is unfair  I don t have any evidence that Harris was seeing that unfairness back when she was attorney general   but to her credit  we evolve  we learn  we see things  Harris  supporters say as a prosecutor she was tasked with upholding the law and  as attorney general  defending the state  not making policy  She had limited ability to effect change within the rigid structure of the courts  they argue  Everyone who has experienced the criminal justice system knows it s broken   said Lateefah Simon  a civil rights activist who worked for Harris in San Francisco   She would say   we re confined by the rules of the law  and in the areas where we have discretion  we are going to work to try to move justice    I deeply know her convictions about what could be possible and what we needed to do  but also what the boundaries and limitations were   she said Simon said Harris worked to hire more people of color as prosecutors  In her first year as San Francisco district attorney  she launched a re entry program designed to keep low level drug offenders from returning to prison  That same year she refused to seek the death penalty for a man who killed a police officer  infuriating the Bay Area political establishment and creating friction with the law enforcement community But in many cases throughout her career Harris embraced the traditional role of prosecutor Her office defended wrongful convictions  fighting to keep behind bars those who judges determined should go free  She refused to take a position on a pair of sentencing reform ballot measures  arguing she must remain neutral because her office was responsible for preparing ballot text  She defended the death penalty in court  setting aside her personal opposition to capital punishment In response to critics who ve pushed her to use her power in the courts to usher in change  she told The New York Times in 2016   I have a client  I don t get to choose my client  Harris says she would call for a federal moratorium on the death penalty if elected president Harris  law enforcement approach has at times put her out of step with California s activist community  When she pushed a controversial policy that criminalized truancy  threatening to jail parents of children who missed too much school  even Harris  staff  winced at the plan   she wrote in her first book released just in time for her campaign for attorney general in 2010 The program has since become a source of tension with criminal justice advocates  who see it as sign of Harris  outdated approach to dealing with problems that stem from poverty In a recent NPR interview  Harris said her truancy initiative was not designed to punish vulnerable families  but  put a spotlight  on the problem and direct resources to needy families  Her campaign hails the effort as a success  and supporters have lauded Harris for prioritizing a child s education  As a result of our initiative  which never resulted in any parent going to jail   never   because that was never the goal   Harris said But Harris s legacy remains on the state s books  She authored a state wide truancy law modeled after her San Francisco program  It has resulted in hundreds of parents in often less affluent and less politically liberal California counties being prosecuted Harris  approach at the time was considered smart politics for a politician seeking to run statewide  Throughout her career  Harris worked to win over powerful police unions  She refused to support a bill requiring her office to investigate shootings involving law enforcement officers  In 2015  she declined to back statewide standards for body cameras  arguing that individual departments should decide how to use the technology  If you offend all the police chiefs and sheriffs of California  you re probably not going to get re elected as the attorney general of California  and if you re not elected  how do you engage in any of the reforms you want to do   said Jim Bueermann  a former California police chief who worked on Harris  transition to the attorney general s office As Harris transitioned from law enforcement to legislating  the politics of criminal justice issues were changing fast The deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015 prompted outcry and spawned the Black Lives Matter movement  Democrats began rethinking their tough on crime strategies  focusing more on inequality and abuse in the system  Prosecutors and police came under increasing scrutiny for their roles Harris  views appear to have been changing  too In 2014  she was opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana  and when she ran against a Republican challenger for re election as attorney general she took the more conservative view  He wanted to legalize  Harris laughed at the idea in a local television interview But Harris s public tone changed as speculation grew about her running for president in 2020  Last year  Harris endorsed Democratic Sen  Cory Booker s bill for federal legalization of marijuana  She argued on Twitter that  making marijuana legal at the federal level is the smart thing to do and it s the right thing to do   She released a video declaring that  marijuana laws are not applied and enforced in the same way for all people  Last month  she went as far as acknowledging to a pair of morning radio hosts that she s used recreational marijuana   I have  and I did inhale  that was a long time ago  For Ron Gold  the Republican who ran against her in 2014 and who supported recreational legalization when she did not  Harris  stance on marijuana is indicative of her tendency to take a position  that s popular  but not necessarily held strongly by the candidate  it s a position that curries favor with a segment of the population   he said Some see a similar pattern when it comes to the call for bail reform Shortly after announcing her presidential bid in January  Harris declared on Twitter   It s long past time to address bail reform across the country   This is a serious injustice   she wrote Three years earlier  Harris s office was defending cash bail in a federal case  Neither the bail law nor the bail schedule discriminate on the basis of wealth  poverty  or economic status of any kind   she wrote  In response to the notion that money bail schemes unfairly punish low income defendants  Harris wrote   the state is not constitutionally required to remove obstacles not of its own creation  Harris appears to have shifted her stance 10 months later  In December of 2016  Harris filed a motion in a case challenging the application of California s money bail laws saying the system is deserving  of intense scrutiny   She pledged not to defend any bail scheme that fails to take into account a defendant s ability to pay  Three weeks later she was sworn in to the Senate Still  she asked the judge to toss the case  arguing that the laws were constitutional even if the way some counties implemented those laws was not  The bail system at issue here does not categorically deny bail to any group of individuals   she wrote The move perplexed bail reform advocates who say she could have used her position of power to do more as the top law enforcement official in the state  overseeing thousands of prosecutors who each day requested cash bail for those they charged with crimes  I m glad she s come to the right position now  but it s too late for tens of thousands of Californians  real human beings who have been detained in jail every day in California throughout the whole state  that the attorney general could have stopped   said Phil Telfeyan  one of the plaintiff s attorneys in the bail cases Harris  campaign declined to answer questions about when and why Harris  views on marijuana and bail reform shifted Campaign spokesman Ian Sams noted the political arena  not the courtroom  is the appropriate place to address policy problems  As senator   he said   she has aggressively confronted the policy question by proposing a bipartisan federal law to end cash bail  Simon  the civil rights advocate who worked with Harris  said she often say Harris spoke  privately  in frustration about cash bail and other elements of the criminal justice system while she was a prosecutor  But still  Harris had to work within its confines  Simon said  Prosecutors and lawmakers are different   she said   as a lawmaker  you actually get to make laws  As a prosecutor  you must follow them  Advocates say they re cautiously optimistic about Harris  legislative efforts  and are glad to see the issue in the political spotlight  But they note her bill  which she co wrote with Republican Sen  Rand Paul  endorsed the use of controversial risk assessment tools to determine who should be released from jail and who should remain behind bars Raphling said Harris  office has been receptive to feedback  Still  he said she

CAIRO   In his desire to wield sweeping power  President Abdel Fattah el Sisi of Egypt has suppressed politics  cowed the media and jailed legions of opponents Now he is extending his iron grip to a new corner of Egyptian society  the country s cherished soap operas Every year during the holy month of Ramadan  Egyptians crowd around their televisions to gorge on big budget mini series starring the country s top actors  including weepy melodramas  police procedurals and sweeping historical epics  The best are exported across the Middle East But the crop of shows currently in production for Ramadan are being subjected to suffocating controls  Mr  el Sisi s officials are dictating scripts and capping wages  directors and actors say  A military linked production company has taken charge of some of the biggest shows Filmmakers have been told their stories should follow approved themes  like praising the army and the police  or vilifying the banned Muslim Brotherhood  Those who don t play by the rules don t get on the air  For Sisi  this is not just about politics or power   said Ezzedine Choukri Fishere  a writer and former diplomat whose novels have been adopted into TV serials   He wants to re educate the Egyptian public  ImagePresident Abdel Fattah el Sisi  at an Arab summit meeting in Tunis on Sunday  is extending his grip to a new corner of Egyptian society  soap operas CreditZoubeir Souissi ReutersThe soap opera clampdown is the cultural edge of a far reaching and intrusive brand of authoritarianism that has taken root in Egypt under Mr  el Sisi  reaching new levels even for a country that has been governed by military backed strongmen for decades Hosni Mubarak  who governed for 30 years until his ouster in the 2011 Arab Spring  also presided over an oppressive  often cruel system  Even so  he allowed space for other centers of power  like his political party and the senior judiciary  which could result in surprising actions  Now and then  judges issued rulings that discomfited him  Newspapers could criticize him to a point  In 2005  the opposition Muslim Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in Parliament That space  limited as it was  has been virtually shut down under Mr  el Sisi  who came to power in a 2013 military takeover  He governs through a small clique of advisers  mostly drawn from the military  the security services and his family  that enjoys huge economic clout  sees the world through a security prism and has sought to stamp out every breath of dissent  Egyptians can be arrested for politically incorrect Facebook posts  I would frankly feel safer talking politics in Damascus than in Cairo   said Yezid Sayigh  a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut  Mr  el Sisi s personalist autocracy  he continued   tries to dominate the public space so completely that nobody dares say anything  even in private  that might be deemed dissent by those in power   That fear is what all totalitarian systems try to instill  that even when the system cannot eavesdrop on you  it can hear you  A government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Mr  el Sisi s approach has met with little resistance from President Trump  who is scheduled to host him at the White House next week  Where Washington once was a modest brake on the excesses of Egypt s strongmen  Mr  Trump has lavished praise on Mr  el Sisi in previous encounters   even complimenting his taste in footwear   but has said little about the tightening vise of repression in Egypt The United States has not had an ambassador in Cairo since July 2017 Mr  el Sisi s governing circle is dominated by military men he trusts  The army s Engineering Authority has been charged with overseeing ambitious projects worth billions of dollars  including an extension of the Suez Canal that was completed in 2015 and a new administrative capital that is under construction in the desert east of Cairo ImageThe set of the soap opera

little public oversight  prosecuting actors and political opponents as well as terrorism suspects  Mr  el Sisi s intelligence agencies quietly manipulate the workings of Parliament  which is currently debating sweeping constitutional changes that would extend Mr  el Sisi s term until 2034 and could also bring the senior judiciary directly under his authority  a power Mr  Mubarak never had Television talk shows  once a ferment of raucous debate  have become so predictably pro government that many Egyptians are tuning out  The foreign ministry  once a bastion of Egypt s proud diplomatic tradition  is viewed as a much reduced force  Sisi is not Kim Jong Un or Saddam Hussein   said Amy Hawthorne of the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington   But he s inching Egypt toward that kind of regime  The hand of the security agencies also extends deep into the economy  often blurring the line between national security and commerce As the ride sharing company Uber has expanded in Egypt  it has faced government demands to provide access to personal information about its customers  In February  as the security agencies stepped up those demands  the Uber app started to crash in Egypt  said an official with knowledge of talks between Uber and the Egyptian government But it is in his pursuit of culture and the arts that Mr  el Sisi has really stood out Last month the celebrated author Alaa al Aswany  who wrote The Yacoubian Building  said a secret military court had prosecuted him for  inciting hatred against the regime    a prosecution all the more striking because Mr  al Aswany was once an avowed el Sisi supporter In January  Amr Waked  an actor who starred in the Hollywood movie  Syriana   said in a Twitter post that he had been sentenced to eight years in prison for criticizing Mr  el Sisi  Last week  the Egypt s Actors Union expelled Mr  Waked  who lives in Europe  and another prominent actor for  high treason  after they attended a

positive principles  of older  state produced TV shows  and criticized recent productions  In the following years  state officials started to press filmmakers through both censorship and quiet pressure This season  though  the meddling has created an industry crisis  by several accounts With Ramadan just a month away  the number of mini series currently under production has been cut in half  to about 12 or 15  one director said The Egyptian Media Group  a company with links to the General Intelligence Service  has established the dominant TV production company and bought several of the biggest TV networks  according to Mada Masr  one of the last independent news outlets left in Egypt A senior director  speaking on the condition of anonymity  said scriptwriters were ordered this winter to follow certain guidelines  to glorify the military  to attack the Muslim Brotherhood and to promote conservative family values that encourage young Egyptians to obey their elders   and presumably avoid the kind of questioning that led to the 2011 Arab Spring  the director said The directive is a sign of another major difference between Mr  el Sisi and Mr  Mubarak  said Mr  Ezzidine  the analyst  who lives in the United States While Mr  Mubarak often seemed content to simply manage Egypt s dysfunction  Mr  Sisi appears intent on reshaping the country s moral and intellectual fiber  He has lectured citizens on their manners and their physical fitness  Now he wants to purge what he views as dangerous currents of thought Mr  el Sisi s defenders say Egypt needs a strong leader to protect the country from the chaos that has engulfed Libya  Syria and Yemen  and to enact long overdue yet unpopular  harsh economic reforms  like recent cuts to fuel and electricity subsidies  Egypt s stability has contributed to a 16 percent increase in tourism in the past year  and the energy sector is booming after major gas discoveries in the Mediterranean ImageEgypt s Parliament held

saw as a sign of mismanagement of basic services  He hoped to attract more protesters  But he was arrested within minutes and bundled into a police van alongside a friend who had filmed his solo protest In the back of the van  Mr  Mohy recorded an impassioned  sometimes tearful video message that was posted on Facebook  He would probably be tortured for speaking out  he said  but he insisted it had been worth it  Maybe they will inject us  maybe they will kill us  maybe they will burn us   said Mr  Mohy  whose Facebook page is filled with his poetry   But we are facing our destiny as men  With tens of thousands of opponents already in jail  such acts of public resistance are rare  and Mr  el Sisi s authority faces few obvious challenges for now Mr  el Sisi s view is that his strength comes from divine providence In a 2013 interview  he told a journalist that a voice had come to him in a dream and said   We will grant you what no one has had before  But some analysts warn that  in seeking to exert such tight control over the Egyptian state and society  Mr  el Sisi might be sowing the seeds of his eventual undoing Presiding over such a top heavy system that has alienated so many sectors of society could leave Mr  el Sisi vulnerable on the day his system inevitably faces an unforeseen shock  said Mr  Sayigh  the senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center  Sisi and the army have painted themselves into a corner by destroying anyone they could talk to   Mr  Sayigh said   When the day comes where they need others in government or business  they may have nobody to support them   

Senator Kamala Harris announced Monday night that her 2020 campaign raised  12 million in her first two plus months running for president  a sum that is expected to vault her into the top tier of financial competitors in the wide open Democratic primary Ms  Harris  a first term senator from California  invested heavily building an online network of donors in the two years leading up to her launch  spending millions of dollars to increase the size of her email supporter list  Her campaign said more than  6 million of her fund raising   about half of her total   came from her digital program  including  1 1 million in the last week Candidates must disclose their fund raising figures for the first quarter of 2019 by April 15  though many release them earlier in an attempt to position themselves better politically ahead of the full report Ms  Harris s campaign said she had received 218 000 contributions in total and that 98 percent of her contributions were under  100  Her average donation was about  55  Her campaign did not say how much of her total those small contributions accounted for  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race   A nationwide network of hundreds of thousands of grass roots supporters has stepped up to lay the foundation for a winning campaign   said Juan Rodriguez  Ms  Harris s campaign manager  in a statement Ms  Harris has also raised money aggressively on the traditional fund raising circuit and spent the final weekend of March dashing across California  from the Bay Area to Los Angeles  to raise as much as possible ahead of the first disclosure deadline of the 2020 race  Her campaign said only 0 55 percent of her individual donors gave the legal maximum of  2 800   though that is still hundreds of contributors Earlier on Monday  Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   announced that he had raised more than  7 million in the first quarter  Mr  Buttigieg s campaign said he had 158 550 donors who gave an average donation of  36 35  About 64 percent of his  7 million came from contributions of less than  200 Neither Ms  Harris nor Mr  Buttigieg disclosed how much cash on hand their campaigns currently have On Tuesday  senior advisers to Senator Bernie Sanders  who is widely expected to post the largest fund raising haul this month  are scheduled to release his fund raising figures  In emails to supporters  Mr  Sanders s campaign has said he had nearly 900 000 contributions in the first quarter  writing in one email that donations were  about a  20 average this time   His average donation was  27 in 2016  suggesting he has raised somewhere between  18 million and  24 million Ms  Harris recently rolled out a plan to give every teacher in America a substantial raise  and her campaign said on Monday that she has received 11 000 donations from educators  

WASHINGTON   Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised  18 2 million over the first six weeks of his presidential bid  his campaign announced Tuesday  a display of financial strength that cements his status as one of the top fund raisers in the sprawling Democratic field Mr  Sanders received almost 900 000 contributions from 525 000 individual donors  his campaign manager  Faiz Shakir  said  The average donation was  20  compared with  27 in Mr  Sanders s 2016 presidential campaign  he said Mr  Shakir said that a majority of Mr  Sanders s donors were under the age of 39  and that 20 percent of all donors had not contributed to Mr  Sanders s previous campaigns  He said that 88 percent of the total money raised came from donors giving  200 or less Mr  Sanders s announcement of his fund raising for the first quarter of the year had been highly anticipated  as he was expected to reveal a sizable total  Presidential candidates must report their first quarter fund raising to the Federal Election Commission by April 15  but they can choose to disclose information before that deadline  The announcement on Tuesday offered a chance for Mr  Sanders s team to showcase the breadth of support for his campaign  Make sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter  His total for the quarter is the largest announced by a Democratic candidate so far  though most campaigns have not made their numbers public Senator Kamala Harris of California raised  12 million in the first quarter  her campaign said on Monday  Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   said on Monday that he had raised more than  7 million  Both candidates entered the race in January  several weeks before Mr  Sanders announced his candidacy Andrew Yang  a New York businessman who is running on a platform that the United States should provide a universal basic income  said Tuesday that he had raised more than  1 7 million from over 80 000 donors   noteworthy figures for a political newcomer  His average donation was  17 92  he said  an amount even smaller than Mr  Sanders s Former Representative Beto O Rourke of Texas  who entered the race in March and has been a prolific online fund raiser  has yet to announce his haul for the quarter The fund raising totals are important beyond the symbolic value they carry for candidates who can point to large numbers of supporters  The Iowa caucuses are still 10 months away  meaning that Democratic candidates will need to be able to fund their campaigns for a long stretch of time just to make it to the first nominating contest  Who s in  Who s out  Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker   There is zero question now that Bernie will be able to build a very strong and formidable campaign operation   said Mo Elleithee  who was a spokesman for Hillary Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign and is now the executive director of Georgetown University s Institute of Politics and Public Service But Mr  Elleithee said it remained to be seen whether Mr  Sanders s backers would stick with him as time went on   What will be interesting is  Is this sustainable as other candidates get better known   he said Mr  Sanders posted a bigger opening number than he did in the last presidential race  when he raised about  14 million in the quarter that covered April through June of 2015  Mr  Shakir said it took 146 days  or about 21 weeks  for Mr  Sanders to reach 900 000 donations in that campaign But the amount raised by Mr  Sanders this quarter was not off the charts for a Democratic presidential hopeful  Mrs  Clinton raised about  47 million in her first quarter as a candidate in the 2016 campaign  though unlike Mr  Sanders  she relied heavily on big donations Mr  Sanders began the 2020 race with the benefit of an enormous donor base that he developed in his primary campaign against Mrs  Clinton  when he raised well over  200 million  After jumping into the 2020 race on Feb  19  he quickly reminded his rivals of his large following  collecting  5 9 million in the first 24 hours and a total of  10 million within a week   Only Mr  O Rourke disclosed a bigger 24 hour haul  with  6 1 million  The Sanders campaign had set a goal of receiving one million donations by the end of the first quarter  The campaign fell short of that goal  but Mr  Shakir expressed no regret about having aimed for it   It was important to us to set an ambitious goal   he said Mr  Sanders s financial resources go beyond the money he has received since entering the presidential race  Like others running for president who have previously run for federal office  he can make use of funds that he had raised in earlier campaigns  He began the 2020 race with  14 million available for his use  Mr  Shakir said Mr  Shakir said the new fund raising total showed that the movement Mr  Sanders began in his 2016 campaign was still gaining steam  He noted that there had been questions from pundits about whether that would be the case   Is this movement sustaining  Is it still there   The answer is a resounding yes   he said   It is still strong and it is still growing   

WASHINGTON   Senate Democrats blocked a Republican disaster aid bill  saying more money is needed to help hurricane torn Puerto Rico  But President Donald Trump opposes additional funding and says the U S  territory is getting more disaster money than some states The move tossed long sought relief for victims of hurricanes  floods and Western wildfires into limbo and escalated a fight between Democrats and Trump  who said Tuesday that he is the  best thing  that ever happened to Puerto Rico Trump claimed additional funding would come at the expense of U S  farmers and states  and attacked the island s political leaders  alleging they  only take from USA   Puerto Rico s residents are U S  citizens White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said it was  ridiculous  to question Trump s commitment to the people of Puerto Rico  but called the island  that country  in an interview with MSNBC  Gidley claimed the error was  a mistake  Monday s 44 49 vote fell short of a majority  much less the 60 votes required to overcome a Democratic filibuster  sending GOP leaders back to the drawing board and seeming unlikely to kill disaster aid efforts outright  since there is much political support to send aid to Southern farmers  wildfire ravaged California towns and Midwestern flood victims  Our work on this subject is far from finished   Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   said on Tuesday Trump allies such as Sens  David Perdue  R Ga   and Rick Scott  R Fla   are among the strongest backers of the legislation  We will get this done eventually   Perdue said  promising relief to struggling farmers in his state The path forward is unclear  but a leading option is for the Senate to pass a more narrowly drawn bill simply to get the issue into a House Senate conference committee  House Democrats insist the talks must produce a final measure with help for Puerto Rico Democrats say Trump has been slow to release already appropriated funding for Puerto Rico and has shown little urgency in helping the island  Trump criticized the island s government at a meeting with Senate Republicans last week and suggested Puerto Rico has gotten too much disaster help compared with states such as Texas  using inflated numbers to make his case  Just as we leave no soldier behind on the battlefield  we help our fellow Americans when there s a disaster  wherever the disaster strikes  We do not abandon them  Period   said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y Trump complained in a pair of tweets Tuesday about the island s leadership and said  91 billion destined for Puerto Rico is  more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before    all their local politicians do is complain   ask for more money  He said the politicians there are  grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA   The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J  Trump   the president continued   So many wonderful people  but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted  Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments  and so little appreciation  Puerto Rico Gov  Ricardo Rossello responded with his own tweets  stating in part   Mr  President  this  place  you refer to   PuertoRico  is home to over three million proud Americans that are still recovering from the storm and in need of federal assistance  We are not your adversaries  we are your citizens  Rossello also asked that all senators approve the disaster aid bill and disputed Trump s numbers  claiming that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved only  300 million in permanent work projects  not  91 billion The  13 5 billion Senate measure mostly mirrors a  14 2 billion measure the House passed in January  combining aid to Southern farmers  California communities devastated by last summer s wildfire  and hurricane hit states such as Florida  Georgia and North Carolina  Hurricane damaged military bases in Florida and North Carolina would receive rebuilding funds Democrats want to add almost  700 million more to unlock further disaster aid for Puerto Rico and several states  including help to rebuild badly damaged water systems  Democrats are also trying to force the administration to release billions of dollars in rebuilding funds that have already been approved McConnell said the Senate measure is the fastest way to get aid to the South and the Midwest  along with nutrition aid to Puerto Rico  where food stamp benefits have already been cut  It is the only bill on the table with any provision for the Midwest flooding   McConnell said   And it s the only bill on the table that could earn a presidential signature in time to deliver urgent relief on the nutrition assistance in Puerto Rico  Political momentum for the measure   strongly backed by Trump s allies in Georgia  Florida and North Carolina  among other states   has only been heightened by massive flooding in Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Iowa  whose nominating caucuses are the first test for Democrats hoping to challenge Trump next year  The GOP measure would make Midwestern states eligible for more aid  and by blocking the bill  Democratic presidential contenders in the Senate are likely to face criticism Trump has yet to veto a spending bill despite some tough talk  and he has signed off on  600 million to ease food stamp cuts in Puerto Rico Trump s  91 billion estimate  said a White House spokesman  includes about  50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements  along with  41 million already approved  Actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed slowly from federal coffers  

WASHINGTON   Tricia Newbold  the Trump administration s latest whistle blower  did something unexpected only hours after a House committee released her deposition that the White House had overruled career staff members who denied officials their security clearances  She went back to work  As you can imagine   Ms  Newbold  a 39 year old employee of the White House Personnel Security Office  wrote in an email during her commute on Monday   I am extremely nervous for how people at work will treat me  But according to people close to her  she was not afraid to tell them about the things she had seen  Ms  Newbold s decision to accuse her own office of rampant mismanagement of the security clearances of at least 25 employees came after months of what she characterized as personal discrimination and professional retaliation from Carl Kline  the office s former director  after she spent roughly a year trying to raise issues internally In a White House where aggressive leak investigations are conducted in service of President Trump  who has aides sign nondisclosure agreements  Ms  Newbold s account represents the rarest of developments  a damning on the record account from a current employee inside his ranks  She wasn t looking for trouble   Ms  Newbold s lawyer  Edward Passman  said in an interview on Monday   And she wasn t looking to go public  But her back was to the wall and she did what she had to do  Described as both  no nonsense  and  intense  by people who have interacted with her during the clearance process  Ms  Newbold has served under four presidential administrations  beginning with the Clinton White House in 2000  Eventually she worked her way up to adjudications manager  a job that required her to help make determinations about the security clearances of administration employees  Her office is filled with holdovers from other administrations  and it is meant to be nonpartisan Yet in the Trump administration the office was filled with people who had little experience in vetting employees in the interest of national security  Ms  Newbold said in a nine hour deposition with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform last week  There was no resolution   Ms  Newbold told the committee  according to a lengthy summary letter the panel s Democratic chairman published of her interview  which contained verbatim quotes   And I feel that right now this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office  Ms  Newbold told the committee that at least two senior administration officials had been granted security clearances   which gave them access to classified information   despite possible disqualifying issues  She also told the committee that she had compiled a list of at least 25 individuals  including contractors and senior advisers  who had a  wide range  of disqualifying information  including drug use  financial problems and criminal conduct In February  The New York Times reported that the president overruled several senior officials in order to reinstate the security clearance of Jared Kushner  his son in law and senior adviser  despite issues raised during his clearance process John F  Kelly  the president s former chief of staff  wrote a contemporaneous internal memo about how he had been  ordered  to give Mr  Kushner the top secret clearance  In her interviews with the House committee  Ms  Newbold said that Mr  Kelly and Joe Hagin  the former deputy chief of staff  had been attentive to the national security issues she had tried to raise Mr  Hagin resigned last June and Mr  Kelly in December  Mr  Trump has the legal authority to grant a clearance  but in most cases  the Personnel Security Office makes a determination about whether to grant one after the F B I  has conducted a background check Democrats on the committee are also demanding information from the White House about Ivanka Trump  the president s eldest daughter and adviser  who was granted a security clearance shortly after Mr  Kushner got his  In an interview with ABC News in February  Ms  Trump insisted her father had no hand in either her clearance or her husband s Ms  Newbold  who has a rare form of dwarfism  also accused Mr  Kline  the former director of personnel security  of retaliating against her when she repeatedly pointed out to him that actions he was taking  including overriding recommendations to issue clearances to two senior officials  were violating protocol  Ms  Newbold said that Mr  Kline oversaw a workplace where files   including extensive and sensitive background check documents   were not secured properly  and stopped the performing of credit checks for potential employees  She told the House committee that she had  never seen our office so ill staffed and with such lack of experience  Last fall  Ms  Newbold filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  accusing Mr  Kline of moving office files to a shelf several feet above her  deliberately out of her reach  beginning in December 2017  That month  she hired Mr  Passman  her lawyer  As little as I am  I m willing to fight and stand up for what I know is right  and they ve always respected that about me   Ms  Newbold told the House committee last week   It s humiliating to not be able to independently work and do the job that you need  In January  Ms  Newbold was suspended for two weeks without pay after NBC News reported that Mr  Kline had approved a security clearance for Mr  Kushner despite staff objections  The office s new director  Crede Bailey  said at the time that Ms  Newbold had refused to  support new procedures your supervisor implemented  Within the past two weeks  Mr  Passman said she was also removed from her supervisory role at work  On Monday  the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether she could expect to continue in her job  In the evening  Ms  Newbold s lawyer said she had gone back to work without incident Also on Monday  Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the committee s chairman  called for a subpoena for Mr  Kline  who now works at the Defense Department  to learn more about his work when he was the director of the office and about his interactions with Ms  Newbold  In a letter to Pat Cipollone  the White House counsel  Mr  Cummings said that the Trump administration had refused to provide information about  the problematic practices of the White House Security Office over the past two years  Republicans on the committee quickly sought to minimize what Ms  Newbold actually knew about the senior officials whose clearances were overturned  In a memo released on Monday  they said Mr  Cummings used only  cherry picked excerpts  from Ms  Newbold s deposition  and said she had acknowledged that the president had the  authority to grant access to national security information to anyone he chooses   The Republican members also pointed out that she had positive things to say about Mr  Bailey  her current supervisor Mr  Passman said Mr  Bailey s two week suspension of Ms  Newbold was  unwarranted   but added that  he s not personally attacking her like Kline did  It did not surprise Mr  Passman or other people close to Ms  Newbold that she returned to work   her choice to continue  kind of speaks for itself  about the kind of person she is  her older sister  Melissa Rahming  said in an interview on Monday   She s not afraid for what she s said   Ms  Rahming said  adding that her sister had  held her integrity this entire time  Daniel Jacobson  a former associate counsel in the Obama White House  called Ms  Newbold a  serious security professional  and a  total straight shooter  in a tweet on Monday  

WASHINGTON   A newly filed lawsuit is challenging a censorship system the government uses to ensure that millions of former military and intelligence officials spill no secrets if they decide to write articles and books after they move on from public service In an unusual constitutional complaint filed on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Maryland  a group of former officials declared that the prepublication review system  to which they are required to submit writing that relates to their former work for the rest of their lives  is  dysfunctional  and unjustifiably restricts their free speech and due process rights The system is plagued by a patchwork of ambiguous policies and vague standards that puts too much discretionary power in the hands of reviewing officials  who can delay or discriminate against lower ranking people who criticize government actions  while speedily clearing favorable memoirs and other writings by retired senior officials  the lawsuit said  This far reaching censorship system simply can t be squared with the Constitution   said Jameel Jaffer  executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University  which is jointly representing the plaintiffs with the American Civil Liberties Union He added   The government has a legitimate interest in protecting bona fide national security secrets  but this system sweeps too broadly  fails to limit the discretion of government censors and suppresses political speech that is vital to informing public debate  The Justice Department declined to comment about the lawsuit filed Tuesday  Read the complaint  The review system traces back to limits imposed on a handful of C I A  officials in the 1950s  It ratcheted out to cover more and more people and agencies starting in the 1970s and ballooned further under the Reagan administration Consenting to the reviews is now a routine part of gaining a security clearance  and the lawsuit also complained that even military employees without access to classified information face similar lifelong constraints While many lawsuits have been filed over the government s handling of particular manuscripts  the new one appears to be the first to challenge the underlying system itself  unconnected to any particular disputed piece of writing  legal specialists said The system relies mainly on a 1980 Supreme Court ruling  Snepp v  United States  which permitted the C I A  to seize the proceeds from a former officer who published a book without submitting it to the agency for review  The court did not hear arguments or take briefs before issuing an unsigned ruling  which dismissed the First Amendment issues in a footnote The legality of the censorship system is  unsettled  in part because  the practice of prior restraint by the government has grown enormously  since that case was decided  said Jack Goldsmith  a Harvard Law School professor and former Bush administration Justice Department official who has co written several articles critical of the process At the C I A  alone  the agency went from reviewing about 1 000 pages a year in the early 1970s to about 150 000 in 2014  the lawsuit said  citing documents the A C L U  and Knight Institute obtained under the Freedom of Information Act  This is a huge problem   Mr  Goldsmith said   The government s system of prior restraint is wildly overbroad  undisciplined and subject to inconsistent standards  It results in lots of important information that doesn t threaten national security not being made public  It chills people from writing things that would help people understand how the government works  In 2017  as part of the annual intelligence authorization law  Congress instructed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to come up with a new system for the intelligence community that would  yield timely  reasoned  and impartial decisions that are subject to appeal   Lawmakers set a deadline of 180 days But that deadline came and went  and the office still has not completed a new policy  although officials are working on it  an office spokeswoman said on Monday The plaintiffs asked a judge to rule that agencies cannot enforce any obligation to submit their future writings to review boards  They took no position on whether the solution is to fix the system or make it voluntary   which would leave former intelligence and military officials and contractors free to publish without prior review if they assume the risk of being prosecuted if they divulge any dangerous secrets The plaintiffs include Timothy H  Edgar and Richard H  Immerman  former employees of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  Melvin A  Goodman  a former C I A  employee  Anuradha Bhagwati  a former Marine  and Mark Fallon  a former counterterrorism agent at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service Mr  Fallon  who retired in 2010  said that he had trouble getting the manuscript for his book   Unjustifiable Means  The Inside Story of How the C I A   Pentagon  and U S  Government Conspired to Torture   cleared for publication His plan  he said  had been to publish it at the start of the Trump administration  But the government farmed out his book to numerous agencies  and the review process delayed publication more than eight months  to the fall of 2017  disrupting promotional plans When the manuscript was finally returned to him  he said  censors demanded the removal of 113 passages  many of which cited names and events that had been discussed in congressional hearings or newspaper articles  He said he reluctantly consented rather than delay further  There are names redacted in my book that are part of the Congressional Record   Mr  Fallon said   There are names that are redacted in parts of my book that weren t redacted in other parts of my book  which shows how ludicrous the process was  He also maintained that books by former officials and contractors who defended the C I A  s interrogation program were treated better  including George Tenet  its former director  John Rizzo  its former acting general counsel  Jose Rodriguez  the former head of its Counterterrorism Center  and psychologist James Mitchell  who helped design its program That critique dovetails with another recently filed lawsuit related to the prepublication censorship in 2011 of a book by Ali Soufan  a former F B I  counterterrorism agent who had clashed with the C I A  over the agency s use of torture after the Sept  11 attacks The lawsuit was brought by documentary filmmakers who say Mr  Soufan is still unable to discuss material with them that agency censors had blacked out in his manuscript  even though the C I A  permitted the former agency officials to discuss similar things in their own books   like details about the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah  a high value terrorism suspect  The system was about controlling a narrative   Mr  Soufan said in an interview   I had self censored a lot   I know what is classified   but it s not about protecting sources and methods if I m allowed to say  Abu Zubaydah talked because of waterboarding   but if I want to say  it wasn t waterboarding  that s not what happened   I can t say it   

WASHINGTON   Former Representative Beto O Rourke of Texas raised  9 4 million over the first 18 days of his presidential bid  his campaign said on Wednesday  the latest sign of his ability to attract online donors even within a packed Democratic field The total  which represents Mr  O Rourke s fund raising haul for the first quarter of the year  is smaller than the first quarter numbers of two rivals  Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California  But Mr  O Rourke only joined the presidential race in mid March Mr  O Rourke  who proved to be an extraordinary online fund raiser during his unsuccessful run for Senate last year  received 218 000 contributions  with an average donation of  43  his campaign said It also said that a majority of donors to his presidential bid had not donated to his Senate campaign  Mr  O Rourke raised roughly  80 million for his race against Senator Ted Cruz  an eye popping total that created high expectations for his fund raising as a presidential candidate  Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race  After entering the 2020 race  Mr  O Rourke offered early evidence of his fund raising power  His campaign said he had received  6 1 million in the first 24 hours of his bid  more than any other Democratic presidential candidate had announced raising in his or her first day  Mr  Sanders had previously been atop the pack  at  5 9 million in 24 hours That huge first day made up a majority of Mr  O Rourke s fund raising in the first quarter  Mr  Sanders went on to reach a total of  10 million raised within a week of announcing his campaign  his team said  a threshold that Mr  O Rourke did not meet in 18 days  There are tremendous expectations for him given his 2018 performance  but he s now swimming in a much more crowded pond than he was in 2018   said Amy Walter  the national editor of the Cook Political Report   And so I think that is going to be something to be watching for over the course of these next few months   Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker  Mr  O Rourke s campaign said 98 percent of the contributions it received were below  200  The campaign did not say how much cash it currently has  Not only is this a sign of our grass roots strength during the first two weeks of our campaign   Mr  O Rourke said of his fund raising in a statement   but it is a sign of what s possible when you put your full trust in the people of this country  Presidential candidates must disclose their first quarter fund raising by April 15  but some campaigns decide to make their numbers public before that deadline Mr  Sanders s campaign said on Tuesday that he had raised  18 2 million over six weeks  and Ms  Harris s campaign said on Monday that she had raised  12 million since joining the race in January  Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   said on Monday that he had raised more than  7 million since January The early fund raising totals put Mr  Sanders and Mr  O Rourke in their own class when it comes to bringing in money from grass roots donors  Mr  Sanders s campaign said he had not held any fund raising events  Mr  O Rourke s campaign said 99 percent of his fund raising came from online donations  and that he had not held a fund raiser since entering the race Ms  Harris  on the other hand  has a strong network of small donors  but she has also aggressively courted large donors  Her campaign said more than  6 million of her  12 million total came from the campaign s digital program  which includes fund raising efforts like email solicitations  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is  fully behind  Stephen Moore  his choice to help lead the Federal Reserve  despite unflattering details that have come to light about Moore s personal life  a top White House official said Wednesday while also complaining about Washington s  toxic  environment  I spoke to the president yesterday  He completely supports Steve  I certainly do  People are being awful hard on him     This town is a toxic town in some respects   Larry Kudlow  director of the National Economic Council  told reporters   So we are fully behind him  fully behind him  Kudlow said Moore is  a smart guy  who  would be a breath of fresh air on the Fed  and so far it s all systems go  Moore is a former Trump campaign adviser who helped design massive tax cuts the president signed into law in 2017  He has been affiliated with multiple conservative groups  including as the Heritage Foundation s chief economist  leading some economists to say Moore could inject politics into an institution that strives to keep decisions about monetary policy free of political influence Moore has taken a series of controversial stances on the Fed  and has acknowledged the need to learn more about how the central bank works He also has said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell should be fired for rate hikes last year that Moore claims undermined the benefits from Trump s tax cuts  Trump has also publicly come down hard on Powell over those increases  The Fed recently announced it will not raise interest rates in 2019  a decision Powell said was not influenced by the president Trump has yet to forward Moore s nomination to serve on the Fed s Board of Governors to the Senate for confirmation  His required background check has yet to be completed According to published reports and court records  Moore had a lien of more than  75 000 filed against him in January 2018 for unpaid taxes  and has fallen behind on alimony and child support payments to his ex wife After Trump s announcement in March  Moore said his criticisms of the Fed  including his suggestion about dismissing Powell  were likely written  in a time of anger  While the Fed s recent actions have been more in line with the easy credit stance the administration is seeking  Trump has made sharp attacks on the central bank at recent meetings  according to a report Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal  The newspaper quoted an unnamed source present at one of the meetings as saying that Trump told the group that he told Powell during a recent telephone conversation   I guess I m stuck with you  Asked about that comment during his appearance at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor  Kudlow said he thought it was an  expression of love and affection  on the part of the president Under the law that governs the Federal Reserve  a president can only remove a Fed chairman for cause  Courts in cases that involved other agencies that use similar language have interpreted it to exclude policy differences On the separate issue of tariffs  Kudlow said Trump would veto legislation being considered by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley  R Iowa  that  among other things  would scale back the president s virtually unlimited power to impose tariffs on imports he declares a threat to national security  The president is not in favor of that at the moment  Not in favor of that   Kudlow said  He added that the president believes imposing tariffs  or even merely threatening to impose them  gives him the upper hand in trade talks with other countries  China most notably Trump slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports last year and believes China would not currently be negotiating a trade deal with the U S  had he not imposed the levies  Kudlow said A Chinese delegation is in Washington this week for another round of talks  following a U S  team s trip to Beijing last week for discussions    AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report     

WASHINGTON   Some of Robert S  Mueller III s investigators have told associates that Attorney General William P  Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr  Barr indicated  according to government officials and others familiar with their simmering frustrations At stake in the dispute   the first evidence of tension between Mr  Barr and the special counsel s office   is who shapes the public s initial understanding of one of the most consequential government investigations in American history  Some members of Mr  Mueller s team are concerned that  because Mr  Barr created the first narrative of the special counsel s findings  Americans  views will have hardened before the investigation s conclusions become public Mr  Barr has said he will move quickly to release the nearly 400 page report but needs time to scrub out confidential information  The special counsel s investigators had already written multiple summaries of the report  and some team members believe that Mr  Barr should have included more of their material in the four page letter he wrote on March 24 laying out their main conclusions  according to government officials familiar with the investigation  Mr  Barr only briefly cited the special counsel s work in his letter ImageListen to  The Daily   New Insights Into the Mueller ReportThe attorney general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four page summary  Members of the special counsel s team say something was lost transcriptBack to The Dailybars0 00 25 58 25 58transcriptListen to  The Daily   New Insights Into the Mueller ReportHosted by Michael Barbaro  produced by Theo Balcomb  Lisa Tobin and Paige Cowett  and edited by Larissa AndersonThe attorney general turned a report of nearly 400 pages into a four page summary  Members of the special counsel s team say something was lost michael barbaroFrom The New York Times  I m Michael Barbaro  This is  The Daily   Today  The Mueller team sent its report to the attorney general  William Barr  The attorney general sent a summary of that report to Congress  Now  new reporting shows members of Mueller s team feel that Barr s summary did not reflect the report they wrote  It s Thursday  April 4  So take us back to the beginning of last week  What do we know at that point nicholas fandosSo we knew that Bill Barr  taking Bob Mueller s 300  to 400 page report  had gone through it extensively and boiled down what he called the  principal conclusions  to just four pages michael barbaroNick Fandos covers Congress  Mike Schmidt covers national security michael schmidtWe were in this unusual situation where the special counsel  Robert Mueller  had sent his report to the attorney general  said  I found no evidence that the campaign conspired with Russia to impact the election  But he declined to make a decision on obstruction nicholas fandosAnd what he said was Mueller didn t reach what Barr called a  traditional prosecutorial decision   In other words  Mueller presented evidence for the fact that the president may have obstructed justice but didn t go as far as to conclude that he had  He essentially punted to the attorney general s office michael schmidtAnd in this case  by Mueller not reaching a determination  he leaves the door open for Barr to come in to say  O K   Mueller didn t make a determination on this issue of obstruction  He did on collusion  I m going to look at all the facts  And he makes his determination   no case to be made here on both of these issues  The problem  though  is that the perception is that Mueller  the independent investigator who s there to do an inquiry free of politics  has not made a call on this central question  But Barr  the president s appointee  who s been there just for a few months  is making the decision  So the question is  is the fix in  Why is it  if Mueller didn t come to an answer  the attorney general did michael barbaroSo at the beginning of last week  we know that Mueller made the unusual decision not to make a call  And Barr made the unusual decision to make a call  And the question is  why michael schmidtIt s not unusual that Barr made a call  The Justice Department is there to decide whether people broke the law or not  And he was doing that  What s different and unusual here is that Barr and Mueller don t look like they re on the same page  music michael schmidtMueller said  I can t make a determination on this issue  And Barr did  So why is it that they looked at it differently  Why was it that Mueller  the prosecutor here  didn t do the one thing that prosecutors at the Justice Department do  which is make a call nicholas fandosAnd that was the question that we ve spent the last week trying to figure out  What is the difference here  What is the evidence that they re looking at  And why did Mueller and Barr make the decisions that they made around this question of obstruction of justice michael barbaroAnd what have we now learned nicholas fandosWhat we ve now learned is that nobody s happy  The team that was working   or at least some of the team that was working with Bob Mueller feels that Barr stepped in and filled the vacuum in a way that didn t properly capture what their 22 month investigation found  And Barr s team feels that Bob Mueller fell short of doing his job michael barbaroSo let s start with the Barr side  Explain more about why the attorney general and those around him are upset michael schmidtSo in not reaching a decision on obstruction of justice  Barr has to go out on his own and make that determination without the top cover of the independent investigator who went out and was supposed to make a determination on whether the president broke the law michael barbaroAnd what do you mean by  top cover  michael schmidtOne of the reasons you have a special counsel is to insulate an investigation from politics and then  when the investigation is concluded  have a way of holding up the product of the inquiry  the fruits of it  to the public and saying  look  this was done free of politics  We assessed this matter based on the facts  And now you have a result that is exposed  at least in part  to the perception that the president s guy made the decision michael barbaroThe attorney general michael schmidtCorrect nicholas fandosUndercutting one of the key points of Mueller s appointment in the first place michael barbaroAnd you re saying that the people in the Justice Department and that Barr himself are upset to be put in that position michael schmidtWell  the system s not working the way it s supposed to  You had Mueller there for one reason   yea or nay on crimes  And on one of these central questions  he couldn t get there  And by stepping back and saying  I don t know  it allows at least the Democrats to say  what  How was this decision made  How did they get to this  How is it that the president s political appointee was the ultimate decider nicholas fandosAnd it gives them real credence to go and say  we need to see all the evidence  We need to see the whole file here because the president s handpicked man made this decision  Maybe we d reach a different conclusion if we looked at the evidence  Bob Mueller seems to have michael barbaroSo then why did Barr choose to make a call on obstruction of justice if he knew and was upset that this was going to be seen as hyper political and that it would fan the flames of Democrats in Congress nicholas fandosThe problem for Barr was that when he got the report and looked at the evidence  to him  it was a pretty clear case that you would not press this kind of charge  that the president hadn t obstructed justice  Now  you ve got to remember that Barr comes to the job with a pretty expansive view of executive power  As Democrats made famous  he wrote a memo before he was appointed attorney general arguing that certain acts by the president shouldn t be construed as obstruction of justice  They re part of his executive powers  And so he looked at this and  I mean  he can t make the same decision that Mueller did  Somebody has to make a choice about whether or not this is a chargeable offense  And he looked at it and says  well  in our judgment and this team s judgment  it s not michael barbaroSo Barr reads the report and thinks  what are you talking about it s not clear whether or not there was obstruction of justice  There  in his mind  clearly wasn t nicholas fandosBarr does acknowledge that there is evidence  basically  of behavior that could be construed as obstructive  He gives credence to what Mueller is presenting but says  when you add it all up  it doesn t tip into  michael schmidtCriminality nicholas fandos  criminal obstructive territory michael barbaroRight  And while it felt political for Barr to reach a conclusion  to make a call that Mueller wouldn t  I have to think it would have felt even more political in Barr s mind for Congress to be the one to perform that role  And so he was upset to have to make this call  but  it sounds like  felt that he had to michael schmidtI don t know if he s upset as much as he looks at this situation and says  this is not the way it s supposed to be working  Someone needs to make a decision on whether the president broke the law  I ll step in and do that  And I think I can do that based on the facts nicholas fandosAnd Congress can still play a role  I m redacting the report  I ll give it to you with sensitive information blacked out  And then you can make your own judgment  But the public has an intense interest in this  And I ve got to say something  And I decide whether acts broke the law or not  And I don t think this one did michael barbaroDo we know if Mueller s team expected Barr to make this call on obstruction of justice after they declined to do so nicholas fandosWe don t know precisely what the Mueller team expected on this obstruction question  It seems that they were not clear in communicating to the Justice Department what they wanted  It may not have mattered anyway  But what we do know is that after Barr came out with this four page summary  which essentially exonerated the president on collusion and said he did not break the law on obstruction  some members of Mr  Mueller s team felt that he had inadequately and only partially represented the work of their 22 month investigation michael barbaroSo this is the other side of your reporting   that not only was the Barr side disappointed with the Mueller side  the Mueller side was disappointed with the Barr side nicholas fandosWhat we have learned is that since Barr made his public statement about a week ago  members of the Mueller team have told associates that they feel  essentially  that his work   if it wasn t misrepresentative of theirs   didn t give the full picture  which they believe is more damaging to the president than the attorney general s letter lets on  Now  we are not saying that every member of the Mueller team is frustrated by this  We don t know what Bob Mueller himself thinks  He remains one of the black boxes at the center of this investigation  But there are members of the team who were involved in the decision making around these issues that we ve been talking about who have watched and been disappointed and angry about how it s being characterized michael barbaroAnd what is the focus of their disappointment  to the degree you understand it nicholas fandosSo when they read Bill Barr s concise four page letter  they were frustrated that he had not drawn more from their own work  And in fact  what we discovered in reporting this piece out is that they had prepared summaries of their own work that were part of the report that they handed over to the Justice Department a couple of weeks ago and felt that some of that material could have easily been drawn into what Mr  Barr handed over  So not that he shouldn t have made a decision about whether the president obstructed justice or not in a criminal sense  but that concurrent with that  he should have put out more of their evidence or analysis to fill out the public picture  The Justice Department says those summaries had sensitive information in them  classified information  secretive grand jury information that couldn t become public  and ultimately didn t use any of it michael schmidtSo what Mueller s folks are essentially saying is  hey  we wrote these summaries  If you were going to go out and say something about this investigation  and you were going to do something as extreme or as declarative as clearing the president  why is it that you didn t include some of the things that we found michael barbaroAnd specifically  why didn t you include some stuff that we found that was pretty damning  You re making it seem like the president didn t do anything wrong michael schmidtDonald Trump has come out in the days after Barr s declaration and said the Mueller report was beautiful  And it completely exonerates him  If you re an investigator who spent the last two years looking at Donald Trump  and you think there s a lot of questionable behavior there  that is something that is going to irritate you mightily michael barbaroI mean  do either of you think that the Mueller people have a legitimate point here  Or is this a classic case of pride of authorship  They wanted to see their work in the public summary nicholas fandosI don t think that we fully know  What seems clear in our reporting is that there was no specific communication or agreement by the Mueller team to the Barr team   you should use these things  or we want these things to be out  They seem to have had an intention  And they certainly now have a regret about it  But we don t know what interaction there was in the actual decision making process that happened that weekend two weeks ago michael barbaroWell  so why do we think that Barr chose not to include more of what was in these summaries  especially the negative material  in his four page summary michael schmidtI think there s one big  broad reason and another contemporary reason  the broad reason being that Barr and many Justice Department officials and  for many years  prosecutors believe that if they decide not to charge someone  the fruits of the investigation should not be just thrown out there for the public or for the enemies of the person who were investigated michael barbaroDirty laundry should not be aired if the subject of those dirty laundry are not charged with a crime michael schmidtIf you cannot meet this incredibly high bar of bringing a federal prosecution  that doesn t mean you then get to just take the trash and just throw it out in the street and let the public rummage through it michael barbaroAnd Mike  by the contemporary example you referred to  I m assuming you re talking about James Comey michael schmidtI m talking about the July 2016 press conference that James Comey held  It s right in the heat of the presidential election  He stands up and says  we  the F B I   have done this investigation into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email account  We don t think there is a case to be made here  But we found some very questionable behavior in how she handled sensitive national security secrets  The press conference was seen as very damaging to Clinton even though a case was never made michael barbaroAnd so you re saying that Barr s view would be  I m not going to be the one to replicate that by drawing from these Mueller team summaries and putting those out into the public sphere michael schmidtCorrect  We don t use criminal investigations to go out and find damaging things that may not be crimes that we then simply release to the public to be used against someone nicholas fandosThe problem is  this was never a normal or average criminal investigation  It has broad national security implications  And it has implications for almost every decision that s made at the highest levels of the government michael schmidtThis is more about a pathway of how you deal with the president s conduct  And what it appears from the Mueller side is that they re saying  look  this is the president of the United States  There s some conduct here that we think the public and Congress should see  And O K   Justice Department  it may not be criminal  But this is the president  And this needs to be examined more thoroughly by the political process and by Congress  It s about a pathway of dealing with the president nicholas fandosAnd Bill Barr doesn t seem to disagree with that  fundamentally  He said throughout that he wants to make as much of this report public as possible  But he doesn t think that that absolves him of the Justice Department s role of saying whether or not the president or his campaign broke the law  And so he s grappling with the Justice Department s aversion to talk about individuals that it s not saying broke the law  But yet he knows that the public and the Congress want and probably are owed more information about what did happen  And so he s kind of operating somewhere in the middle of those two things michael schmidtThe difference here is that if I was under investigation  and the Justice Department determined that I didn t break the law  then there s no other process that really needs to be dealt with me  Maybe my company needs to decide whether I get fired or not for that conduct  In this instance  there s another issue with the president  O K   the president didn t break the law  But maybe the president did things with his power that the public should know about  Congress should know about  and need to be more closely examined  Because maybe it s not just about breaking the law  It s about how he conducted himself as president  And does Congress need to deal with that  And what we are starting to see from Mueller s side is this frustration that  hey  we think there s some bad stuff that happened here  But by Barr coming out and not disclosing that but saying the president didn t break the law  he is casting the die on how the public will later look at the president s conduct  It will say that for several weeks after we finished our report  the only thing that was out there was Bill Barr saying the president didn t break the law  and the president turning around and saying  I was fully exonerated  And they re saying  hey  America  we think more of this process needs to play out michael barbaroRight michael schmidtSo this all comes down to the vexing question of  how do we investigate a sitting president  And how is that done in a way that the public has the utmost confidence in that  And in that is this tension between how much independence the investigator should have  In Nixon  that pendulum swung too far in the president s direction  In the Starr investigation of Clinton  it went the other way  The investigator had too much power  And here  between Mueller and Barr s teams  they are fighting that same fight and have different understandings of how this should all be dealt with  And it s the same issue that we ve been looking at for 50 years  just the latest episode of it michael barbaroSo inside of one presidential investigation  these two teams are embodying all the tensions that have basically been present since Watergate nicholas fandosCorrect michael schmidtIt s how much you can tell the public  and how is apparent misconduct by the president dealt with  And there s no clear pathway on that  So whatever Barr does will be viewed by one side as political and laying on the brakes for the president  Whatever Mueller does will be viewed by the president s enemies as trying to get him  And the confidence in that process then erodes  And it s messy  And it s hard to figure out  What are the real facts here  What really happened michael barbaroBut at this point  we re just talking about the summary that Bill Barr sent to Congress  We re still waiting on the full report  So won t this tension that you re describing eventually be more or less resolved when we learn how much information we ll ultimately have access to nicholas fandosIt may be  And we may see a very different set of facts at the end of the day  But I think the question here is about who sets the narrative for the intervening period of time  It may end up being a month before we see a fuller version of the Mueller report  And for that time  Bill Barr s conclusion that the president didn t break the law is going to be the dominant narrative  And I think that what we re hearing from members of the Mueller team is a concern that by the time their fuller work does come out  the narrative is baked   so much so that even if it shows  for instance  that the president didn t break the law but abused his office or conducted acts that Congress will deem inappropriate for his office  that there s not room to have a full debate around that  that the conclusions about the work that they did for 22 months will have been prejudged at that point  and that it won t quite matter what the report says for the president s political fate michael barbaroNick  Mike  thank you very much nicholas fandosThank you guys michael schmidtThanks for having us archived recording  jerry nadler The committee has a job to do  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct michael barbaroOn Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the use of subpoenas to obtain a full copy of the Mueller report archived recording  jerry nadler That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence michael barbaroThe committee s chairman  Democratic representative Jerry Nadler of New York  said he would not immediately issue a subpoena  But his power to do so will intensify pressure on the attorney general  William Barr  to quickly release an unredacted copy of the report archived recording  jerry nadler I will give him time to change his mind  But if we cannot reach an accommodation  then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials michael barbaroWe ll be right back  music michael barbaroHere s what else you need to know today  A Times analysis of deadly terror attacks involving white extremists has found that at least a third of them were inspired by fellow white men who carried out similar attacks and had either professed admiration for them or interest in their tactics  In one case  a school shooter in New Mexico corresponded with a gunman who attacked a mall in Munich  All together  the two men killed 11 people  The connections between the killers crossed continents and highlight how the internet and social media have spread white extremism  And  archived recording  joe biden I ve always tried to be   in my career  I ve always tried to make a human connection  That s my responsibility  I think  I shake hands  I hug people  I grab men and women by the shoulders and say  you can do this michael barbaroOn Wednesday  former vice president Joe Biden responded to a series of complaints from women that his close physical contact had made them uncomfortable archived recording  joe biden Our social norms have begun to change  They ve shifted  And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset  And I get it  I get it  I hear what they re saying  I understand it michael barbaroIn a video message sent as Biden prepares for a possible presidential run  he defended his behavior but said he is able to change archived recording  joe biden But I ll always believe governing  quite frankly   life  for that matter   is about connecting michael barbaroThat s it for  The Daily   I m Michael Barbaro  See you tomorrow However  the special counsel s office never asked Mr  Barr to release the summaries soon after he received the report  a person familiar with the investigation said  And the Justice Department quickly determined that the summaries contain sensitive information  like classified material  secret grand jury testimony and information related to current federal investigations that must remain confidential  according to two government officials The Criminal Investigations That Sprouted From MuellerFederal prosecutors are pursuing a number of criminal inquiries that grew out of the investigation of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III Mr  Barr was also wary of departing from Justice Department practice not to disclose derogatory details in closing an investigation  according to two government officials familiar with Mr  Barr s thinking  They pointed to the decision by James B  Comey  the former F B I  director  to harshly criticize Hillary Clinton in 2016 while announcing that he was recommending no charges in the inquiry into her email practices The officials and others interviewed declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Mr  Barr explained  although the report is believed to examine Mr  Trump s efforts to thwart the investigation  It was unclear how much discussion Mr  Mueller and his investigators had with senior Justice Department officials about how their findings would be made public  It was also unclear how widespread the vexation is among the special counsel team  which included 19 lawyers  about 40 F B I  agents and other personnel At the same time  Mr  Barr and his advisers have expressed their own frustrations about Mr  Mueller and his team  Mr  Barr and other Justice Department officials believe the special counsel s investigators fell short of their task by declining to decide whether Mr  Trump illegally obstructed the inquiry  according to the two government officials  After Mr  Mueller made no judgment on the obstruction matter  Mr  Barr stepped in to declare that he himself had cleared Mr  Trump of wrongdoing Representatives for the Justice Department and the special counsel declined to comment on Wednesday on views inside both Mr  Mueller s office and the Justice Department  They pointed to departmental regulations requiring Mr  Mueller to file a confidential report to the attorney general detailing prosecution decisions and to Mr  Barr s separate vow to send a redacted version of that report to Congress  Under the regulations  Mr  Barr can publicly release as much of the document as he deems appropriate Read Attorney General William Barr s Summary of the Mueller ReportThe letter  by Attorney General William P  Barr  details the main findings of the special counsel s two year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election A debate over how the special counsel s conclusions are represented has played out in public as well as in recent weeks  with Democrats in Congress accusing Mr  Barr of intervening to color the outcome of the investigation in the president s favor In his letter to Congress outlining the report s chief conclusions  Mr  Barr said that Mr  Mueller found no conspiracy between Mr  Trump s campaign and Russia s 2016 election interference  While Mr  Mueller made no decision on his other main question  whether the president illegally obstructed the inquiry  he explicitly stopped short of exonerating Mr  Trump Mr  Mueller s decision to skip a prosecutorial judgment  leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime   Mr  Barr wrote  He and his deputy  Rod J  Rosenstein  decided that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that Mr  Trump had committed an obstruction offense Mr  Barr has come under criticism for sharing so little  But according to officials familiar with the attorney general s thinking  he and his aides limited the details they revealed because they were worried about wading into political territory  Mr  Barr and his advisers expressed concern that if they included derogatory information about Mr  Trump while clearing him  they would face a storm of criticism like what Mr  Comey endured in the Clinton investigation VideoThis is the story of how the special counsel Robert S  Mueller III s extensive investigation into Russian efforts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race got started CreditCreditDoug Mills The New York TimesLegal experts attacked Mr  Comey at the time for violating Justice Department practice to keep confidential any negative information about anyone uncovered during investigations  The practice exists to keep from unfairly sullying people s reputations without giving them a chance to respond in court Mr  Rosenstein cited the handling of the Clinton case in a memo the White House used to rationalize Mr  Trump s firing of Mr  Comey Though it was not clear what findings the special counsel s investigators viewed as troubling for the president  Mr  Barr has suggested that Mr  Mueller may have found evidence of malfeasance in investigating possible obstruction of justice   The report sets out evidence on both sides of the question   Mr  Barr wrote in his March 24 letter Mr  Mueller examined Mr  Trump s attempts to maintain control over the investigation  including his firing of Mr  Comey and his attempt to oust Mr  Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to install a loyalist to oversee the inquiry Mueller Report  Who and What the Special Counsel InvestigatedMore than two years of criminal indictments and steady revelations about Trump campaign contacts with Russians reveal the scope of the special counsel investigation The fallout from Mr  Barr s letter outlining the Russia investigation s main findings overshadowed his intent to make public as much of the entire report as possible  a goal he has stressed since his confirmation hearing in January  He reiterated to lawmakers on Friday that he wanted both Congress and the public to read the report and said that the department would by mid April furnish a version with sensitive material blacked out  He offered to testify on Capitol Hill soon after turning over the report Mr  Barr  who took office in February  has shown flashes of frustration over how the unveiling of the investigation s findings has unfolded  In his follow up letter to lawmakers on Friday  he chafed at how the news media and some lawmakers had characterized his March 24 letter Mr  Barr and Mr  Mueller have been friends for 30 years  and Mr  Barr said during his confirmation hearing in January that he trusted Mr  Mueller to conduct an impartial investigation  He said he told Mr  Trump that Mr  Mueller was a  straight shooter who should be dealt with as such   Mr  Mueller served as the head of the Justice Department s criminal division when Mr  Barr was attorney general under George Bush  and their families are friends Mr  Barr s promises of transparency have done little to appease Democrats who control the House  The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to let its chairman use a subpoena to try to compel Mr  Barr to hand over a full copy of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence to Congress  The chairman  Representative Jerrold Nadler  Democrat of New York  has not said when he will use the subpoena  but made clear on Wednesday that he did not trust Mr  Barr s characterization of what Mr  Mueller s team found  The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct   Mr  Nadler said   That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves   not the attorney general s summary  not a substantially redacted synopsis  but the full report and the underlying evidence  Republicans  who have embraced Mr  Barr s letter clearing Mr  Trump  have accused the Democrats of trying to prolong the cloud over his presidency and urged them to move on Mr  Trump has fully embraced Mr  Barr s version of events  For days  he has pronounced the outcome of the investigation a  complete and total exoneration  and called for the Justice Department and his allies on Capitol Hill to investigate and hold accountable those responsible for opening the inquiry

it actually matters a lot of the time  CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesJaden Rams used to be on fire for Donald Trump  Shortly before the 2016 presidential election  when he was 13  he put on a red MAGA hat and matching tie and yelled his support at a rally in his hometown  Grand Junction  Colo  I was getting politically charged around that time   he said   I was pretty passionate about a lot of the causes he was advocating for  Today he calls the presidential campaign and its aftermath  a travesty for American unity   He believes President Trump has fulfilled his campaign promises  but added that  I don t feel largely those have been positive   Two years closer to voting age  he now leans left  and said he would register as an independent These are critical years for the voters of tomorrow  Political science research shows that a generation of voters is shaped for life by what happens during the teenage years and early 20s  whether the country is at war  how the economy is doing  whether the president is popular  Evidence in the Trump era so far shows young people coming of age now are tilting left  Election data suggests that the youngest voters are supporting Democrats  and surveys of teenagers not yet old enough to vote reveal them to be anxious about the current state of the country and likely to embrace liberal views ImageAlemitu  center  and Selame

of whites ages 18 to 24 say they re Republicans  They favored Mr  Trump in the presidential election  but those who turned out in the midterm elections very narrowly backed Democrats  according to

voters turn out at much higher rates  And young Americans who connect to Mr  Trump could retain lasting ties to his party  It s also possible that this generation will be exposed to very different

BERLIN   Germany s most notorious far right politician  Björn Höcke  a man who has called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin  a monument of shame   was furious when he woke up one morning to find a section of the memorial built to scale outside his bedroom window It was November 2017  Mr  Höcke sued the artist who had secretly rented the neighboring property and prepared the stunt over many months  He tried to have him evicted  He even launched criminal proceedings against him  But to no avail  The rental lease is open ended And the replica of the Holocaust memorial remains But where civil and criminal proceedings have failed  a state prosecutor has stepped in  it emerged Wednesday  The prosecutor s office in Mr  Höcke s eastern home state  Thuringia  is investigating the artist  Philipp Ruch  on suspicion of  forming a criminal association   a legal provision known as Paragraph 129  which gives the state far reaching surveillance rights and is normally applied to criminal groups and suspected extremists The investigation  which was revealed in the answer to a routine parliamentary question  is now raising questions about whether the law is being leveraged by far right sympathizers to crack down on their opponents  Mr  Höcke s party  the far right Alternative for Germany  the country s third largest party in Parliament  is particularly strong in the former Communist East of the country  We have to ask the question  Is there a political intention that overlaid the judicial intention   said Steffen Dittes  the lawmaker of the Left Party who made the parliamentary request to see a list of all those who were being investigated under Paragraph 129 In the reply he was sent  there were a dozen investigations listed in two tables  In one table  designated for terrorist suspects  groups like the Islamic State and the Shabab came up repeatedly  the other table included a group of Holocaust deniers  far right and far left extremists   and then   a group of action artists   It sends a devastating political signal   Mr  Dittes said Mr  Dittes noted that the investigation of Mr  Ruch was opened in November 2017  a week after he had unveiled the replica memorial and just a couple of days after Mr  Höcke had publicly accused Mr  Ruch and his artist collective of being  a terrorist association  ImageBjörn Höcke  center  a member of the far right party Alternative for Germany  in Chemnitz last year CreditMartin Divisek EPA  via ShutterstockMr  Dittes also said that the prosecutor in charge of the investigation had built a reputation for being soft on far right offenders  for example letting it slide when a notorious German song about  a subway to Auschwitz  was sung at an Alternative for Germany election rally in 2017  This does not look like a mistake or an exception   Mr  Dittes said Martin Zschächner  the prosecutor in Thuringia in charge of the investigation  denied that it was politically motivated  Speaking in a telephone interview  Mr  Zschächner said he was investigating Mr  Ruch because he was suspected of illegally  spying  on Mr  Höcke  On their internet page they said they wanted to spy on him  so the question is whether that happened or was planned   Mr  Zschächner said  Sixteen months later  he said  the investigation was still continuing Meanwhile  the domestic intelligence service of Thuringia concluded long ago that neither Mr  Ruch nor his artist collective  the Berlin based Center for Political Beauty  was extremist   It s political art  not extremism   said Stephan Kramer  who heads the agency Mr  Ruch aims to offend  He has been sued countless times over his art  but so far he has never lost a case  And never before has anyone raised any suspicions of him being a criminal or involved in extremist activity  he said  That is the scary part   Mr  Ruch said in an interview on Wednesday   They could be observing me  tapping my phone  following me around because they don t like my art and my politics   He plans legal action against Mr  Zschächner The idea of making a replica memorial outside of Mr  Höcke s house came to Mr  Ruch in January 2017  That month  Mr  Höcke spoke at a rally in Dresden and questioned the guiding precept of modern Germany   the country s culpability in World War II and the Holocaust   calling on Germans to make a  180 degree  turn in the way they viewed their history Germans were  the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of their capital   he had said  referring to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin ImageA news conference last year with activists of the Center for Political Beauty  from left  Cesy Leonard  Stefan Pelzer and Philipp Ruch CreditBernd von Jutrczenka Picture Alliance  via Getty ImagesIn addition to building the replica memorial  Mr  Ruch and his colleagues pretended to monitor Mr  Höcke s family home from a fake spy room with old electronic equipment that was also open to visitors Sometimes  the artists would dress up as spies in trench coats and filmed Mr  Höcke s house  Once  they even rifled through his trash to get a DNA sample in order to determine Mr  Höcke s own racial purity   It turned out he has Polish and Portuguese ancestry  Another time  they offered 5 000 euros  or about  5 620  to anyone willing to provide a witness statement that Mr  Höcke has written under a pseudonym for a newsletter associated with a convicted neo Nazi who lives two villages away Mr  Ruch defended these measures as stunts aimed at raising awareness about how extremist Mr  Höcke s views were in his opinion Two years later  Germany s domestic intelligence office has in fact put Mr  Höcke and a number of other prominent members of the Alternative for Germany under observation for suspected extremism  What we did as fiction the state is now doing in reality   Mr  Ruch said Mr  Ruch has known since February that he was the subject of some investigation because a government sponsored organization that had invited him to speak at a conference abruptly disinvited him on Feb  12 In a letter  the organization said it had been informed by the Interior Ministry about a criminal investigation regarding his person Mr  Ruch himself had not been informed that he was under investigation  It was only when Mr  Dittes contacted him last month that he began to make enquiries  But when he requested to see his file  he was denied access  because the investigations are still ongoing   

WASHINGTON   Amid blowback from Capitol Hill  President Donald Trump switched gears again Wednesday  suggesting he never wanted Congress to vote to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election Trump s new tweets shifted his rationale for the  Obamacare  fight  First he said it was his choice to push off the health care votes  Then he said he never expected there to be any votes at all until after 2020 Trump claimed Wednesday he had never intended to reopen old wounds  But in keeping the issue at the forefront  the president put fresh attention on the GOP s long running and thus far unsuccessful effort to end ACA  I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me   the Republican Party   Trump tweeted  adding   I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election  That s not how congressional Republicans  including Senate Majority Leader McConnell  understood Trump s sudden shift to the issue last week Nor did it stop Democrats from calling attention to the health care issue Wednesday The Democratic controlled House used a near party line 240 186 vote to condemn the Trump administration for joining a federal lawsuit aimed at annulling former President Barack Obama s health care law  Minutes later  the House Democrats  campaign organization launched digital ads in the districts of around 40 Democrats in competitive seats  saying they d  fought back  against GOP efforts to gut the statute s protections The GOP s bitter internal fight over health care in 2017 remains a sore subject for the president  He often retells the story of the late Arizona Sen  John McCain s  no  vote that killed the repeal and replace effort  Republicans  hit hard on health care issues during the 2018 midterm election  had no plans to take up the issue again before the next one Trump s fight was on display when he told Republican senators last week that his White House was developing a plan to replace the Obama health law  The sudden move stunned GOP leaders on Capitol Hill  While Trump wanted them to become  the party of health care   they feared it could be for all the wrong reasons if they were forced into a do over of the tough votes McConnell on Tuesday issued a rare public disclosure of his private counsel to the president  warning that another health care fight would be politically costly and doomed to fail now that Democrats control the House  The usually tight lipped leader said afterward that the president agreed to shelve his health care push until after the campaign  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters Tuesday Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week   backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  mindful that Republican unfulfilled promises to  repeal and replace  the Obama era law stand as a glaring failure of his administration  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   Trump said Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  After Trump said last week he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  McConnell faced a revolt from the ranks McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking    Associated Press writers Zeke Miller  Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram  Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar  Darlene Superville and Kevin Freking contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON NEW YORK   U S  President Donald Trump on Monday injected himself into one of the most consequential cases of the current Supreme Court term  saying the nation s 2020 census would be  meaningless  without adding a citizenship question to the questionnaire The comment on Twitter came ahead of an expected Supreme Court ruling by the end of June on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  decision to add the citizenship question violated federal law  Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question   Trump tweeted   Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together  Trump s critics have accused the White House of encouraging an undercount by dissuading Hispanics and other immigrants from participating in the census  disproportionately affecting Democratic leaning states and municipalities Many states  cities and civil rights groups have gone to court over the citizenship question  which is among a series of White House policies signaling tighter control over immigration These include Trump s declaration in February of a national emergency to obtain funds for a wall on the U S  Mexico border  and his threat to close the border as soon as this week  disrupting legal crossings as well as trade The U S  Constitution requires a census counting the number of residents every 10 years Results are used to draw political boundaries  allocate seats in Congress and at the state and local level  and distribute roughly  800 billion of federal funds  The census is the administration s new front on its war on immigration and  sadly  the president s tweet today bears out that concern   said Terri Ann Lowenthal  a former staff director on the House census oversight committee who now advises groups seeking an accurate 2020 count  VERITABLE SMORGASBORD When Ross announced the addition of a citizenship question in March 2018  he said it was in response to a Department of Justice request for data to help enforce the Voting Rights Act  which protects eligible voters from discrimination Only U S  citizens can vote in federal elections  Non citizens comprise about 7 percent of the 328 7 million people living in the United States  Census questionnaires have not included a citizenship question since 1950 The Supreme Court is reviewing a Jan  15 ruling by U S  District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan that Ross broke a  veritable smorgasbord  of federal rules by adding the question  a decision he called  arbitrary and capricious  Furman also said the Voting Rights Act was as a  pretextual  rationale for adding the question  a decision that Ross had  already made for other reasons  The judge said the change would cause many states to lose federal funding  while Arizona  California  Florida  Illinois  New York and Texas would lose congressional seats Furman  an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama  stopped short of a finding that Ross intended to discriminate against immigrants Oral arguments at the Supreme Court are scheduled for April 23 Steven Dillingham  who became director of the U S  Census Bureau in January  declined to discuss Trump s tweet but said the bureau was focused on obtaining a full  complete count He spoke to reporters at a press briefing on Monday  one year before National Census Day marking the 2020 count  LONG PEDIGREE Furman s decision came in a lawsuit brought by 18 U S  states  15 cities and a variety of civil rights groups In urging the Supreme Court to overturn Furman s ruling  Solicitor General Noel Francisco  representing the Justice Department  said Ross had discretion to add the citizenship question  and that there was a  long pedigree  in the census for asking about citizenship or country of birth He also said other democracies including Australia  Canada  France  Germany  Indonesia  Ireland  Mexico  Spain and the United Kingdom ask about citizenship on their censuses Another federal judge  Richard Seeborg in San Francisco  on March 6 also declared the citizenship question illegal Following that ruling  the Supreme Court said it will also decide whether Ross  actions violated the Constitution s Enumeration Clause  which sets out terms for counting people Adding the citizenship question could lead to an undercount of 4 2 million Hispanics alone  the Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media  Politics and Public Policy estimated last month   Reporting by Susan Heavey and Lauren Tara LaCapra in Washington  and Nick Brown and Jonathan Stempel in New York  Editing by Susan Thomas and Bill Trott  

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee approved subpoenas Wednesday for special counsel Robert Mueller s full Russia report as Democrats pressure the Justice Department to release the document without redactions The committee voted 24 17 to give Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler  D N Y   permission to issue subpoenas to the Justice Department for the final report  its exhibits and any underlying evidence or materials prepared for Mueller s investigation  Nadler has not yet said if he ll send the subpoenas  which would be the first step in a potentially long fight with the Justice Department over the materials The Judiciary panel also voted Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trump s former top advisers  stepping up a separate  wide ranging investigation into Trump and his personal and political dealings On the Mueller report  House Democrats had given Attorney General William Barr until Tuesday to provide an unredacted verson to Congress  along with underlying materials  The Justice Department ignored that deadline  with Barr telling committee chairmen in a letter last week that he was in the process of redacting portions of the almost 400 page report and it would be released by mid April   if not sooner  The vote further escalates the Democrats  battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see  a fight that could eventually head to court if the two sides can t settle their differences through negotiation  Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr In the letter last week  Barr said he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material  in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that  would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties  Democrats say they want access to all of that information  even if some of it can t be disclosed to the public  Nadler said he will give Barr time to change his mind on redactions  but if they cannot reach an agreement they will issue the subpoenas  in very short order   He also said he is prepared to go to court to get the grand jury information  This committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job  not the attorney general s  to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his office   Nadler said The five former Trump advisers who could receive subpoenas are strategist Steve Bannon  communications director Hope Hicks  chief of staff Reince Priebus  White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson  Donaldson served as McGahn s chief of staff before both left the administration The five were key witnesses in Mueller s probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month  along with dozens of other people connected to Trump  Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Mueller s investigation  were sent outside the White House   meaning the committee should have access to them because they may not be covered by executive privilege The top Republican on the Judiciary panel  Georgia Rep  Doug Collins  said at the vote that the five subpoenas are misguided because two of the individuals have already provided 3 000 documents to the committee and that the other three have indicated a willingness to cooperate Collins said the authorization for all of the subpoenas is  reckless  and that Democrats shouldn t be asking for documents that the Justice Department can t legally disclose to the public  The committee rejected a GOP amendment that would have blocked the subpoenas from applying to grand jury information  We have a pre emptive chairman who has gone out with pre emptive subpoenas today on a report that has already been promised him   Collins said   This is nothing but political theater  Trump himself has largely deferred to Barr on the report s release while also saying he wouldn t mind if the full version was made public  Still  he has criticized Democrats for seeking the unredacted information  He tweeted Tuesday that  there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy  Nadler or House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff  who has also called for the full release Mueller notified Barr that he had completed the investigation March 22 and sent him the report  In a four page summary of that report released two days later  Barr wrote that the special counsel did not find that Trump s campaign  conspired or coordinated  with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election  He also said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation  instead setting out  evidence on both sides  of the question Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter

want to see what Mueller wrote  

MADISON  Wis    Conservative Brian Hagedorn s strong showing in Wisconsin s Supreme Court race cheered state Republicans Wednesday  with their first positive result in a statewide election since 2016 suggesting reasons for optimism next year in a critical presidential battleground Hagedorn led liberal backed Lisa Neubauer by 5 962 votes   less than half a percentage point   in a race that could still go to a recount  But it came after a string of losses by Republicans in special and statewide elections since Donald Trump carried the state While Republicans were excited  they were also cautious about what Hagedorn s showing means for President Donald Trump s re election  Nobody should assume because Republicans won this race that they will continue to win everything else   Republican strategist and former state GOP leader Brandon Scholz said   This is one election where all the pieces came together at the end  2020 is an entirely different  politically charged animal with the presidential race  Republican U S  Sen  Ron Johnson  who has been leading GOP efforts to rebound following the 2018 election  credited Hagedorn s showing with a ground up engagement with conservatives who were angry with attacks in the race and national Democratic priorities  This is the recipe for success   he said   That s what I ve been preaching since the day after the November 2018 election  We have to energize  rely on the grassroots  Hagedorn benefited from a late infusion of  1 2 million from the Republican State Leadership Committee  Conservative talk radio  including former Republican Gov  Scott Walker for three hours the day before the election  also worked to drive up turnout Republicans compared attacks on Hagedorn to those on U S  Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh  National political fights over the release of Robert Mueller s investigation into Trump and ongoing court battles over a lame duck legislative session in Wisconsin also fueled interest in the race  GOP strategists said Hagedorn said attacks against him over long ago blog writings  including calling Planned Parenthood a  wicked organization  and denouncing court rulings that favored gay rights  motivated his supporters Democrats took the result as a sign that despite a string of wins  including ousting Walker in November  nothing can be taken for granted  Not that Democrats needed it  but it s another wakeup call that every single election here is going to be highly competitive   said Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki   This is not a red state  This is not a blue state  This is the deepest shade of purple there is on the spectrum  Neubauer didn t immediately say whether she would request a recount  which would face a tough challenge in overturning such a large margin and which would come at her expense  She immediately appealed to supporters for money in case she pursues the recount  Counties have until April 12 to report final vote totals  and Neubauer has three days after that to request a recount The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been the deciding force in several partisan battles over policy in recent years  and is itself clearly partisan   conservatives hold a 4 3 edge  Democrats had hoped Neubauer would capture a seat currently held by a liberal justice  maintaining that spread but positioning them to win the majority in another election next year Unless Hagedorn s apparent victory is undone by recount  conservatives instead will enjoy a 5 2 majority and won t be at risk of losing it until at least 2023  The high court already looks likely to decide early disputes between new Democratic Gov  Tony Evers and majority Republicans in the Legislature Turnout was nearly 27   well above the 22  of last year s state Supreme Court race  Hagedorn overcame Neubauer s huge margins in the liberal strongholds of Madison and Milwaukee by running up the vote in Green Bay and more rural parts of northeastern and north central Wisconsin  Those are both parts of the state that helped fuel Trump s win in 2016 Wisconsin recounted its presidential vote in 2016 at Green Party candidate Jill Stein s expense  In that recount of nearly 3 million ballots  only 131 votes were changed   in favor of Trump  Neubauer  in a recount of just 1 2 million ballots  would have to pick up 45 times as many votes The 2016 presidential recount cost local election clerks  2 million   more than the  1 7 million Neubauer raised during the entire campaign through March 18  However  those costs included overtime for clerks who had to count nearly 2 9 million votes under a tight deadline due to the Electoral College Given the recent tight elections  Republicans are taking nothing for granted going into 2020  Johnson said  We have to run almost perfect elections going forward   he said  If  Democrats  are energized  we re going to have issues  Nobody will be overconfident  We know what s at stake        Associated Press writer Ivan Moreno contributed to this report from Pewaukee  Wisconsin  

WASHINGTON   The National Rifle Association  the nation s largest gun lobby  has settled on its next target on Capitol Hill  blocking Congress from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act  a 1994 law that assists victims of domestic and sexual violence The House is set to vote on the legislation this week  the law expired in February  But the bill includes a new provision   aimed at curbing sexual violence by expanding law enforcement s ability to strip domestic abusers of their guns   that the N R A  does not like  The measure closes the so called boyfriend loophole by barring those convicted of abusing  assaulting or stalking a dating partner or those subject to a court restraining order from buying or owning firearms Under current federal law  those convicted of domestic abuse can lose their guns if they are   or were formerly   married to their victim  live with their victim  have a child with their victim or are a parent or guardian of their victim  The proposed provision would extend those who can be convicted of domestic abuse to include stalkers and current or former boyfriends or dating partners Jennifer Baker  a spokeswoman for the N R A   said that for  many of those  offenses    and I m using air quotes here   the behavior that would qualify as a stalking offense is often not violent or threatening  it involves no personal contact whatsoever   She argues that the new provision is  too broad and ripe for abuse   Like if you were sending harassing messages to somebody on Facebook  to somebody you never met or somebody you dated five years ago   she said  adding   How it s written right now  you could be convicted for a misdemeanor stalking offense for a tweet that causes someone emotional distress and then you would be prohibited from owning a firearm  Others find the N R A  s argument far fetched   A single tweet or Facebook message  without significant other conduct  would ordinarily not be enough  to result in a conviction for stalking  said David Keck  director of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms  which provides guidance to law enforcement and governments on implementing firearms prohibitions  but takes no position on the new domestic violence act provision And times have changed for the gun lobby  A wave of freshman Democrats in Congress were elected on a promise to enact new gun restrictions  and they proudly campaigned against the N R A  The No  1 way that women are being killed with guns is by their beloveds  their boyfriends  their significant others   said one of those freshman Democrats  Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia   I am not paying attention to the rhetoric of the N R A  because I can t be distracted  What s most important is putting forth good legislation to save as many lives as we can   Ms  McBath s son  Jordan Davis  was shot to death in 2012 Roughly half of all female homicide victims are killed by what experts call  intimate partners    meaning current or former spouses or dating partners   according to a 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  And about half of intimate partner homicides involved dating relationships  according to Mr  Keck The  boyfriend loophole  provision is  a refocus on should we be just looking at domestic partners or should we be looking more broadly at intimate partners   he said Studies also show that domestic abusers with guns inflict a disproportionate amount of violence on their partners  and that the victims are overwhelmingly female  Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a firearm  according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence  a gun safety group  Roughly three quarters of all intimate partner murder victims were also victims of stalking by their partners  according to the National Center for Victims of Crime  The share of homicides committed by dating partners has been increasing for three decades   said Shannon Watts  who founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  a group that supports tighter gun laws  in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012   Women are now as likely to be killed by dating partners as by spouses with guns  The reauthorization bill has one Republican co sponsor  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania  Representative Kevin McCarthy  the House Republican leader  is urging Congress to extend the expired law for the rest of the year to continue funding services to survivors at current levels  Ms  Baker  of the N R A   accused Democrats of  playing politics  with the bill by inserting the so called boyfriend provision as a  poison pill  so that Democrats can portray Republicans who vote against it as anti woman The N R A  has decided to  score  the vote on the Violence Against Women Act  meaning it will keep track and publish how lawmakers vote in an effort to either reward or defeat them in the next election  While the move is not likely to keep the bill from passing the House  it does make it more likely that the  boyfriend loophole  provision will be stripped from the act when the measure arrives in the Senate  Anybody who votes for this should take the outrage of the N R A  and wear it proudly   said Representative Debbie Dingell  Democrat of Michigan  who drafted the provision as a separate bill and fought for it to be included in the Violence Against Women Act Ms  Dingell   whose husband  John D  Dingell Jr   who died this year  served on the N R A  s board of directors   has spoken powerfully of her experiences as a child  cowering in the closet in fear of her father  who struggled with mental illness and had a gun  I am not someone who wants to take people s guns away   she said   I have lived with a man that was an N R A  board member and with a man that shouldn t have had a gun  And I want to stand up for both sides  The move to oppose the act comes as the N R A  s power is increasingly being challenged on Capitol Hill and in statehouses around the country by gun control activists  including many students who have taken up the charge after the massacre last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Fla Twenty six states and the District of Columbia passed 67 new gun safety laws in 2018  according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence  On Capitol Hill  the House in February passed legislation expanding background checks to cover nearly all gun purchases   the first significant gun safety measure in 25 years Even in the Republican controlled Senate  Senator Lindsey Graham  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  convened a hearing last week on  red flag laws  or extreme risk protection orders that allow family members and law enforcement officers to obtain court restraining orders to remove firearms from people who have been identified as a risk to themselves or others So far  14 states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing extreme risk protection orders  Mr  Graham said he is working on legislation to create incentives for states to enact such bills  Ms  Baker said the N R A  agrees with the idea in theory but has not supported any of the state laws because of  serious due process concerns  The idea has gained traction in some unlikely places   including the White House  where President Trump embraced it when Vice President Mike Pence raised it during a meeting with lawmakers after the school massacre in Parkland  Or Mike  take the firearms first and then go to court   Mr  Trump told Mr  Pence  adding   because a lot of times  by the time you go to court  it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures  I like taking the guns early

damage in Freeport  Ill CreditScott P  Yates Rockford Register Star  via Associated PressThe news that Anna Sorokin  the New York  party girl grifter  whose story has fascinated society and Hollywood and who is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court  has been advised by a stylist on what to wear for her courtroom appearances should not really come as a surprise to anyone  Increasingly  it seems  there is a tendency to rely on experts to help navigate the thorny issues of what to wear when  and not just for highly fraught events Consider  for example  the recent reports that J B  Pritzker  the governor of Illinois  has daily notations on his official schedule related to dress  Or rather  how to dress for different occasions  This has gotten less attention than Ms  Sorokin s news has  he is  to be fair  a somewhat less sensationalist figure   but in many ways it is a similarly revealing sign of the times According to John O Connor of The Associated Press  who used the Freedom of Information Act to get access to the governor s schedule during the first six weeks of his term  there were more than 70 written recommendations regarding what the governor should wear to various planned events  The advice included when to bring multiple tie choices  for his official photo  he went with marine blue with white polka dots   when to forget the tie altogether  as well as what occasions were best for the  polo with Columbia jacket  At first  like Mr  O Connor  I thought this was unusual  Governor Pritzker  after all  has been a businessman and philanthropist  and presumably knows how to dress for the office  So I called Jordan Abudayyeh  Mr  Pritzker s press secretary  to ask why it was necessary  She said the notations were  standard operating procedure  meant to make his life simpler and make sure he always looked appropriate  She did not have much else to add Which is too bad  because Mr  Pritzker and his team are indeed far from alone in this particular strategy  though they may be taking it to a slightly more extreme level than most According to Ryan Williams  a Republican strategist and former aide to Mitt Romney during Mr  Romney s time as governor of Massachusetts and his two presidential campaigns  it was  not unusual  to jot down on the governor s schedule whether the dress code for an event was  business  casual or black tie   During the campaigns  this could be even more detailed  depending on the event   A country barbecue  for example  might require more thought   Donna Brazile  the onetime interim head of the Democratic National Committee and a recently signed Fox News contributor  said that in her experience such advice came from communications and advance teams and was  part of the message of the day   Also  that it had become increasingly important and  perhaps  detailed ImageGovernor Pritzker unveils his graduated income tax plan at the Illinois State Capitol CreditJustin L  Fowler The State Journal Register  via Associated Press Once upon a time  you had three dress codes  business  casual and formal   she wrote in an email  noting that today candidates can dress to  signal everything from leadership style to their political branding  and hence need a certain amount of premeditation Bennet Ratcliff  a former political consultant who worked with the Democratic Governors Association  pointed out that social media has exacerbated the situation  A politician is now dressing not just for the people in the room but also the people scrolling past a picture of said politician with the people in the room   and may be stopping to look or think In that context  you can go one of two ways  adopt an effective uniform that communicates an attitude of formality in representing the job  see  for example  President Trump  who rarely appears in public without a jacket  and seems happiest in his oversize suits and below the belt red ties   or dress to fit in with the group you are with  In which case maybe you need a bit of help determining what that means There is nothing wrong with this  or with thinking about this  it doesn t reveal a superficiality or lack of substance  which is often the default fear when the topic of clothing comes up  On the contrary  it acknowledges the truth that we all make snap judgments based first on appearance  and then make a choice about how much time and brain space need to be devoted to influencing those judgments  and how much can be delegated This should be something everyone can relate to  given the current craziness around dress codes in general  be it the complete nonsense of events that request  creative dress  or  dress to impress  or the difficulty of corporate strictures on dressing  appropriately  in an office setting  a word so vague that it is practically meaningless   Yes  Goldman Sachs  this means you   To a certain extent  we are always in search of dress recommendations and instruction  as the social and professional codes of yesteryear have eroded under the increasing commingling of life and work  putting an end to unspoken uniforms  That s why stylists and personal shoppers have become such a booming business  increasingly famous in their own right  In many ways  politics has been the most insulated of all professions  but clearly  even that is changing  And really  if there is such a thing as a courtroom stylist  can a political stylist be far behind  This is essentially the role Meredith Koop played for Michelle Obama  though officially her job was general aide  and how Hervé Pierre functions for Melania Trump  Mr  O Connor of The Associated Press said that after he discovered the dress notations on Mr  Pritzker s schedule  he asked to speak with the governor about the subject but to no avail  his email request received no response  which was  he said  a rarity in his experience   Frankly  I think Governor Pritzker missed a great opportunity  He would have done everyone a favor if  once the topic was on the table  he had embraced it  Imagine how liberating it would be if a politician  especially a male one  was secure enough to give an interview about the importance of dressing the part  and how useful it was to have someone thinking about that so he could use his time crafting policy  be it for flood management or health care Especially because the question of public figures and what they wear and who helps decide that is bound to become more fraught during the coming Democratic primary  as the pressure to distinguish oneself will put more onus on crafting an identifiable image that stands apart while simultaneously standing for something  Arguably Beto O Rourke has already proven himself to be working this angle  at least judging by his Vanity Fair cover and his skill at casting himself as the people s pol Though given that he hired a campaign manager only last week  chances are he is still styling himself  

LONDON   Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday broke with her own party  appealing to the opposition to work with her on a plan in a move that could keep Britain closely tied to the European Union after the country leaves the bloc Mrs  May made the announcement after her cabinet had met for seven hours  amid a growing sense of crisis  With only 10 days left until Britain is due to leave the European Union  she also said she would ask leaders of the bloc for an extension Parliament is deadlocked on the issue  and lawmakers are increasingly alarmed by the prospect of careering out of the bloc without an agreement Her overture to the Labour Party could mark a turning point in Brexit  as Britain s exit from the European Union is known  ending months of stalemate between Mrs  May and Conservative hard liners  who have adamantly refused to support the deal she negotiated with the European Union  This basically rips up the last two and a half years as far as her stance goes   said Tim Bale  professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London  It seems the calculation has changed  and finally the country s interests have been put above those of the Conservative Party   he added Mrs  May s deal with Europe has two parts  a withdrawal agreement  which details the practical terms of the divorce  and a political declaration  which outlines Britain s future relationship with the bloc The prime minister said the withdrawal agreement must stand  even though Parliament has rejected it three times already  European leaders have insisted upon this Under the withdrawal agreement  Britain would remain in the European Union customs and trading system until at least the end of 2020 Negotiations with the Labour Party will center on changes to the political declaration  However  these would be nonbinding and could be dismantled by a future British government Mrs  May s plan had envisioned eventually severing ties with the bloc s customs and trading system  and taking control over immigration from continental Europe Until now  she has refused to consider softening any of these so called red lines The only option Mrs  May will not negotiate with the opposition is canceling Brexit altogether  Closer economic ties with the bloc through a customs union or membership in its single market are up for discussion and even a referendum confirming any deal has not been excluded  Mrs  May s aides said Within an hour of Mrs  May s announcement  pro Brexit Conservatives began to express their dissent  amid reports that a number of cabinet ministers had argued against a further extension Whether the prime minister can win the cooperation of the Labour Party   and whether the European Union will grant her request for another delay   remained unclear  I m very happy to meet the prime minister   said Jeremy Corbyn  the Labour leader  after Mrs  May s announcement  We recognize that she has made a move   he added   I recognize my responsibility to represent the people who supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn t support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future  And that s the basis on which we will meet her and have those discussions  Still  to move forward with this plan  he will have to become involved in the tumultuous negotiation  and share responsibility for the success or failure of Brexit  Some Conservatives expressed dismay that the Labour Party would now be more involved  It is very disappointing that the cabinet has decided to entrust the final handling of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party   said Boris Johnson  who resigned from Mrs  May s cabinet and is considered a front runner to replace her  in an interview with the BBC  I think the result will almost certainly be  if Corbyn gets his way  that we remain in the customs union so that we can t control our trade policy  that there are huge areas of lawmaking we can t control  and Brexit is becoming soft to the point of disintegration   he said It has never been clear whether Mrs  May was willing to lead the country into a no deal exit  a threat she raised repeatedly in tough talking speeches at the start of negotiations A powerful faction in the Conservative Party  to which she has devoted most of her adult life  has shifted to a hard line position  shrugging off warnings of severe economic consequences with a no deal exit  and advocating what they called  a clean break  It was unclear whether Mrs  May had shifted as well  Her remarks on Tuesday  however  suggested that she had not  When it came down to it  she was just too sensible   said Rosa Prince  the author of a biography of Mrs  May   She s got to be thinking of her legacy now  and if people are dying for lack of medicine  if there are food shortages  if Britain goes feral  that s not how she wants to be remembered  Speaking at 10 Downing Street  Mrs  May said it was clear Britain would need an extension to Brexit  but  one that is as short as possible  Mrs  May s immediate plan is to try to reach an agreement with Mr  Corbyn and get Parliament s support for it before next week s European Union summit in Brussels on April 10 Alternatively  she said  Parliament would vote on an array of alternatives  with the government promising to accept the outcome Mrs  May hopes Britain might still be able to leave the bloc next month and avoid holding elections to the European Parliament  Failing that  she would ask for an extension that could be curtailed as soon as Britain had ratified its withdrawal agreement After Tuesday s extraordinary cabinet meeting  ministers were held in Downing Street without access to cellphones until Mrs  May had spoken  a sign she wanted to get her version out before her fractious cabinet started leaking  Chilean wine was served as they waited Upon emerging  cabinet members told journalists that they had discussed the option of calling a general election  but that polling suggested that the Conservative Party might fare poorly if a new election was called now Mrs  May s willingness to adjust her position on Brexit came  too late   said Ayesha Hazarika  a political commentator and former Labour adviser   This should have been done right at the beginning  She added   It shows how catastrophically badly she has handled the chronology of the process  By this stage  Ms  Hazarika said   the politics are too raw on both sides   and Mr  Corbyn will be under intense pressure to call for a second referendum Mr  Corbyn himself is a longtime euroskeptic  but many of his party members are pushing strongly for a second referendum or for canceling Brexit altogether  Labour is also intent on holding a general election in the near future Mr  Corbyn  who has safely criticized the government from the margins  risks being held responsible for an unpopular result if he cooperates with Mrs  May  Ms  Hazarika said  Their strategy has been to have a clean hands Brexit  the Tories will mess it all up   she said   If she s co opting him to be a co pilot  does he want to take that responsibility   He s got a big strategic question to ask   she added She said the next days were likely to bring all kinds of bizarre twists  like collaboration between Mr  Corbyn and Conservative backbenchers in an effort to bring Mrs  May down in a no confidence vote  Anything is possible right now   she said   There are so many wheels within wheels right now  I have never seen anything like it   

WASHINGTON   U S  congressional Democrats on Wednesday authorized a powerful committee chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report on Russia s role in the 2016 election  moving closer to a legal clash with President Donald Trump s administration The Democratic led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to enable its chairman  Jerrold Nadler  to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller s unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides including political strategist Steve Bannon Nadler has not yet exercised that authority  with the timing of any such move uncertain  The committee vote was 24 17 along party lines  with Democrats in favor and Trump s fellow Republicans opposed Attorney General William Barr  a Trump appointee  issued a four page summary of Mueller s main conclusions last month including that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400 page report by mid April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence gathering sources and methods In addition to Bannon  the committee authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn  former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson They are among 81 people  agencies and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates Nadler s panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would ignore a Democratic demand turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline  Democrats have expressed concern Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign Nadler said he would work with Barr  for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials  and will go to court to get permission to obtain the grand jury material  But if that doesn t work out in a very short order  we will issue the subpoenas   Nadler added       The committee must see everything   The potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government s third branch   the judiciary Representative Doug Collins  the committee s top Republican  said Democrats are  desperate for dirt on this president   This is reckless  It s irresponsible  And it s disingenuous   Collins said   It s also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing  making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy  It was not clear how likely the Justice Department would be to hand over subpoenaed documents  It could ignore a subpoena  running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress  and prepare for a potentially lengthy court battle INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACTIONIn another development  the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic led House Intelligence Committee  led by Trump critic Adam Schiff  is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump s inaugural committee Citing people familiar with the request  the Journal reported that the effort signaled that Congress is expanding its probe of how the inaugural committee raised and spent more than  100 million  The report could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters Barr s March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller s  principal conclusions  said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice  Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller s inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump  Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice  Moscow denied election interference  Mueller and U S  intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U S  Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report  If the department still refuses  then it should be up to a judge   not the president or his political appointee   to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record   Nadler said  Trump ally Lindsey Graham  Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  wrote on Twitter that the House panel s demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was  dangerous and ridiculous  The Justice Department declined comment  Priebus declined to comment  A lawyer for Priebus  Bannon and McGahn  as well as a Bannon spokeswoman  did not immediately respond to requests for comment Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries  Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge s permission to get access to Mueller s grand jury material  which is protected under federal law  Nadler said Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far  Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well  noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report s release to Congress   Reporting by David Morgan  Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld  Sarah N  Lynch  Steve Holland and Mark Hosenball  Editing by

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform voted Tuesday to issue a subpoena to the former head of the personnel security division at the White House after a whistle blower accused him of putting national security in jeopardy by mismanaging security clearances The whistle blower  Tricia Newbold  a manager in the White House s Personnel Security Office  told the committee in a private interview last month that senior Trump administration officials granted security clearances to at least 25 individuals whose applications had been denied by career employees for  disqualifying issues   including drug use and criminal conduct  the committee s Democratic staff said in a memo released on Monday Ms  Newbold said the top personnel security official  Carl Kline  reversed a decision to deny a clearance for a senior White House official after a background check turned up multiple concerns  including possible foreign influence  She also said Mr  Kline granted a security clearance to a second White House official despite concerns voiced by a specialist When Ms  Newbold repeatedly pointed out his actions  she said he discriminated against her over her short stature  which is caused by a form of dwarfism  She filed a complaint against him with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission A White House spokesman declined to comment on the subpoena  In a statement  Mr  Kline s lawyer  Robert Driscoll  said the  facts will prove that he acted appropriately at all times   Mr  Driscoll said he received the subpoena from Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the committee  on Tuesday evening The committee also voted on Tuesday to authorize subpoenas related to the Trump administration s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire  an issue that is being taken up by the United States Supreme Court These committee votes authorized some of the first subpoenas for members of the Trump administration after Democrats  who promised to be a check on the White House  gained the House majority in the midterm elections Mr  Cummings said during Tuesday s meeting that despite claims the committee was just trying to  embarrass  the president with its newfound subpoena power  the move to compel testimony from Mr  Kline was meant to protect national security  The vote  22 to 15  was along party lines NBC News reported in January that Mr  Kline  who was Ms  Newbold s boss  had overruled a decision by career security officials concerned about granting a clearance to Jared Kushner  President Trump s son in law and senior adviser Ms  Newbold  a 39 year old employee who has worked in the White House for 18 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations  said she decided to go to the committee after attempts to raise concerns with her superiors and the White House counsel went nowhere  according to the Democratic staff s account  She s begging us to do something   Mr  Cummings said during the meeting   Because she simply wants her government to work the way it s supposed to work  Republicans on the committee argued against the subpoena because Mr  Kline s lawyer indicated that Mr  Kline was willing to appear before the panel voluntarily  In their own memo summarizing Ms  Newbold s comments to the committee  they presented her concerns as overblown and depicted her as a disgruntled federal employee  We re going to subpoena a guy who just sent us a letter saying he s willing to come here voluntarily   said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio  the committee s top Republican   I ve been on this committee 10 years  I ve never seen anything like this  But Mr  Cummings said that Mr  Kline  who now works at the Department of Defense  refused to answer questions from the committee about specific federal officials and clearance decisions during a voluntary appearance  Mr  Cummings said that the White House refused two committee requests to interview Mr  Kline and that Mr  Kline did not respond to two separate requests sent directly to him since January In a letter to Mr  Cummings  dated Tuesday  Mr  Driscoll wrote that his client was willing to appear but that the White House Counsel s Office deemed some of the proposed topics as an infringement upon President Trump s rights as the chief executive  Mr  Driscoll called a subpoena an  extreme and unnecessary step  Mr  Cummings said he planned to seek testimony from other senior White House officials as well Most of the Republican members of the committee also opposed the majority s proposal to subpoena testimony from a top Justice Department official  John Gore  about adding a citizenship question to the census The committee voted mostly along party lines to authorize a subpoena for testimony from Mr  Gore  as well as for documents from the Justice Department and the Commerce Department  some of which were either denied to the committee or heavily redacted One Republican member  Representative Justin Amash of Michigan  joined the Democrats in the vote The White House did not provide official comment on the census related subpoenas  Mr  Jordan accused Democratic members of the committee of trying to interfere in the court proceedings over the citizenship question In January  a federal trial judge blocked the Commerce Department from adding the question  saying the process

WASHINGTON   Senate Democrats blocked a GOP attempt on Tuesday to change Senate rules to limit debate time on most of President Donald Trump s nominees to just a couple of hours The party line vote is another step toward a potential power play by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who is considering ramming the rules change through later this week using an arcane parliamentary maneuver The proposed rules change would limit debate on most nominees to two hours instead of the 30 hours now required  Cabinet secretaries  Supreme Court nominations  and appeals court judges would be exempted from the new rules Tuesday s approach required 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster  but McConnell s upcoming maneuver would only require a simple majority McConnell said Tuesday he s taking action in response to  systematic obstruction  not targeted  thoughtful opposition to a few marquee nominations or rare circumstances  but a grinding  across the board effort to delay and obstruct the people this president puts up  Democrats said Republicans abused the old rules   which required a 60 vote margin to break a filibuster for all nominees   to thwart dozens of nominees of former President Barack Obama  Democrats changed the filibuster threshold to a simple majority in 2013 over outraged protests by Republicans such as McConnell Shortening the debate time  they maintain  would allow Republicans to run roughshod over them  The hurdles and hoops required to win confirmation should be difficult  they say  as a means to ensure nominees are ethical and qualified and responsive to requests by senators for information  The purpose of these rules is to reject partisanship so that we can get nominees who will put the good of the country before politics   said Sen  Amy Klobuchar  D Minn   If we eliminate this crucial check on our democracy  allowing the majority to ram through these appointments  we will undermine our democracy and our government  Republicans counter that it is Democrats who are abusing the process now by claiming the full 30 hours of debate time for noncontroversial picks  Often  the Senate chamber sits empty as the clock ticks on these picks  And Obama benefited from abbreviated debate times for most nominations under a temporary arrangement over 2013 14 that suited Democrats just fine back then  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is suggesting he will defer until after 2020 his push for a Republican health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act Trump tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections   when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House  Republicans were cool after Trump surprised them last week with an unexpected pivot to the issue and his claims the GOP will be the party of health care  They don t yet have a comprehensive plan to replace the law  known as  Obamacare  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017  And while Republicans gained Senate seats last fall  there s no indication that GOP senators want another fight over repealing  Obamacare   particularly not those up for re election next year Health care  especially protections for people with pre existing conditions  resonates with voters and helped Democrats in the November elections According to AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide  nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care as the most important among a list of key issues  A Quinnipiac University poll last week found 55  of Americans supporting the improvement and not the replacement of the nation s health care system With Democrats controlling the House  any attempt to dismantle the law could not pass Congress Still  Trump last week appeared to commit his party to a new push for a plan to replace the health law  We are working very hard on that   Trump said as he was heading out to a Michigan rally He said Republicans  are going to work together to come up with something that s really spectacular  In his late Monday tweets  Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that  will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America  Challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts Last week  the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down  an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured and reignite a winning political issue for Democrats  

Former Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Wednesday that his tendency toward physical displays of affection and encouragement has made some women uncomfortable  and he promised to be  much more mindful  of respecting personal space  Social norms have begun to change  They ve shifted   the 76 year old Biden said in a cellphone video posted to Twitter    And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset  And I get it  I get it  I hear what they are saying  I understand  Wearing a suit and open collared shirt  Biden also teased an announcement of his political plans  promising to  be talking to you about a whole lot of issues   Shortly after the video was released  a union announced Biden would speak at their conference in Washington on Friday The video was Biden s first direct comment on what has tripped up his preparations to enter the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign  He did not directly apologize but seemed to be seeking to ease some people s discomfort  which has raised questions about whether he could wage an effective campaign On Friday  former Nevada politician Lucy Flores wrote in New York Magazine that Biden approached her from behind  touched her shoulders and kissed the back of her head in 2014 Since then  another woman has said Biden grabbed her face when he was thanking congressional staff at a 2009 event Biden  a former longtime U S  senator from Delaware  first said in a statement that he did not recall the episode that Flores initially described in the magazine piece and then in subsequent weekend interviews In the video Wednesday  Biden insisted that what he described as the compassion from where the affection comes will not change and again nodded to the steps he s taking toward running  But I ll always believe governing   life  for that matter   is about connecting  connecting with people   he said   That won t change  Biden also said that he would be more careful about his actions in the future  And I ll be much more mindful  That s my responsibility  my responsibility  and I ll meet it   Biden said And in so doing  Biden was tacitly acknowledging a nagging concern for some voters  that he cannot adapt  The idea that I can t adjust to the fact that personal space is important  more important than it s ever been  is just not thinkable   he said in closing   I will  I will   

WASHINGTON   Two civil liberties groups on Tuesday sued three U S  intelligence chiefs and the acting defense secretary  seeking to have declared unconstitutional their agencies  pre publication reviews of former officials  writings and speeches The American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  and Columbia University s Knight First Amendment Institute brought the lawsuit on behalf of five former intelligence and military officials  They argued the reviews as currently practiced breach the Constitution s First Amendment prohibition on government abridgement of freedom of speech The plaintiffs contended that reviews also violate the Constitution s Fifth Amendment  because the procedures can involve arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and fail to define what can or cannot be said The action was brought in U S  District Court in Greenbelt  Maryland  against Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats  CIA Director Gina Haspel  National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan Pentagon  NSA and CIA spokesmen said they do not comment on pending litigation  Coats  office declined to comment  This is a challenge to a far reaching system of prior restraints that suppresses a broad swath of constitutionally protected speech  including core political speech  by former government employees   said the lawsuit  Under this system  government officials review and censor tens of thousands of submissions every year   it said  Current and former U S  intelligence and military officials are required to submit writings or speeches to pre publication reviews to insure they are not disclosing classified information  The plaintiffs said that review standards differ between agencies and former officials are subjected to the procedures  without regard to their level of access to sensitive information  Reviews frequently take weeks or months and result in censorship decisions that  are often arbitrary  unexplained and influenced by authors  viewpoints   said the lawsuit  adding that  favored officials  can receive  special treatment  that  fast tracks  their speeches or manuscripts As a result of this  dysfunction   many would be authors self censor  denying the public access to information that would inform debate on national security issues  it said The former officials on whose behalf the lawsuit was filed included Richard Immerman  a historian who worked for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  ODNI   Timothy Edgar  a cyber security expect who also worked at ODNI  and Mark Fallon  a former Naval Criminal Investigative Service official who served as the chief investigator at the Guantanamo Bay detention center They also included former senior CIA analyst Melvin Goodman and Anuradha Bhagwati  a Marine Corps veteran    Reporting by Jonathan Landay  editing by Steve Orlofsky  Susan Thomas and Jonathan Oatis  

NEW YORK   Two Republican state attorneys general on Monday urged a federal appeals court to uphold the Obamacare federal healthcare law  saying that striking it down would be disruptive for patients  doctors  insurers and employers The attorneys general of Ohio and Montana submitted  friend of the court  briefs to the 5th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals which is expected to review a December ruling by U S  District Judge Reed O Connor in Fort Worth  Texas  striking down the Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare Dozens of patient and healthcare industry groups  including the American Medical Association  American Hospital Association  American Cancer Society and seniors advocacy group AARP also filed briefs in support of the law The briefs come less than a week after the U S  Department of Justice  in an unexpected legal maneuver  said the entire healthcare law should be invalidated  Previously  President Donald Trump s administration had said portions of Obamacare should be struck down and others should survive  including a state led expansion of the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor The 2010 law  seen as the signature domestic achievement of Trump s Democratic predecessor  Barack Obama  has been a flash point of American politics since it passed  with Republicans including Trump repeatedly attempting to overturn it  Democrats made defending the law a powerful messaging tool in the campaign for the November elections  in which they won a decisive 38 seat majority in the U S  House of Representatives The House submitted a filing last month to the appeals court in support of the law  as did a group of 17 mostly Democratic led states including California and New York The lawsuit that led to the Texas ruling was brought by a coalition of 20 Republican led states including Texas  Alabama and Florida It centered on the law s so called individual mandate requiring individuals to buy health insurance or pay a penalty  In 2012  the U S  Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the mandate  ruling that the penalty was allowed through Congress  power to tax In late 2017  however  Trump  a Republican  signed a tax bill reducing the penalty for not buying insurance to zero  The states challenging the law argued that the mandate was no longer a tax  and was therefore unconstitutional O Connor agreed  and found that the rest of the law could not be separated from the mandate  meaning it must be struck down entirely About 11 8 million consumers nationwide enrolled in 2018 Obamacare exchange plans  according to the U S  government s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services   Reporting by Brendan Pierson in New York  Editing by Noeleen Walder and Peter Cooney  

WASHINGTON   U S  Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to deter Russia from meddling in U S  elections by threatening stiff sanctions on its banking  energy and defense industries and sovereign debt The  Deter Act  is the latest effort by U S  lawmakers to increase pressure on Moscow over what they see as a range of bad behavior  from its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria s civil war to attempts to influence U S  elections The measure was introduced by Senators Chris Van Hollen  a Democrat  and Marco Rubio  a Republican  They offered a similar measure last year  when it also had bipartisan support but was never brought up for a vote by the Senate s Republican leaders  who have close ties to President Donald Trump Trump has gone along with some previous congressional efforts to increase sanctions on Russia  although sometimes reluctantly  Backers of stronger action against Russia believe such measures will have better prospects in 2019  given control of the House of Representatives by Democrats  who are less reluctant than Trump s fellow Republicans to push back against the White House According to details of the legislation  first reported by Reuters  it would require the U S  Director of National Intelligence  DNI  to determine  within 30 days of any federal election  whether Russia or other foreign government or anyone acting as an agent of that government  had engaged in election interference If the DNI found such interference occurred  the act would require  among other things  that mandatory sanctions be imposed within 10 days on  among others  Russian banks and energy companies The act would mandate that sanctions be imposed on two or more of the following Russian banks  Sberbank  VTB Bank  Gazprombank  Vnesheconombank and Rosselkhozbank It also would order the prohibition of all transactions subject to U S  jurisdiction in Russian sovereign debt  Russian government bonds and the debt of any entity owned or controlled by Russia s government The sanctions would include blocking   freezing without seizing   any assets in the United States of those targeted for sanction  including senior Russian political figures and business leaders Russia denies trying to influence U S  elections  But U S  intelligence and law enforcement agencies have found that Moscow sought to intervene in the 2016 vote to boost Trump s chances of winning the White House An investigation by U S  Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not establish that members of Trump s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election  according to a summary released by U S  Attorney General William Barr last month The Deter Act is targeted at Russia but notes that U S  intelligence has identified China  Iran and North Korea as other major foreign government cyber threats  It also asks that Trump s administration present Congress with a strategy on preventing interference in U S  elections for each of those countries and other countries of significant concern The senators timed the bill s release to come after the end of Mueller s investigation  which has cast a shadow over the first two years of Trump s presidency  and just before an address to Congress by Jens Stoltenberg  secretary general of the NATO alliance  who has focused on the threat posed by Russia   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle  Editing by Peter Cooney and Bill Trott  

HONG KONG   After business groups had criticized a plan to ease rendition of fugitives between Hong Kong and jurisdictions including mainland China  the Hong Kong government pulled back  a little Last week  the Hong Kong authorities dropped from their proposal nine economic crimes that could prompt an extradition But on Wednesday  the government of Chief Executive Carrie Lam showed that it has no intention of stopping its broader push to overhaul its extradition laws  and introduced legislation intended to help Hong Kong send fugitives to jurisdictions that it does not have rendition agreements with John Lee  the Hong Kong secretary for security  said that the legislation would  block loopholes in the overall system of cooperation on criminal justice  But lawyers  associations and human rights groups have broadly criticized the extradition proposal  which has added to fears that Hong Kong s status  which offers greater protection for individual rights and free speech than mainland China does  is fading On Sunday  thousands of protesters marched in a steady rain to express their displeasure with the move  Opponents have called the proposed changes the  send to China rules   a homonym for a Chinese phrase for funerary rites The changes to the extradition policy were proposed after a young woman from Hong Kong was found dead in Taiwan last year  The police in Taiwan said they believe her boyfriend  who is also from Hong Kong  killed her while they were there on vacation The boyfriend was arrested in Hong Kong and charged with several crimes related to the theft of the woman s property  but under local law he could face charges for her killing only in Taiwan Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement with Taiwan  so the authorities proposed changing the rules to make it easier to send suspects to such jurisdictions  including mainland China Hong Kong  a former British colony  returned to Chinese control in 1997 under a framework of  one country  two systems   which allows it to maintain its own local government and legal system Under existing law  Hong Kong can extradite people to places it does not have formal agreements with if the legislature approves such an action But government officials have said that the system is not feasible because the legislative process could alert targets and give them time to flee before the authorities act  The proposed changes will allow Hong Kong s chief executive  the city s top official  to make such decisions instead  The surrender on a case basis is full of matters that make it not practicable   Mr  Lee  the security secretary  said on Tuesday   So to me  it is a loophole that I must plug  ImageJohn Lee  the Hong Kong secretary for security  said that the changes would  block loopholes in the overall system of cooperation on criminal justice  CreditVincent Yu Associated PressThe Hong Kong Bar Association is one group that has been critical of the government s position  On Tuesday  it said that a lack of extradition arrangements with mainland China was not a  loophole   but a decision made by the legislature in 1997 because of fundamentally different systems and concerns about the weak protection for rights across the border  There has been a failure by the government to explain why it considers that circumstances have changed since 1997   the bar association said in a statement It added that if the government chose to omit some economic crimes because of the business community s concerns about due process on the mainland  then it should not permit rendition for any offenses  Cutting only some crimes  does not deal with the fundamental issues underlying rendition of suspects  to mainland China  it said Claudia Mo  a lawmaker and member of the pro democracy coalition in the legislature  called the move to exclude some economic crimes  disgusting   How could you compartmentalize laws like this because you need to appease a certain sector   she said Mr  Lee said that any changes would maintain rights protections  and that suspects would not be extradited over political charges  But criticism has swelled in recent days  with several journalist associations and news outlets rejecting the government s assurances The changes  will not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hong Kong   the media organizations said in a joint statement The statement listed several cases of journalists being harassed in mainland China by the authorities and accused of violations listed in the proposed extradition law changes  including drug offenses and bribery Hong Kong has been shaken by cases of residents who became entangled in mainland legal matters  including the sort of behaviors with political ramifications that are treated as criminal only in authoritarian states Five booksellers who sold thinly sourced works that speculated on elite politics and the personal lives of China s leaders disappeared into mainland custody in late 2015  only to be shown later on state television offering confessions to alleged crimes Taiwan has also raised issue with the legislation  The authorities there have said that they are eager to have Chan Tong kai  the man accused of killing the Hong Kong woman  handed over to face trial But the question of status could create an obstacle  China considers self governed Taiwan to be part of its territory  but Taiwan s Ministry of Justice has said it would not go along with an extradition agreement that makes such a declaration The Hong Kong Bar Association said that such a disagreement raises questions about whether the proposed changes will achieve the stated goal of sending Mr  Chan to Taiwan  Given that the government cannot give any assurance that the proposed amendments will result in a favorable resolution   it said   there is no reason for the government to rush into these controversial and worrying proposals which undermine the international reputation of Hong Kong

WASHINGTON   President Trump has long been focused on measuring his brand  obsessively reviewing television ratings  cataloging his magazine covers and fixating on polls But Mr  Trump may not like how his brand is faring in one important metric  his  E Score   a number compiled by E Poll Market Research that is not publicly available  but which marketing executives  network television stations and advertisers rely on to figure out which personalities appeal to audiences   and which do not Like the Q Score  which measures the appeal of celebrities  the E Score calculates awareness and appeal of individuals in the public eye  But it also tracks how individuals score on more than 40 personality and physical attributes In terms of those attributes  Mr  Trump was most often described as  aggressive   48 percent  and  mean   38 percent   according to his scores from December that were obtained by The New York Times  He also scored high for being  insincere    confident  and  creepy   But he scored between 0 and 4 percent for the attributes of  sexy    impartial    handsome  and  physically fit  About 29 percent of people described Mr  Trump as  overexposed   And his overall strong positive appeal is 14 percent  compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 39 percent Among adults over the age of 55  Mr  Trump consistently held more positive appeal than among those who are younger  Mr  Trump also consistently held more positive appeal with men than with women  across all age groups Marketing  advertising and entertainment executives pay E Poll Market Research an annual subscription of  17 000 and up to access its database  allowing them to analyze the views of American consumers and assess the marketing effectiveness of each celebrity rated  The company  which has about 10 000 profiles in its database and surveys about 1 100 online participants every week  started tracking Mr  Trump when he was a television personality on  The Apprentice   according to a spokesman  Randy Parker  We do not approve of the use of E Poll s data in this story and cannot confirm or deny the information you were given   he said In 2010  during the heyday of  The Apprentice   Mr  Trump s Q Score showed he was more popular with African American and Hispanic audiences than he was with white audiences  according to  Devil s Bargain  Steve Bannon  Donald Trump and the

the election   said Henry Schafer  executive vice president of the company   He had one of the lowest positive Q Scores and one of the highest negative Q Scores  It looks like he just continued doing that up until today  ImageSupporters at Mr  Trump s rally in Grand Rapids  Mr  Trump scores consistently higher with men than with women CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesMr  Schafer said the key to Mr  Trump s success was  extremely high awareness   even if much of it was negative   You always have a portion of the population that enjoys that kind of reality  and that s his base   he said Officials in the Trump White House also receive E Scores  in part because networks often want to know how those officials are perceived Ivanka Trump  the president s elder daughter  has about 70

recognition Ms  Trump s overall strong positive appeal was 12 percent  compared with an overall strong negative appeal of 21 percent  While Ms  Trump was more disliked than liked among every age group

negative appeal was 36 percent  Mr  Kushner rarely appears on television and has no social media profile  But he is a constant figure in the news  given his broad portfolios and influence in the White House Mr  Kushner scored highest for the attributes of  insincere   29 percent    creepy   27 percent  and  overexposed   22 percent   He was lowest in terms of  exciting    glamorous  and  emotional

appeal of 9 percent and a strong negative appeal of 43 percent Ms  Sanders  who has phased out the regular White House press briefing  which often had contentious back and forths with reporters  and is now more often seen in friendlier venues like the morning show  Fox   Friends   ranked somewhat higher  with a strong positive appeal of 19 percent and a strong negative appeal of 28 percent The scores show the public views Ms  Sanders as more of an honest broker than Ms  Conway  who became infamous in the administration s early days for coining the phrase  alternative facts  Ms  Sanders scored 15 percent for  trustworthy   compared with Ms  Conway s 8 percent ranking in the same category  Ms  Conway was described by 31 percent of respondents as  insincere   compared with 27 percent

WASHINGTON   A whistle blower working inside the White House has told a House committee that senior Trump administration officials granted security clearances to at least 25 individuals whose applications had been denied by career employees for  disqualifying issues  that could put national security at risk  the committee s Democratic staff said Monday The whistle blower  Tricia Newbold  a manager in the White House s Personnel Security Office  told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform in a private interview last month that the 25 applicants included two current senior White House officials  in addition to contractors and other employees working for the office of the president  the staff said in a memo it released publicly The memo does not identify any of the 25 people  But one of the senior White House officials appears to be Jared Kushner  the president s son in law and senior adviser NBC News reported in January that Carl Kline  who until recently served as the head of the personnel security division and was Ms  Newbold s boss  had overruled a decision by career security officials concerned about granting Mr  Kushner a clearance The New York Times reported in February that President Trump had ordered his chief of staff  John F  Kelly  to grant a clearance last year to Mr  Kushner  The president had earlier said he had no role in the clearance  Over the last few years that I ve been here  I ve been accused of all different types of things  and all of those things have turned out to be false   Mr  Kushner said Monday night on Fox News in response to a question about Ms  Newbold s claims Democrats on the oversight panel are also demanding information from the White House about the process of granting a clearance to Ivanka Trump  among others  Ms  Trump s final clearance was granted shortly after Mr  Kushner s  In an interview in February with ABC News  Ms  Trump insisted her father had no hand in either her clearance or her husband s Ms  Newbold told the committee s staff members that she and other career officials had denied the 25 applications for a variety of reasons  including  foreign influence  conflicts of interest  concerning personal conduct  financial problems  drug use and criminal conduct   the memo said The denials by the career employees were overturned  she said  by officials with more seniority who  by her account  did not follow the normal procedures meant to mitigate security risks and generally adhered to by other administrations Ms  Newbold  who has worked in the White House for 18 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations  said she chose to speak to the committee after attempts to raise concerns with her superiors and the White House counsel went nowhere  according to the committee staff s account  I feel that right now  this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office   she said  according to a summary of her March 23 interview with the committee s staff that was distributed on Monday White House officials have been concerned for weeks that Ms  Newbold would either speak publicly or share information that she had gleaned about how security clearances had been handled during the first half of Mr  Trump s term  Her statements to the Oversight Committee are likely to increase pressure on the White House to address lingering questions about its general practices around keeping the nation s secrets and several high profile cases Representative Elijah E  Cummings  Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the committee  included information provided by Ms  Newbold in a letter to Pat A  Cipollone  the White House counsel  on Monday  again demanding that the White House turn over files connected to the security clearance process and make administration personnel available for interviews Mr  Cummings said he was prepared to authorize subpoenas as soon as Tuesday to try to compel the White House to comply with an investigation into whether national secrets were at risk   an escalation that could force Mr  Cipollone either to reach an accommodation with Congress or fight in court  I understand that the president has the right to grant these security clearances  but I have the duty and Congress has a duty to be a check on that system   Mr  Cummings told reporters   If the top secrets of our country are being seen by eyes that should not see them  we ought to all be concerned  Mr  Cipollone has argued repeatedly that the power to deny or grant security clearances  belongs exclusively  to the executive branch and  therefore  Congress has no authority to make such  unprecedented and extraordinarily intrusive demands   He has simultaneously accused Mr  Cummings of mischaracterizing his posture toward the committee  writing that his office had been acting in good faith with regard to several of the committee s investigations ImageRepresentative Elijah Cummings  chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee  said he was prepared to authorize subpoenas as soon as Tuesday to try to compel the White House to comply with an investigation into whether national secrets were at risk CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesThe White House did not respond to a request for comment  It is not clear what steps  if any  Mr  Kline might have taken to resolve the security concerns raised by the career employees before overruling them Republicans on Capitol Hill blasted Mr  Cummings for his handling of the case  calling it a  partisan attack on the White House  and accusing him of cherry picking from Ms  Newbold s interview  Chairman Cummings s investigation is not about restoring integrity to the security clearance process  it is an excuse to go fishing through the personal files of dedicated public servants   said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio  the Oversight Committee s top Republican In a nine page memo of their own  Republicans presented Ms  Newbold s concerns about the office s leadership as overblown and  in some cases  typical of a disgruntled federal employee  They said she had told the committee that  only  three of the 25 individuals on her list were  senior level  White House employees  and  only  four or five prompted  very serious reasons  Mr  Cummings said he planned to issue a subpoena for the testimony of Mr  Kline  a nonpolitical federal official who until recently served as the head of the personnel security division and was Ms  Newbold s boss  Mr  Cummings also identified five other senior White House officials whose testimony he planned to seek He requested summaries of the security clearance adjudication process and any related documents for nine current and former officials  including Mr  Kushner  Ms  Trump  the president s elder daughter and senior adviser  and John R  Bolton  the national security adviser In the cases of the two senior White House officials  Ms  Newbold gave the committee a detailed account of her role  the Democratic memo said In one case  she said that a senior White House official was denied a clearance after a background check turned up concerns about possible foreign influence   employment outside or businesses external to what your position at the E O P  entails   and the official s personal conduct   E O P   refers to the executive office of the president Mr  Kline stepped in to reverse the decision  she said  writing in the relevant file that  the activities occurred before federal service  without addressing concerns raised by Ms  Newbold and another colleague In the case of the second senior White House official  Ms  Newbold told the committee that a specialist reviewing the clearance application wrote a 14 page memo detailing disqualifying concerns  including possible foreign influence  She said that Mr  Kline instructed her  do not touch  the case  and soon granted the official clearance There is nothing barring the president or his designees from overturning the assessments of career officials  But Ms  Newbold sought to portray the decisions as unusual and frequent  and  in any case  irregular compared to the processes usually followed by her office to mitigate security risks  Once we adjudicate it  the president absolutely has the right to override and still grant the clearance  but we owe it to the president and the American people to do what is expected of us  and our job is to adjudicate national security adjudications regardless of influence   she told the committee  according to the Democratic staff s memo Republicans  in their memo  stressed that Ms  Newbold had no firsthand knowledge of why Mr  Kline ultimately elected to grant the clearances to the two senior officials  Her testimony focused on a series of personnel and workplace complaints that suggest she is unhappy and dissatisfied in her office   the Republican memo said It noted that Ms  Newbold had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Mr  Kline  accusing him of discriminating against her over her short stature  which is caused by a form of dwarfism  She also filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel In January  Ms  Newbold was suspended for two weeks for failing to follow new office policies  but she told the committee she believed the suspension was retaliation for her E E O C  complaint According to the Democrats  Ms  Newbold also asserted that the Trump administration had made changes to security protocols that made it easier for individuals to get clearances  The changes included stopping credit checks on applicants to work in the White House  which she said helps identify if employees of the president could be susceptible to blackmail  She also said the White House had stopped  for a time  the practice of reinvestigating certain applicants who had received security clearances in the past Republicans  memo said that Ms  Newbold had spoken positively of other Trump security policies and personnel  

WASHINGTON   The Republican led U S  Senate on Wednesday changed its procedures to speed up the confirmation of President Donald Trump s nominees for some lower court judgeships and sub Cabinet level positions The move to shorten debate on such nominees from 30 hours to two hours was resisted by Democrats but they could not block it because Republicans hold 53 seats in the 100 seat chamber Senator Mitch McConnell used his powers as majority leader to make the change  which will set a precedent that will apply to district court judges  the lowest rung of the judiciary  but not vacancies in the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts  The Senate has historically provided greater protection for whichever party is in the minority than the 435 seat House of Representatives by allowing longer debating time before votes and requiring 60 yes votes for most approvals  Those conventions have been whittled away by both Democrats and Republicans in recent years as the mood in Washington has become more and more polarized  however  with each party accusing the other of misusing the rules Reducing the time for debate will  begin to unwind this partisan paralysis  for the good of the Senate   McConnell said on Wednesday  Democrats slammed the procedural change  At a time when leader McConnell brags about confirming more judges than anyone has done in a very long time  he feels the need to invoke the terribly destructive and disproportionate procedure   Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Fifty three district court nominees have been confirmed during Trump s first two years in office against 44 confirmed at the same point in the presidency of Democratic President Barack Obama During Obama s presidency  Senate Democrats took steps to more easily win approval of his nominations by requiring only a simple majority vote for administration posts and judges other than Supreme Court nominees  They also limited debate to two hours  but that move expired at the end of that Congress after Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 elections  In 2017  McConnell expanded the simple majority procedure to include Supreme Court confirmations in order to overcome Democratic opposition to Trump s first nominee  Neil Gorsuch The fight over the confirmation of federal judges has been raging for years  as divisive issues before the courts include hot button issues like abortion  the death penalty and money in politics  Republicans are hoping that they can confirm as many of Trump s conservative picks as possible while they control the Senate and White House Democrats were enraged in 2016 when McConnell refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland  Obama s pick to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court At the time  McConnell said that choice should be made by whoever won the November 2016 presidential election Since he became president in January 2017  Trump has won confirmation of 37 appeals court judges  compared to 55 appeals court judge confirmations during Obama s entire eight years  Such confirmation votes would not be subject to Wednesday s procedural change  Click here to see a graphic showing Trump s appeals court appointments  https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL https   tmsnrt rs 2Vxf9tL    Reporting By Amanda Becker and Richard Cowan  additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Lawrence Hurley  Editing by Sonya Hepinstall  

The future success of the Democratic Party depends on the crucial   but unsettled   allegiance of the nation s growing Hispanic electorate Fernand Amandi  a Democratic pollster and podcast host based in Miami  addressed the party s Latino quandary in a December interview with The Associated Press The question is not are Democrats winning the Hispanic vote   it s why aren t Democrats winning the Hispanic vote 80 20 or 90 10 the way they are winning black voters In an interview earlier this week  Amandi told me that Democrats  want and hope for this magical osmosis to happen but that s not how politics works  In the 2018 midterms  Democrats showed gains among Hispanic voters in most states  compared with 2014  Party operatives are concerned  however  about the slow rate of growth of these improved Democratic margins  They are equally worried about turnout   at a time when many thought that President Trump s rhetoric and policies would produce impressive gains among Latino voters for the Democratic Party Take turnout  Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic constituencies in the United States  but their level of political participation is not keeping pace with their overall population numbers As the accompanying Pew chart demonstrates  the number of Hispanic voters in midterm elections has grown steadily  from 2 9 million in 1986 to 6 8 million in 2014  At the same time  however  turnout   measured as a percentage of total eligible adult citizens 18 and over   has experienced a relative decline The Growth of the Latino Bloc       g edsall1 box  g artboard

  02           06           10           14         By The New York Times   Source  Pew Research CenterIn 1986  the Latino turnout rate was 38 7 percent  in 2014  that rate fell to 27 1 percent  If the 2014 turnout rate had been as high as it was in 1986  Hispanics would have cast 9 7 million ballots instead of 6 8 million   Complete numbers for 2018 are still being compiled  In a preliminary analysis of Hispanic voter turnout last year  Catalist  a Democratic firm that builds voter lists  found significant increases in turnout of three to five percent  comparing 2018 with the 2014 midterms  Texas  Nevada and California saw five percent increases  Florida four percent  New Mexico and New York three percent Turnout rates and levels of support are two key  but quite different  political measures  While Latinos had a turnout rate of 27 1 percent in 2014  their support for Democratic House candidates that year was 62 percent  Their support for Republican House candidates was 36 percent  according to exit polls While Democratic support among Hispanics has improved over the past decade  from the low 60s to the high 60s  there is evidence suggesting that those gains cannot be relied upon in future elections In the midterm elections  Florida became the prime example of such unreliability  as Republicans demonstrated they could buck state and national trends to make substantial gains among Hispanics Republicans won two close statewide races in Florida in 2018  one for senate and one for governor   despite the gradual erosion of Republican support among Cuban Americans in the state and despite the continuing influx of pro Democratic Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017 Simon Rosenberg  president of NDN  formerly the New Democrat Network  a pro Democratic think tank  wrote   In All Important Florida  Democrats Lose Ground With Hispanic Voters  a month after the 2018 election In an election where Democrats had one of their best years ever with Hispanic voters across the country  Florida Democrats saw their Hispanic numbers decline  Nationally  Democrats went from 62 36  26 pts  in 2014 to 69 29  40 pts  this election  In Florida  Democrats went from 58 38  20 pts  in 2014 to 54 44  10 pts  this year As Rosenberg pointed out  this shift occurred despite the fact that Trump did everything possible to alienate Latinos  along with undercutting Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis  the winning Republican candidates for Senate and governor Rosenberg noted that Trump hadrelentlessly attacked immigrants and Hispanics in particular  He grossly mismanaged the aftermath of Hurricane Maria  sending hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans fleeing to Central Florida  He revoked the temporary status of many immigrants in Florida  Given all this  one would have imagined the environment for Democrats to make gains among Hispanics was present in Florida this year  gains which were made elsewhere  Yet we fell back By all accounts  Scott and DeSantis campaigned almost daily in Hispanic precincts  while their Democratic opponents  Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum  took the Hispanic vote for granted  We had no infrastructure   Christian Ulvert  Gillum s director for Spanish language media  told Politico And honestly  Democrats have been playing catch up on Hispanic outreach for two decades  because Republicans have invested in it  You can t close that gap overnight Politico described Nelson s bid for a fourth term as  a uniquely lazy campaign that made laughably ineffectual attempts to engage with Hispanics  Melissa Michelson  a political scientist at Menlo College in California and president of the Latino caucus of the American Political Science Association  described in an email the changing political orientation of Florida s Cuban Americans In a 1989 90 survey  Michelson wrote  68 8 percent of Cuban Americans identified with Republicans  Since then there have been significant changes  Over the years  she continued  Pew has documented a steady decline in Cuban Americans  Republican identification  from 64 percent in 2002 to 56 percent in 2006 to 47 percent in 2013 Despite the decline in Republican support among Cuban Americans  Michelson emphasized thatThere has always been a contingent of Latinos who identify as Republican and are more interested in Republican conservative  or anti Communist  policies than in immigration issues or racism  Recall that 40 percent of Latinos voted for Bush in 2004  Reagan also enjoyed considerable Latino support  I think many Democrats are continually perplexed by this   that there could be Latino voters who are willing to support a president  or candidate  like Trump whose rhetoric and policies are so clearly anti Latino and racist While Scott and DeSantis revived Cuban American willingness to support Republicans  two of the three Florida House seats that had been represented by Cuban American Republicans switched parties in 2018 Revealing a contrast to Florida  Matt A  Barreto  a political scientist at U C L A  and a co founder of Latino Decisions  analyzed turnout and voting patterns in Texas  In a March report  Barreto described a huge pro Democratic turnout increase there  ranging from 105 to 125 percent in eight counties where Hispanics make up more than 90 percent of the population  There were significant gains in counties with white majorities of 83 to 91 percent too  but these upturns were smaller  in the 35 to 55 percent range The ability of two conservative Florida Republicans to make such inroads simply by campaigning diligently suggests that the Democratic hold on Latinos is less firm than many believed So where do Latinos stand politically The NBC News Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 918 Hispanics during 2018 and found that Trump s job approval rating was a relatively dismal 30 percent  21 points below his 51 percent favorability rating among whites  but 18 points higher than his 12 percent approval rate among African Americans The data  provided to The Times by Public Opinion Strategies  one of the two firms that conducted the survey  found that Trump s approval among Hispanics was highest among men and among the affluent   40 percent for both   and among men without college degrees  at 39 percent A 2018 Pew report   Key takeaways about Latino voters in the 2018 midterm elections   found that Hispanics cast a decisive majority of votes for Democratic congressional candidates  69 29   a smaller percentage of votes  however  than African Americans  90 9  and Asian Americans  77 23   Whites backed Republicans  54 to 44 In a state by state breakdown  Pew found that in the Texas Senate race  Latinos backed Democrat Beto O Rourke over Ted Cruz by nearly two to one  64 35  while Greg Abbott  the incumbent Republican governor  lost the Hispanic vote to Democratic challenger Lupe Valdez  53 42 In Florida  Democrats Gillum and Nelson won the Hispanic vote by nearly equal percentages  54 44 and 54 45    but in both cases by margins that were inadequate to produce overall victory The Democratic winner in the Nevada Senate race  Jacky Rosen  did far better among Hispanics  who backed her over Dean Heller  the Republican incumbent  67 30 While many Democrats expected Trump s anti immigrant rhetoric and policies  especially the family separation debacle  to produce a decisive shift to the left among Hispanics  that has not proved to be the case An October 2018 Pew report found that almosthalf of Latinos  48 percent  believe there is about the right amount of immigrants living in the U S   while a quarter say there are too many immigrants and 14 percent say there are too few  Three quarters of Hispanics opposed Trump s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border  while one in five favors construction In an email  Barreto  of Latino Decisions  argued that Democratic support among Hispanics remains solid I do not see anything since November 2018 to suggest Dems are losing any support at all  Trump continues on the same path of bashing immigrants and bashing Latinos without evidence and this only further decreases his favorability among Latinos Asked about the declining share of eligible Hispanics turning out on Election Day  Barreto countered that the growing numbers of eligible Latinos arealmost entirely driven by U S  born young Latinos turning 18 and entering the eligible voter pool In a common pattern  Barreto pointed out   young people have very low rates of voter registration and voter turnout   especially in midterm elections  Because of that  Barreto said that in order to get a better picture  the data should be age adjusted so that turnout levels of older voters of different races and ethnicities could be compared Barreto is also sharply critical of most polling of Hispanics and of exit polls in particular  arguing that the lack of Spanish speaking interviewers results in an undercount of Hispanic turnout as well as inaccurate estimates of Republican and Democratic votes In addition  candidates and political parties have to make a much stronger case to young Hispanics that their vote matters  according to Barreto Otherwise  you will only get incremental growth each year   which still puts Latinos as a larger and larger share of the electorate  but perhaps not as large as we could be Rosenberg  of NDN  argues that the Democratic Party did not start targeting the Hispanic electorate  with modern campaign tactics and communications  until the 2006 8 period  Those efforts immediately bore fruit  Rosenberg contended in an email Remember that in 2004 Bush won Arizona  Colorado  New Mexico and Nevada  Now Colorado and New Mexico are no longer really competitive at the presidential level  Nevada is slipping away from the Republicans  and Democrats elected a Senator in 2018 in Arizona Texas  according to Rosenberg   is about to hit a tipping point   in large part because of the Hispanic vote What conclusions and what questions remain in the wake of these complex and sometimes conflicting trends in the Hispanic electorate First and foremost  Latinos remain a decisively Democratic constituency  with important caveats Brian Schaffner  a political scientist at Tufts and co principal researcher at the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  wrote in an email that nationally  Hispanic support for Democrats has been relatively consistent Schaffner provided the accompanying graph  which shows the level of voting for Democrats in House contests in the six elections from 2008 to 2018 for whites  blacks  Asian Americans and Hispanics  The Hispanic Democratic vote shows a significant 8 6 point increase from 2014 to 2016 and a 13 6 point increase from 2014 to 2018   call it the Trump jump   although the increase in the percentage of Asian Americans voting for Democrats was even larger at 20 2 points Who Votes for DemocratsOf votes for the two major party candidates in House races  the share that went

Source  analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election Study by Brian Schaffner  Tufts UniversityLatinos  partisan loyalties are much less hard and fast than  say  those of either African Americans or white evangelicals  The results in Florida demonstrate that Democrats risk defeat if they fail to campaign heavily in Hispanic communities  and Republicans stand to gain at the margins if they are prepared to invest time  money and energy The major question mark going into 2020  assuming Trump is the Republican nominee  is whether Hispanic opposition to his presidency will prevent a recurrence of the Florida 2018 phenomenon  Will Trump s presence so nationalize the election that down ballot Republicans will face a brick wall when they try to make modest inroads among Hispanics To date  Trump has shown every intention of turning the election into a referendum on himself  and all the baggage he carries  with no regard for the political survival of fellow Republicans  If anything  he appears determined to drive up hostility to him among Latinos  For the past two days  for example  the president has ranted on Twitter  attacking Puerto Rico and its political leaders On Monday  he told his Twitter followers Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works On Tuesday  he was still at it All their local politicians do is complain   ask for more money  The pols are grossly incompetent  spend the money foolishly or corruptly    only take from USA Behaving this way  Trump may succeed in driving up support among  his people   as he likes to call his voters  But if he keeps it up  he will be doing both his Democratic opponent and the Democratic Party as a whole a huge favor as far

WASHINGTON   The Democratic led U S  House Judiciary Committee said it will vote on Wednesday on whether to authorize subpoenas to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full report investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election Lawmakers will also consider subpoenas for underlying evidence from Mueller s investigation and from five former aides to President Donald Trump  including White House counsel Donald McGahn and political adviser Steve Bannon  The committee said on Monday that they may have documents related to the Mueller probe Democrats have become increasingly frustrated over U S  Attorney General William Barr s plan to share only a redacted copy of the nearly 400 page investigative report with Congress  The committee will vote on a resolution to allow House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler to issue subpoenas at his own discretion The Mueller report describes his office s 22 month probe  which did not establish that members of Trump s campaign conspired with Russia but also did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice  according to a four page summary Barr released on March 24  Barr said Mueller s team had not found enough proof to warrant bringing obstruction charges against the president Trump and the White House have hailed the conclusions as a victory for the president  But Democrats have taken issue with Barr s intervention   Congress  not the attorney general  has a duty under the Constitution to determine whether wrongdoing has occurred   Nadler wrote in a New York Times Op Ed on Monday   It is not the attorney general s job to step in and substitute his judgment for the special counsel s  That responsibility falls to Congress   and specifically to the House Judiciary Committee   as it has in every similar investigation in modern history  A week ago  Nadler and the Democratic heads of five other House committees gave Barr until Tuesday to provide the full Mueller report and underlying evidence  Barr said he would issue his redacted version by mid April or sooner Trump on Monday took aim at Democrats in the aftermath of the Mueller probe   No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report  it will never be good enough  Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing   the president said on Twitter  Republicans on the judiciary panel say Congress does not need the unredacted Mueller report to do its job and accuse Democrats of setting arbitrary deadlines as part of a partisan campaign to undermine Trump ahead of the 2020 election   The attorney general has already demonstrated transparency above and beyond what is required   Representative Doug Collins  the top Republican on the judiciary committee  said in a statement  But Democrats say Republicans helped set a precedent for Congress to obtain underlying investigative material during their investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state  The committee said the Justice Department gave Congress more than 880 000 pages of internal investigative records from the Clinton probe as well as classified and sensitive law enforcement information from an early Russia probe that Mueller took over  In addition to McGahn and Bannon  the committee will consider subpoenas for former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks  former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson The five former Trump aides were among 81 individuals  agencies and other entities that received document requests on March 4 as part of the committee s obstruction and corruption investigation of Trump and his associates   Reporting by David Morgan and David Alexander in Washington  Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld in New York  Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   Aides to Joe Biden struck a more aggressive tone on Monday as the former vice president faced scrutiny over his past behavior toward women In a statement  Biden spokesman Bill Russo blasted  right wing trolls  from  the dark recesses of the internet  for conflating images of Biden embracing acquaintances  colleagues and friends in his official capacity during swearing in ceremonies with uninvited touching The move came on a day in which a second woman said Biden had acted inappropriately  touching her face with both hands and rubbing noses with her in 2009  The allegation by Amy Lappos  a former aide to Democratic Rep  Jim Hines of Connecticut  followed a magazine essay by former Nevada politician Lucy Flores  who wrote that Biden kissed her on the back of the head in 2014 The developments underscored the challenge facing Biden should he decide to seek the White House  Following historic wins in the 2018 midterms  Democratic politics is dominated by energy from women  The allegations could leave the 76 year old Biden  long known for his affectionate mannerisms  appearing out of touch with the party as the Democratic presidential primary begins Lappos told The Associated Press that she and other Himes aides were helping out at a fundraiser in a private home in Hartford  Connecticut  in October 2009 when Biden entered the kitchen to thank the group for pitching in  After he finished speaking  he stopped to talk to us about how important a congressional staff is  which I thought was awesome   Lappos said She said she was stunned as Biden moved toward her  He wrapped both his hands around my face and pulled me in   said Lappos  who is now 43   I thought   Oh  God  he s going to kiss me   Instead  he rubbed noses with me   Biden said nothing  she said  then moved off  She said the experience left her feeling  weird and uncomfortable  and was  absolutely disrespectful of my personal boundaries  The Hartford Courant first reported Lappos  assertion Russo didn t directly respond to Lappos  instead referring to a Sunday statement in which Biden said he doesn t believe he has acted inappropriately during his long public life  The former vice president said in that statement   We have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences  and men should pay attention  And I will  Biden hasn t made a final decision on whether to run for the White House  But aides who weren t authorized to discuss internal conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity said there were no signs that his team was slowing its preparations for a campaign Asked by the AP about the accusations against Biden  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said   I don t think that this disqualifies him from running for president  not at all   She declined to elaborate Biden s potential Democratic rivals haven t rushed to back him up  Over the weekend  presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand came closest to calling out the former vice president  Warren said Biden  needs to give an answer  about what occurred  Gillibrand said   If Vice President Biden becomes a candidate  this is a topic he ll have to engage on further  Ultraviolet  a women s advocacy group  tweeted   Joe Biden cannot paint himself as a champion of women and then refuse to listen and learn from a woman who says his actions demeaned her  Good intentions don t matter if the actions are inappropriate  Do better  Joe  And thank you  LucyFlores for coming forward     Beaumont reported from Des Moines  Iowa  AP Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace contributed to this report  

LONDON   British lawmakers long at loggerheads over the path to withdrawing from the European Union actually came close to agreeing on something Monday  a solution known as a  customs union  What is it Simply put  it would entail Britain s agreeing to stay permanently in a customs union with the bloc   a  soft Brexit   of sorts What is a customs union The customs union being proposed in Parliament by a former Conservative chancellor  Ken Clarke  would keep the United Kingdom in the same tariff system as the European Union countries A customs union would help businesses that send goods back and forth to the Continent  so it would be of most interest to Britain s manufacturers  particularly the automobile industry  But some smaller businesses might also benefit What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union And it might also ease complication of the much hated Irish backstop plan  which is intended to eliminate the need for hard border checks between Northern Ireland and the south Sounds good  What s the hitch While a customs union would allow goods to flow more easily  it would not allow for frictionless trade Yes  the agreement would keep the tariffs Britain pays on goods that cross the border equal to those that countries in the European Union pay But it is more complicated than that  The goods being traded will still need to meet the same product standards that apply throughout the bloc  to keep the playing field level ImageA security agent last week at a border post in Coquelles  France  that was built in anticipation of a  no deal Brexit  CreditPhilippe Huguen Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesWhat might that mean for Britain  Just take a look at Turkey Turkey is a member of a customs union with the European Union  but it is not a member of the bloc itself  So trucks on its borders are often held up for hours as guards check for permits and make sure the products being transported are in compliance with regulations set in Brussels And a customs union would not cover trade in services  like legal counsel and information technology  which are by far the largest sector of the British economy But the biggest objection from Brexit backers to a customs union is that countries that are in one are prohibited from making their own trade deals  And that  they argue vociferously  undermines the whole point of leaving the bloc Chris Grayling  the transport secretary  warned on Monday that a customs union would result in the government of Lithuania having  more power  over Britain s trading relationship than British ministers ImageBritain s transport secretary  Chris Grayling  with a fellow cabinet member  Penny Mordaunt  leaving 10 Downing Street last week CreditDaniel Leal Olivas Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThat might explain why only 35 Conservatives voted for the customs union proposal last week Would it at least solve the Irish border problem Well  no  for the same reason that trucks pile up on the border between Turkey and the European Union  Even though tariffs would be equalized  there would remain the need to check that products  particularly food  comply with the bloc s standards That problem could be avoided if Northern Ireland remained aligned with single market rules on food and health standards  But that is alarming to the Brexiteers  who are adamantly opposed to any agreement that would make Northern Ireland subject to different rules than the rest of the United Kingdom In an interview with The Daily Telegraph  Mr  Grayling said it was a  myth  that a customs union would solve the Irish border issue  It is not going to come without strings attached   he said   The idea that we just get a customs arrangement without having to sign up to a raft of single market legislation is extremely unlikely  ImageThe Termon River  on the border of the Republic of Ireland  left  and Northern Ireland CreditNeil Hall EPA  via ShutterstockAre there any alternatives Sure  Plenty But there is no guarantee any would be more palatable to a majority of lawmakers The one most mentioned is  Common Market 2 0   put forward by a cross party group of Tory and Labour lawmakers  It would require Britain to remain a part of the bloc s single market  as well as in a customs union Often referred to as a  Norway style soft Brexit   it would mean accepting single market rules  but not require direct involvement in the quest for closer political union and agricultural policies It would  however  require Britain to accept freedom of movement between member states  perhaps the one thing above all that Mrs  May vowed to end in the Brexit process In the last round of votes  189 members of Parliament voted for the plan  while 283 voted against it  On Monday night  it was defeated more narrowly after the opposition Labour Party said it would whip its lawmakers to vote for the amendment What s likely to happen Your guess is as good as anyone s Getting out of the customs union was one of the red lines set by Mrs  May  who has said that Britain must have  new opportunities to trade with the rest the world  Agreeing to any  softening  in her Brexit stance is politically perilous  It may incite mass resignations by pro Brexit lawmakers in her cabinet  who have called the customs union and other similar proposals a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result  

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration on Wednesday will resume negotiations with China toward ending a trade war that has deepened uncertainty for businesses and investors and dimmed the outlook for the global economy The two sides are to meet for the ninth time  with analysts expressing optimism that the world s two biggest economies might be near some kind of agreement  Negotiators met in Beijing last week in talks that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as  constructive   Now  Vice Premier Liu He  a close confidante of President Xi Jinping  is leading a Chinese team to Washington  We have been encouraged by the tone of the negotiations   Myron Brilliant  head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  told reporters Tuesday Brilliant estimated that the two sides are 90  of the way to an agreement but cautioned that  the last 10  is the hardest part  the trickiest part  At the heart of the dispute are the Trump administration s allegations that China steals technology and coerces U S  companies to hand over trade secrets   all part of Beijing s zeal to overtake U S  technological dominance  To pressure China  the United States has imposed tariffs on  250 billion in Chinese goods  The Chinese have counterpunched by taxing  110 billion in U S  imports Forecasters at the World Bank and International Monetary  among others  have downgraded their outlook for the global economy  partly because the U S  China rift is damaging trade and causing businesses to slow their investment until they know how the dispute will end Tensions have eased somewhat since President Donald Trump met Xi in Buenos Aires late last year and the administration ended up suspending its plans to raise tariffs on  200 billion of the Chinese imports to buy time for negotiations We re making headway   Larry Kudlow  Trump s top economic adviser  said Tuesday  describing the talks as  a larger  grander discussion than anything we ve ever had in U S  China relations  Analysts say two major sticking points  in particular  stand in the way of any agreement First  Trump wants to preserve at least the 25  tariffs he has imposed on  50 billion in Chinese imports as a way to maintain leverage over Beijing  China wants those sanctions lifted Second  the two sides must develop a mechanism to ensure that China honors any commitments it makes in an agreement  The administration complains that China has repeatedly failed to keep promises it made in previous trade talks The Chinese are widely expected to agree to buy substantially more American products   likely including soybeans and natural gas   to help narrow the United States  trade deficit in goods and services with China  which hit a record  379 billion last year  America s trade deficit with China has been a chronic complaint of Trump  although many economists say a bilateral trade gap is relatively insignificant Congressional Democrats and others have warned Trump against reaching any agreement that settles for more U S  exports to China without also requiring Beijing to adopt serious economic reforms  Stand firm  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y   said Tuesday   Skip the political photo op and make good on your promise to stand up for American businesses and workers when China takes advantage  Christopher Adams  a former China specialist at the Treasury Department and the Office of the U S  Trade Representative who is a senior adviser at the Covington   Burling law firm  added   There has to be something substantive on the structural issues  Otherwise  the criticism will be severe  Whatever negotiators agree to  analysts say  they are unlikely to end the long standing tensions between America s mostly open  capitalist economy and a Chinese economy in which the Communist Party and the central government command the dominant role Even with a deal  Adams said   a lot of the underlying issues will still be with us unresolved because they re rooted in fundamental differences between the US and Chinese systems   

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Tuesday lashed out at Puerto Rico s local lawmakers as  grossly incompetent  and singled out one of his favorite targets  Carmen Yulín Cruz  the mayor of San Juan  as  crazed and incompetent  Mr  Trump s latest invective toward the local leaders of an island devastated by a hurricane in September 2017 came in a torrent of tweets  which began on Monday night and spilled into Tuesday morning  Mr  Trump was reacting after the Senate on Monday blocked billions of dollars in disaster aid for Midwestern states  in part because Democrats said a proposed  600 million in nutritional assistance to Puerto Rico fell short of its needs  Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas   Florida combined  yet their government can t do anything right  the place is a mess   nothing works   Mr  Trump wrote on Twitter  He also stated  incorrectly  that Puerto Rico had received  91 billion in aid from the federal government In fact  FEMA and other agencies have so far distributed  11 2 billion in aid to Puerto Rico  according to the Office of Management and Budget  Some  41 billion in aid has been allocated  while  91 billion is the budget office s estimate of how much the island could receive over the next two decades Gov  Ricardo A  Rosselló of Puerto Rico  a Democrat  responded to Mr  Trump in a tweet of his own on Tuesday   Mr  President  once again  we are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Mr  Rosselló wrote Mr  Trump has long been sensitive when it comes to the subject of Puerto Rico  where the federal government s response to Hurricane Maria was widely criticized as too slow  Aides and allies said Mr  Trump had vented privately that Puerto Ricans had complained too much  and he had also noted privately that Hurricane Maria  which killed 2 975 people as a result of the storm and its effects  was not as bad as Hurricane Katrina  in which fewer people   1 833   were killed Mr  Trump has long hit back at Ms  Cruz  who during the disaster became the most outspoken critic of the federal response On Tuesday  Mr  Trump seemed to imply in his tweets that Puerto Rico was not part of the United States  noting that local elected officials  only take from USA   Hogan Gidley  a White House spokesman  seemed to underscore the view in the White House that Puerto Ricans were not Americans when he twice referred to the island as  that country  during an appearance on MSNBC Mr  Trump s apparent disdain for the island s leadership has led to a breakdown of communication between local officials and the White House For weeks  Mr  Rosselló has asked the White House for a private meeting with Mr  Trump to lay out the island s case for why it desperately needs federal funds for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria  But Mr  Rosselló s request has gone unanswered  and he has tried instead to communicate with the president publicly  saying in cable news interviews  in official appearances and on Twitter that he fears Mr  Trump has been misled about Puerto Rico s needs Mr  Rosselló s fight may be an uphill battle with a president who has made it clear that he views more federal aid to Puerto Rico as throwing money away  Mr  Trump s advisers also view the pleas from local officials as part of a campaign to shift the blame for what they view as severe mismanagement of the supplies and money sent after the storm People familiar with Mr  Trump s thinking said he was skeptical that additional aid would not be used to pay down Puerto Rico s debt  The acting White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  who has made it clear that he believes Puerto Rico will need to find its own way out of the debt crisis  is believed to be encouraging the president s negative view of the island In Puerto Rico  however  Mr  Trump s stance is being viewed through the lens of race  In an interview on Tuesday  Mr  Rosselló mentioned  unprompted  that Puerto Rico s population was almost entirely Latino and said that historically  there have been  ethnic undertones  to the treatment of Puerto Ricans by Washington   We don t want special treatment   he said   We just want equal treatment  The governor also has bigger issues to deal with at home  The resignations of two power players in his cabinet became public late on Monday  Julia Keleher  the education secretary  and Héctor M  Pesquera  the public safety secretary  had been among the least popular members of Mr  Rosselló s government  Their departures dominated the headlines in the local news media  which made little reference to what is widely seen here as yet another episode of presidential bluster That is not to say Puerto Ricans necessarily disagree with Mr  Trump s criticism of the commonwealth s leaders  even if many locals dislike the president himself  or the disdainful way he sometimes refers to the island  We have a political caste that is opportunistic and extremely corrupt   said Eduardo Lalo  a well known local novelist  humanities professor and opinion columnist who supports Puerto Rican independence   What the president says  of course it s clumsy and tremendously vulgar  and he says it for reasons of his own that are not substantive  But it s also objective  Image We are not your adversaries  we are your citizens   Gov  Ricardo A  Rosselló of Puerto Rico said in a tweet to President Trump CreditThais Llorca EPA  via ShutterstockThe truth is  he said   Puerto Rico is a colony of the United States  and therefore its hands are completely tied  At a bakery in the comfortable San Juan neighborhood of Ocean Park on Tuesday  the morning crowd was hardly abuzz about Mr  Trump s comments  though people had noticed them One patron  Miguel Rodríguez  54  pulled out his cellphone to show how  moments earlier  a friend had posted on Facebook that she agreed with the president for the first time in praising Puerto Ricans but labeling their leaders  corrupt  Mr  Rodríguez  the owner of a company that installs security systems  scrolled down to the comment he left under his friend s post   We do not lack resources  we have too many thieves   The government wants to keep demanding money from the government of the United States   Mr  Rodríguez said   But much of that help doesn t reach the people  Politically  Mr  Rosselló is in an unenviable position experienced by all of his predecessors  Puerto Rico cannot get funding even for its food stamp program without approval from Congress  but it has no congressional representation to make its case in Washington   Representative Jenniffer González Colón  a Republican  has no vote in the House   None of the previous governors  however  had to deal with the dire consequences of a devastating hurricane in the middle of a government bankruptcy  Neither Trump nor any president of the United States nor any official in the United States has assumed the responsibility it has with Puerto Rico   Professor Lalo said   The great tragedy of the Puerto Rican people is that for 120 years  it calls Washington and no one picks up the phone  Mr  Rosselló  who is up for re election next year  has faced intense criticism on the island for trying to work cooperatively with Mr  Trump even as the president was repeatedly deriding Puerto Rican leaders Last week  the governor amped up his language against Mr  Trump  appearing to refer to him as a  bully  in an interview with CNN  If the bully gets close  I ll punch the bully in the mouth   he said   It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage  He later characterized his comments as a metaphor Mr  Trump has refrained from going after Mr  Rosselló by name  preferring to focus his attention Ms  Cruz  his political nemesis since her outspoken comments criticizing the Trump administration s failure to provide swift and meaningful help in the weeks after Hurricane Maria After Mr  Trump called Ms  Cruz  crazed and incompetent  on Twitter on Monday  she fired back  calling him  unhinged   He can huff   puff all he wants but he cannot escape the death of 3 000 on his watch   she wrote   SHAME ON YOU  Ms  Cruz recently declared her candidacy for governor  She and several other candidates are hoping to unseat Mr  Rosselló in 2020  He is a supporter of Puerto Rican statehood  she is not  When he doesn t get his way  he tries to pit people against each other   Ms  Cruz said of Mr  Trump in an interview on Tuesday   Three thousand people died under his watch and he has never acknowledged it  He s now trying to weaponize help   and  in his desperation  he s lying about it  Calling Puerto Rican leaders  corrupt  reflects poorly on Mr  Trump s own administration  she added  If he thinks that the money that has come to Puerto Rico is money that we shouldn t have received  then he doesn t trust FEMA   she said   He shows his inability to lead and that he is incapable of understanding how his own government works   

WASHINGTON   The  cooling saucer  of the United States Senate keeps going into the microwave For the third time in six years  the majority party in the Senate detonated the so called nuclear option on Wednesday to unilaterally change years old rules of the chamber with a simple majority vote  This time  to work through a backlog of President Trump s judicial and administration nominations  Republicans cut the time between ending debate and a final confirmation vote on executive branch nominees and district court judges from 30 hours to two The change was a provocative step that reignited a bitter partisan fight over presidential nominations that has raged for a decade and spanned presidencies from both parties  Democrats dwelled at length over the blockade that stopped Judge Merrick B  Garland from ascending to the Supreme Court in the final year of Barack Obama s presidency to angrily question how Republicans could complain about the handling of Mr  Trump s nominees  There s no other word but  hypocrisy    said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York  the Democratic leader The majority leader  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  justified his actions on the Garland nomination  saying Democrats would have done the same thing to a Republican Supreme Court nominee  And he said Democrats started the process in 2003  when they began routinely filibustering a Republican president s nominees Mr  McConnell s move on Wednesday was intended to break the Democratic blockade over dozens of judicial and sub cabinet nominations sent to the Senate by the Trump administration and to appease Mr  Trump  who has been badgering him to take such a step for months  We had hoped the Democrats would negotiate  but their base will roast them alive if they supported  a compromise deal unblocking Trump nominees  said Senator John Cornyn  Republican of Texas  who is a close ally of Mr  McConnell But the one party rule change   which followed maneuvers by Democrats in 2013 to end the 60 vote threshold for most judges and executive branch nominees  and by Republicans in 2017 to end the 60 vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees   knocked down another pillar of Senate custom that separated it from the majority rule House  And it took the chamber one step closer to ending the defining procedural bulwark of the Senate  the 60 vote requirement for moving ahead with most legislation  The Senate has changed so dramatically under McConnell s influence   said Senator Richard J  Durbin of Illinois  the second ranking Democrat in the upper chamber   He is corrupting the Senate into an institution that is more like the House of Lords than what the framers intended  We have walked away from amending  debating and legislating  Mr  Schumer declared it  a very sad day for the Senate  Mr  McConnell answered   This is not a sad day  this is a glad day   We know you don t like Donald Trump  but he won an election and he is entitled  to  set up  his government  he continued Under the new rules  the Senate approved the nomination of Jeffrey Kessler to be assistant secretary of commerce  It was then to approve Roy Kalman Altman to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Wednesday s rule change was not as sweeping as the 2013 move  made when Democrats controlled the chamber  to abolish the 60 vote threshold on most nominees  Nor was it as provocative as 2017  when the Republican majority extended that 51 vote confirmation threshold to the Supreme Court after Mr  McConnell spent most of 2016 blocking Judge Garland s nomination But Wednesday s precedent opens the way for Mr  McConnell to speed up the nominating process for sub cabinet level posts and Federal District Court judges  appointments that represent as many as 80 percent of administration nominees  Democrats say that by limiting the time between cutting off debate on a nominee and voting on final confirmation  the Senate loses time needed to vet nominees Senate Democrats   who have been marginalized by Mr  McConnell s hardball style of leadership   said Wednesday s move represented an attack on institutional norms put in place to ensure full debate For Mr  Trump  the change is long overdue  For more than a year the White House  spurred on by Mr  Trump and officials in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs  has prodded Mr  McConnell to invoke what has been referred to on Capitol Hill as a  mini  nuclear option But Mr  McConnell resisted  in part because of the opposition of two moderate Republicans  Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee Their opposition ebbed in recent weeks after sporadic talks overseen by Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer to unfreeze some of the nominations fell apart  Mr  Trump expressed his frustration over the logjam during his hourlong appearance at the Republicans  weekly lunch in the Capitol last week  This is crazy   he said  according to two people in the room   We have all these people  ambassadors  who have put their whole lives on hold  waiting to be confirmed A day later  Mr  McConnell  speaking at a second strategy lunch with his conference  blasted Mr  Schumer and claimed he was avoiding a compromise out of fear that he would be publicly attacked by liberals in his party He singled out Mr  Schumer s own former spokesman  Brian Fallon  who now leads a progressive coalition that lobbies against the appointment of conservative judges  Chuck won t make a deal because he s afraid of Brian Fallon   Mr  McConnell said  according to a person familiar with his remarks Mr  Fallon did not respond to a request for comment  The only thing stopping a deal is Senator Mitch McConnell  because Senator McConnell wants to change the rules   said Justin Goodman  Mr  Schumer s current spokesman Mr  Schumer has privately expressed frustration with his recent interactions with Mr  McConnell  particularly the majority leader s unwillingness to even consider a separate deal for nonjudicial appointments  In a recent leadership meeting  Mr  Schumer complained that Mr  McConnell was offering him a deal that  chopped off four fingers  as opposed to cutting off his whole hand  Senate Democratic aides said Every Senate Democrat voted against the rule change on Wednesday  Two Republican senators  Mike Lee of Utah and Ms  Collins  also opposed it  The Senate s rules protect the rights of the American people by balancing the competing interests of majorities  minorities and individual senators   Mr  Lee said The actual nominations were less controversial than the rule  and a handful of Democrats crossed the aisle to vote for Mr  Altman Mr  McConnell and Mr  Schumer  who bear no great affection for each other  engaged in an uncommonly emotional duel on the Senate floor   holding in rapt attention two dozen senators who  in near unison  deposited their iPhones on their desks or laps to watch At one point  Mr  Schumer  speaking from a prepared text  turned to confront Mr  McConnell directly  accusing the leader of abusing  the brute power of the majority  to push the change  I m sorry my Republican colleagues have gone along with Senator McConnell s debasement of the Senate   he said Mr  McConnell sat impassively at his desk a few feet away as Mr  Schumer spoke  He stared down at the carpet and fussed with his shirt cuffs  wearing a wry  mocking grin When he stood to defend himself  his face betrayed the strain  gradually reddening into a crimson blush that spanned from cheekbone to jaw  as he accused Democrats  under the leadership of  a fella named Chuck Schumer   for weaponizing the filibuster over the past 15 years  He started the whole thing   Mr  McConnell said  turning to face Mr

WASHINGTON   The Democratic head of a powerful U S  House committee asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of President Donald Trump s personal and business tax returns on Wednesday  in a long awaited move widely expected to lead to a long court battle with the White House The request  in a letter from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig  is viewed by Democrats in the House of Representatives as a vital first step toward oversight of Trump s income taxes and business network  which some lawmakers believe could be rife with conflicts of interest and potential tax law violations  It is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials  To maintain trust in our democracy  the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly  as laws intend   Neal said in a statement IRS and U S  Treasury officials were not immediately available for comment Trump defied decades of precedent as a presidential candidate by refusing to release the tax documents and has continued to keep them under wraps as president  saying his returns were  under audit  by the IRS  Trump s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recently testified in Congress that he did not believe the president was being audited but may have used the audit claim to avoid scrutiny that could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties  Trump was dismissive of the request but continued to make the audit argument in comments to reporters during a meeting with U S  military leaders on Wednesday   Is that all   the president asked when told Democrats wanted to see six years of his returns   Usually it s 10  so I guess they re giving up   he said   I ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name  you re audited  But until such time as I m not under audit  I would not be inclined to do that   Neal based his request on his committee s oversight jurisdiction of the IRS  specifically its alleged audits of Trump and the extent to which the agency has enforced the tax laws against the president  OVERSIGHT PRESSURECongressional Republicans oppose Neal s effort  saying such a move sets a dangerous precedent by turning the confidential tax documents of a U S  citizen into a political weapon  This particular request is an abuse of the tax writing committees  statutory authority and violates the intent and safeguards of     the Internal Revenue Code   Representative Kevin Brady  the committee s top Republican  said in a statement Independent analysts welcomed the move   The Ways and Means Committee s strongest oversight ability is making sure the IRS is operating properly   said Steve Rosenthal  a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank in Washington  It was the third time this week a Democratic led House committee exerted oversight pressure on Trump  Earlier on Wednesday  the House Judiciary Committee authorized its chairman to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller s full investigation report on Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed a former White House security chief on Tuesday Neal s committee initially planned to request only Trump s personal tax returns  But some Democrats and independent analysts pressed for them to include business returns to better gauge the president s activity in the private sector  The request includes returns for eight entities  Donald J Trump Revocable Trust  DJT Holdings LLC  DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC  DTTM Operations LLC  DTTM Operations Managing Member Corp  LFB Acquisition Member Corp  LFB Acquisition LLC and Trump National Golf Club A Democratic aide said the committee selected a manageable number of business entities that provide a vital window on Trump s business activity  Although Trump has never released his returns  the New York Times last year cited a  vast trove  of returns and financial records saying it showed he engaged in tax schemes including cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions of dollars in taxes  The White House called the report misleading    Reporting by David Morgan  Doina Chiacu and Alexandra Alper  Editing by Peter Cooney and G Crosse  

WASHINGTON   The U S  and China opened a ninth round of talks Wednesday  aiming to further narrow differences in an ongoing trade war that has deepened uncertainty for businesses and investors and cast a pall over the outlook for the global economy The latest negotiating session on American soil follows a similar set of talks held last week in Beijing Larry Kudlow  a top White House economic adviser  said  good headway  was made when U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met in the Chinese capital with a delegation headed by Vice Premier Liu He  a confidant of President Xi Jinping Kudlow expressed optimism that the parties would narrow the areas of disagreement further this week  They ll be here for three days  maybe more   he told reporters at a roundtable sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor Others said they ve been encouraged by the tone of the negotiations thus far Myron Brilliant  head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce  estimated Tuesday that the two sides are 90  of the way to an agreement but cautioned that  the last 10  is the hardest part  the trickiest part  At the heart of the dispute are the Trump administration s allegations that China steals technology and coerces U S  companies to hand over trade secrets   all part of Beijing s zeal to overtake U S  technological dominance  To pressure China  the United States has imposed tariffs on  250 billion in Chinese goods  The Chinese have counterpunched by taxing  110 billion in U S  imports Forecasters at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  among others  have downgraded their outlook for the global economy  partly because the U S  China rift is damaging trade and causing businesses to slow investment until they know how the dispute will end Tensions have eased somewhat since President Donald Trump and Xi met in Buenos Aires late last year and the administration ended up suspending its plans to raise tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese imports to buy time for negotiations Kudlow said the talks are covering a host of issues that the two sides  have never really covered before  and that progress was being made on all fronts   which is the assessment administration officials from Trump on down have been making publicly for weeks  We re not there yet and we hope this week we get closer   Kudlow said Analysts say two major sticking points  in particular  stand in the way of any agreement First  Trump wants to preserve at least the 25  tariffs he has imposed on  50 billion in Chinese imports as a way to maintain leverage over Beijing  China wants them lifted Second  the two sides must develop a mechanism to ensure that China honors any commitments it makes in an agreement  The administration complains that China has repeatedly failed to keep promises it made in previous trade talks The Chinese are widely expected to agree to buy substantially more American products   likely including soybeans and natural gas   to help narrow the United States  trade deficit in goods and services with China  which hit a record  379 billion last year  America s trade deficit with China has been one of Trump s chronic complaints  although many economists say a bilateral trade gap is relatively insignificant Congressional Democrats and others have warned Trump against reaching any agreement that settles for more U S  exports to China without also requiring Beijing to adopt serious economic reforms  Stand firm   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y   said Tuesday   Skip the political photo op and make good on your promise to stand up for American businesses and workers when China takes advantage  Christopher Adams  a former China specialist at the Treasury Department and the Office of the U S  Trade Representative who is a senior adviser at the Covington   Burling law firm  added   There has to be something substantive on the structural issues  Otherwise  the criticism will be severe  Whatever negotiators agree to  analysts say  they are unlikely to end the long standing tensions between America s mostly open  capitalist economy and a Chinese economy in which the Communist Party and the central government command the dominant role Even with a deal  Adams said   a lot of the underlying issues will still be with us unresolved because they re rooted in fundamental differences between the U S  and Chinese systems     Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report  

ImageAlaa Abd El Fattah speaking at a conference in Cairo in 2015  The Egyptian blogger was freed last week after five years in prison CreditNariman El Mofty Associated PressCAIRO   We woke to the news last Friday  The 37 year old software developer and pro democracy activist Alaa Abd El Fattah had finally been released from prison  after completing a five year sentence for having called for street protests in defiance of the law   Alaa is out  Yes  I swear   tweeted his sister  Mona Seif  in Arabic  Not long after  she shared a blurry photo of him  sitting on a rattan chair at their family home  playing with their dog  Next came a photo of Alaa sitting with his now seven year old son and holding the boy s little feet It wasn t Alaa s  first arrest  but his seventh  and longest  under four governments In May 2006  under the reign of President Hosni Mubarak  Alaa was arrested during a peaceful protest calling for an independent judiciary  and released six weeks later In 2011  under the transitional rule of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces  he was arrested on charges of inciting aggression during bloody clashes opposing Coptic Christian protesters and riot police and thugs  He was released after two months On the night of March 26  2013  under the rule of the Islamist President Mohamed Morsi  Alaa was accused of inciting  aggression  during a protest outside the Muslim Brotherhood s headquarters  He was arrested and released the following day Two days later  he was arrested again  charged with having set fire the previous year to the headquarters of the then presidential candidate Ahmed Shafik  He was handed a one year suspended sentence In November 2013  he was arrested yet again  for protesting  in defiance of an anti protest law  against military trials for civilians  for rioting and for attacking public servants He was released on bail in March 2014   and rearrested on the same charges that June after being sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison  During a retrial in September of that year   an obligatory procedure for defendants sentenced in absentia   Alaa was released on bail  The presiding judge stepped down mid trial saying that the prosecution had obtained evidence illegally The following February  in 2015  he was arrested again  and handed the five year sentence he just completed During one of the times that Alaa was in prison  his first child was born  during another  his father died His father was the prominent human rights lawyer Ahmed Seif El Islam Hamed  His sisters   Mona and Sanaa Seif   are both staunch activists  And his mother  Laila Soueif  is perhaps Egypt s most recognizable face of the left Of my many memories from the uprising of 2011  one of the most precious was finding Ahmed and Laila  sitting hand in hand one afternoon on a ledge in Tahrir Square  Alaa stood over them talking and laughing  a water bottle in hand  Mona and Sanaa were not far away  giving out fliers A lot has changed during the five years that Alaa was in prison  Many people we know in common have left the country  as immigrants or asylum seekers  Activists  journalists and human rights defenders have been put in jail or disappeared  Some have been released  Friends have had breakdowns  An activist couple who met in Tahrir Square have married and had their first child  But an Italian student and researcher was brutally murdered  found dead on the side of a street with torture marks   that fact lingers  The cost of living also has shot up  after the government lifted fuel subsidies and floated the Egyptian pound to save itself from debt As we lived our lives on the outside  in relative freedom  we never forgot Alaa   the hashtag  freealaa was sustained  And yet at some point we began to fail him I couldn t forget how the protests calling for Alaa s freedom started out sizable in the initial weeks  even months  of his detention  and then slowly began to shrink  I remember the day that I found myself not responding to such a call and followed the gathering on Twitter instead   on the streets  were just a handful of supporters  headed by Alaa s ever stoic mother I began to question my lack of political stamina  my will  my occasional paralysis over even writing  and was riddled with a sense of defeat  It was perhaps my guilt that caused me to work a character inspired by Alaa  Dido  into my novel  By the end of the book  Dido is in prison  and he says to his writer cousin that he doesn t blame her for not making activism her life  telling her that it doesn t take an entire population to change the course of things and that everyone has his and her own calling In a letter from 2016  Alaa wrote   I spent most of 2014 in prison yet I still had lots of words   And then  a few lines later  But by early 2015  as I heard my sentence  I had nothing left to say to any public  I could only write personal letters  The revolution and  indeed Egypt itself  would slowly fade out even from those letters  and by fall 2015  even my personal words dried up  It s been months since I wrote a letter and more than a year since I ve written an article  I have nothing to say  no hopes  no dreams  no fears  no warnings  no insights  nothing  absolutely nothing  Alaa is out of prison now  but that doesn t mean he s free  For the next five years of his life  he will be under surveillance and will have to report to a local police station every evening at six and spend his nights there I think Laila and Mona spent all of Alaa s first night out but back in sitting on the pavement outside the station  reading and waiting for him to emerge at dawn  Knowing them  they might do the same for the next five years On Saturday  the second afternoon of his partial freedom  Alaa wrote on Twitter   I am the poison  I am the antidote  I am the medicine  I am the sickness  I am the ghost of the Spring past  With the most visible face of the revolution now free  and against the backdrop of ongoing protests in Algeria  I find myself reflecting on what has gone wrong for Egypt since 2011  Our broader failing was less about what we wanted    bread  freedom and social justice    than how we thought we could get there  A national referendum to amend the Constitution looms  and it might dictate the course of the country for the next 15 years  And so it seems like it s time to regroup and devise a common political strategy  knowing that our political goals remain the same  a freer  fairer Egypt  in which we can express ourselves without fear of persecution The Times is

WASHINGTON   The House Judiciary Committee will prepare subpoenas this week seeking special counsel Robert Mueller s full Russia report as the Justice Department appears likely to miss an April 2 deadline set by Democrats for the report s release The Judiciary panel plans to vote on subpoenas Wednesday  a day after the deadline  The chairmen of several House committees asked for the full  unredacted report last week after Attorney General William Barr released a four page summary laying out the report s  principal conclusions   Barr said in a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary committees on Friday that a redacted version of the full 300 page report would be released by mid April   if not sooner  The planned committee vote  announced Monday morning  would not automatically issue subpoenas but authorize House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler  D N Y   to send them if he decides to do so  As I have made clear  Congress requires the full and complete special counsel report  without redactions  as well as access to the underlying evidence   Nadler said in a statement   Attorney General Barr has thus far indicated he will not meet the April 2 deadline set by myself and five other committee chairs  and refused to work with us to provide the full report  without redactions  to Congress  The vote comes as Democrats are escalating their battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see   a fight that could eventually end up in court  Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and will almost certainly be unhappy with the amount of information provided by Barr when the department releases the report in the coming weeks The panel will also vote Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to a number of President Donald Trump s former top advisers  including strategist Steve Bannon  Communications Director Hope Hicks  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  White House Counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson  Donaldson served as McGahn s chief of staff before both left the administration The five were key witnesses in Mueller s probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month  Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Mueller s investigation  were sent outside the White House   waiving executive privilege rights that would block document production  To this end  I have asked the committee to authorize me to issue subpoenas  if necessary  to compel the production of documents and testimony   Nadler said Nadler sent requests to 81 people connected to Trump s political and personal dealings as he launched a wide ranging investigation into possible obstruction of justice  public corruption and abuses of power Barr said in the letter Friday that he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material  in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that  would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties  Democrats say they want all of that information  even if some of it can t be disclosed to the public  They are citing precedents from previous investigations involving presidents and also information disclosed about the Russia investigation to Republicans last year when they held the House majority If the committee does issue subpoenas  the path forward is uncertain  If the administration decides to fight  lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena   a fight that could  in theory  reach the Supreme Court  Generally such disputes are instead resolved through negotiations The Democrats could also formally ask Mueller to send the Judiciary committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump  But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  backed by the majority of her caucus  has said she s not currently supportive of impeachment Barr wrote in his summary that the special counsel did not find that Trump s campaign  conspired or coordinated  with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election  He said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation  instead setting out  evidence on both sides  of the question Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter  declaring that Mueller s evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe Democrats say they want to know much more about both conclusions and they want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr Republicans have said the Democratic demands are overreach  Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not  in truth  require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department   said Georgia Rep  Doug Collins  the top Republican on the Judiciary committee  

This week it s Joe Biden s turn in the  MeToo barrel  and like many Democrats  I m torn about what to think  The allegations by Lucy Flores   that in 2014  when she was running for lieutenant governor of Nevada  the vice president touched her shoulders  and kissed the back of her head   cannot exactly be dismissed as an outlier  given that another allegation of guerrilla nuzzling followed just 72 hours later  this time from 2009   and that multiple photo montages online suggest a similar pattern And so we have another debate about male decency and respect  trying to weigh creepiness against over exuberant affection  handsiness against glad handing  all the while remembering that this is Joe Biden we re talking about  a retail politics guy from another era  known for arm grabs and bear hugs  you d see this all the time on the Senate floor   the shoulder squeezing  the close talking   He is  by nature  a physically expressive fellow  Hugs are not unfamiliar to him  and he seems to sense when people are feeling fragile  as Stephanie Carter  the wife of Ash Carter  a defense secretary under Barack Obama  wrote in an essay for Medium  noting that the  creepy Uncle Joe  photo featuring her as the recipient of a shoulder rub was quite welcome  thank you very much These gray zone allegations are of course still worth examining  But because they are salacious   because they are embodied  because we can actually see them   I wonder if we spend more time discussing them than another gray zone problem that  in my view  is far more pervasive and often less easily solved with a sharp rebuke or a complaint to human resources  not being taken seriously Because here s the truth  Some of the women I know have  MeToo stories  But most of the women I know have stories about feeling dismissed  invisible  less than What are they talking about  They re talking about seeing their ideas gain traction in a meeting only after a man has said them  Or being told after they ve asserted themselves in a meeting that they dominated it   or at the least talked too much They re talking about seeing weeks or months of work being casually dismissed by their superior after he s had a 10 minute conversation with a male colleague They re talking about being mansplained Personally  I ve been mansplained about my own book  And about Congress  which I covered on and off for 20 years  You know what didn t help  Saying Hey  I wrote a book about that  Or Hey  I started my career at The Hill They re talking about contradicting a male colleague and watching him get really mad They re talking about being called boastful when they re invoking a necessary credential They re talking about having their recollections dismissed until they re Googled They re talking about being given soft or detail oriented responsibilities while the fellas are delegated the big think They re talking about chatting with another woman and a male colleague walks by   Planning a rebellion   he asks   That  admittedly  happened early in the careers of most of the women I have talked to  Have men stopped doing that  I wonder   Maybe  Hopefully  Probably not   Many of these problems are happening in organizations with supposed enlightened politics  They can still have feudal habits Note what I m not mentioning  Ambition   pushiness  Too obvious Or the motherhood penalty Or a national policy that guarantees only three months off with a newborn  unpaid  if you re lucky enough to work for an organization to which the Family and Medical Leave Act applies Or that we have no subsidized child care  and often get looked at as if we re nuts if we ask for reimbursement for it when we work extra hours Younger women sometimes look at women of my generation   I m 49   and wonder why we may be a little wearier  a little warier  a little less noisy  But it s not  I don t think  a matter of false consciousness  or that we don t know our rights  nor is it that we re resentful about having had to swallow our own stories as we were coming of age   Even ancient infractions of a minor variety are  in this climate  the functional equivalent of a loaded gun  It s that some of the more ambiguous  MeToo experiences might seem more manageable  or maybe just more ridiculous   and certainly less insidious   than the subtler biases many of us have faced in how men think  They re about an attitude  A mind set  hiding in plain sight Sometimes the two are connected  It can be a short leap from taking physical liberties with a woman  even if they re minor  even if they re done out of sheer obliviousness  to dismissing her ideas  Both involve a certain inability to see Maybe my younger peers have been fortunate enough to see most of these behaviors melt away  But I suspect they haven t  and they  too  deserve our attention  maybe their own hashtag  I don t care what it is  just so long as they re discussed  They re common  They re powerful  They re corrosive and confidence pulverizing  They re every bit as real more on joe bidenOpinion   Ross Douthat  The Real Joe Biden DecisionApril 2  2019Opinion   Michael Tomasky  The Biden Paradox  and How to Solve ItMarch 12

This article is part of David Leonhardt s newsletter  You can sign up here to receive it each weekday Over the weekend  my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick and I went looking for articles arguing both sides of the Joe Biden question  We found numerous pieces upbraiding Biden for touching people while interacting with them  and several of them argued that his likely presidential campaign should suffer for it Finding articles making the opposite case wasn t so easy   The closest we came was a Medium essay by Stephanie Carter  whose husband served in the Obama administration with Biden   But if the media consensus this weekend was a condemnation of Biden  the reaction on Monday   both in the media and among readers   was different  It was substantially more mixed and less negative You can see some of that view in the letters that The Times received from readers   Men were acculturated to behave in ways that ignored the sensibilities of women  and that is no longer acceptable   Laura Petiford wrote   I   struggle to understand how it is helpful to render men like Mr  Biden  unfit  because of behaviors that were so deeply woven into the social fabric of this country that we are only now beginning to address them contextually   Listen to  The Argument  podcast every Thursday morning  with Ross Douthat  Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt  Susannah Sard wrote   Sometimes we need to relax   Richard Brandshaft wrote   Yet again the proverbial liberal circular firing squad   And Eileen West wrote   Joe Biden has plenty to answer for  especially his treatment of Anita Hill  Let his challengers question him on that  rather than being distracted by the media frenzy of the day  The strongest reaction I saw came from Theda Skocpol  a Harvard political scientist whom I ve quoted before in this newsletter  She has spent years studying the Tea Party  the Obama presidency and the Trump resistance  I m going to turn over most of the rest of the newsletter to her  by reprinting an email she sent me And my own view  I m still thinking it through  As I said yesterday  Biden s  handsiness  is a bit strange  I ve interviewed other politicians who touched me repeatedly during the conversation  and it was unnecessary   I hope Biden understands why the habit makes some people uncomfortable  But I m increasingly thinking that it should not become a defining issue for his likely campaign  Wait a minute Theda Skocpol writes The piling on about Joe Biden s sometimes unwanted affectionate touches by political competitors and media outlets is shameful  Both women who have come forward so far are not talking about workplace abuse or sexual misconduct  I can believe them  and still ask why they are speaking up now  One person  who has supported a political competitor to Biden  acknowledges that she is speaking because Biden is considering entering the primaries  the other says that if Biden really respects women  he should not run and clear the field for the capable women candidates  Wait a minute  Is this what gender equality really means  Is this the kind of society we want to live in   where right wingers can do any vicious thing they want to anyone and shrug it off  while people on the center left are supposed to expel from public life anyone who says a single wrong word or has done something benignly intended in the past that now does not fit changed norms  Not me  that is not the kind of America I want to live in  That is not the kind of Democratic primary I want to participate in  If Biden wants to run  I want to hear what he has to say and compare him  fair and square  to the others Biden has long been known as an emotional person who hugs just about everyone he feels positively about  male and female  Now the social mores have shifted  He needs to say he realizes this and change his behavior accordingly  Everyone else  meanwhile  needs to get a grip  Anyone who experiences an unwanted word or gesture should tell the person involved that they would like them not to say do that   not wait a decade and contact the media in an expedient moment  And Democrats must keep in mind that they need votes in 2020 from millions of older Americans who are really put off by this kind of out of context piling on  End of Skocpol s email  For more   Joe Biden needs to cut it out  And so does the mob that is after him   Karen Tumulty writes in The Washington Post My colleague Michelle Goldberg says that this is the wrong time for Biden to run and criticizes his reaction to this controversy  In response to Lucy Flores s description of his touching   Biden could have told her that he was sorry for making her uneasy  Instead  he focused on his intentions rather than her experience  a faint echo of the way he d ignored  Anita  Hill s experience decades ago  Ross Douthat argues that the episode highlights a choice Biden will need to make  Whether to run a campaign in which he is constantly apologizing  and likely losing  or trying to appeal proactively to the large group of Democrats who like him    a mix of older white Democrats  culturally moderate African Americans and Hispanics  and anti Trump suburbanites   And  yes  Michelle  Ross and I will be debating about Biden on this week s episode of  The Argument   which will be out on Thursday  If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter  you

The Trump administration s decision to cut off aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras to punish their governments for failing to curb migration is a rash response to a real policy dilemma  Cutting off aid will needlessly deepen tensions between Congress and the administration  and it will exacerbate migration from the region without twisting Central American politicians  arms  But we shouldn t pretend that the aid itself was doing much good   in fact  the best move right now would be to significantly change the way aid to Central America is structured  to push those countries to alleviate the political  economic and social pressures driving people north in the first place Immigration fueled tensions between Congress and the White House are likely to reach a new high as a result of the decision to cut off aid to Central America  The president s declaration of a state of emergency to build his wall already triggered a battle over the power to legislate  that fight will now grow to include the power of the purse  The potential cost is greater than heightened acrimony  As each side will surely dig in its heels  sensible immigration and foreign policies  such as bipartisan efforts to address the rising number of asylum seekers or to prevent Guatemala from sliding into authoritarianism  will get lost in the scuffle The decision to cut off aid is bound to drive up migration numbers  American aid to Central America has a lot of problems  Its total amounts are paltry  and it is mostly distributed inefficiently in large blocks by foreign contractors  Nonetheless  that aid is about the only outside support available to Central American governments confronting relentless poverty and violence  And some of the aid does work  There is good evidence that violence prevention assistance to El Salvador has contributed to a decrease in the homicide rate  a likely factor behind the drop in migration to the United States ImagePeople waiting at the border crossing in Nuevo Laredo  Mexico  to apply for asylum sometimes stay at this overcrowded migrant shelter for weeks  even months CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesCutting off foreign assistance is unlikely to persuade Central American governments to take actions that reduce the migratory flow  The amount of aid provided pales in comparison with revenue accrued through migrant remittances  The  500 million sent to these countries in 2017 was less than 3 percent of the money received as remittance each year  And as Venezuela has shown  the United States isn t the only source of support   Mr  Trump s aid cutoff simply opens the door for China or Russia  Governments of the region  especially of Guatemala and  to a lesser degree  of Honduras  are indifferent to the plight of their poor who migrate  Especially as these governments turn increasingly authoritarian and criminal  they are more than happy to rid their countries of real and prospective opponents  For too long  Central American governments and elites have gotten away with abdicating their fiduciary  social and legal responsibilities to their citizens  They have failed to collect tax revenue and to invest in social programs and job creation that alleviate the plight of their poor  And they have aligned themselves with vast organized criminal networks  These networks  acting either independently or in alliance with increasingly sophisticated gangs  are responsible for terrorizing community members into fleeing their countries and for transforming migration into a lucrative criminal enterprise If the Trump administration is serious about forcing the hand of Central American governments  it can t just cut off aid   an alternative policy approach is urgently required  Rather than turn a blind eye to creeping authoritarianism  it should pressure governments to become more democratic and less beholden to corrupt elites and criminal networks ImageEl Salvador s president elect  Nayib Bukele  at the Heritage Foundation in Washington in March CreditEric Baradat Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThere could not be a more opportune or urgent moment to do so  particularly in El Salvador and Guatemala  Mr  Trump should reach out to the Salvadoran president elect  Nayib Bukele  and help him make good on his campaign promise to ensure transparency by establishing a commission to investigate corruption and criminality  Timing is even more critical in Guatemala  Congress has already pushed the country s government to improve accountability by revoking the visas of corrupt public officials and business people  The administration should embrace and further these efforts  especially in the run up to elections this year  in which several factions are trying to block the candidacy of Thelma Aldana  a crusading former attorney general  for president In all of these cases  American aid can be used both as a carrot to promote reform and as a support mechanism to help politicians like Ms  Aldana achieve needed reform  As sometimes happens with this administration  Mr  Trump is half right  American aid is not working  and Central American governments need to be called to account for their mismanagement  But ending that aid will just make everything worse  Instead of being a giveaway  it needs to be structured as an incentive for domestic reform  Not only will that cut down on migration  but it will help give Central Americans what they have been longing for  a safe and prosperous region where they can imagine a future for their children Read moreOpinion articles on

A second woman on Monday accused Joseph R  Biden Jr  of touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable  intensifying the scrutiny of the former vice president s close physical interactions with women over the years as he prepares for a likely presidential bid The woman  Amy Lappos  said in an interview with The Hartford Courant that Mr  Biden  put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me  at a fund raiser in Connecticut in 2009  When he was pulling me in  I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth   she said in the interview  She said the encounter  wasn t sexual  but that there was  a line of respect   and Mr  Biden had crossed it  Joe Biden s hugs and kisses were well known in Washington  Now he faces a generational reckoning  Her allegations follow a weekend in which Mr  Biden defended himself against a similar complaint from a former Nevada assemblywoman  Lucy Flores  who said in an essay published on Friday that the former vice president had touched and kissed her inappropriately at a campaign event in 2014 In a statement late Monday that Ms  Lappos sent to The New York Times  she said she was speaking out because she was disappointed in the way Ms  Flores has been treated in the aftermath of her allegations   Uninvited affection is not okay  Objectifying women is not okay    Ms  Lappos said  Referring to this type of behavior as  simply affection  or  grandpa like  or  friendly  is ridiculously dismissive and part of the problem    she said in the statement   Saying  but Trump    is dangerous and sets the bar for Democratic men far below where it should be  Mr  Biden s team had already issued two statements trying to contain the damage  Earlier Monday  his spokesman  Bill Russo  sent a third  lengthy email to reporters criticizing what he said were misrepresentations of Mr  Biden s past behavior  and seeking to link some of the attacks on him to Republicans Mr  Russo cited an image of Mr  Biden holding the shoulders of Stephanie Carter  the wife of former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter  and another of Mr  Biden kissing the head of Senator Chris Coons s daughter  arguing that the criticism of the former vice president was rooted in inaccurate assumptions about what was occurring in the pictures Both Ms  Carter and Mr  Coons s young daughter welcomed Mr  Biden s embrace  Mr  Russo said  pointing to a Medium post Ms  Carter wrote and comments Mr  Coons made about how close his family is to the Bidens But Mr  Biden s team of advisers is preparing for more criticism about his past behavior  acknowledging that  given Mr  Biden s nearly 50 year career in politics  it s inevitable that others will come forward to say he made them feel uncomfortable Mr  Russo pointed out that much of the criticism about Mr  Biden s conduct has come from Republicans and that some of it has been manufactured entirely The aide pointed to photoshopped images  including one in which Mr  Biden is portrayed touching Ms  Carter s breast  and another cropped photo of the former vice president comforting his grandson at the funeral of his son  Beau   which he called  most galling of all    These smears and forgeries have existed in the dark recesses of the internet for a while   Mr  Russo said   To this day  right wing trolls and others continue to exploit them for their own gain   he added  warning against a  cottage industry of lies  On Monday  the Drudge Report posted a collage of Biden photographs  including one that photoshopped him standing behind a crying piccolo player in the Villanova University band  a widely shared image from the 2015 N C A A  basketball tournament Mr  Biden s advisers believe that the more the right pushes images of him  real or fake  the more it will help them persuade Democrats that Republicans are trying to derail a potential challenger who performs best in polls against President Trump  The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because the former vice president is not yet in the race But Mr  Biden s inner circle is also deeply suspicious about the timing of Ms  Flores s criticism  believing it s part of a larger effort by hostile Democrats to undermine the former vice president s candidacy before he even announces  the advisers said The aggressive response by Mr  Biden s aides represents the latest indication of what they said over the weekend  that he will not be dissuaded by the allegations from entering the presidential race The challenge for Mr  Biden now  though  is that Ms  Flores is no longer alone in speaking out In her interview with The Courant  Ms  Lappos said the encounter that made her uncomfortable occurred at a fund raiser in 2009  when she was working as a congressional aide to Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut  There s absolutely a line of decency   she told The Courant   There s a line of respect  Crossing that line is not grandfatherly  It s not cultural  It s not affection  It s sexism or misogyny  She said she  never filed a complaint  to be honest  because he was the vice president  I was a nobody  The office of Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut confirmed Monday that the event described in the Courant article took place and that Mr  Murphy  who was a congressman at the time  attended it The recent scrutiny of Mr  Biden s physical behavior began on Friday when Ms  Flores  a Democrat  published an essay in New York Magazine s The Cut  which described an encounter with Mr  Biden in 2014 that she described as mortifying In the essay  she wrote that Mr  Biden had come to a rally to help her fledgling campaign for lieutenant governor of Nevada and had come up behind her  touched her and planted  a big slow kiss  on the back of her head  Mr  Biden  in a statement Friday  said he did not believe he acted inappropriately  but pledged to listen to any accuser Since the essay published  Ms  Flores  39  has praised Mr  Biden for being willing to listen to concerns and clarify his intentions  But she has said she finds it hard to believe that Mr  Biden could not have been aware of how he made her and other women feel and has called his behavior  completely inappropriate   

WASHINGTON   Colluding with Russia  The special counsel says no  Cheating at golf  Well  that s something else From pulling a fast one on Tiger Woods to exaggerating his handicap  Donald Trump s alleged misdeeds on and around the golf course are the subject of a new book by former Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly   Commander in Cheat  How Golf Explains Trump   Reilly documents dozens of examples of underhanded golf behavior by the president  transgressions talked about by pro golfers and duffers alike  In golf  he s definitely not exonerated   Reilly told The Associated Press   There s been dozens and dozens of people that can declare him guilty of cheating  One infamous instance came in a 2017 round with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson  who is the current No  1 player in the world  The president s playing partner  Fox Sports golf analyst Brad Faxon  reported that Trump s offenses included putting down a score that didn t account for two balls he hit into the water on one hole  You ve heard so much about it  it s almost like you want to witness it so you can tell the stories   Faxon is quoted as saying No big deal  many would say  It s only a game But outside of formal tournaments  golf is a game of honor in which individual players act as their own referees  keep their own scores and assess themselves penalties for rule violations  Trump s cheating  Reilly said  motivated him to write the book Says Reilly   I don t know much about politics  but I know golf and it really offended me  not as a voter or as a citizen   just as a golfer  Reilly quotes players who accuse Trump  his caddie and Secret Service agents of regularly moving his golf balls out of difficult lies  At Winged Foot Golf Club in New York  the only non Trump property where the president is a member  Reilly writes   The caddies got so used to seeing him kick his ball back onto the fairway they came up with a nickname for him   Pele    That s the world soccer star from Brazil Sports announcer Mike Tirico says Trump once threw Tirico s golf ball off the green into a nearby bunker when they played together Some of the allegations aren t new  Boxer Oscar De La Hoya told The AP in 2016 that Trump cheated against him twice in the space of two holes   Yes  I caught him   De La Hoya said   It was unbelievable  But I guess it was his course  so it was his rules  Trump  by all accounts  is a good golfer  especially for his age  Reilly writes  But the 2 8 stroke handicap he claims is the product of manipulation  A handicap is based on a golfer s most recent 20 scores and allows players of different skill levels to compete fairly against each other  Someone with Trump s handicap typically would shoot scores about three over par  Despite making more than 150 visits to his golf courses since taking office  Trump has logged only one round in the online USGA Handicap Index   and a 96 at that Trump s love of playing belies his past criticism of President Barack Obama s regular play and his own campaign declaration that he d be so busy in the White House   I m not going to have time to go play golf   It helps to know golf  because golf explains Trump   Reilly says  The president peppers his public statements with golf metaphors  tweeting in December about the Federal Reserve   The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch   he can t putt  And Reilly contends Trump s early days on the course provide a window into his zero sum world view Trump honed his game at Cobbs Creek  a public course outside of Philadelphia  which he later described as full of  hustlers  and where he  learned about everything   Reilly describes it as the sort of course where  everybody is trying to grift you   and where Trump learned  I got to cheat them before they cheat me  Bryan Marsal  the chair of the 2020 U S  Open to be played at Winged Foot  told Reilly that Trump began one game with him as a partner by warning   You see those two guys  They cheat  See me  I cheat  And I expect you to cheat because we re going to beat those two guys today  Trump is hardly the first president accused of bending the rules at golf  Bill Clinton was infamous for his  Billigans    taking do over shots openly and without remorse  But Reilly  who s known Trump for decades and played with him for his book  Who s Your Caddy   recounts Trump s score altering and other schemes as  so brazen you almost admire it  Reilly  clearly no fan of the president  said he undertook the project because of Trump s  whopper    repeated over the course of the campaign and in the White House   that he won 18 club championships Reilly could not corroborate a single Trump victory in a club championship  and found the president s tally includes at least one in which Trump never played on the course that day  another in which he counted the inaugural round at a yet to be opened club  and 12 that were  actually senior or super senior club championships  The White House did not respond to a request for comment Reilly said he s issuing Trump a challenge to defend his reputation in a match on a course that he doesn t own refereed by officials   offering  100 000 to the charity of the president s choice  Reilly  whose handicap is a 4 8  says he s confident Trump  can t cover that 2 8  No way     AP Golf Writer Doug Ferguson contributed    Follow Miller

WASHINGTON    Not any longer  And with that  a triumphant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to close the book Tuesday on a divisive Republican debate  convincing President Donald Trump to shelve plans to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election  I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters It was a rare public disclosure of private counsel from the Republican leader  And it signaled that  after two years in Trump s Washington  Republicans on Capitol Hill are figuring out how to handle the president and his impulsive swerves on policy Trump insisted Tuesday it was his idea to switch course  I wanted to delay it myself   Trump said during an event at the White House   I want to put it after the election  Facing a court deadline  Trump seized on health care last week  backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act  Trump s motivations were as political as they were legislative  He didn t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign  according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly  We re going to keep the presidency  and we ll vote in the best health care package we ve ever had   he said Speaking later Tuesday at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump said   Republicans should not run away from health care      If we stay away from that subject  we re going to lose  Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days  The president stunned Republicans last week by announcing he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  insisting the GOP could become the  party of health care   Republicans wanted no part of a do over after their failure to replace the law in 2017  Facing a revolt from the ranks  McConnell told the president he needed him to listen  according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care   namely  trying to lower prescription drug prices  But Trump s promised big  new health care bill wasn t going happen with Democrats running the House  Instead  Trump could focus on the issue during the election Several times McConnell told Trump to listen  the person said  And it worked  Trump told McConnell he  accepted  the situation and  would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign   That night  Trump tweeted as much  So we don t have a misunderstanding about that   McConnell said Tuesday Trump s shift   he tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections  when Republicans hold the Senate   win back the House    made clear that the health care debate will be left for voters to decide during the race for the White House That arrangement suits Democrats just fine  They are denouncing Trump s attempt to overturn the ACA in court and floating various health care plans  including an expansion of government funded Medicare with so called  Medicare for All   setting up a stark contrast between the parties for the campaign trail Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will  hold Americans hostage through 2020  on an issue that affects millions of people  He said that Trump  insists he has a magic plan that we can see if only the American people re elect him  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats  health care battle with Trump is  a values fight  After Trump dropped the issue on Republicans last week  many hoped it would just go away  They had no comprehensive proposal to replace the ACA law and no big plans to unveil one  Publicly and privately  Republicans tried to talk to Trump McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking  Medicare for All  proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate  according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking Rep  Mark Meadows  R N C   a Trump confidant  called shifting the debate to 2021  a very pragmatic decision   He said Tuesday that  spending quality time to develop a comprehensive strategy  would be  critical  Trump s effort to repeal former President Barack Obama s 2010 health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017 when Republicans controlled both chambers in Congress  He still blames the late Sen  John McCain for joining other senators to oppose a last ditch plan While Republicans gained Senate seats last fall  GOP senators   particularly those up for re election next year   weren t looking for another fight over the law  They saw how the issue played in 2018  when Democrats made it the cornerstone of their successful drive to win back the House Preserving health care protections  and especially for people with pre existing conditions  resonates with voters  According to AP VoteCast  a survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide  nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care at the top of a list of key issues As Democrats have blamed Republicans for trying to end the ACA  GOP backed challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts Last week  the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down  an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured In his late Monday tweets  Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that  will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America  Republicans appeared relieved that  for now  that battle will be fought during the campaign  rather than in Congress The No  2 Senate Republican  John Thune of South Dakota  said the president  has some big ideas and  to his credit  wants to solve problems   But Thune said   you run into that wall of reality   of a divided Congress with Democrats in control of the House  which requires bipartisanship  Trying to convey what the obstacles are to getting what he wants to get done in the next two years is something I think a number of our members conveyed to him   Thune said    Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman  Alan Fram

WASHINGTON   President Trump on Monday hosted about 300 guests  including convicted felons  at the White House for the  First Step Act Celebration   a party intended to bring attention to a rare piece of bipartisan legislation he passed last year  and which he plans to highlight on the campaign trail The East Room celebration capped a day of events dedicated to overhauling the criminal justice system  an issue that agencies across the government have been asked to elevate The labor secretary  Alexander Acosta  participated in a panel on work force development  Ben Carson  the secretary of Housing and Urban Development  led a session about prisoner re entry  Ivanka Trump  the president s daughter and senior adviser  weighed in at a session dealing with incarcerated women  Kim Kardashian  the reality TV star  was even invited to participate in the panels and the party  but could not attend Months after the legislation passed  and amid foreign policy blunders and a defeat on funding a wall along the southern border  Mr  Trump s administration is putting the issue front and center  As president  I pledged to work with both parties for the good of the whole nation   Mr  Trump said at the East Room gathering  pointing to the legislation as an example of bipartisan work that he said was  so important to me  But some activists who helped work on the legislation   which would expand job training and early release programs  and modify sentencing laws  including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders   have expressed concern that Mr  Trump is more attuned to the political opportunities the law offers him  rather than with ensuring it is enacted effectively Mr  Trump s budget  released last month  listed only  14 million to pay for the First Step Act s programs  The law passed in December specifically asked for  75 million a year for five years  beginning in 2019  The funding gap was first reported by The Marshall Project The Office of Management and Budget  however  noted that the bill passed after the budget had already been finalized and that there was always an understanding that funding for the First Step Act would be revisited  On Monday night  Mr  Trump said that  my administration intends to fully fund and implement this historic law   It was the line that many concerned advocates had been hoping to hear  The answer is a resounding yes  We re fully committed to doing that   Ja Ron Smith  a White House adviser who has worked extensively on putting the First Step Act in place  said in an interview  referring to the funding In a budget justification document  the Bureau of Prisons  which operates under the Justice Department  said that it had not concluded how much money would be required to put the First Step Act into effect  But it went on to say that fulfilling the law was a  priority  and that the Bureau of Prisons  budget for re entry activities  will be prioritized to fully fund the requirements of the act  The document also noted that the prison bureau planned to dedicate  147 million in the 2020 fiscal year to First Step Act related activities  which include the cost of expanding halfway housing  the cost to relocate people and  85 million for the Second Chance Act grant program  which aids states and nonprofits in reducing recidivism Despite the assurances from the president on down that the changes remain a budget priority  questions about funding have advocates on the issue concerned and keeping up public pressure  The First Step Act cannot fulfill its promise of turning federal prisons toward rehabilitation and preparing men and women to come home job ready if it is not fully funded   said Jessica Jackson Sloan  national director of  Cut50  a prisoner advocacy group that worked closely with the White House to get the legislation passed  Ms  Sloan said the group had been meeting with appropriators and talking to White House officials for months  to ensure that the proper funding is requested and appropriated  Others who have worked on the issue said it still remained to be seen whether the White House would push for full funding when it comes time to work out appropriations in a spending bill  and whether there would be an effort to make the Justice Department comply with it  I hope that the president s budget has been amended to specifically fund First Step  but there is so much that needs to be done after that   said Holly Harris  the executive director of Justice Action Network  which has worked with a bipartisan group on criminal justice overhaul efforts   We need the president to lean in hard on his allies in Congress  Ms  Harris noted that her group continued  to be skeptical  that officials at the Justice Department would prioritize the issue  It was not a priority for Jeff Sessions  the first attorney general in the Trump administration  who fought Jared Kushner  the president s son in law  on making it one  But his successor  William P  Barr  said in his confirmation hearing that he would fully carry out and support the law  Mr  Barr has also met with Mr  Kushner at the White House and understands that it is a priority for top officials  White House officials said Mr  Kushner helped persuade the president to get behind the prison reform measure last year  by assuring him that it had the backing of conservatives and that it was also popular with African American voters  whose support for the president was anemic in his 2016 campaign At a campaign rally in Grand Rapids  Mich   last week  Mr  Trump described the First Step Act as legislation that politicians had been trying to do  for so many years  He added a dig at his opposition   While we are pushing and pursuing all of these common sense policies to advance the common good for our citizens  Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism  resistance and revenge  The kickoff party on Monday offered Mr  Trump an opportunity for a photo op with the convicted felons  many of whom were African American  as his campaign advisers want him to expand his appeal beyond his base  Mr  Trump called many of the First Step Act beneficiaries up to the microphone to speak  where they grew emotional and thanked him for signing the legislation Many Democratic lawmakers and prison advocacy groups were happy to work with the Trump administration on the legislation  despite early skepticism about Mr  Trump s commitment to the issue  Some of them  like Representative Josh Gottheimer  Democrat of New Jersey  attended the event at the White House on Monday evening  and were even name checked by Mr  Trump  But what has to accompany that  obviously  is ensuring that the bill is implemented   Ms  Harris said  

WASHINGTON   How many ways can you measure the first quarter of the year  For Democratic presidential candidates  it s 300 plus events  26 states and hundreds of voter questions The Iowa caucus is still 10 months away  but the Democratic primary campaign is already an all out sprint   passing eye popping markers for campaign activity and voter engagement  Voters in Florida and Ohio may not see it  but weekends in Iowa  New Hampshire  Nevada and South Carolina   not to mention a handful of select states   are a blitz of candidate rallies and local meet and greets For some candidates the frenetic pace is the message  a way of casting themselves as tireless and willing to take every last question  Elizabeth Warren and Beto O Rourke are trying to make an ambitious schedule and accessibility part of their brands  but Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand have done their parts to keep up with several dozen events each  most in early voting states It s far from clear that the candidate who holds the most events  whether leaping onto tables or addressing big rallies  will emerge as the candidate with the most votes  Still  Democrats watching the display from a distance say the engagement  the activity and the enthusiasm bode well  Broad picture  This is incredibly good for the Democratic Party   said Jim Messina  who managed President Barack Obama s re election campaign The Democrats  contested 2008 primary and the GOP s packed 2016 field showed  that enthusiasm in primaries becomes very important in a general election   Messina said  That s because engaged backers are  more likely to do two things you need them to do  in order to win  he said  donate money and help persuade their social networks to vote For all the recent upheaval in politics  the 2020 campaign so far shows some things haven t changed  Retail campaign stops are still essential to breaking through in early voting states that will play a central role in choosing the nominee  They are  perhaps  even more important in the social media era  One live streamed rally that goes viral on social media can reach more voters than dozens of smaller events Even though no one metric can predict success  a look at the campaigns  tallies of on the ground engagement shows how some of the busiest road warriors are faring at the end of the first quarter Warren and O Rourke are logging mileage in areas their party hasn t always traveled to early on and underscoring their appetite for grassroots interaction  a style Pete Buttigieg is also cultivating  Warren took more than 200 questions from voters and O Rourke answered more than 350  according to their campaigns  first quarter estimates That s a notable feat for O Rourke  who only entered the race last month  The former Texas congressman has logged 55 first quarter events in nine states where he publicly took voter questions  according to his campaign  Gillibrand held 59 public events in eight states since launching an exploratory committee in January  according to the New York senator s campaign  Buttigieg has held 35 events in 11 states since the South Bend  Indiana  mayor started an exploratory committee that same month Minnesota Sen  Amy Klobuchar logged 36 public events in 10 states since forming her campaign in February  according to her campaign s tally California Sen  Kamala Harris has emerged as a top tier contender despite fewer public events than some opponents  clocking in with 26 public first quarter events in eight states since launching her campaign in January  according to an AP estimate  Harris  campaign said Monday night that she took more than 100 voter questions during first quarter events  where total estimated turnout has topped 37 000 Warren  a former law professor whose campaign is keeping detailed statistics  took questions at 48 events in 12 states over all three months  according to the Massachusetts senator s campaign  Her aides measure her commitment to voter engagement partly in selfies   estimating that she s taken more than 12 000 with voters so far  The tally of extra time after events is itself a strategic move  an argument that availability can win the day while other candidates spend time on the high dollar fundraisers she s sworn off Other Democrats are consciously mixing up their number and types of public events  Booker is holding a bigger kickoff of a national tour soon after holding smaller events  The New Jersey senator s campaign estimates that he has held more than 50 public events in seven states since he jumped into the race in February and taken more than 350 voter questions A handful of other candidates have lagged behind in their total number of first quarter events  Former Colorado Gov  John Hickenlooper s campaign has logged 16 events  while Washington Gov  Jay Inslee held 12 events according to an AP tally  Former housing secretary Julian Castro has held more than a dozen of his own over the first quarter All of these candidates tend to fall behind Bernie Sanders in early polling of the Democratic field  Sanders  the runner up in 2016  has held 17 major events in eight states and Washington  D C   since declaring his candidacy in early March Not all of Sanders  events   nor those of other candidates   feature the sort of real time voter questions that are a fixture of Warren s and O Rourke s appearances  But Sanders  crowds illustrate his formidable ability to engage voters on his own terms  The Vermont senator s campaign projects a total turnout of 74 000 people for all of his events so far President Donald Trump famously upended the traditional calculus of campaigning in 2016 by making fewer retail visits as he powered past more than a dozen GOP rivals  Whether anyone in the Democratic field can repeat that model remains to be seen  We want to fall in love like we did with Barack Obama   Messina said of Democratic voters   and to do that  you need to do the retail part of this  Several candidates have made a point of veering off the beaten track  hoping a stop outside the early states will earn them some extra media attention and voter good will O Rourke crossed six states in one week on his post announcement road trip  Warren has made unexpected trips to Puerto Rico and the Deep South  eager to find a way to set herself apart from the pack When the Massachusetts senator touted her  not traditional  choice to visit Alabama during a rally there last month  a voice from the audience chimed in to note that  Obama did it    Associated Press writers Juana Summers in

In the post Watergate era  most Americans have taken for granted that a president would not fire an F B I  director investigating him  or replace an attorney general for insufficient loyalty to the president s personal interests  Dangling a pardon before potential witnesses to influence their testimony  Unheard of Whatever one s feelings about the end of the Mueller investigation  the Barr letter makes one thing clear  The guardrails that were established after Watergate against these types of abuses have been smashed  We still need to see the full Mueller report  but unless corrective steps are taken  Mr  Trump and Mr  Barr will have changed  perhaps profoundly  the shape of presidential power  and in troubling ways It s therefore up to Congress and the 2020 presidential candidates to step in and harden the policies that for 40 years prevented improper political interference in law enforcement They can do this by enacting comprehensive legislation to codify rules and practices that were previously voluntary  Those who subscribe to the Barr memo view of expansive executive power might claim that such legislation would violate the Constitution  On the contrary  such legislation would help enforce it First  Congress should restrict when and how the White House intervenes in law enforcement actions  giving teeth to the norms of the post Watergate era  One model for such legislation is a reform born out of President Richard Nixon s abuse of the I R S  to target enemies  Congress made it unlawful for certain officials  including the president  to  request  directly or indirectly   any I R S  officer or employee to  in effect  weaponize a taxpayer audit  Congress could apply that approach by prohibiting a president from intervening in individual law enforcement proceedings   or at a minimum require notification when a president or members of the White House staff do so  Such a rule would have imposed an additional bar  for example  on the president trying to get the Department of Justice to block the AT T Time Warner merger in retaliation for CNN s coverage  or from trying to investigate or prosecute political opponents Second  Congress should ensure that if the president issues or even dangles pardons in an attempt to block an investigation into his own interests  legislators will receive documents regarding the underlying investigation  once it s concluded   This will both ensure accountability and deter bad faith behavior  Representative Adam Schiff s Pardon Abuse Prevention Act provides a good start  it could be supplemented to apply to so called dangled pardons and to force disclosure of discussions with pardon seekers in investigations implicating the president Third  Congress can make it harder for the government to mislead the public  A little known law called the Information Quality Act creates a requirement that federal agencies ensure the quality  objectivity  utility and integrity of information they provide to the American people  Strengthening the act so that it applies to the president would help expose disinformation and make it more difficult for presidents to take executive actions based on false  determinations  and  findings   Finally  Congress should prohibit the president from using federal law enforcement powers to interfere in an electoral campaign  Procedures designed to check some such activity exist in the United States Attorneys Manual  but that merely compiles prudential guidelines  Congress should harden these rules and expand them to cover other law enforcement agencies  such as the Department of Homeland Security   It could require a Civil Service process to approve sensitive actions around campaign season  An even stronger measure could require early stage confidential judicial approval before a law enforcement action that might impact the outcome of an election could be taken  Such reforms would make it harder for a president to abuse power   such as by timing investigations or announcements to affect a political campaign  using the security clearance process to silence critics  sending immigration authorities to polling places or intervening in Secret Service activities to protect candidates and events Campaign season shouldn t bring government to a halt  and law enforcement shouldn t ignore actual wrongdoing in an electoral context  But given the abuses we ve seen in the past two years and others that might easily take place in the future  we ignore additional protections at our peril Some of these ideas already have bipartisan support  Clear statements by Congress implementing constitutional principles would also provide standards by which courts and the American people could judge the president s conduct The Constitution commands that the president  take care that the laws be faithfully executed   At its core  this commands the president to act in good faith  The founders thought this directive was so important they put it in the Constitution not once but twice  in the  take care  clause and the president s oath As the founders understood  the only reason We the People would delegate sovereignty to elected officials is if we were assured they would exercise that power in the public interest  If our legal system were to approve of the president exercising that power instead to protect his own interests  as the Barr letter does  we may find that our democratic experiment won t extend much longer Ian Bassin   ianbassin  and Justin Florence   justingflorence  are co founders of the

 Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan have looked for judges and justices who could be counted on to oppose the right to abortion  To a startling degree  the fruits of that effort are apparent in the cases now making their way to the Supreme Court   writes Linda Greenhouse in her column  The Flood of Court Cases That Threaten Abortion  Readers shared their perspectives in the comments and Ms  Greenhouse responded to some of them  A selection of those comments and her replies follow  They have been edited for length and clarity    Rachel L  Harris and Lisa Tarchak  senior editorial assistantsWe Had All Better Pay Attention Now  Southwest  Strange how we just take it for granted that our judiciary is partisan  The founding fathers and the Constitution they left for us specifically say that the judiciary is nonpartisan  Yet the Republican Party has been fighting tooth and nail for 40 years to turn our judiciary Republican Linda Greenhouse  In fairness  the Constitution doesn t say the judiciary is nonpartisan and there have been partisan battles over the courts from the very beginning  What we re seeing now  as you suggest  are the fruits of decades of laserlike focus on the courts by one party  and a kind of laissez faire attitude by the other   an asymmetry of intentionality  you might say  that s brought us to where we are today Mor  California  The most outrageous of these abortion laws is the one from Indiana  outlawing abortion of defective fetuses  A fetus  whether defective or not  does not know it exists  Aborting it will prevent untold suffering for the resulting child and its family  So what is the point of this law apart from gratuitous cruelty L G   Laws like this one  giving the state the power to decide whether a woman has the  right  reason for deciding to terminate a pregnancy  not only infantilize women but act to further stigmatize abortion as baby killing and to cover the woman with moral opprobrium  That is their real purpose  It seems to me that if the government of Indiana  so eager to criminalize what it cleverly labels discrimination abortions  was actually willing to help families cope with children who need intensive  lifelong care  it would be possible to imagine having a different conversation  It was the former representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts who famously said that from the point of view of such conservatives   Life begins at conception and ends at birth  John Quinn  Virginia   The real question here is the application of federalism  Some states   New York  California  Massachusetts  Washington  Virginia  Oregon and Colorado   will have laws that allow for unrestricted abortion rights  Other states  like Texas and Louisiana  will restrict or prohibit abortions  This is no different than some states having liquor monopolies  Virginia and Pennsylvania  and some states allowing liquor to be sold by anyone with a license  California and Kentucky   The application of federalism will not end or prohibit abortion  but only allow abortion in states where the practice has significant public support L G   Your comment reflects a misunderstanding of federalism  which does not mean that states are simply free to disregard constitutional rights   Not that the right to buy a beer is in any way equivalent to the right to terminate a pregnancy   but for your information  the 21st Amendment  which repealed Prohibition  explicitly gives the states the right to regulate alcohol sales   Every state has its own constitution  which can protect rights more but not less generously than the federal Constitution does  For instance  the right to same sex marriage was recognized by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts under the Massachusetts Constitution a decade before the Supreme Court issued the Obergefell decision  which interpreted the United States Constitution to do the same thing  States aren t free to declare   but not in our state

reflects contemporary politics and culture  To imply otherwise elevates judges and justices  while at the same time denigrating the democratic process L G   You re absolutely right   constitutional values are born outside the courts  and can die there as well  There are several names for this process in the academic literature   constitutional culture  or  in a phrase coined by Prof  Lani Guinier of Harvard Law School   demosprudence   jurisprudence that comes from and speaks to the people  Nothing in my column denies this  To the contrary  I m talking about the actions of judges propelled to the courts through the actions of social movements on our politics  That process continues  It will never stop B  Moschner  San Antonio  Texas will suffer if Roe is found to be unconstitutional  even in increments  There is no way our state will legislate abortion at any stage  However  I suspect that these courts will be strategic and slow at chipping away at these rights  Eventually  red states will no longer have clinics offering abortions  The women with means will be able to travel across state lines to a progressive state for the procedure  but the poor women who cannot care for a third or fourth child will be helpless to do the same L G   Yes  you re right  that is the plan  There are some states now with only one or two abortion providers  and women have to travel hundreds of miles and jump through multiple regulatory hoops to exercise their constitutional right  Under the Texas law that the Supreme Court overturned in its 2016 decision  Whole Woman s Health v  Hellerstedt  there would have been no abortion provider between San Antonio and El Paso  a distance of more than 500 miles  and Texas was O K  with that  Further  it s low income women who get most of the abortions these days  since women with higher incomes are able to avail themselves of reliable  long lasting  and expensive  contraception  Readers interested in facts and figures about abortion should look at the statistical picture from the authoritative Guttmacher Institute Catracho  Maine  A legitimate religious objection to my tax dollars going to fund warfare  bombing of children and other life destroying military activities  putting children in cages after separating them from their parents or denying health care protections to children and others should be given the same weight as an equally legitimate religious objection to abortion or even abortion counseling  The courts should affirm this moral equivalence and as a country we can act accordingly L G   Yes  agreed  And to make your comment more specific to the issue at hand  there are more and more  conscience  based opt outs being created by the federal and state governments  Employers that don t like birth control don t have to include it in the employee health plan  under a newly issued Trump administration regulation that s being challenged in court  and some states allow pharmacists not to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception if they disapprove of the product  But what about those of us whose conscience would require such products and procedures to be available for the good of society  Our voices are not part of this conversation Mark Stave  Baltimore  As a public interest attorney representing abused and neglected children  I have no difficulty in understanding Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati  I have watched as our Maryland circuit court judges trim their rulings to more clearly align themselves with the tendencies of the state s Court of Appeals  When the higher court leaned toward the rights of children to be free of abuse  they ruled that way more often  When they shifted away from children  toward parents  rights to raise children however they saw fit  the judges leaned that way  Judge Sutton sees the way the circuits and the Supreme Court are headed  and he changes accordingly L G   I have enough regard for Judge Sutton to assume that he called this issue the way he saw it   that because doctors have no  right  to provide abortions  they can t be heard to complain when the state tries to force them to give up their ability to provide abortions in order to continue receiving an unrelated benefit  There is some internal logic to this argument but it flies in the face of 40 plus years of common sense precedent that holds that doctors stand in the shoes of their patients  who would not otherwise be able to get into court to assert the rights that they indisputably have  Gerard  Pennsylvania  The real question is whether the government should enforce the consequence of one opinion  There are strong convictions on both sides of this issue  and it is appropriate to debate whether abortion is morally right or wrong  But it goes against the principles of freedom and liberty to enact laws to enforce one view on every individual  We should defend an individual s choice  lest one day our choices on other matters may be reduced by the convictions of others L G   Personal choice  absolutely  The best bumper sticker I ve ever seen read   Opposed to abortion  Don t have one   But if you mean that we should be able to exercise personal choice not to obey laws of general applicability   anti discrimination laws  for example   you lose me there  so I m assuming that s not what you mean Wysiwyg  U S A   Once again  I am reminded of Kamala Harris s question during the hearing on Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court   Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body  Equality and equity in legal decisions are the significant issues here  To allow judges to inject their personal beliefs into making such decisions is contrary to the Constitution s tenets on its face L G   Yes  and it was a great comment by Senator Harris  But I don t actually think that judges  for the most part  believe they are injecting their personal views into their jurisprudence  They believe they are acting as judges  But as Justice Sonia Sotomayor said years ago  in the  wise Latina  speech that she was so unfairly slammed for   we are all the product of our life experiences  The challenge for a judge is to recognize that fact and do the hard work of setting aside the prejudices and preconceptions they bring to the table as people  As an aside  that is not the challenge that faces an opinion columnist  I m always amused by reader comments that accuse me of having an opinion  An opinion column without an

WASHINGTON   During his presidential campaign  Donald J  Trump often complained about how President Barack Obama drew red lines that he never enforced  and how a diminished America let Russia walk into Syria unchallenged  something he said would not happen if the Russian leader respected the United States president Now  in Venezuela  President Trump is facing his own red line moment   again  with Vladimir V  Putin of Russia For the past week  the Trump administration has  escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country  claiming that Moscow is helping to prop up President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and undermining the hopes of American officials that the Venezuelan military will oust him  The United States has been trying to rally the world behind Juan Guaidó  the opposition leader  as Venezuela s legal interim president On Monday morning  speaking at the Army War College in Carlisle  Pa   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said flatly   Russia s got to leave Venezuela  That followed a statement on Friday by John R  Bolton  Mr  Trump s national security adviser  who said that the arrival of roughly 100 Russian military  advisers  in the country  along with new arms  posed  a direct threat to international peace and security in the region   Mr  Bolton also warned that no country should enter the Western Hemisphere  with the intent of establishing or expanding military operations  Such declarations seem to set up a test  Would Venezuela be the place where Mr  Trump  who has often seemed willing to tolerate Mr  Putin s most audacious provocations  finally draws his own red line  And  if so  does he have a plan to enforce it It is notable that Mr  Bolton  not Mr  Trump himself  made the Friday announcement  with its echoes of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine  the first time the United States issued similar warnings telling foreign powers not to intervene in the Western Hemisphere  In offering the unvarnished declaration on Monday   and while Mr  Trump focuses on the southern border   Mr  Pompeo said he was merely repeating the president s sentiments on Venezuela Yet Mr  Maduro is digging in   despite the economic sanctions against his government and the recognition of Mr  Guaidó as interim president by the United States and more than 50 other nations  And Mr  Putin may well see an opportunity to replay Syria in Venezuela  propping up another leader that many American officials said had to go   Mr  Maduro instead of President Bashar al Assad of Syria  this time   and frustrating Washington s regional goals The administration so far has been quite cautious when it comes to threatening military action in Venezuela  While there have been ritual reminders that  all options are on the table   there is no indication that any military intervention   which has a long and unhappy history in Latin America   is being seriously contemplated Instead  the administration is beginning to talk about an extended battle of attrition  After the Maduro government declared last week that Mr  Guaidó could not hold public office for 15 years  Elliott Abrams  the State Department s special representative for Venezuela and a veteran of many Cold War battles in Latin America  told reporters   I don t imagine that Juan Guaidó is deeply worried because the Maduro regime  while it might be around in 15 days  is not going to be around in 15 years   Why is Russia helping Venezuela  He then talked about tightening sanctions on oil sales  dismissed Russian accusations that the United States was trying to mount a coup against Mr  Maduro and warned that it  would be a mistake for the Russians to think they have a free hand here   they don t   But he carefully avoided explaining why Mr  Putin might feel under constraint ImageA Russian military plane recently arrived in Venezuela  The Trump administration has escalated its warnings about Russian intervention in the country CreditYuri Cortez Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Putin has plenty of reasons for keeping Mr  Maduro in power  Russia is also focused on recovering billions of dollars in debt that Mr  Maduro owes it  some of which is being paid back in oil  Full repayment may never happen For Mr  Trump  this is the newest iteration of his many Russia problems   and the latest example of his reticence to talk publicly about Moscow s malign influence around the world  His silence is jarring  since Mr  Bolton  Mr  Pompeo and Gen  Joseph F  Dunford Jr   the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  talk about it almost every week They have all embraced the administration s year old national security strategy  which recognizes that a resumption of great power competition  not terrorism  is the primary challenge facing the United States today  Mr  Trump s former aides say  however  that he never read the full national security strategy  and they note that when he does talk about it  he almost never discusses Russia s behavior Perhaps that is a reaction to the enormous  bipartisan criticism he received after his seemingly deferential approach to Mr  Putin in Helsinki  Finland  last summer  when Mr  Trump once again appeared to be convinced by the Russian leader s denials that he had interfered with the 2016 United States presidential election Or perhaps it is rooted  as one of Mr  Trump s aides suggested recently  in a desire not to create the kind of public sound bites that Mr  Obama did   and that he came to regret It was Mr  Obama who declared in August 2011 that  for the sake of the Syrian people  the time has come for President Assad to step aside   And it was Mr  Obama who warned that  the use of chemical weapons is a game changer   then elected  once the chemical weapons were employed  to pull back from military action  Just a year ago  Mr  Trump was still citing that decision  declaring in a tweet that  if President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line in The Sand  the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago  The president is not alone in his critique of how the Obama administration handled Syria  One of the most thoughtful analyses of what went wrong came from William J  Burns  Mr  Obama s deputy secretary of state  in his new book on American diplomacy   The Back Channel   It is rife with warnings that could also apply to Venezuela Mr  Burns agreed with what he called Mr  Obama s  long game  calculus   which included  having the discipline to avoid getting sucked into another military entanglement in the Middle East  which would likely only underscore the limits of our influence in a world of predators for whom Syria s battles were existential  But he admitted that the Obama  short game  was lacking because  we misaligned ends and means  promising too much  on the one hand   declaring  Assad must go  and setting  red lines    and applying tactical tools too grudgingly and incrementally  on the other  Reached in London over the weekend  Mr  Burns praised the Trump administration for avoiding military entanglements that are bound to raise cries of American imperialism  even among Mr  Maduro s greatest opponents  But he said it was at risk of repeating some of the Obama administration s mistakes  The focus on building political and economic pressure is sensible   he said  And he noted that the geographic distance between Russia and Venezuela limited Mr  Putin s ability to affect events   Proximity matters   he said   They don t have a way to project their power in ways they demonstrably did in Syria  As a result  much hinges on Mr  Trump s ability to build a hemispheric coalition  a move that is being undermined  Mr  Burns argued  by the tension with Mexico  especially with Mr  Trump s recent threats to close the border and to end assistance to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras Mr  Maduro  too  may be learning some lessons from Mr  Assad  he said   As long as you control the guys with the guns  even the most unpopular and deeply repressive regimes have the capacity to hang on a lot longer than we might assume   

WASHINGTON   President Trump acknowledged Tuesday that closing the southern border with Mexico could damage the United States economy  but said protecting America s security was more important than trade In remarks from the Oval Office  Mr  Trump reiterated his threat to shut the border if Mexico  America s third largest trading partner  cannot restrict a flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States  But the president s economic team  concerned about the damage from such a move  said it was looking for ways to limit the fallout if Mr  Trump does do so  Sure  it s going to have a negative impact on the economy   Mr  Trump said  adding   but security is most important   Security is more important to me than trade   he said Republican lawmakers  economists and business groups largely disagree with that assessment and warned this week that closing the border could cripple the flow of goods and workers and devastate American automakers and farmers  as well as other industries that depend on Mexico for sales and goods  Closing down the border would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country   Senator Mitch McConnell  Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  said in an interview   I would hope that we would not be doing that sort of thing  Mark Zandi  the chief economist at Moody s Analytics  said that  a full shutdown of the U S  Mexican border of more than several weeks would be the fodder for recessions in both Mexico and the U S  Mr  Trump s economic advisers have briefed him on the potential financial damage from a border shutdown and started looking for ways to mitigate it  including possibly keeping certain trading avenues open Larry Kudlow  the director of the National Economic Council  said Tuesday in a brief interview that the Trump administration was trying to secure the border without harming the economy  The question is   he said   can we deal with that and not have any economic damage  I think the answer is we can  People are looking at different options  Mr  Kudlow added that the administration was  looking for ways to allow the freight passage   some people call it truck roads   There are ways you can do that  which would ameliorate the breakdown in supply chains   he said But business leaders say there is no way to contain the damage from even a partial shutdown of the 2 000 mile border that the United States shares with Mexico  Nearly  1 7 billion of goods and services flow across the border daily  as well as nearly a half million legal workers  students  shoppers and tourists  the U S  Chamber of Commerce said Monday On Tuesday  officials with the chamber called a partial border shutdown  uncharted territory  and said such a policy would have negative economic consequences  particularly for communities along the border  We don t know whether that is feasible or not   said Neil Bradley  the chamber s executive vice president and chief policy officer Even if it is possible  a partial shutdown would still cause significant disruptions for industries that are highly integrated across the border  including automobiles  machinery and electronic equipment  The North American auto industry will be crippled  in a week  Kristin Dziczek  a vice president for the Center for Automotive Research  an industry research group  said in a tweet Mr  Trump s pledge to close the border comes in response to what officials with the Department of Homeland Security say is an increase in migrant families who are flooding America s immigration system  leading to overflowing detention centers and mass releases of migrants The president told reporters that if Mexico cannot restrict the flow of asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States  and if Congress cannot agree to several immigration restrictions that Mr  Trump has long pushed for   the border is going to be closed  While 76 000 migrants crossed the border in February  that number is nowhere near the migration levels seen in the early 2000s  And a majority of the migrants crossing the border now are Central American families looking for asylum  as opposed to Mexican individuals looking for work  Homeland security officials could quickly deport Mexican individuals seeking employment  but  by law  they cannot swiftly deport Central American families or unaccompanied children Homeland security officials have said they expect the number of crossings to surpass 100 000 this month  And a senior department official said those traveling in and out of ports of entry were already feeling an effect  There was a three hour wait at the port of entry in Brownsville  Tex   according to the official  and there were around 150 trucks backed up and waiting to cross at Otay Mesa  in California On Monday  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  said she would divert up to 750 border patrol officials from ports of entry to areas in between the ports to handle large groups of migrants crossing the border  A senior homeland security official also said the administration could start closing traffic lanes at the ports  The crisis at our border is worsening   Ms  Nielsen said   and D H S  will do everything in its power to end it  Senator Lindsey Graham  Republican of South Carolina and one of Mr  Trump s external advisers  has been urging the president to ease off the threat  On Tuesday  Mr  Graham portrayed Mr  Trump s latest broadside as less an eventuality and more a calculated bargaining position  You are taking a bad problem and  by closing the ports of entry  you are creating another problem   he said during an interview   To the extent that he wants to redeploy resources to the points of entry to deal with the ungoverned spaces   that will create economic upheaval  but that will hopefully lead to a solution  Border activity makes up a relatively larger share of Mexico s economy than the United States   meaning Mexico would most likely have more economic damage from a border closing  Mr  Zandi said But that does not mean the United States would be in a winning position  Communities across the country would probably see supply chain disruptions  product shortages  seizures in stock and bond markets and a plunge in already fragile business confidence  Mr  Zandi said  The disruption would be especially sharp in the border states of California  Arizona  New Mexico and Texas  which all have Mexico as their No  1 export market Any closure could have far ranging implications for a wide range of industries   including automotive  electronics and apparel   that source small components and deliver their products on a just in time basis on both sides of the border It could also be devastating for the agriculture industry  Since the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994  American farmers have moved toward specializing in corn  soybeans  chicken  dairy  pork and beef to supply to Mexico  while Mexican farmers have specialized in fresh fruits and vegetables to send to the United States  Any delays in deliveries of these products could lead to near immediate price hikes and empty supermarket shelves  which would hit low income Mexicans and Americans the hardest Christin Fernandez  the vice president for communications at the Retail Industry Leaders Association  said that slowing or halting screenings at major ports near the border would lead to product delays and potentially higher shipping costs  The entire retail ecosystem is sustained on the expectation that America s retailers can provide consumers with the goods they want and need  when they need it  at the best possible prices   Ms  Fernandez said   If our suppliers are feeling the pain  retailers will feel the pain  and  ultimately  it is consumers that will bear the burden  Stock markets do not appear to be pricing in any risk of a border closure  The S P 500 was essentially unchanged on Tuesday  and it remains near a six month high  

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has faced its greatest challenge in a generation as officials have struggled to modernize New York City s failing subway  Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo has responded by promising bold solutions to fix the troubled agency and regain the trust of angry riders But here are the changes Mr  Cuomo and state lawmakers unveiled this week as part of the new state budget  A reorganization plan due in June  a  forensic audit  of train cars and signals  a group of outside experts who will review major projects and a  debarment process  that would ban contractors who do not finish projects on time And even though state leaders have vowed more transparency  the authority s new chairman   among the most powerful positions in New York government   was confirmed by the State Senate around 2 a m  on Monday when most New Yorkers were asleep Transit advocates have praised Mr  Cuomo for persuading state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing  which will raise billions of dollars for the subway by establishing tolls to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan  But they were less enthusiastic about his changes at the transit agency  which appear to be more of a bureaucratic reshuffling than a radical transformation Many New Yorkers view the authority  the nation s largest transit agency  which oversees more than 70 000 employees  as inept   if not corrupt  The authority s construction projects are routinely late and over budget   as high as seven times as costly as elsewhere in the world The authority s new chairman  Patrick J  Foye  was approved by the State Senate in the dead of night after hastily called hearings on Sunday  leaving virtually no chance for any significant public input  This is just a wildly bad start at real M T A  reform   said Benjamin Kabak  a transit advocate who runs the Second Ave  Sagas website Mr  Cuomo  a Democrat in his third term  defended the timing  saying that Mr  Foye s appointment was part of the budget deal  which included both congestion pricing and changes at the transportation authority  I said unless we have a management reform plan  I m not going to approve more money   Mr  Cuomo said in a radio interview on Tuesday His budget director  Robert Mujica  said in an interview that new rules would make the authority s board more accountable to the public and the M T A  leadership team understood the urgency of overhauling how it does business  You have a management team now that recognizes what the failures are and recognizes that there has to be a significant cultural change   Mr  Mujica said But Richard Ravitch  a former M T A  chairman credited with turning the subway around in the 1980s when it was plagued by delays and crime  said he was concerned about new rules allowing M T A  board members to serve only while the person who appointed them was in office  The board s members need to be more independent to make tough decisions for the system  he said  instead of acting like political appointees Image I said unless we have a management reform plan  I m not going to approve more money   Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo said in a radio interview on Tuesday CreditPeter Morgan Associated Press This certainly gives the governor more power   Mr  Ravitch said of the reforms John Kaehny  executive director of Reinvent Albany  a watchdog group  said the changes did not address the agency s politicization under Mr  Cuomo  who has been accused of micromanaging the system  Mr  Cuomo has at times prioritized aesthetics  like the appearance of subway stations  over the nuts and bolts of maintenance  The thing at the top of everyone s list is to hire good transit managers and let them do their jobs   Mr  Kaehny said   It may seem obvious  but that s one of the crucial problems  Maria Doulis  a vice president at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission  said the changes did not address the costs of an upcoming union contract for subway workers or improving work rules to reduce costs  The union  Transport Workers Union Local 100  is a close ally of Mr  Cuomo  Increasing the productivity of the work force to be able to perform the work more cost effectively is essential to the success of the M T A    she said   I don t see that part here  The legislation did expand the use of  design build   a construction approach favored by Mr  Cuomo that bundles together the design and construction phases of a project instead of carrying them out separately Mayor Bill de Blasio  a frequent adversary of Mr  Cuomo  said on Monday that he supported the M T A  reforms  even though some say the congestion pricing plan gave away control of city streets to the state  The final plan on the M T A  is one I fully supported   Mr  de Blasio said in a television interview   We got the important changes and reforms we wanted to see in the name of fairness  The authority  which oversees the subway  buses and commuter railroads  had gone nearly five months without a permanent leader  Its previous chairman  Joseph J  Lhota  stepped down in November amid questions over his potential conflicts of interests and outside jobs Mr  Foye is a respected transit executive  though not exactly a revolutionary choice  He had been a top leader at the agency for the last year and a half  He is taking over at a critical time  The subway s leader  Andy Byford  has an ambitious plan to fix the subway by upgrading its signals The agency s bridges and tunnel division will oversee the rollout of the Manhattan toll plan in 2021  making New York the first city in the country to impose congestion pricing Mr  Foye told reporters on Monday that the agency had to do better and  everything is on the table  in terms of reforms  like merging procurement and legal departments at different parts of the agency   The harsh truth is we ve lost credibility with our customers and with our funders both in Albany and City Hall   he said at a news conference to discuss the congestion pricing deal At a hearing called by the Senate on Sunday afternoon that was streamed online  Mr  Foye pledged to serve as the authority s full time chairman and chief executive  without taking on outside jobs  Asked why the system had not improved since he joined the authority  Mr  Foye said the subway was getting better and now he would have full responsibility as chairman  The buck stops at my desk   Mr  Foye said  

CHICAGO   Chicago became the largest American city ever to elect a black woman as its mayor as voters on Tuesday chose Lori Lightfoot  a former prosecutor  to replace Rahm Emanuel  When she takes office in May  Ms  Lightfoot also will be the city s first openly gay mayor Ms  Lightfoot  who has never held elective office  easily won the race  overwhelming a better known  longtime politician and turning her outsider status into an asset in a city with a history of corruption and insider dealings  Ms  Lightfoot  56  beat Toni Preckwinkle  a former alderman who is president of the Cook County Board and who had for years been viewed as a highly formidable candidate for mayor  Here s what you need to know about Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago and the first openly gay mayor for the city  For Chicago  Ms  Lightfoot s win signaled a notable shift in the mood of voters and a rejection of an entrenched political culture that has more often rewarded insiders and dismissed unknowns  For many voters  the notion that someone with no political ties might become mayor of Chicago seemed an eye opening counterpoint to a decades old  often repeated mantra about this city s political order   We don t want nobody nobody sent  As Ms  Lightfoot took the stage in a downtown ballroom on Tuesday night  she acknowledged the unlikeliness of her resounding victory  in which she appeared to win all 50 of Chicago s wards   We were up against powerful interests  a powerful machine and a powerful mayor   she said   Nobody gave us much of a chance  For some of Ms  Lightfoot s supporters  the significance of her victory was monumental  going beyond a single candidate or city   Look  nothing personal  but it s not the good old boys club anymore   said Kimberly Smith  40  who was born and raised on the South Side and said she thought the election marked a turning point in Chicago politics   I feel empowered  ImageMs  Lightfoot with her daughter Vivian Lightfoot and her wife Amy Eshleman on Tuesday night CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York Times Read how Chicago became the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  and how Chicagoans feel about it  National advocates for gay rights celebrated Ms  Lightfoot s win   Now young queer women and women of color can see themselves reflected in a position of major political leadership   said Stephanie Sandberg  executive director of LPAC  an organization that works to build the political power of L G B T Q  women Ms  Lightfoot s rise was unexpected only weeks ago  when 13 other candidates were vying to run the nation s third largest city  many of them far better known   with decades of experience in Chicago politics and with dynastic names like Daley  Ms  Lightfoot is a lawyer who has served in appointed positions  including as head of the Chicago Police Board and as a leader of a task force that issued a scathing report on relations between the Chicago police and black residents  but she was not widely known around the city until recent months Ms  Lightfoot   Chicago s 56th mayor   arrives at a pivotal moment for a Democratic city that has for the past eight years been led by Mr  Emanuel  who surprised many residents when he chose not to seek re election Chicago  a city of 2 7 million residents  is wrestling with dueling realities  Tech jobs and convention business have poured into its shimmering downtown while public schools have been shuttered on the South and West Sides  and thousands of black residents have moved away  Mr  Emanuel s administration made strides to shore up the city s fiscal woes but residents have complained about mounting taxes and fees  Chicago s new mayor still must come up with an additional  1 billion in the next four years to continue pulling the city out of a pension crisis And the city says its crime problems have been improving over the past two years  recording about half as many murders this year as

Chicago  which is essentially evenly split between white  black and Latino residents  On Tuesday  though  the contest between two African American women scrambled the usual political calculus  or what one Chicagoan  Ra Joy  described as its habit of  tribal voting   in which politicians count on support from voters of their own race In February  during the most crowded mayoral primary in city history  Ms  Lightfoot and Ms  Preckwinkle topped a far larger array of candidates of various ethnicities  races and genders  removing all the others from Tuesday s runoff  That left political alignments few Chicagoans had seen before  Ms  Lightfoot pursuing white voters on the city s Northwest and Southwest Sides  both women seeking black voters from a base on the South Side that had leaned toward a different black candidate in February  parts of Chicago s North Side lakefront loaded with signs for Ms  Lightfoot Some residents said the history making nature of the election was energizing while others seemed nonchalant  perhaps partly because Chicago has seen similar milestones  In 1983  the city picked its first black mayor  Harold Washington  in a racially charged election  a term before that  in 1979  the city chose its first female mayor  Jane Byrne  It s not as shocking as it was back then  so that s wonderful progress   Kathy Byrne  the daughter of Jane Byrne  who died in 2014  said of the historic nature of this year s election   Why it s taken so long  I don t know  In many ways  the election transformed into a referendum on Chicago s political culture  known for its miserable ranking on most measures of corruption  its political machine and its habit of keeping family dynasties in power Ms  Lightfoot  who was partner at a prominent law firm  Mayer Brown  portrayed her newcomer status as a sign of strength  pledging to dismantle City Hall s old political ways and to  bring in the light   Still  her claim of being an outsider was questioned by some younger activists in the city  who pointed to her jobs in the Richard M  Daley administration and as a police oversight official during Mr  Emanuel s tenure  not to mention her role as a prosecutor ImageFor many of her supporters  Ms  Lightfoot s victory signaled a rejection of an entrenched political culture that has more often rewarded insiders and dismissed unknowns CreditJoshua Lott ReutersMs  Preckwinkle  the longtime Cook County board president  had tried to cast her experience as essential for managing a city the size of Chicago  while simultaneously reminding voters that she had   when she was first elected as an alderman years ago   regularly bucked the political establishment But as the election season played out  impatience over political corruption seemed to intensify among voters  in part because a major corruption scandal was unfolding at City Hall  Federal authorities have accused the City Council s longest serving alderman  Ed Burke  of running an old school shakedown  even as the local news media reported that a second alderman had cooperated with the authorities  secretly recording his conversations at City Hall for months Of the city s 50 aldermen  15 seats were up for runoff elections on Tuesday  Mr  Burke  who has denied any wrongdoing  won re election to another term in February  winning a margin large enough to avoid a runoff Rarely does this city get new  unexpected mayors  So Chicagoans watched with curiosity and uncertainty about what a Lightfoot administration would truly look like  Ms  Lightfoot has portrayed herself as a progressive  who promised to usher in a new era of accountability and transparency at City Hall  At times  she seemed to be running against Chicago politics in the public imagination  A television ad used an image of a smoke filled room and spoke darkly of the  Chicago machine  Ms  Lightfoot has spoken frequently of equity and inclusion  of redistributing city funds to spread the prosperity of downtown and the North Side to neighborhoods that have been neglected  It s unacceptable  the condition of our communities on the South and West Sides   she said during the campaign   The only way we are going to carve a new path for the city  to take us in a direction that our communities don t continue to be resource starved  is to vote for change  ImageMs  Lightfoot greeted residents on the South Side on

staggering bills have not been comprehensive Ms  Lightfoot has said that she will help the city meet its financial commitments by legalizing recreational marijuana and building a casino in Chicago

driven more by their perceptions about politics than about policy  Ms  Lightfoot  her supporters said  offered the promise of a new order and a rejection of the politics of a generation ago  It s because of Chicago   Deepti Pareenja  37  said  after casting her ballot on the city s Northwest Side for Ms  Lightfoot   We have a history of corruption with people who ve been ingrained in politics

KIEV  Ukraine   A young television comic and novice candidate trounced Ukraine s political elite in the first round of the presidential election  official results showed Monday   a stinging rebuke by an electorate tired of the lack of change in a country dominated by rich businessmen With the initial vote tally nearly complete  results released by the Central Electoral Committee showed that Volodymyr Zelensky  41  who is famous for playing a schoolteacher accidentally vaulted into the presidency  leading the field with more than 30 percent  He received 5 2 million votes  almost double the number of his nearest competitor  President Petro O  Poroshenko  who had just under 16 percent Yulia V  Tymoshenko  a former prime minister who has run for president twice before  came in third with more than 13 percent  The turnout was more than 63 percent in an electorate of 30 million  the electoral commission said Since no candidate garnered more than 50 percent of the vote  Mr  Zelensky and the apparent second place finisher  Mr  Poroshenko  will face each other in a runoff in three weeks  on April 21 As soon as the polls closed on Sunday and exit polls indicated that there would be a runoff  the two leading candidates began bashing each other Mr  Zelensky presented himself as an insurgent facing a tired old guard that had refused to take him seriously  He walloped a field of 38 other candidates representing different political blocs in Ukraine  most of whom attracted only small fractions of the vote ImageYulia Tymoshenko after a news conference in her election headquarters in Kiev on Monday CreditOleg Petrasyuk EPA  via ShutterstockA Zelensky adviser described the outcome as the culmination of a series of uprisings in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014 that succeeded in overthrowing governments but failed to break the grip of the oligarchs who control economic and political life  as well as the media  This is a struggle so that the political system finally starts working not for its own benefit  but for the benefit of the people   said Dmitri Razumkov  a political consultant for Mr  Zelensky   Despite two revolutions  nothing has changed in our country  Mr  Zelensky has been vague about what he would do as president  and at one point tried to crowdsource his program by suggesting that supporters contribute thoughts via social media  Voters might demand more in the second round There have also been suspicions that he is a front for Ihor V  Kolomoisky  a Ukrainian tycoon who fled to Israel amid a banking scandal  Both men have denied any secret pact Mr  Poroshenko  53  conceded on Sunday night that he had lost the confidence of young voters weary over the slow pace of change and the continuing economic woes  But he said that the time for joking was over and that Ukraine needed a leader who could confront both its socioeconomic problems and  more important  the conflict with Russia The election will help determine the course of the country that has become the European fault line in renewed global tensions between Russia and the West  The war for control of the Donbass  the regions in eastern Ukraine where government forces are fighting Russian backed separatists  has claimed 13 000 lives and displaced millions since 2014 In a sign of the deep rift with Russia  the main rivalry in the presidential race was not  unlike a decade ago  between pro Russian and pro Western factions  The leading ally of Russia this time  Yuriy Boyko  was in fourth place  with over 11 percent of the vote ImagePresident Petro O  Poroshenko came in second in the first round of voting CreditReutersMr  Poroshenko faces an uphill battle in a runoff  political analysts said  not least because he remains one of the wealthiest men in Ukraine  His wealth comes from his chocolate empire  and he did not fulfill a 2014 campaign promise to sell his business  Various businessmen close to him have been caught up in scandals involving corruption The president continued to grow richer as ordinary Ukrainians suffered from low wages and unemployment  noted Volodymr Fesenko  a political analyst The election outcome echoes a global trend of tossing out established political leaders in favor of candidates who promise a complete national overhaul  Mr  Fesenko and other analysts said  The victory of Zelensky is a protest against the old elites and the request for radical political change  a radical update   said Mr  Fesenko  chairman of a think tank called the  Center for Applied Political Studies  It is not so much love for the comedian as  the expectation that he can become a catalyst for change   he said Ukrainians seem less enamored of their leaders all the time  A mere 9 percent voiced confidence in the government  and 91 percent see it as corrupt  according to a Gallup poll conducted in March In Russia  Dmitri S  Peskov  the spokesman for President Vladimir V  Putin  declined to comment on the first round voting results  Russia s main interest is seeing a candidate prevail who will work toward a gradual settlement of the conflict in Donbass  he said Other Russian political leaders and the state run media tried to present the Ukrainian election as a farce and a rebuke to the idea that a political uprising like that in Ukraine in 2014 could force change  Rossiyskaya Gazeta  the government newspaper  said there were signs of  massive violations and falsifications in these elections   the dirtiest and most dishonest in the history of Ukraine  The Russian reports and commentary ignored the widespread perception that the election in Ukraine was democratic  with a real choice and an outcome that was not preordained   unlike elections in Russia  Only minor election law violations have been reported thus far  

WASHINGTON   At the heart of President Trump s negotiations with China is a troubling contradiction  The United States wants to use the trade talks to encourage the country to adopt a more market oriented economy  But a key element of a prospective deal may end up reinforcing the economic power of the Chinese state Negotiators are still working out deal terms  but any agreement seems certain to involve China s promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods  For Mr  Trump  this is an essential element that will help reduce the United States  record trade deficit with China and bolster farmers and other constituencies hurt by his trade war But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state  and most will be carried out by state controlled Chinese businesses  further cementing Beijing s role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese  It seems like those types of really simplistic purchasing commitment type of arrangements would actually reinforce state ownership rather than discourage it   said Rufus Yerxa  the head of the National Foreign Trade Council  which represents the United States  largest exporters After months of talks  the two sides are inching closer to an agreement  Robert Lighthizer  Mr  Trump s top trade negotiator  and Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  discussed the remaining sticking points with their Chinese counterparts on Thursday evening and Friday in Beijing  Mr  Mnuchin wrote on Twitter on Friday that the talks had been  constructive  Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by this week  to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He  the Chinese special envoy charged with negotiating the deal  who will begin meeting with his American counterparts on Wednesday The United States and China had been looking to reach a tentative agreement by the end of Mr  Liu s visit  with a signing ceremony between Mr  Trump and President Xi Jinping of China potentially later this month But the two sides are still wrestling with two major sticking points  how an agreement will be monitored and enforced and how many of Mr  Trump s tariffs come off and when  said Myron Brilliant  executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce Mr  Brilliant said there was no question the United States and China were  in the endgame with regard to a deal   However  he said these factors were  complicating the fact that the agreement is 90 percent done at this point  To pave the way toward an agreement  China made several announcements that could benefit American companies  Last week  Chinese regulators approved JPMorgan Chase s request to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country  a change China had discussed since entering the World Trade Organization two decades ago  Chinese officials have also floated the idea of an expanded trial that would allow foreign cloud computing companies to operate more freely On Sunday evening  China s Finance Ministry issued two statements saying that Beijing would continue to suspend tariffs it imposed last year on American cars and car parts in retaliation for Mr  Trump s tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese imports  Those tariffs  which were suspended while the two sides tried to reach an agreement  were supposed to resume at the end of March  but China said it would extend the suspension indefinitely as a gesture of good will ImageChina imported more than  100 billion worth of American goods last year  including large volumes of soybeans CreditChristopher Smith for The New York TimesThe Finance Ministry said   We hope that the U S  and China will work together to step up consultations and make practical efforts toward the goal of ending trade friction  While the two sides are closer to an agreement than at any point in the past  it remains unclear how successful the Trump administration will be in achieving its key goals  The president s trade war was initiated in large part to try to reorient the Chinese economy and force it to become more open to American companies and investment  Using punishing tariffs as leverage  the Trump administration has pressed China to roll back its heavy hand in the economy  including asking Beijing to curtail subsidies to state owned firms and to end its practice of forcing foreign companies doing business in China to transfer their technology to Chinese competitors China has not readily committed to these goals  in part because such commitments are seen as infringing on China s sovereignty and undercutting the power of the Chinese state  What the Chinese have agreed to most readily is purchasing American goods  especially commodities that can fuel their economy While the final list could be different  the United States and China have discussed the purchase of products including corn  soybeans  sorghum  natural gas  oil  coal  chemicals  semiconductors and airplanes  according to people with knowledge of the talks The Trump administration views these purchases as necessary to bolster the president s support across farming and manufacturing communities hard hit by the trade war and to help narrow the gap between what China sells to the United States and what it buys  The administration has been working on various draft lists of what it wants China to purchase  according to people who have viewed them The final purchasing amount is not yet clear  In December  Mr  Mnuchin said that China had made an offer to buy more than  1 2 trillion in American goods as part of the talks  But economists and China analysts have cautioned that such a large amount could be hard for the United States to produce and export The United States exported just  120 billion of goods to China last year  With the American economy hovering near full employment  it lacks the productive capacity to raise exports by hundreds of billions of dollars in the short term  The United States could redirect some of the goods it sells to other countries to China instead  for instance diverting soybeans headed to Europe to China But a deal that would require China to buy even more from the United States is raising concerns that China could expand its leverage over the United States  If it can be negotiated by government fiat  it can be taken away by government fiat   said Kevin Book  managing director at ClearView Energy Partners  an energy focused research firm The deal could usher in a wave of new American exports if China agrees to open its markets more fully  Removing its requirements that American carmakers and financial services firms team up with a Chinese entity to do business in the country  for instance  could give those firms more ability to sell goods and services to China But in other industries  including agriculture  energy and aviation  purchases associated with a trade deal would be made directly by state controlled entities  And while that would mean greater revenues for American companies  skeptics say it could also increase the leverage that China has over the United States in the future  We are handing them the ability to coerce our companies   said Derek Scissors  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute ImageWhile China would like to buy more tech goods  one of the Trump administration s biggest fears about China is that it is leading a state sponsored effort to unseat the United States as the leading technological power CreditKin Cheung Associated PressSuch a purchasing arrangement could also provoke challenges at the World Trade Organization  which bars its members from granting special advantages or privileges to any one country  as well as directing state enterprises to purchase goods from a specific country China has already demonstrated its ability to influence commodity purchases depending on the tenor of relations  analysts said  Once trade tensions flared  China drove its purchases of American oil to nearly zero last year  Mr  Book said  After a breakthrough in talks this year  China ramped up its purchases of United States soybeans  How easy would it be for the government of China to then turn off that tap when it gets into a dispute with the U S    Mr  Yerxa asked Recent events have also raised a question over some components of the purchasing package under discussion  China had planned to buy Boeing 737 Max series planes  But the crash of a 737 Max in Ethiopia in early March  the second deadly crash of the new plane in less than five months  has thrown those plans into question Last week  China suspended the airworthiness certification for the model entirely  a move Richard Aboulafia  vice president for analysis at the Teal Group  described as  pretty aggressive   I think there s a very good chance that this is less about public safety and more about trade negotiation leverage   Mr  Aboulafia said It s also unclear how many purchases of semiconductors  the advanced components that power circuits in laptops  smartphones and other electronics  will ultimately be in the deal While China would like to buy more of the advanced technology  the Trump administration is concerned about allowing Beijing to gain an upper hand in the next generation of technology  The administration has pushed China to roll back its Made in China 2025 campaign  an industrial plan that pumps state money into building cutting edge industries  like advanced manufacturing and aviation China had proposed last year to purchase  200 billion of American semiconductors  according to people with knowledge of the deal  Beijing wanted to buy the semiconductors straight from fabrication lines at American factories and then do the necessary packaging and testing in China  The United States rejected that idea  The two sides have since discussed a smaller number  but it is not clear now how many semiconductor purchases will ultimately be included in a deal The semiconductor industry has publicly warned that additional purchases could result in the Chinese government s gaining more power to control where Chinese companies buy products  While Chinese companies may buy more American components in the short term  the industry warns that Beijing could ultimately use such a system to redirect purchases to Chinese suppliers instead For now  administration officials are still trying to assure lawmakers that their trade deal will achieve the economic changes the United States wants and will require much more than purchases When pressed by lawmakers in February about whether the deal would require more than just additional sales to China  Mr  Lighthizer told Congress   I do not think it should just be a purchase agreement   

BANGKOK   Thailand s junta leader looks set to return as prime minister after a general election stacked heavily in his favor  but the process reveals that more than a decade s polarization in Thai politics is as strong as ever Rather than ensuring stability  the sharply divided vote almost guarantees new struggles over power  which could involve parliament  street protests or even fresh military intervention A self declared  democratic front  of seven political parties says a preliminary vote count from the March 24 election shows it will be able to put together a majority in the House of Representatives But the junta appointed Senate also takes part in the vote for prime minister  meaning junta leader and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan ocha will likely need to win only one quarter of the elected representatives in the lower house to get his job back Prayuth as army commander led the 2014 coup that toppled an elected government  and many people would see his taking power again through a carefully manipulated process as just the latest instance of Thai voters having their choices overruled by legal or extralegal means It would still be far from smooth sailing even if Prayuth and his allies in the Palang Pracharath party form a government  while the anti junta coalition led by the Pheu Thai party holds a majority in the House of Representatives A Prayuth led government  won t be able to pass laws and pass budgets   said Pornson Liengboonlertchai  a professor of political science at Bangkok s Chulalongkorn University   There s a likelihood that they will become an ineffective government because there could be a no confidence vote which relies on majority votes  and there s a likelihood that Prayuth will face that  a vote of no confidence  With the final election results not being certified until May 9  there s a good chance the numbers   perhaps whittled down by disqualifications   will not give the anti junta coalition a majority But this runs the risk of appearing that the junta friendly Election Commission is helping to steal the election  creating a public backlash and the possibility of street protests  If they go the nuclear option and get rid of one of the parties  entirely dissolve them  then I think you may see people getting really  really  really upset   said Kevin Hewison  a professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and veteran Thai studies scholar In the worst case scenario  the failure to establish a working government could invite new intervention by the military  My big fear is that there s going to be another coup   Hewison said   They ll say   Look  this hasn t worked  we ll set them straight again   The army s excuse for staging its coup in 2014 was to end political strife that deadlocked the country s administration Aside from the maneuvering to form a new government  the vote showed that what Thailand s people want is not uniform and perhaps not even clear after nearly half a decade in which political activities were banned and freedoms of speech and assembly were severely restricted The preliminary results of the election  though marred by alleged irregularities  paint the picture of a nation deeply divided between those for and against military rule Of course divisions are nothing new in Thailand  The country s politics have been defined by them since the rise of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  a telecommunications tycoon who came to power in a populist political revolution nearly two decades ago Thaksin was beloved by many in the countryside for policies such as universal health care and farm subsidies  but was loathed by many in the country s conservative establishment who saw him as corrupt and a threat to the traditional role of the monarchy at the center of Thai society  He was ousted by a 2006 coup and is now in exile  The election seems above all to have made clear the depth of continuing divisions   said Michael Montesano  coordinator of the Thailand Studies Program at Singapore s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute   At the same time  the rhetoric used by some on the Thai right in support of the Palang Pracharath party may have inflamed the concerns of voters worried about former Prime Minister Thaksin s continued influence on Thai politics and broader threats to the old status quo  But the dominating factor of Thaksin as boogeyman may be fading  with the rise of what some analysts see as a third force  the Future Forward Party  which starting from scratch without the benefit of old school politicians in its leadership managed to pull off a third place finish in the polls  both in terms of popular vote and likely seat total The party has a youth oriented appeal but also a frank anti military stance  and as more or less amateurs  stands apart from the other major contenders Part of the party s appeal is that it has given those opposed to both military rule and Thaksin a path to express themselves Party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit has said he would join a coalition and support a Pheu Thai prime minister  Yet in a recent interview  when a reporter asked him to say the first word that popped in his head when he heard the name Thaksin  his answer was telling   History  The anti Thaksin forces may still see the battle as one against the former prime minister and his political machine  but others such as the Future Forward Party and Pheu Thai are trying to move it toward a pro democracy versus anti democracy dialogue  said Jacob Ricks  a political scientist at Singapore Management University  Thaksin is appearing less important in their discussion  while he remains front and center for the military and their allies   he said Montesano said one of the upsides of the election is that divides in Thailand are no longer so much about Thaksin  The downside may be that voter sympathy for or patience with a continuing authoritarian orientation toward politics has become evident   he said He said it was unlikely these divisions can be overcome in the foreseeable future  especially if  Palang Pracharath continues to push to install either Gen  Prayuth or an outsider into the premiership  if Future Forward stays true to its electoral platform  and if meaningful progress in addressing inequality in Thai society does not occur     Grant Peck has covered coups and elections in Thailand

ALGIERS  Algeria   Algeria s Constitutional Council formalized President Abdelaziz Bouteflika s departure Wednesday from the office he held for two decades  as rattled international partners watched closely to see what s next for an energy rich country that is a key player in fighting terrorism Bouteflika himself asked the Algerians people for forgiveness the day after he stepped down following weeks of protests and the loss of the army s support  He urged citizens in a farewell letter  to stay united  and never divide yourselves  Bouteflika himself asked for forgiveness from his compatriots after stepping down in the wake of mass protests  and urged them in a farewell letter  to stay united  and never divide yourselves  Algerians faced a new and uncertain era  after the resignation of a man who had ruled Algeria for 20 years and had been a fixture in the Arab world s political landscape for decades A discreet  77 year old Bouteflika ally   the president of the upper house of the Algerian Parliament  Abdelkader Bensalah   is expected to take over as interim leader while Algeria plans elections  But that might further anger the protesters who drove Bouteflika from power  and who want to overhaul a political system seen as secretive  elitist and corrupt  Our session today is related to establishing the vacancy of the post of president of the republic  following the resignation of Mr  Abdelaziz Bouteflika yesterday   said Constitutional Council president Tayeb Belaiz at Wednesday s meeting The 12 member body then formally notified Parliament that Algeria no longer has a president  Both chambers of the national legislature are expected to meet to name the president of the upper house as interim leader for 90 days while elections are organized A much diminished Bouteflika  82  appeared on images shown on national television Tuesday night handing his resignation letter to the Constitutional Council president  Bouteflika  who hasn t spoken publicly to the nation since a 2013 stroke  appeared pale and weak and wore a traditional robe instead of his habitual suits In the public farewell letter released Wednesday by state news agency APS  Bouteflika acknowledged that some of his actions as president were less than successful  writing   I ask your forgiveness for any failing toward you  But he also said   I am leaving the political scene without sadness or fear  for the future of our country   He said he hoped Algeria s new leaders take the nation to  horizons of progress and prosperity  Women and young people  who led the protest movement that pressured him out of office  are  the beating heart of our nation  and deserve special attention  Bouteflika wrote He notably praised those who fought alongside him for Algeria s independence from colonial France and urged Algerians to live up to their example and honor their sacrifices Algerian protesters celebrated his departure with songs and flag waving in the capital Tuesday night New protests are already planned for Friday  after six straight Fridays of massive  peaceful gatherings that surprised the entrenched leadership by their strength and persistence Bensalah  the man expected to serve as interim leader  has led the upper house for most of Bouteflika s four terms  A one time journalist and former ambassador  Bensalah has held senior political positions for the past 25 years but has kept a low profile  rarely giving interviews or appearing at public events He s known as a politician who works behind the scenes to strike compromises and solve problems  and who avoids controversial debates   and is very much part of the political elite Demonstrators worry that those who would play a role in the political transition are too close to the distrusted power structure  including Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui  accused of contributing to fraud in the last presidential election in 2014 and cracking down on past protests However  the protest movement doesn t have a single  unifying alternative to the current political system Another question is what the influential military and Bouteflika s entourage will do next  Military chief of staff Ahmed Gaid Salah appeared to trigger Bouteflika s departure by pushing to get him declared unfit for office Countries around the world are watching Algeria s political crisis  wondering whether a transfer of power could impact gas and oil deliveries to Europe  Cuba and around Africa   or crucial security cooperation with Europe and the U S Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned against foreign interference in Algerian politics and said Wednesday that  we hope the internal processes in that country     will by no means affect the friendly nature of our relations   Algeria s foreign minister recently visited Russia  and the countries have been economic and geopolitical allies since the Soviet era French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian expressed hope that Algerians would  pursue this democratic transition in the same spirit of calm and responsibility  that has marked the protests that drove Bouteflika from office  France  Algeria s former colonial ruler and a key trading partner  had come under fire for seeming to support Bouteflika earlier in the movement The U S  State Department  which has expressed support for the peaceful protests  said it s now up to Algerians to decide the next steps  Since fighting an Islamist insurgency in the 1990s  Algeria has cooperated closely with the U S  and Europe against terrorism The United Nations   where Bouteflika often defended Third World countries as Algerian foreign minister in the 1960s and 1970s   offered Algeria support in its transition  The U N  said Wednesday that Secretary General Antonio Guterres  salutes the mature and calm nature in which the Algerian people have been expressing their desire for change  In Sudan  organizers behind months of anti government demonstrations expressed hope that Sudan s Omar al Bashir would follow Bouteflika s footsteps Sarah Abdel Jaleel  a spokeswoman for the Sudanese Professionals Association  told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Bouteflika s resignation shows the  success of peaceful resistance within Africa   She says it  definitely gives us all hope and reassurance that we must continue     Angela Charlton in Paris  Samy Magdy in Cairo

BANGKOK   Thailand s influential army chief warned Tuesday that the military will fight any moves that threaten the country s system of constitutional monarchy with the king as head of state  in an apparent threat directed at supporters of a new anti junta party  The army does the army s duty  which is to protect  maintain  and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy   Gen  Apirat Kongsompong said at a news conference Apirat appeared to be targeting intellectuals backing the Future Forward Party  which according to preliminary figures ran a strong third in the March 24 general election Apirat s words  come as an intimidating knock out punch against any Thai political critics of Thailand s system of government   said Paul Chambers  a lecturer in political science at Naresuan University in northern Thailand   But more explicitly  the words seem to attack Future Forward Party  whose leaders have seemed particularly critical of the junta and military  and who in the past discussed the monarchy  Future Forward Party co founder Piyabutr Saenkanokkul used to be part of the Nitirat Group  legal scholars who sought reforms in Thailand s lese majeste law  which carries stiff prison terms for people found guilty of defaming the monarchy Apirat suggested that scholars who have studied abroad may have lost their understanding of the  Thai style democratic system  Pitabutr received his master s and doctoral degree in France  and other prominent members of the Nitirat Group studied law in Germany  Don t introduce the leftist views you learned that made you all pretentious   Apirat said The military backed Palang Pracharath Party won the most popular votes in the March polls  and its candidate  Prayuth Chan ocha  is likely to become prime minister  but could end up with the opposition holding a majority of seats in the House of Representatives  Prayuth led a 2014 coup that ousted an elected government and since then has served as junta chief and prime minister Supporters of the Future Forward Party believe the courts and the Election Commission may try to disqualify some of its winning candidates  or even the entire party  ahead of the release of official election results on May 9 Thai social media since the election has been buzzing with postings seeking to discredit the Future Forward Party One recently circulated video shows excerpts of a lecture Piyabutr gave in 2013  when he taught law at Bangkok s Thammasat University  He has said it was to explain the relationship of democracy to monarchies in political systems worldwide  But it has been cast by his party s opponents as criticism of Thailand s monarchy An obscure right wing group  Political Civic Group  said it has filed a complaint with the Election Commission about Piyabutr s statements  claiming they violated election law  He has denied the allegations against him and charged the video was taken out of context to undermine him Apirat also criticized activists who charge that the Election Commission mismanaged the polls and are seeking to impeach its members  Once the referee has made a ruling  you blame the referees  When boxers fight  this guy loses  and you blame the referees  If it s like this it will never end  It will be a never ending cycle of revenge and disapproval  How can it end  I ve said already   Apirat said  before taking a long pause   I don t want to say something too harsh  After becoming army commander  Apirat told reporters last October that he refused to rule out more coups if there is political unrest  If politics does not create riots  nothing will happen   he said His father  Gen  Sunthorn Kongsompong  helped carry out a 1991 coup and served as junta leader for more than a year  

ALGIERS  Algeria   Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika will step down before his fourth term ends on April 28  his office said Monday  as the ailing leader capitulated to growing calls for his resignation after two decades in power It s unclear if the stunning move will appease the masses of protesters whose vociferous calls for Bouteflika and his cadre of loyalists to quit have expanded to demand an overhaul of the entire political system Their weekly protests since Feb  22 have challenged the political status quo in the country long ruled by Bouteflika  82  a onetime wily political survivor who has rarely been seen in public since he suffered a stroke in 2013 A short statement from Bouteflika s office said he would take  important steps to ensure the continuity of the functioning of state institutions  after he leaves the office he assumed in 1999 The Algerian Constitution calls for the head of the upper house of parliament  Abdelkader Bensalah  to act as interim leader for a maximum of 90 days while an election is organized Algerian national television reported Sunday night that Bouteflika and the replacement prime minister he appointed last month  Noureddine Bedoui  had formed a new government after struggling for weeks to find potential Cabinet ministers amid the uncertainty surrounding the president The new government must stay in place during the transition period before the next election In recent weeks  the president saw key figures withdraw their support from him  Algeria s powerful army chief proposed launching a procedure to have Bouteflika declared unfit for office  prompting tensions between the army and the president s inner circle The president s concession came after a court in Algeria said it was investigating corruption and the illegal transfer of funds abroad amid concerns about a flight of capital from the country amid political instability The official APS news agency quoted the Algerian prosecutor s office Monday as saying  certain people  were banned from leaving the country  for the needs of the investigation   providing no details Police detained a powerful industrialist who is thought to be close to Bouteflika  Ali Haddad  near the Algerian Tunisian border over the weekend Algeria is Africa s biggest country by land mass and a major natural gas producer  but its energy riches have not trickled down to reach the pockets of its people The protests have been driven mostly by young Algerians  many of whom struggle to find jobs  Desperation has driven some to attempt to migrate to Europe on rickety boats Demonstrators said Bouteflika and the rest of the political establishment were out of touch with their everyday problems  They have called for a rewritten constitution that gives fewer powers to the president in a bid to strengthen democracy in the gas rich North African country Ending his presidency amid the protests was a bold decision for Bouteflika  who in February declared he would seek a fifth term in the presidential election originally scheduled for April 18 He postponed the election and said he would not be a candidate when it was held  but did not set a new date  angering critics who saw the delay as designed to hold onto power Bouteflika had been known as a political survivor ever since he fought during the 1950s and 1960s for Algeria s independence from France He became foreign minister at the age of 25  and stood up to the likes of Henry Kissinger at the height of the Cold War  when Algeria was tethered to the former Soviet Union Bouteflika famously negotiated with the Venezuelan terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal to free oil ministers who were taken hostage in a 1975 attack on OPEC headquarters in Vienna and flown to Algiers Most crucially  he helped reconcile Algeria s citizens after a decade of civil war between radical Muslim militants and Algerian security forces left some 200 000 people dead in the 1990s and nearly tore Algeria apart During his 20 years in office  age and illness took a toll on the once charismatic figure  Corruption scandals over infrastructure and hydrocarbon projects have also dogged him for years and tarnished many of his closest associates Algeria has been a key partner to the United States and Europe in fighting Islamic extremism  The recent political crisis caused concern among Western allies    Elaine Ganley and Angela Charlton contributed    Adamson reported from Paris

CHICAGO   After Rahm Emanuel announced he would not seek another term as Chicago s mayor  the field of would be replacements seemed to grow by the day  Lori Lightfoot  a former federal prosecutor who had never held elective office  often seemed an afterthought in a mounting list of prominent names   a member of the Daley political dynasty  the head of the county s Democratic Party  a former leader of Chicago s public school system Yet on Tuesday  voters sided with Ms  Lightfoot in overwhelming margins  handing her a resounding victory as she prepares to become the first African American woman and first openly gay person to serve as Chicago s mayor  Ms  Lightfoot s outsider status and her pledge to combat political corruption resonated across the city s traditional dividing lines of race and class  With 97 percent of precincts reporting  she had received 73 percent of the vote and was leading in all 50 City Council wards  Today  you did more than make history   Ms  Lightfoot told a packed ballroom of her supporters that chanted her name on Tuesday night   You created a movement for change   Read how Chicago became the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  and how Chicagoans feel about it  Ms  Lightfoot  a Democrat  used her acceptance speech to underscore the historic nature of her victory  As her wife and daughter stood nearby  Ms  Lightfoot said her win proved that Chicago was  a city where it doesn t matter what color you are  and  where it doesn t matter who you love  just as long as you love with all your heart   She also reiterated her promise to invest in struggling neighborhoods  not just the booming downtown  a hallmark theme of her campaign pitch  We can and will make Chicago a place where your ZIP code doesn t determine your destiny   she said Ms  Lightfoot finished with the most support among 14 candidates in February s first round  nonpartisan election  In Tuesday s runoff  she broadened that appeal and soundly defeated Toni Preckwinkle  a longtime politician who leads the county board and local Democratic Party  The two women will soon have offices in the same building  and have vowed to work together despite a campaign that was often acrimonious In the Logan Square neighborhood on the city s Northwest Side  Deepti Pareenja  37  said she voted for Ms  Lightfoot on Tuesday in part because of the candidate s lack of political experience ImageMs  Lightfoot campaigned with supporters last week  She presented herself on the campaign trail as an antidote to Rahm Emanuel s eight years in office and as an answer to the city s far longer tradition of machine politics CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York Times It s because of Chicago   Ms  Pareenja said   We have a history of corruption with people who ve been ingrained in politics for multiple decades  Ms  Pareenja said she also voted for Ms  Lightfoot in February s first round election  but at the time did not think Ms  Lightfoot had much of a chance of winning  Ms  Pareenja said she was surprised and excited when the runoff field was set The fact Ms  Lightfoot had never served in elective office also helped her earn the vote of Michelle Saulnier  29  a Ph D  student  It s a good thing  especially in Chicago where there s known to be a lot of corruption   Ms  Saulnier said on Tuesday after casting her ballot in the Logan Square neighborhood  where Ms  Lightfoot lives and her campaign signs were all around   I think that s really important to try to break some of these cycles that we re in   Read more about the Chicago election for mayor that resulted in a win for Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to run the city  Don Rose  a political consultant who was a senior adviser to the Lightfoot campaign  said that Ms  Lightfoot benefited from recent corruption scandals that seemed to work against any mayoral candidate who was already part of the Chicago political establishment  It was the perfect situation for some kind of outsider who would capture that mantle and consolidate the reform minded vote   he said   People got fed up  Ms  Lightfoot  56  who held city government jobs under two mayors  presented herself on the campaign trail as an antidote to Mr  Emanuel s eight years in office and as an answer to the city s far longer tradition of machine politics  She criticized Mr  Emanuel s decision to close dozens of schools  mainly in Hispanic and black neighborhoods  and focused especially on promises to overhaul the Chicago Police Department and reduce gun violence  People feel like the violence is out of control and that there s no plan   Ms  Lightfoot said in an interview last year Just a few years ago  Mr  Emanuel turned to Ms  Lightfoot during the biggest crisis of his tenure  A Chicago police officer  Jason Van Dyke  had just been charged with murder in the death of a black teenager  Laquan McDonald  and protesters were calling for Mr  Emanuel s ouster ImageMs  Lightfoot with her daughter Vivian Lightfoot and wife Amy Eshleman before taking the stage to make her victory speech on Tuesday night CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York TimesIn the months that followed  Ms  Lightfoot was chairwoman of a panel that met with residents and produced a scathing report  The document accused the Police Department of systemic racism and found that officers had lost the trust of residents and failed to instill a sense of safety  What we heard from people all across the city is they felt like they didn t even have a claim to the geography in front of their house  on their street  or in their neighborhoods   Ms  Lightfoot said when the report was released in spring 2016 After the report was made public  Ms  Lightfoot drifted away from Mr  Emanuel  eventually resigning her role as president of the Chicago Police Board  which oversees officer discipline  and entering the mayoral race in May At the time  Ms  Lightfoot was one of only a handful of figures willing to run against Mr  Emanuel  who was widely expected to appear on the ballot until announcing in September that he would not  As the field of candidates grew more vast  including the entrance of Ms  Preckwinkle  Ms  Lightfoot forged ahead with her campaign There were reasons for skepticism  Ms  Lightfoot was relatively unknown in the city s political realm  and her ballot petition signatures were briefly challenged last year  But she surged in at least one poll in the final days before the February election  and was endorsed by The Chicago Sun Times  She has the vision  values  qualifications and policies to be an effective leader for the whole city  from the hedge fund managers to the fast food workers   the newspaper s editorial board wrote   She is calm  focused  principled and independent  In the weeks since  as the race took on a venomous tone  Ms  Lightfoot tallied up endorsements across the city  including from several of her former opponents Ms  Lightfoot repeatedly portrayed Ms  Preckwinkle  with whom she agrees on most major policy issues  as a part of the Democratic machine that long dominated Chicago government Ms  Preckwinkle was fond of noting Ms  Lightfoot s work as a  corporate lawyer  and her service in city government under the previous two mayors  And Bridget Gainer  a county commissioner who supported Ms  Preckwinkle  said her candidate s political experience was in fact an asset  We need results  not just rhetoric   Ms  Gainer said in February   Chicago is not a training wheels job   

BALTIMORE   Baltimore already faced daunting challenges  soaring violent crime  a thriving drug economy and poverty so intense that some derelict neighborhoods look like they were hit by a plague  Now  Mayor Catherine Pugh is embroiled in a strange scandal  sucking attention away from those core issues while embarrassing Maryland s biggest city on a national scale The allegations surrounding the first term mayor conjure up a bizarre world where no contract financial deals intersect with children s picture books  of all things  Since 2011  the Democrat has somehow received payments totaling at least  700 000 for tens of thousands of self published 20 page books with titles like  Healthy Holly  Fruits Come in Colors Like the Rainbow  Her main customers for the hard to find paperbacks  a  4 billion medical network  on whose board she served  that paid her personal business half a million dollars for 100 000 copies  and a health care provider that bought  Healthy Holly  books after she became mayor  as that company was seeking a city contract It s Baltimore s latest chapter of murky politics and alleged corruption  of odd bedfellows and weird contradictions  For many locals  it s yet another reminder that their hometown seems doomed to repeat cycles of tawdry mismanagement  reinforcing tales of homegrown sleaze ingrained in pop culture by the gritty TV drama  The Wire   Baltimore s insular politics  with its interlocked civic and political elite  and without clear divides among parties or factions  creates the conditions for scandals like this one   said Daniel Schlozman  a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University For Pugh  an affable  image conscious politician who was once the state Senate majority leader and ran a public relations firm  the stakes could not be higher  Allegations of blatant self dealing have left her increasingly isolated and politically vulnerable  As a growing chorus presses for her resignation  her spokespeople say she s retreated to her home on doctor s orders  taking an  indefinite  leave of absence due to a pneumonia bout Yet at a rambling press conference last week  Pugh painted her  Healthy Holly  initiative as entirely well intentioned  while calling her whopping  500 000 book deal with the University of Maryland Medical System a  regrettable mistake   She held up baby bibs and onesies emblazoned with words like  play  and  crawl  that she said were part of a  Healthy Holly  lifestyle message As public trust appears to erode with each new revelation  many political observers wonder if an indictment will come from an investigation into Pugh s financial dealings as an elected official  On Monday  Maryland Gov  Larry Hogan formally asked for a criminal investigation into Pugh s activities by the State Prosecutor s Office  which investigates public corruption Pugh s lawyer  Steven Silverman  said she looks forward to cooperating with the state prosecutor s investigation and will provide  as much information as possible to put this matter to rest  While the accusations raise clouds over Baltimore s mayor  Pugh hasn t been indicted for anything and it s far from clear how long the criminal investigation will take  Pugh might even try forging ahead  at least through 2020 when her term expires  but many political analysts believe she would never be able to wield power effectively It wasn t supposed to be this way  Pugh came to office contrasting her clean image with her main opponent  ex mayor Sheila Dixon who was forced to depart office in 2010 as part of a plea deal for misappropriating about  500 in gift cards meant for needy families But as Baltimore Sun columnist Dan Rodricks wrote of Pugh in a Tuesday piece  it turns out  the woman who was elected because she did not come with baggage turns out to have had a matching set of luggage you d need five bellhops to carry  Acknowledging that Baltimore faces more tough times due to the latest scandal  Democratic U S  Rep  Elijah Cummings urged people to focus on the many Baltimoreans working hard to transform the city in ways big and small  I want everyone to remain focused on the fact that there are thousands of good people doing important work every single day to make Baltimore a better place to live and work   said Cummings  a native of the city  in a statement touching on Pugh s leave of absence That kind of pep talk is recurrent in Baltimore  a city with a shrinking population and public officials who keep getting into trouble  Just last week  Pugh s onetime police commissioner  Darryl De Sousa  was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison for tax fraud A crowning frustration preoccupies city leaders  Baltimore s latest scandal is unfolding amid the overwhelming  unmet expectations of citizens in large swaths of the startlingly segregated city  There s a failing school system  crumbling infrastructure  and a beleaguered police department under federal oversight Some members of Baltimore s influential legislative delegation in Maryland s capital are now describing Pugh s scandal in almost existential terms  I hope that she s doing some real soul searching   said state Sen  Bill Ferguson  a Baltimore Democrat   This is such a distraction from where we need to be and the issues that we should be focused on to really help rebuild a great American city  so now we ve just got to pull it together and figure out what the future holds  Another city Democrat  Sen  Antonio Hayes  put it more bluntly   It s frustrating as hell      

ISLAMABAD   Facebook said Monday it has shut down more than 100 misleading pages  groups and accounts linked to the Pakistani military It said the accounts were eliminated because they engaged in  coordinated inauthentic behavior    a term used to refer to fake accounts run with the intent of disrupting politics and elections   and not because of the content that was posted Facebook has been disclosing such purges more regularly in recent months  including ones linked to groups in Myanmar    Bangladesh and Russia  Facebook said the material in question included posts praising the Pakistani air force  mocking the air force of archrival India and expressing support for anti India protests in the disputed Kashmir region  Facebook said 2 8 million accounts follow one or more of the pages in question Those behind the online activity tried to conceal their identities and pass themselves off as ordinary users but were actually employees of Inter Service Public Relations  the media arm of the Pakistani military  Facebook said There was no immediate comment from the military  The ISPR is not part of Inter Services Intelligence  the country s main spy agency Facebook said it also removed nearly 700 pages and accounts linked to an IT Cell of the Indian National Congress  a political party  and 15 pages  groups and accounts linked to an Indian IT firm  It said the two networks had spread posts about domestic politics ahead of India s general election  which will be held in phases from April 11 to May 19 Facebook said last week it is taking a variety of measures to prevent the spread of false information ahead of the voting  from blocking fake accounts to employing third party fact checking organizations  

In 1971  C P  Ellis was the Exalted Cyclops of the Durham  N C   klavern of the United Klans of America  Ann Atwater was a fair housing activist  advocating for better treatment for the city s African American residents  The beginning of their unlikely real life friendship is the subject of  The Best of Enemies   the latest muddled and well meaning big screen attempt to find solace in the history of American racism Don t get me wrong  The facts of the story  chronicled in a book by Osha Gray Davidson  are eye opening and inspiring  and the film  written and directed by Robin Bissell  includes some fascinating details about the granular challenges of local politics  As Ellis and Atwater  Sam Rockwell and Taraji P  Henson do what you expect Oscar nominated actors to do  They clarify and complicate their characters  paying attention to their individuality even as the movie loads them up with symbolic baggage C P  loves his family and hates black people  which makes him a fairly normal white person of his time and place  Unlike other movies on similar subjects   The Best of Enemies  doesn t treat racial prejudice as a freakish  isolated pathology  but rather as an unremarkable  omnipresent fact of life  C P  and his Klan brothers aren t especially extreme  They carry membership cards in their wallets and are openly allied with many of Durham s political leaders and prominent white citizens  who are fighting a rear guard action against racial progress As the movie begins  those forces of reaction seem to be winning  In spite of the civil rights legislation of the previous decade  Ann still argues for basic fairness in front of a City Council composed entirely of white men  one of whom makes a show of turning his back on her when she speaks  Nearly 20 years after Brown v  Board of Education  the schools in Durham are still segregated  When a fire damages the black school that one of Ann s daughters attends  she and other parents  supported by the N A A C P   argue that white and black children should be educated together  C P  and his friends are appalled by the idea There have been movies that dramatize social change via courtroom debates  street demonstrations and legislative struggles   The Best of Enemies  is the first I have seen that focuses on a charrette  a term borrowed from design that basically means a period of enforced  deadline driven discussion  Under the impressively patient guidance of Bill Riddick  Babou Ceesay   a Raleigh based specialist in this kind of nonviolent process  black and white citizens gather every day to talk  The hope is that by spending time together and working in common  they will discover tools of civility and compromise It would be interesting to observe the fine grain of this process  a form of nonviolent  democratic politics that seems both wildly idealistic and soberly practical  But the charrette serves as a backdrop for the far more conventional story of a white man s change of heart and the black woman who brought it about The political moral of the movie is that change happens when the oppressed are nice to their oppressors  Ann takes it on herself to do a kindness for C P  s family  and this causes him to question his beliefs  Meanwhile  his fellow racists  in and out of the Klan  set about intimidating white charrette participants who seem likely to support integration  C P   in breaking with his side  risks ostracism and worse There is real danger there  and  The Best of Enemies  doesn t sugarcoat it  But it makes nearly all of its emotion and suspense depend on what the white people will do  We see a lot of C P  s domestic and social activities  getting to know his wife  Mary  Ann Heche   and his best Klan buddy  Floyd  Wes Bentley   But we barely catch a glimpse of Ann s children  or set foot inside her house  African American life in Durham is all but invisible  which means that the political  religious and cultural roots of the real story remain offscreen As do its implications  Like many other movies    Green Book  being the most recent and popular example    The Best of Enemies  invites you to believe that racism lies safely in the past  It may not have died the minute C P  Ellis saw the error of his ways  but the public conversion of a Klansman surely meant its days were numbered  You would never guess that school integration in particular remains an elusive goal  resisted not only by sheet wearing whites in the South but also by avowed liberals in Northern cities and suburbs Rather than illuminating the politics of the present by examining the struggles of the past  Bissell lurches from folksy comedy to clattering melodrama  producing the opposite of enlightenment  To quote an old protest song  When will we ever learn  

NEW DELHI ISLAMABAD   Facebook has deleted 712 accounts and 390 pages in India and Pakistan for  inauthentic behavior   it said on Monday  many linked to India s opposition Congress party days before a national election  and others related to Pakistan s military Facebook has come under increasing pressure around the world to ensure its social media platform is not abused for political purposes or to spread misinformation The action against accounts with alleged links to Congress  the party led by the Gandhi family that has dominated Indian politics for much of its post independence era  marks a bold move by Facebook The platform has more than 300 million users in India  where it has been a key political campaigning tool in the election   the largest democratic exercise in the world   starting on April 11 While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his rivals use official Facebook accounts to send political messages to millions of followers  thousands of unverified pages also share posts to support or criticize politicians Among the most significant things it has removed  Facebook said it had taken down 549 accounts and 138 pages linked to India s Congress for  coordinated inauthentic behavior   In a Tweet  Congress said none of its official pages or those run by its verified volunteers had been taken down  The party is awaiting a response from Facebook to provide a list of all pages and accounts which were removed  it said Also removed were 15 accounts linked to an Indian IT company which  among other things  issued posts on Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  and alleged misconduct of political opponents including Congress  Facebook said The Digital Forensic Research Lab at think tank Atlantic Council  which partnered with Facebook for the review  said the accounts linked to Congress pushed satirical posts  while pro BJP pages  carried vitriolic posts against opposition leaders   The fact that partisans on both sides resorted to such tactics is a troubling feature   it said in a blog post In the face of increasing calls for tougher regulation of online content  Facebook has been taking similar measures elsewhere  In Pakistan  it removed 57 accounts  24 pages  seven groups and 15 Instagram accounts  also for inauthentic behavior  as part of a network that originated there and was linked to employees of a unit of the Pakistani military Nuclear armed neighbors India and Pakistan both sent warplanes to attack each other s territory in February after a suicide bomb attack claimed by a Pakistan based militant group killed 40 Indian paramilitary police in the disputed region of Kashmir  The attack also led to a deluge of fake news  another issue social media companies have been grappling with CRITICISM OF POLITICIANSFacebook s head of cybersecurity policy  Nathaniel Gleicher  said the firm had removed accounts based on their behavior  not their content The company s review found individuals using fake accounts and issuing posts including criticism of the BJP who were  associated with an INC  Indian National Congress  IT Cell  Two of the samples shared by Facebook were of posts that criticized Modi s initiatives and called for supporting the Congress party and its president  Rahul Gandhi Separately  Facebook removed 12 accounts and one page  plus one group and one Instagram account  which linked to individuals related to an Indian IT firm Silver Touch  Asked what Silver Touch s link with politics was  Gleicher told Reuters earlier it was  associated with  a mobile app promoted by Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  After BJP s IT head  Amit Malviya  told Reuters both the party and the app had  nothing to do with Silver Touch   Facebook in a new statement late on Monday said it had  seen no evidence to date of Silver Touch being associated with the NaMo App on our platform   referring to the Narendra Modi app   We won t be speculating about off platform connections of the actors we took down today   a spokeswoman said Facebook s actions on Monday also included the removal of a  pro BJP  page called  The India Eye   which had more than 2 million followers   was strongly nationalist   a vocal supporter of Modi and a critic of Gandhi  Atlantic Council said Facebook said it had also removed another 227 pages and 94 accounts in India for violating its policies on spam and misrepresentation In Pakistan  Facebook said it removed pages and accounts on Facebook and Instagram that spread information about Pakistani politics  the Indian government and the Pakistani military  Those accounts were being run by employees of the Pakistani military s public relations arm  the Inter Services Public Relations  ISPR   Facebook said No comment was immediately available from ISPR These Pakistani accounts  pages  groups and Instagram accounts removed from Facebook had more than 2 8 million followers  Last week the firm removed a social media network in the Philippines and took

DUBLIN   With Westminster deadlocked over Britain s departure from the European Union  one small party is potentially positioned to rescue Britain from its self induced paralysis   but it refuses to vote Having won seven seats on an anti Brexit platform  the party s support would have reversed Monday s three vote defeat for a proposal to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union s customs union  ending the risk of a catastrophic no deal Brexit The party is Sinn Fein  the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army  which does not consider itself British and has formally renounced any involvement in Westminster politics This week  despite renewed criticism in Ireland  Sinn Fein repeated that it has no intention of ending its Westminster boycott   It s a matter of principle  We are a party that is for a United Ireland  for Irish independence   said the party s president  Mary Lou McDonald  on Tuesday Speaking outside the Irish Parliament in Dublin  Ms  McDonald told reporters that Sinn Fein members would not be prepared to  swear an oath to a foreign power   a reference to the royal oath of allegiance required of new lawmakers at Westminster  Irish interests in this Brexit debacle are not best advanced at Westminster   she said   Irish interests in this scenario were always going to be advanced and protected  or not  by the government in Dublin  whose duty it is to defend Irish interests in conjunction with our European partners  ImageThe former president of Sinn Fein  Gerry Adams  center  joined a protest against a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland last week CreditPaul Faith Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesA cross border party whose central goal is a united Ireland  Sinn Fein actively participates in both the Republic of Ireland s Parliament and in the  currently suspended  assembly for Northern Ireland  a devolved region of the United Kingdom  Its refusal to take up its seats in Westminster at a time when the Parliament is debating and voting on issues of critical importance to the whole island of Ireland has been repeatedly criticized by other Irish parties  north and south Sinn Fein is a determined competitor in Northern Ireland parliamentary elections  using any seats it wins at Westminster as a source of electoral legitimacy   and of public funds from the British exchequer  At the last elections in 2017  it won seven seats  with the rival  pro Brexit Democratic Unionist Party taking 10 of the other 11 Northern Ireland constituencies  But Sinn Fein insists that its candidates are elected on a clearly stated abstentionist policy  and that they therefore have no mandate to vote in Britain s Parliament  whatever is at stake A poll taken in the Republic of Ireland last month suggested that 57 percent of voters there felt that Sinn Fein should be prepared to vote at Westminster on matters relating to Brexit  with only 20 percent against  But within its core support group in Northern Ireland  where Sinn Fein is the main voice of Catholic nationalism  the boycott is seen by many as a matter of principle  not political tactics  and strongly supported Prof  Jennifer Todd  a political scientist at University College Dublin  said that going to Westminster would do little to change Sinn Fein s popularity in the Republic  where it runs mainly on leftist social democratic issues  but would alienate some core supporters in the north  benefiting hard line dissidents who never recognized the peace deal  Nor  she thought  was the party s tactical route in Westminster as straightforward as arithmetic might suggest If it did it enter Parliament on a one off basis to vote on Brexit   it might work   she said   They could come in and out and make a difference without committing to a parliamentary presence  But with British parliamentary politics so chaotic and unpredictable  she said  they could  get caught in the Westminster process and they would lose Northern Ireland support to the dissidents  Sinn Fein s president  Ms  McDonald  made a similar point in Dublin on Tuesday   Don t imagine for a second that seven Sinn Fein M P s could enter Westminster and make sense of the utter chaos and circus that we ve witnessed over the last number of months   she said

BANGKOK   Thailand s ruling military junta has filed a complaint accusing the leader of a popular new political party of sedition and aiding criminals  a move he described as politically motivated The party  Future Forward  ran a strong third in elections last month that were also contested by a pro military party Future Forward s leader  Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit  said he would report to police on Saturday to answer the summons against him  He could face up to nine years in prison The summons did not specify what actions prompted the complaint  It said Thanathorn was accused of sedition for using words or writing  to raise unrest and disaffection amongst the people in a manner likely to cause disturbance in the country  Several criminal complaints and protests to the Election Commission have already been lodged against Thanathorn and his party Speaking to reporters on Wednesday before a tour of a Bangkok neighborhood to thank voters  Thanathorn said the new legal action was expected and  nothing new   We are prepared mentally  There s nothing to worry about   he said   We believe in our innocence  We believe these cases are politically motivated  Thanathorn commented further about the summons on his Facebook page  saying it was clear  that old political games don t end after elections but in turn become even more intense because they are afraid of Future Forward  afraid of our victory that surpassed many people s expectations  He said he would answer the summons to show his innocence and  prove that Thailand s justice system will not submit to becoming a tool for dictators  Preliminary results of the March 24 general election failed to give any single party a majority  making it unclear whether pro  or anti junta parties will hold a majority in the House of Representatives  The Future Forward Party is a junior partner in an anti junta coalition that claims have a majority of seats  but the final official results won t be released until May 9 Between now and then  there could be shifts in party alliances  and there is concern that the state Election Commission  widely regarded as sympathetic to the junta  could disqualify the elected candidates of its opponents The army has several times publicly shown its disdain for Future Forward s policies  The country s influential army chief on Tuesday issued a thinly veiled attack on the party  not mentioning it by name but implying that it has foreign influenced ideas unsuitable for the  Thai style democratic system   which is a constitutional monarchy Gen  Apirat Kongsompong  the ruling junta s secretary general  said the army would do its duty   which is to protect  maintain and defend the institutions of nation  religion  and monarchy  Respect for the monarchy is a sensitive and emotional issue in Thailand  and accusations of disrespect are sometimes used by opportunists to smear their political opponents  Thailand has a lese majeste law that makes criticism of the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years  imprisonment per offense Thanathorn has said his party s primary agenda is to stop Thailand s military from intervening in politics  and also suggested its budget be slashed The new party s critics also have tried to tried to sow suspicion that it is allied with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  who was ousted by the military in a 2006 coup and is treated as the arch enemy of Thailand s royalist establishment  The party denies any such ties  and a large part of its appeal appears to be that it supports neither the military nor Thaksin The co founder of Future Forward  law scholar Piyabutr Saengkanokkul  has come under pressure as well  including a summons to be a witness in what appears to be Thanathorn s case Piyabutr has been in hot water with conservative Thais who see him as a threat to the monarchy after social media began circulating a video of a Feb  17  2013  lecture in which he described the role of the monarchy in democratic governments  He responded that the posting was misleading and was not about Thailand s system An obscure conservative organization filed a complaint about him with the Election Commission  and on Wednesday singer and actress Haruthai Muangboonsri formally submitted a legal complaint to police accusing him of being a threat to national security The military has governed Thailand since then army commander Prayuth Chan ocha staged a coup in 2014 against an elected government  Since then  Prayuth has served as junta leader and prime minister  and is the candidate of the pro military Palang Pracharath Party  which according to preliminary results grabbed the biggest share of the popular vote in last month s election According to a new constitution implemented under the junta  prime ministers are chosen by a joint vote of the elected House of Representatives and the appointed Senate  giving Prayuth a great advantage  However  his opponents could still control a majority in the lower house  making it difficult for him to pass laws or get a budget approved  and making any government he would head unstable because of the possibility it would face a vote of no confidence

KIEV  Ukraine   Volodymyr Zelenskiy has no political experience  but that s no problem for the people of Ukraine who have already seen him performing the role of president In a striking example of fiction morphing into reality  the 41 year old comic actor seems set to take the top office for real  following in the footsteps of the man he plays in a wildly popular television series   an ordinary teacher who becomes an unlikely president and succeeds in bringing the country together Zelenskiy took a commanding lead against the incumbent in Sunday s presidential election  putting him in a strong position for the runoff in three weeks  time He is the latest candidate with little or no political experience to fare well at the ballot boxes  reinforcing the trend in Europe and beyond for anti establishment leaders  Just a day before Ukraine s election  a liberal environmental activist won a runoff in Slovakia to become the country s first female president Zelenskiy is much more moderate than far right populists who have had recent success in elections  and he appealed for reconciliation with separatist held eastern Ukraine  A new life begins   Zelenskiy said in his trademark raspy voice after the vote   A life without corruption and without bribes  A life in a nation of dreams comes true  His easygoing manner and snappy talk on the campaign trail strongly resembled his character in  Servant of the People    a schoolteacher catapulted into the presidential seat after a student s video of him blasting official corruption goes viral  Zelenskiy has  however  refused to hold standard campaign meetings with voters  and his political program remains a mystery The TV series that premiered in the fall of 2015 painted a grotesque satirical picture of Ukraine s officialdom  complete with easily recognizable parodies of serving politicians  It has been immensely popular  attracting up to 20 million viewers in the nation of 42 million   a sign that it hit a nerve in a country fed up with endemic corruption and grinding poverty Zelenskiy s character  Vasyl Holoborodko  at first looks too naive and soft hearted to survive in the cruel world of Ukraine s corruption ridden elite  But he learns quickly and soon turns into a strong leader capable of defeating his wily and experienced foes without losing his integrity  The series is full of profanities and crude humor  but Holoborodko turns serious when he talks about the country s challenges The latest season of  Servant of the People   shown just days before the election  opens with Holoborodko thrown into prison on trumped up charges fabricated by his pitiless foes Inmates hired by his enemies try to kill him  but he survives and gets out  to find Ukraine sunken deeper in poverty and broken into multiple fiefdoms   in a nod to the ongoing separatist conflict in the east  On screen  Zelenskiy s character regains the presidential post and leads the country to peace  prosperity and reunification These are the challenges incumbent President Petro Poroshenko has sorely failed to meet  and Zelenskiy s electoral success clearly reflects public aspirations that he could be just as successful in real life as his character was on screen Ukraine has suffered from economic meltdown  endemic corruption and a spiraling conflict with Russia sponsored separatists in eastern Ukraine that has killed 13 000 people since 2014  Its hopes for integration into the European Union and NATO remain as elusive as ever  and there is no realistic way for Ukraine to reclaim control over the Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 in a move that most of the world sees as illegal For those who cast ballots for Zelenskiy  his lack of political skills is a major advantage  a welcome break from the cast of familiar political figures associated with the country s woes  Both incumbent Petro Poroshenko and Yulia Tymoshenko  who polled second and third  respectively  have been on the political stage for more than a decade Born to a professorial family in the industrial city of Kryvyi Rih when Ukraine still was part of the Soviet Union  Zelenskiy is a native Russian speaker  something that helped him sweep the vote in central  eastern and southern regions where many speak the language The comedian has had a low key campaign  In his rare public appearances  Zelenskiy wouldn t offer his views on specific political or economic issues  promising to rely on a team of professionals Zelenskiy rejects Poroshenko s claim that his lack of experience will make him unable to stand up to Russia  pledging to firmly defend Ukraine s interests  He charged late Sunday that he will make sure that Russia not only returns Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine held by pro Russia rebels  but pays compensation for the  disgusting and horrible  land grabs In Moscow  lawmakers and commentators have described Zelenskiy s strong showing as a sign of public disillusionment with the current government  but most predict that the tug of war between the two neighbors will continue Poroshenko has sought to disparage Zelenskiy  accusing him of being a  puppet  of self exiled billionaire businessman Ihor Kolomoyskyi  whose station has aired  Servant of the People  and given him the platform to announce his candidacy in a New Year s speech  Zelenskiy  who has bitingly mocked the president in his stand up performances  shot back by ridiculing Poroshenko and his associates accused of corruption Kolomoyskyi  who lives in Israel  denied bankrolling Zelenskiy s bid  but hailed him as a bright and honest man of a new generation who can deliver what the country needs  He s absolutely independent   Kolomoyskyi said of Zelenskiy in a recent interview released by the UNIAN news agency   His quick reaction  humor and a broad horizon make him hard to beat in an argument  Volodymyr Fesenko  the head of the Kiev based Penta Center independent think tank  said that Kolomoyskyi hopes that Zelenskiy s victory will help him regain his clout  but added that Zelenskiy could distance himself from the tycoon  Kolomoyskyi will try to fill Zelenskiy s team with his people and fill Zelenskiy s head with his ideas  but he could have problems with it   he said    Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report  

KIEV   A comedian with no political experience took a commanding lead in the first round of Ukraine s presidential election  offering a fresh face to voters fed up with corruption in a country on the front line of the West s standoff with Russia  With 94 percent of votes counted late on Monday  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  a 41 year old comic who plays a teacher turned president in a popular TV series  had won 30 percent President Petro Poroshenko was trailing in a distant second with just under 16 percent  a hole that may be too deep to climb out from  He faced a public furious at his failure to stamp out corruption or improve living standards five years after a pro Russian leader was swept out by a popular revolt In a field of 39 candidates  former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko placed third with 13 percent That leaves Zelenskiy and Poroshenko set to face each other in a run off in three weeks In a cheerful victory speech on Sunday night  Zelenskiy provided little insight into what he would do if he wins  I would like to say  thank you  to all the Ukrainians who did not vote just for fun   Zelenskiy told cheering supporters   It is only the beginning  we will not relax  In keeping with a laid back campaign that blurred the line between fiction and reality  his election night venue provided a bar with free alcohol and table football Poroshenko  53  attacked Zelenskiy as fundamentally unserious  a reckless choice at a time when the country still faces a conflict against Russian backed separatists President Vladimir Putin  dreams of a soft  pliant  tender  giggling  inexperienced  weak  ideologically amorphous and politically undecided president of Ukraine  Are we really going to give him that opportunity   Poroshenko said But analysts said it would be tough for Poroshenko  a confectionary billionaire  to fight back to win the second round   I find it hard to imagine how a gap that wide could be closed   said Serhiy Fursa  a Kiev based investment banker at Dragon Capital Two women in Kiev who had backed defeated candidates said they were now likely to vote for Zelenskiy  Only thanks to the fact that I loathe Poroshenko  and am tired of Tymoshenko    In my opinion it s a protest against the old guys  and I m tired of them too   Natalia  70  said  Natalia said she was worried about Zelenskiy s lack of experience in politics but was hopeful because  he s smart  he s young  and his father is a lawyer   he will help him  Kristina  27  said she was concerned the TV star  had no strategic program  no clear answers  not on the economy   but she would now vote for him   He is the lesser of two evils   WHAT TO EXPECT Zelenskiy s advisers were predicting he would win the lion s share of votes from the other defeated candidates  who campaigned against the status quo  If we believe the research done before the first round  then there will be big outflows  to Zelenskiy  from everyone   said Dmytro Razumkov  Zelenskiy s political adviser In a country dependent on foreign loans  economists are trying to figure out whether Zelenskiy would stick to reforms and fiscal policies demanded by the International Monetary Fund  We would expect Zelenskiy to be put under greater pressure in the run up to the second round to flesh out his policy agenda   said Stuart Culverhouse  head of sovereign and fixed income research at investment bank Exotix Poroshenko has tried to integrate the country with the European Union and NATO while strengthening the military More than 13 000 people have died in the conflict against separatists and Ukraine has lost control of parts of its industrial heartland  Major combat ended with a ceasefire in 2015 but deadly clashes still take place regularly Crimea has been annexed by Russia in a move that triggered international financial sanctions on Moscow  and Poroshenko has campaigned hard to keep the pressure on Russia But public opinion has turned firmly against the political establishment  Voters say politicians failed to deliver on expectations of honest government  despite the sacrifices made during the revolt that overthrew pro Russian leader Viktor Yanukovich and the years of hardship and war that followed  Just 9 percent of Ukrainians have confidence in their national government  the lowest of any electorate in the world  a Gallup poll published in March showed Zelenskiy tapped into this anti establishment mood with a campaign packed with jokes  sketches and song and dance routines that poked fun at his political rivals  One supporter in Kiev said corruption was the main issue for him  and he trusted in Zelenskiy s abilities as a manager and that he would put together a good leadership team   I work for a government agency and I know first hand how easy it is to steal a few million   said the 27 year old who declined to give his name   You can steal freely until someone notices    Reporting by Matthias Williams  Natalia Zinets  Pavel Polityuk and Polina Ivanova in KIEV  Tom

KIEV   Comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy is leading the race to become Ukraine s next president thanks to an insurgent campaign that rails against corrupt politicians influenced by rich oligarchs Yet it is his own relationship with one of the country s wealthiest tycoons that could prove an Achilles  heel One of Ukraine s most popular TV channels 1 1  owned by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky  has given Zelenskiy a powerful platform in recent months during his meteoric rise to the brink of the presidency On Saturday  a day before Zelenskiy won the first round of the presidential contest and set up a run off with the incumbent Petro Poroshenko  1 1 filled its schedule with back to back shows by the comedian and actor The fact that Zelenskiy is a major star on the channel has stoked worries among some investors and voters  and accusations from his political opponents  that he is in the pocket of Kolomoisky  Both Zelenskiy and Kolomoisky say their relationship is strictly professional  and centered on the comedian s TV work  Both say no undue influence is being exerted by the oligarch  whose businesses range from banking and energy to aviation  I m more his puppet than he is mine   Kolomoisky said last year   It is impossible to influence me   Zelenskiy told the news website Gordon in December   Neither Kolomoisky  nor any other oligarch  no one will influence me   Zelenskiy said last month he was in the process of exiting all his businesses  which includes the production company whose shows run on 1 1  Asked whether the relationship was a weak spot for him  Zelenskiy told Reuters   We are working according to TV contracts and it is fine  It is business  However President Poroshenko has sought to make political capital out of the connection between the two men as he fights to make up ground to the comedian before the run off vote on April 21   In the past few weeks my opponents have poured on me rivers of shameless lies  The main source of these lies in recent months   deplorable as it may be   has been 1 1  1 1 has turned into the obedient implementer of the political assignments of its owner   Poroshenko said   Though the latter may have fled abroad  he still plays the pre election political chessboard  sometimes moving the Ze  Zelenskiy  pieces  sometimes the Yu  former prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko  pieces  Kolomoisky is motivated by a desire for revenge against the state   he wrote on Twitter Kolomoisky has lived abroad since clashing with Poroshenko over Ukraine s largest bank  which he used to own  In a November interview to Ukrainian news site lb ua  he worried Ukraine s judicial system would stop him from leaving the country if he came back  Zelenskiy announced he was running for president on December 31 on 1 1  upstaging Poroshenko  who was giving a traditional New Year s Eve address to the nation at the same time On Saturday  the channel s Zelenskiy themed schedule included shows where he and fellow actors performed jokes  sketches and songs  and a documentary voiced by Zelenskiy about Ronald Reagan  a popular actor who became U S  president  Poroshenko is part of the same wealthy elite as Kolomoisky  having made a fortune from confectionery that earned him the sobriquet of  Chocolate King    The strategic dilemma will be what do you prefer  an oligarch or someone possibly controlled by an oligarch  the puppet or a puppeteer   said regional analyst and political consultant Radu Magdin   AM I THAT CRAZY  Kolomoisky makes no secret of his dislike for Poroshenko  and the two have clashed repeatedly over issues that threatened Kolomoisky s businesses  No hard evidence has been presented by any of Zelenskiy s opponents that Kolomoisky is indeed pulling the strings behind the campaign But the ties between the two men have led some political analysts and Western diplomats to question how zealously Zelenskiy would try to implement reforms needed to speed up economic growth and keep foreign aid flowing if they clashed with Kolomoisky s interests  In particular  the relationship puts the spotlight on the fate of PrivatBank  Ukraine s largest lender  which the government wrested from Kolomoisky in 2016 in a clean up of the banking system under an International Monetary Fund bailout program The government pumped billions of dollars into shoring up PrivatBank s finances  saying money had been fraudulently siphoned off from the lender while Kolomoisky owned it  Kolomoisky denied any wrongdoing and has challenged the nationalization in court Asked if there were concerns about Zelenskiy s ties to Kolomoisky  Edwin Gutierrez  head of Emerging Market Sovereign Debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments  said   That is there  but at the end of the day the oligarchs always rule the roost in Ukraine    Maybe this will be another Yanukovich moment where everyone gets excited but then in the end Ukraine disappoints   he added  referring to former President Viktor Yanukovich  who fled to Russia after the 2014 Maidan street protests  Asked in a Reuters interview whether he would hand PrivatBank back to Kolomoisky if elected  Zelenskiy said in February   Am I that crazy  Do I want to lose my life  reputation  Accusations from Poroshenko and his allies that Zelenskiy is being controlled by an oligarch has lent an ironic twist to the presidential race  Zelenskiy s campaign has been propelled by his TV show  Servant of the People  where he plays a scrupulously honest history schoolteacher who becomes president by accident  He challenges the old way of doing things  outwitting shadowy oligarchs and corrupt politicians  The series blurs the line between fiction and reality  between the make believe president and the real life challenger  In the first scene of the first series  three shadowy power brokers are surveying Kiev s Maidan square from a rooftop balcony at night while sipping drinks and talking about how they spend money to bring their puppet politicians to power  It s one week before the election  We worked hard for our candidates  They re almost neck and neck  now let the best man win   says one   What good will that bring me   asks another

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump is taking his interpretation of special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation well beyond the facts He says he s been fully exonerated based on a four page summary of Mueller s nearly 400 page report and is casting himself as a victim of illegal practices by the FBI because the agency investigated him in the first place But Trump is overstating his case  The FBI has legal grounds to open a probe if investigators have information they believe could lead them to a crime  even if one is not ultimately found  And the summary released by Attorney General William Barr says Mueller did not reach a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice Nor was the Russia probe hatched by Democrats  as Trump asserts  He often cites a so called dossier funded by the Democratic Party  but the probe s origins in fact were based on other evidence Trump s claims came in a week of plentiful exaggerations and misstatements  seen most prominently in a speech to Michigan supporters in which he sought credit for all manner of things  including money to clean up the Great Lakes  The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative actually was already getting that money   Trump had proposed slashing it Meanwhile  Democratic presidential candidate Beto O Rourke misstated the length of U S  involvement in the Iraq war A look at the political rhetoric and the facts RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONTRUMP   People were hurt so badly  so badly  Their lives have been ruined and over   you know  over something that should have never taken place  an investigation that should have never happened  There was no crime  as you know  You re only allowed to do this legally if there is a crime  There was no crime     Fox News interview Wednesday THE FACTS  Trump is wrong to suggest that the FBI acted illegally by investigating him  The FBI does not need to know if  or have evidence that  a crime occurred before it begins an investigation In fact  many investigations that are properly conducted ultimately don t find evidence of any crime  The FBI is empowered to open an investigation if there s information it has received or uncovered that leads the bureau to think it might encounter a crime  Apart from that  the investigation into the Trump campaign was initially a counterintelligence investigation rather than a strictly criminal one  as agents sought to understand whether and why Russia was meddling in the 2016 election    TRUMP   The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans  Many of them  they suffered  with an elaborate hoax     rally Thursday in Grand Rapids  Michigan THE FACTS  He falsely suggests that the Russia investigation was started by Democrats after losing the 2016 election Trump typically points to a dossier of anti Trump research financed by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton s campaign  which he incorrectly claims was the basis for the Russia probe  The research that was ultimately compiled into the dossier was initially financed by anti Trump conservatives  and later by the Democrats The FBI s investigation actually began months before it received the dossier Last year  the Republican controlled House Intelligence Committee found the Russia investigation was initiated after the FBI received information related to Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos  not the dossier  Trump praised the committee s final report at the time    TRUMP   Everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the No Collusion  No Obstruction Trump Campaign began     tweet Sunday TRUMP   After three years of lies and smears and slander  the Russia hoax is finally dead  The collusion delusion is over  The special counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction     Total exoneration  complete vindication     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Mueller did not vindicate Trump in  total  in the Russia probe  explicitly declining to clear him of obstruction Mueller s exact words in the report  as quoted by Barr  say   While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime  it also does not exonerate him  The summary of principal conclusions by Barr notes Mueller did not  draw a conclusion   one way or the other   as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction   but rather set out evidence for both sides  leaving the question unanswered of whether Trump obstructed justice  Barr wrote in the summary that ultimately he decided as attorney general that the evidence developed by Mueller was  not sufficient  to establish  for the purposes of prosecution  that Trump committed obstruction Barr s summary also notes that Mueller did not find that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 presidential election in Trump s favor  To establish a crime  Mueller must generally meet a standard of proving an offense beyond a reasonable doubt  The summary did not clear the president of improper behavior regarding Russia but did not establish that  he was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference   Mueller said in a passage from the report quoted by Barr The summary signed by Barr gave the bottom line only as he and his deputy saw it  Democrats are pushing for release of Mueller s full report  Barr is expected to release a public version of the document in the coming weeks    TRUMP  speaking about allegations in a so called dossier about contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election   It came out after the election and everybody had a big fat yawn     All of the sudden I hear   Were you involved with Russia  I say   Russia  What the hell does Russia have to do with my campaign      Michigan rally THE FACTS  Russia actually had plenty to do with Trump s campaign According to U S  intelligence agencies and lengthy indictments brought by Mueller s team  Russia orchestrated a multipart influence campaign aimed at hurting Clinton s candidacy  undermining American democracy and helping Trump get elected That effort included the hacking of the Democratic National Committee  Clinton s campaign and other Democratic groups  Russian intelligence officers then coordinated the release of stolen emails and internal documents There were also plenty of people around Trump receptive to Russia s help  though Mueller s report ultimately did not find that those contacts amounted to a criminal conspiracy  according to Barr s summary In the middle of the campaign  Donald Trump Jr  met at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer thinking he would be getting  dirt  on Clinton  Trump Jr  agreed to the meeting  which included Trump son in law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort  despite it being described to him as part of a Russian government effort to help his father    TRUMP   You look at all of the different things  Russia would ve much rather had Hillary than Donald Trump  I can tell you that right now     Fox News interview Wednesday THE FACTS  Not according to Russian President Vladimir Putin  Asked at a news conference with Trump in July whether he wanted Trump to win the 2016 election  Putin responded   Yes  I did   Putin said he favored Trump  because he talked about bringing the U S  Russia relationship back to normal     MIGRANT CHILDRENTRUMP  on the care of migrant children apprehended at the border and the Dec  8 death of Jakelin Caal Maquin  7  of Guatemala   I think that it s been very well stated that we ve done a fantastic job      The father gave the child no water for a long period of time   he actually admitted blame     to reporters Friday THE FACTS  That s a misrepresentation of the circumstances behind the girl s death as Trump seeks to steer any potential blame for it away from his administration  An autopsy report released Friday found she died of a bacterial infection just more than a day after being apprehended by the U S  Border Patrol  The El Paso County Medical Examiner s office said Jakelin experienced a  rapidly progressive infection  that led to the failure of multiple organs Neither the autopsy report  nor accounts at the time by Customs and Border Protection   spoke of dehydration  The Border Protection timeline on her case said she was checked for medical problems upon her apprehension and   The initial screening revealed no evidence of health issues   And through family lawyers  Nery Gilberto Caal Cuz said after his daughter s death that he had made sure she had food and water as they traveled through Mexico  He did not say her death was his fault    IRAQ WARO ROURKE   We will ensure that this country does not start yet another war before every peaceful  diplomatic  nonviolent alternative is explored and pursued  and those wars that we ask our fellow Americans  these service members  to fight on our behalf  17 years and counting in Afghanistan  27 years and counting in Iraq  let s bring these wars to a close     remarks Saturday in El Paso THE FACTS  The U S  has not been fighting in a military conflict in Iraq for  27 years and counting   The Iraq war started 16 years ago By O Rourke s count  U S  involvement would date back to 1992  in an apparent reference to Operation Desert Storm  which ended in February 1991  President George H W  Bush launched that operation in response to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein s invasion of Kuwait  Bush declared a ceasefire in 1991 There was no ongoing military conflict after 1991  In 2003  President George W  Bush  the elder Bush s son  authorized the invasion of Iraq by a U S  led coalition that toppled Saddam s government  Later known as the  Iraq War   that conflict was part of what the younger Bush described as a U S  war against terrorism following the Sept  11  2001  attacks    GREAT LAKESTRUMP   I support the Great Lakes  Always have  They are beautiful  They are big  very deep  record deepness  right  And I m going to get  in honor of my friends  full funding of  300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative  which you have been trying to get for over 30 years  So we will get it done     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Trump s recent budget proposal sought to cut federal financing of that program by 90 percent  His comment actually meant that his administration would   presumably   give up its efforts over the last few years to cut the program  which has been receiving about  300 million a year since 2010 His assertion that this money has eluded supporters of the lakes for three decades is wrong The program is popular with lawmakers from both parties and it was unlikely that the Trump cut would prevail Also  the Great Lakes are not the world s deepest  or even among the 20 deepest     SPECIAL OLYMPICSTRUMP   I have overridden my people  We re funding the Special Olympics     remarks to reporters Thursday THE FACTS  In this instance  unlike in the Great Lakes matter  Trump is acknowledging that it was his administration that had proposed to cut the money  though by blaming  my people  he did not take direct responsibility In any event  spending is up to Congress  not him  What he means is that the White House is dropping its budget proposal to deny federal money for the games    HEALTH CARETRUMP   We will always protect patients with pre existing conditions  always     Michigan rally THE FACTS  He s not protecting health coverage for patients with pre existing medical conditions  In fact  the Trump administration is pressing in court for full repeal of the Affordable Care Act   including provisions that protect people with pre existing conditions from health insurance discrimination Trump and other Republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve those safeguards  but the White House has provided no details  And it s a stretch to think they could get a Republicans only plan passed through Congress with the House under Democratic control President Barack Obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants  regardless of medical history  and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones  Bills supported in 2017 by Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions    TRUMP   The Republican Party will become the party of great health care      Republicans want you to have an affordable plan that s just right for you     Michigan rally TRUMP   If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out  we will have a plan that s far better than Obamacare     remarks Wednesday to reporters THE FACTS  Republicans may aspire to great health care but they don t have a comprehensive plan for it  And there s no indication that the White House  executive branch agencies like Health and Human Services  and Republicans in Congress are working on one Trump s recent budget called for repealing  Obamacare  and setting hard limits on federal spending for Medicaid  which covers low income people  Some Republicans argue that would be better  because the federal government would create a new program of health care grants to states  But when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed similar proposals a couple of years ago  it estimated such changes would result in deep coverage losses  not to mention weaker insurance protections for people with pre existing medical conditions Trump s budget also called for hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare cuts to hospitals and other service providers  a nonstarter with lawmakers in Congress worried about re election next year The Supreme Court has upheld the health care law twice in previous challenges  The five justices who first upheld it in 2012 are still on the court Congressional Republicans are generally trying to steer away from Obamacare spats  Some are trying to focus on areas where they might find common ground with Democrats and the president  such as reducing prescription drug costs    AUTOSTRUMP   We are bringing a lot of those car companies back      They are pouring back in    Michigan rally TRUMP   We re opening up car plants in Michigan again for the first time in decades  They re coming in  really pouring in      And this has been happening pretty much since I ve been president  It s really amazing what s going on     We ve brought back so much industry  so many car companies to Michigan  so we re very happy     remarks Thursday while departing for Michigan THE FACTS  There is very little truth in those remarks The only automaker announcing plans to reopen a plant in Michigan is Fiat Chrysler  which is restarting an old engine plant to build three row SUVs  It s been planning to do so since before Trump was elected  GM is even closing two Detroit area factories  one that builds cars and another that builds transmissions Automakers have made announcements about new models being built in the state  but no other factories have been reopened  Ford stopped building the Focus compact car in the Detroit suburb of Wayne last year  but it s being replaced by the manufacture of a small pickup and a new SUV  That announcement was made in December 2016  before Trump took office GM  meantime  is closing factories in Ohio and Maryland Trump can plausibly claim that his policies have encouraged some activity in the domestic auto industry  Corporate tax cuts freed more money for investment  and potential tariff increases on imported vehicles are an incentive to build in the U S But automakers have not been  pouring in  at all  as he persistently claims  and when expansion does happen  it s not all because of him Fiat Chrysler has been planning the SUVs for several years and has been looking at expansion in the Detroit area  where it has unused building space and an abundant  trainable automotive labor force Normally it takes at least three years for an automaker to plan a new vehicle  which is the case with the three row Jeep Grand Cherokee and the larger Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs that will fill the restarting Detroit area plant and an existing one  Several years ago then CEO Sergio Marchionne said the Wagoneer would be built in the Detroit area Detroit automakers usually build larger vehicles in the U S  because the profit margins are high enough to cover the higher wages paid there versus Mexico or another lower cost country    IMMIGRATIONTRUMP  on diversity visas   They are giving us their worst people     Michigan rally THE FACTS  That s false The diversity visa lottery program is run by the U S  government  not foreign governments  Other countries do not get to sort through their populations looking for bad apples to put in for export to the U S  Citizens of qualifying countries are the ones who decide to bid for visas under the program  Trump routinely blames foreign states The program requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the last five years in a selection of fields  Out of that pool of people from certain countries who meet those conditions  the State Department randomly selects a much smaller pool of winners  Not all winners will have visas ultimately approved  because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly  Those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks  like other immigrants The lottery is extended to citizens of most countries  except about 20  The primary goal is to diversify the immigrant population by creating slots for underrepresented parts of the world    JOBSTRUMP   We have created  since my election  5 5 million new jobs  Nobody would have believed that was possible     Michigan rally THE FACTS  His number is about right  but he s counting jobs created before he became president  And the progress does not defy belief  The economy created about 6 million jobs in the roughly two years before the election  then again in the roughly two years after    VETERANSTRUMP   They ve been trying to get VA Choice for over 40 years  Couldn t do it  I got it  We signed it six months ago     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Not true  He s not the first president in 40 years to get Congress to pass a private sector health program for veterans  he expanded it  Congress first approved the program in 2014 during the Obama administration  The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles  65 kilometers  to a VA facility Now  starting in June  they are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days  28 for specialty care  or their drive is only 30 minutes    TRUMP   Instead of waiting online for one day  one week  two months    now they go outside  they see a private doctor  we pay the bill  they get better quickly     Michigan rally THE FACTS  Also not right  Veterans still must wait for weeks before they can get private care outside the VA system And the expanded Choice eligibility may do little to provide immediate help  That s because veterans often must wait even longer for an appointment in the private sector  Last year  then Secretary David Shulkin said VA care is  often 40 percent better in terms of wait times  compared with the private sector  In 2018  34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians  down from 36 percent in 2017 At a hearing Tuesday  the top health official at VA  Dr  Richard Stone  described the start of the expanded Choice program to  almost be a non event   in part because wait times in the private sector are typically longer than at VA The VA also must resolve long term financing because of congressional budget caps after the White House opposed new money to pay for the program  As a result  lawmakers could be forced later this year to limit the program or slash core VA or other domestic programs    Associated Press writers Ricardo Alonso Zaldivar and Chad Day in

BRASILIA   Brazilian Economy Minister Paulo Guedes on Wednesday put up a vigorous defence of the government s proposed pension reform  insisting it is critical to fixing the country s  doomed  social security system but opening the door to some concessions In often heated and combative exchanges with lawmakers at Brazil s Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee  CCJ   Guedes said the proposals were progressive  would reduce inequality  and were urgently needed to address Brazil s  inescapable  fiscal problems  The hearing s confrontational atmosphere  however  weighed on Brazilian markets  on fears political infighting may hold up deliberations on the bill  Stocks fell 0 9 percent  the real weakened and interest rates futures rose Elmar Nascimento  lower house whip for the DEM party  the government s main ally in Congress  said in a tweet that Guedes may have to come back to the committee to fully explain what the impact of the new rules will be  The government needs to intensify its efforts to convince lawmakers and the public that reforms must reduce  pension  benefits   Nascimento said Guedes recognised that proposed changes to rural  elderly and disabled workers  pensions are a sensitive issue  adding that the role of Congress would be to weigh those concerns and act on them He also defended the introduction of private retirement accounts  which he called fairer and more helpful for boosting economic growth  citing the example of Chile s system   It s important to understand that our system is financially doomed  no matter the government in power   Guedes told the CCJ President Jair Bolsonaro s plans aim to save over 1 trillion reais   260 billion  over the next decade through a range of reforms including raising the minimum retirement age and making workers contribute to the system for longer Bolsonaro and Guedes have been heavily criticized for not reaching out to lawmakers to build the political consensus needed to secure the bill s passage through Congress  Guedes has tried to strike a more conciliatory tone lately  but that was not in evidence on Wednesday  Venezuela s better  Venezuela s good   Guedes responded sarcastically in a heated exchange with deputies who had shouted down his praise for Chile   Speak up  I can t hear you   Guedes goaded ironically  before shouting and finger pointing later in the session Guedes insisted that his role in pension reform is only to put forward the proposals  not to enter the political debate The government needs at least 308 of the 513 lower house deputies to approve the reforms  sending them to the Senate  A survey run by transparency group Atlas Politico on Wednesday showed that the government currently has the support of 171 deputies   Reporting by Jamie McGeever  Marcela Ayres and Maria Carolina Marcello  editing by Rosalba O Brien  Susan Thomas and Leslie Adler  

As President Abdel Fattah el Sisi of Egypt prepares constitutional changes that could keep him in power until 2034 and enhance military control over the country  President Trump is preparing to welcome him to the White House  This is the second time Mr  Trump will bestow this diplomatic gift on Mr  el Sisi  one of the most authoritarian leaders in the Middle East After taking power in a 2013 coup that ousted the country s first elected president  the Islamist Mohamed Morsi  Mr  el Sisi  a former army chief  promised his people that he would build democracy and leave office in 2022 after completing a second term Instead  he has built a reputation for brutality and repression  torturing and killing hundreds of Egyptians and jailing perhaps as many as 60 000 others  including students and American citizens It is not unusual for American presidents to work with strongmen to advance national interests  But if Mr  Trump welcomes Mr  el Sisi to Washington now  without pressing him for reforms rather than acquiescing to his power grab  he will be crushing hopes that Egypt could become democratic any time soon Mr  el Sisi made his move in February when the rubber stamp Parliament gave preliminary approval to a package of amendments to Egypt s 2014 Constitution  which was adopted after the 2011 Arab Spring uprising ended the 30 year rule of President Hosni Mubarak  leading to Mr  Morsi s election In addition to extending presidential terms to six years from four  and allowing him to run two more times  the amendments would grant the armed forces expansive authority to intervene in the government  give Mr  el Sisi more control over appointing senior judges and provide military courts broader jurisdiction to try civilians A final parliamentary vote is due by mid April  then the amendments are supposed to be submitted to a referendum  But officials are stifling all dissent No members of the political opposition have been allowed to participate in the government s national dialogue sessions on the changes  Several people who posted videos on Facebook criticizing the amendments have been arrested  Two Egyptian actors who criticized Mr  el Sisi on a panel with a congressman in Washington last week were subsequently expelled from their union  which accused them of treason There s been no pushback on any of this from Mr  Trump  who has shown great affection for autocrats  fawning over Mr  el Sisi on his first White House visit  in 2017 Mr  Trump might be able to salvage the April 9 visit if he warns that some of the  1 3 billion in annual American military aid could be at risk if the Egyptian leader doesn t pursue a democratic path  For many years  the United States has been reluctant to use aid as leverage  concerned that doing so could jeopardize Egypt s peace treaty with Israel  along with American access to the Suez Canal  overflight rights and counterterrorism cooperation  But peace with Israel  international use of the canal and cooperating in the fight against terrorism are in Egypt s own interest  and they are unlikely to be abandoned if America stands up for democratic principles Under pressure from Congress  which set certain conditions for aid  the Trump administration in 2017 temporarily withheld  300 million  That helped persuade Egypt to acquit employees of several American and European institutes who were charged for doing democracy related work and to suspend implementation of a law cracking down on such groups  Millions more dollars from 2018 and 2019 are being held in abeyance pending certification that Egypt met congressional conditions  congressional sources said  If Mr  Trump will not call Mr  el Sisi to account  Congress can try  American aid should not come in a blank check  Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee  has placed a hold on  105 million of aid to get Egypt to compensate April Corley  the American injured in 2015 when Egypt s armed forces  using American weapons  mistakenly shot up a tourist group  Mr  Leahy also wants more clarity about Egypt s secretive military campaign against an Islamic State group in Sinai  Barring a principled response to Mr  el Sisi  the United States will be further complicit in shoring up his military dictatorship  disenfranchising most Egyptians and fueling the kind of

ISTANBUL   Turkey s opposition looked poised to win control of the country s two biggest cities Monday as it dealt President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s conservative party one of its most serious electoral setbacks in years  The opposition won Ankara  a ruling party stronghold for decades  and was leading a tight race for mayor in Istanbul  according to unofficial figures Monday The leader who has dominated Turkish politics for 16 years declared victory despite the opposition gains Sunday s local elections were widely seen as a gauge of support for Erdogan as the nation of 81 million faces a daunting economic recession  They were also a first test for Erdogan   who has been accused of increasingly authoritarian tendencies   since he got widely expanded presidential powers last year If confirmed  the swings in Ankara and Istanbul could be excruciating for the politician who campaigned hard to retain hold of them  The opposition also retained its hold over Izmir  Turkey s third largest city Although Erdogan was not running for office Sunday  he became the face of the campaign  rallying tirelessly for months across Turkey  using hostile rhetoric against opposition parties and portraying the vote as a matter of national survival The decline in urban support for his conservative  religious based party came despite the fact that Erdogan wields tight control over the media  which hardly covered the opposition candidates  campaigns Behlul Ozkan  an associate professor at Marmara University  said Erdogan s loss of ground in Ankara and Istanbul indicated that his socially conservative and construction driven policies no longer resonated in Turkey s cities  Political Islam s quarter century old hegemony in Turkey s two largest cities is over   he said   The basic problem is that Erdogan is not able to get votes from middle income earners  who believe that the economy  education and urban administration are not run well  More than 57 million voters were eligible to choose leaders for 30 major cities  51 provincial capitals and 922 districts in Turkey  as well as thousands of local positions  The election was marred by sporadic violence  with five dead and scores injured across Turkey Erdogan s party and its nationalist allies garnered some 52  of the vote overall but the opposition made momentous inroads A strategic decision by a pro Kurdish party to sit out critical races in major cities contributed to the opposition s gains  The opposition also increased its support along the Mediterranean  taking the city of Adana from the nationalists and the resort destination of Antalya from the ruling party Erdogan acknowledged setbacks in a speech to his supporters  saying his party would work to understand what had gone wrong and fix the problem Unofficial results reported by the state run Anadolu news agency after all votes were counted showed a razor thin win for the opposition in the race for mayor of Istanbul  Turkey s largest city and commercial hub  The opposition vote was at 48 8  support to the ruling party s 48 5  support Ekrem Imamoglu  the opposition candidate in an alliance led by the secular Republican People s Party  or CHP  declared that he won Istanbul but his rival  former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim of the ruling party  said it was still too early to call Yildirim accepted that his rival was leading but said his party would file an objection  suggesting a recount of the 319 500 votes declared void in Istanbul  Both Ankara and Istanbul have been held by Erdogan s Justice and Development Party  the AKP  and its Islamic oriented predecessor for 25 years  Erdogan s own ascent to power began as Istanbul mayor in 1994 Unofficial results showed Mansur Yavas  the candidate of the CHP led alliance  winning the top post in Ankara with 50 9  support  The AKP still holds a majority of Ankara s 25 districts  The government had accused Yavas of forgery and tax evasion  which he called slanderous The AKP s candidate for Ankara mayor  Mehmet Ozhaseki  won 47 1  support and his party said it would challenge the results Sunday s election was a significant victory for the opposition  which displayed good strategies and promising candidates  said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli  the Ankara director of the German Marshall Fund  This will certainly lead to an emerging new political landscape in Turkey   he said He argued  however  that a pause in elections until 2023 would benefit Erdogan  This gives the governing party and President Erdogan a window of opportunity to undertake economic reforms  political reforms if they wish  fix Turkey s relations with foreign countries   he said Andrew Dawson  head of the Council of Europe s election observation mission  said Monday his monitors were  not fully convinced that Turkey currently has the free and fair electoral environment which is necessary for genuinely democratic elections  In predominantly Kurdish provinces  the Peoples  Democratic Party  or HDP  won back some seats from government appointed trustees  including the symbolic capital of Diyarbakir  but lost several former strongholds to the ruling party The government has replaced 95 elected officials since 2016 for alleged links to outlawed Kurdish militants Dawson urged the Turkish government to respect the election results Political parties have three days to submit objections and official results are expected in the coming days   Fraser reported from Ankara  Mehmet Guzel contributed from Istanbul

CHICAGO   Adrianne Burton  38  believes that the next mayor of Chicago will have a sharper  more empathetic eye on the public schools  Carolyn Davenport  62  is confident that the new mayor will be a superior manager  accustomed to running a career and a household without any fuss On her lunch break in the Loop  Denise Thompson  54  had a different view   We re making history  sure   she said   But a black woman running the city will be just like anybody else  On Tuesday  Chicagoans were headed to the polls to vote for a successor to Mayor Rahm Emanuel  Residents were choosing between two African American women  guaranteeing that Chicago will become the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor  Read more about the Chicago election for mayor that resulted in a win for Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to run the city  Competing in the runoff election are Lori Lightfoot  a lawyer and former federal prosecutor  and Toni Preckwinkle  the president of the Cook County Board and the chairwoman of the county s Democratic Party  Both women beat out 12 other candidates in an election in February  a who s who of well known names that made up the most crowded ballot in municipal history As the voting began  the historic nature of the election was greeted in Chicago with both pride and nonchalance  a sense that electing an African American woman as mayor would be significant  but not seismic  Here s more on Chicago s election  Maybe it is because Chicago has already seen such milestones  sending the first African American president  Barack Obama  to the White House  helping elect the first African American woman to the United States Senate  Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois  in 1992  and making Harold Washington the city s first black mayor in 1983  It is tremendous   said Josie Brown Childs  a civic leader who worked for Mr  Washington in the 1980s   But Chicago has been on the forefront of certain black politics  whether it was with Harold or Obama  We ve been in the lead on those things  In interviews around the city during the run up to the election  Chicagoans said they were carefully weighing the platforms and promises of Ms  Preckwinkle and Ms  Lightfoot  watching their performances in televised debates and considering what kind of leader the current moment in Chicago demands ImageJosie Brown Childs  a civic leader who worked for Harold Washington in the 1980s  at her South Shore home CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York Times For me  personally  I m asking   Who is going to be the break from politics as usual in Chicago    said Jordie Davies  a Ph D  candidate at the University of Chicago whose dissertation focuses on political activism   I m excited about two black women  But I m looking at records  I m looking at who is going to offer the most holistic platform for addressing problems in Chicago  Deidre Baumann  50  a lawyer who cast her vote Tuesday at a library in the Budlong Woods neighborhood on the North Side  said she would be happy with whichever candidate prevailed  Either way  this is a historic election   she said She watched the debates and studied the candidates  records carefully  she said  deciding in the end to vote for Ms  Lightfoot  who she believed would bring her experience as a federal prosecutor to push for criminal justice reform  Here s what you need to know about Lori Lightfoot  the first black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago and the first openly gay mayor for the city   We have to make this city safe for all the citizens and the police   Ms  Baumann said   On the other hand  we cannot continue to incarcerate black and brown people in disparate numbers  In her eyes  Ms  Preckwinkle represented an older political model   I m disturbed a bit by her ties to the machine   she said   She always touted herself as the progressive candidate  She s had to move away from that as she navigated the political system in Chicago  The new mayor must contend with a host of complicated issues in the nation s third largest city  including a deep pension crisis  persistent violent crime  reform of the police department and the question of how to spur investment and growth in long neglected and segregated neighborhoods on Chicago s West and South Sides  Under Mr  Emanuel  the downtown has boomed  flourishing with tech companies  high rise hotels  a sparkling riverfront and luxury apartments  But many African American residents have moved out of the city in recent years  Mr  Emanuel  who was elected to two terms  did not seek a third term in office Polls have suggested that Ms  Lightfoot has a commanding lead over Ms  Preckwinkle  who entered the race last September after Mr  Emanuel announced that he would not run again  Ms  Preckwinkle garnered endorsements from powerful labor groups   the Chicago Teachers Union and the Service Employees International Union   and from prominent black leaders including Jesse White  the secretary of state In the part of Chicago s South Side that Ms  Preckwinkle once represented in the City Council  voters remembered her tenure fondly  Bob Kurth  76  a longtime resident of the Kenwood neighborhood  said Ms  Preckwinkle came through years ago when he complained about a hole in the street near his condo building  She was approachable  If you had a problem that was part of the ward  you called her and you had a meeting with her   Mr  Kurth said on Tuesday after voting for Ms  Preckwinkle   You saw her on the street  she always had time to talk to you  ImageLori Lightfoot and Toni Preckwinkle before the start of their final on air debate CreditMichelle V  Agins The New York TimesMs  Preckwinkle s long stint in government was not a deterrent  With Toni  she didn t start as a politician  and that means a lot to me   said Mr  Kurth  a retired salesman   She s learned how to play the game  but I don t consider her a part of it  Others saw Ms  Preckwinkle s years in political office as a concern  The fact Ms  Lighftoot had not served in elective office helped her earn the vote of Michelle Saulnier  29  a Ph D  student  It s a good thing  especially in Chicago where there s known to be a lot of corruption   Ms  Saulnier said after casting her ballot in the Logan Square neighborhood  where Ms  Lightfoot lives and her campaign signs abound   I think that s really important to try to break some of these cycles that we re in    Ms  Lightfoot had a head start on the campaign trail  declaring her candidacy for mayor in May 2018  when it was widely believed that she would face off against Mr  Emanuel A relatively unknown figure who has never held elective office  Ms  Lightfoot has spent time introducing herself to voters as a candidate who would focus on overhauling the police department  curbing street violence and rebuilding neighborhoods beyond the affluent downtown and North Side  Ra Joy  an entrepreneur in Chicago who was a candidate for lieutenant governor in 2018  endorsed Ms  Lightfoot early in the race  he said on Saturday at a candidate forum at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition on the South Side A mayoral contest between two African American women has scrambled the usual political calculus in Chicago  or what Mr  Joy called  tribal voting   in which politicians could count on support from voters of their own race  It s turned that notion on its head   he said  adding that the successful candidate would have to build coalitions of Latinos  whites and African Americans in a city where the population is almost evenly divided among the three groups Celestine A  Strain  46  a hospital technician  brought her granddaughter Kalicia  9  to the forum at Rainbow PUSH  hoping Kalicia would someday remember seeing two black women running for mayor of Chicago  It s amazing for her to see   Ms  Strain said  adding that she was hoping Ms  Preckwinkle  who has been a familiar face in county government for years  would emerge victorious on Tuesday   I really believe that she has the right experience  The Rev  Jesse Jackson offered no endorsement in the race  saying that he hoped to be more of a peacemaker after what played out in recent weeks as a bitter campaign  On stage on Saturday  he urged both candidates to sign a statement agreeing to appear together the morning after the election   I wanted to play a reconciling role   Mr  Jackson said in an interview in his office at Rainbow PUSH   The campaign ends  Let the healing begin   

KUALA LUMPUR  Malaysia   Najib Razak  the former prime minister who sat at the pinnacle of a political machine that dominated Malaysia for more than 60 years  on Wednesday began to face the first of multiple corruption trials stemming from the disappearance of billions in public funds The allegations of graft at 1Malaysia Development Berhad  or 1MDB  the state owned investment fund he founded  led to widespread public anger and to Mr  Najib s electoral defeat last year  The upheaval reoriented Malaysian politics and left the former leader  who was once considered untouchable  facing the prospect of decades in prison  This is a sea change for Malaysian politics for the very simple reason that for the first time a former head of government has been charged with corruption   said James Chin  director of Asia Institute Tasmania at the University of Tasmania Mr  Najib  65  went on trial in Kuala Lumpur  the capital  as part of one of the biggest corruption cases in history to go to court  He faces dozens of charges over allegations of graft at 1MDB  which lost  4 5 billion that prosecutors in Malaysia and the United States say was funneled to his circle  including  731 million that went into his own bank accounts The scandal has tarnished the reputation and economy of Malaysia s government  which has long prided itself as being a thriving leader within Southeast Asia  Now  it is facing a  250 billion national debt that ballooned in part because of 1MDB s heavy borrowing Mr  Najib s first trial  which began on the 10th anniversary of the day he was sworn in as prime minister  will cover a sliver of the accusations of wrongdoing  He will face seven charges of criminal breach of trust  abuse of power and money laundering involving  10 million that prosecutors say was transferred from SRC International  formerly a 1MDB subsidiary  into Mr  Najib s accounts The trial had been delayed for months  and on Wednesday Mr  Najib s lawyers unsuccessfully sought another pause Tommy Thomas  the attorney general of Malaysia  told the court that Mr  Najib had once  wielded near absolute power   noting that it was the first time a former prime minister had faced trial in Malaysia  The accused is not above the law  and his prosecution and this trial should serve as precedents for all future holders of this august office   Mr  Thomas said Initially quiet after his electoral defeat  Mr  Najib has been increasingly vocal on social media  professing his innocence and criticizing the governing coalition His wife  Rosmah Mansor  who is well known for her taste in luxury items like designer pursues and multimillion dollar pieces of jewelry  is facing 17 counts of money laundering and tax evasion  She has pleaded not guilty The purported mastermind of the schemes  the Malaysian financier Jho Low  faces charges in Malaysia and the United States  but he remains at large and is believed to be in China  His representatives have said that he denies wrongdoing and they call the case against him politically motivated Prosecutors have outlined a staggering list of things the money was spent on  a  250 million yacht named Equanimity  works of art by Monet and van Gogh  properties in California  London and New York  jewelry  including a 22 carat pink necklace worth  27 3 million  the production of Hollywood films and a see through piano Mr  Low gave to the Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr  Ms  Kerr has surrendered jewelry given by Mr  Low and has offered to give up the piano  but it was walled into her Malibu  Calif   home  complicating removal  The Malaysian government announced Wednesday that it sold the yacht  which was seized in Indonesia last year  for  126 million to Genting Malaysia  a casino and resort company Last year  the Malaysian authorities said they seized jewelry  purses and other valuables worth at least  273 million and cash worth  30 million from properties owned by Mr  Najib and Ms  Rosmah  Counting the cash alone required 22 officials using six bill counting machines over three days Malaysia has also filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs  accusing the Wall Street bank of making false and misleading statements and defrauding investors by raising more than  6 billion for 1MDB  The bank apologized for the role of a former partner who pleaded guilty to charges in the United States and it has sought to distance itself from the scandal The 1MDB case  as well as concerns about debt to China that piled up at a staggering rate under Mr  Najib s rule  has been a rallying point for the administration of Mahathir Mohamad  the 93 year old former mentor and ally of Mr  Najib who returned to the prime minister s post last year vowing to clean up the mess But some of the shine has already come off Mr  Mahathir s administration  which brought together an unlikely and potentially unruly collection of political blocs with little in common Mr  Mahathir has faced criticism over Malaysia s rising cost of living  and he has been pressured to speed up plans to let Anwar Ibrahim  a former opposition leader who was released from prison last year  succeed him Mr  Najib s first trial was scheduled to begin in February  but was delayed by a series of legal moves by his defense In recent months he has become a more vocal presence  campaigning in support of his party s candidate in a March special election  crooning in a cover of a 1970s R B song and embracing the nickname  bossku   or my boss  given by his supporters The candidate from United Malays National Organization  Mr  Najib s party  won the special election  taking a seat from the ruling coalition  which was seen as a sign of bubbling discontent with Mr  Mahathir s government Mr  Chin said he believed Mr  Najib s public relations efforts were based on the belief that if his party were to return to power  he could receive a royal pardon  He truly believes he will get away with it   Mr  Chin said  

At some point soon  Joe Biden is going to have to make two decisions  The first is whether he wants to run for the Democratic nomination  The second is whether he wants to win it  and at what cost Right now  even after some slippage  Biden has the highest polling numbers of any candidate in the race  He also has a record that s completely out of step with his party s activists and ideologists  a highly   familiar personal style that promises further accusations like the ones already leveled by Lucy Flores and Amy Lappos  and a base of support that s roughly as old as he is The combination makes it easy to imagine Biden running a campaign that ends up feeling like an apology tour  in which he talks endlessly about how much he has learned and grown since the days when he was a tough on crime Democrat who opposed school busing and sometimes voted for late term abortion limits  Some of the ideas apparently bandied about by his aides   a one term pledge  Stacey Abrams as a running mate    fit with this strategy  in which the goal would be to establish Biden as a temporary bridge to a woker future  a candidate ready to put his moderate past behind him and serve the new liberal consensus That kind of Biden campaign would probably lose  Indeed  it would probably lose   I know this is harsh   as badly as Jeb Bush did Why  Because in a big primary field  with a lot of flavors available to voters  it s very hard to hold your base if you aren t giving that base a clear reason to vote for you  And the only reason anyone would affirmatively want to vote for Biden is the same reason so many liberals now despise the very idea of his candidacy  because he has that moderate record  because he s closer to the political center than many of his critics  because he s out of step with what Matt Yglesias of Vox recently called  the Great Awokening    the sudden leftward turn on issues of race and immigration and identity The key point here is that while the Great Awokening has transformed the Democratic Party  it hasn t entirely eliminated the constituency for a Bill Clintonian form of moderation  The party has embraced left wing ideas about structural racism  but there are still lots of Democratic voters   minority voters included  as white liberals have outpaced blacks and Hispanics in their wokeness   who would endorse the rhetoric of personal responsibility and colorblindness that the party s activists now disdain as  respectability politics   The party is more zealously pro choice than ever  but there are still Democrats who identify as pro life  the party is vigorously pro  MeToo  but there are still Democrats  the Al Franken constituency and others  who worry that the movement has gone too far And that s just social issues  You can find similar constituencies who aren t yet sold on the full social democratic agenda  who still find the old Clinton era mix of middle class tax cuts and targeted spending more appealing than the Bernie Sanders turn These groups   a mix of older white Democrats  culturally moderate African Americans and Hispanics  and anti Trump suburbanites   probably don t amount to a primary season majority  But they might add up to a large plurality in a divided field  which could easily be enough to win the nomination   It s how Sanders will win it  if he does   with a very different plurality  of course   and it s how Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016  To unite this plurality  though  Biden would have to actually appeal to them openly and directly  which would require taking ownership of his record  not defending everything  not avoiding all apologies  but arguing explicitly that some tough on crime policies were a necessary response to a destructive multi decade crime wave  that some moderation on abortion should be acceptable in the Democratic Party and that the Ocasio Cortezan turn on economic policy should be questioned or resisted  And  yes  defending his personal familiarity  hugs and nose rubs and hair kisses and all  and in the process questioning some aspects of  MeToo Absent that argument  in a primary where Biden is just an old white dude running away from his record  the party s various moderate voters will almost certainly fracture and go to fresher candidates with cleaner pitches   to the Texan Jesus or the South Bend Meritocrat or the Mean Minnesotan or the Racial Optimist   That would be Beto O Rourke  Pete Buttigieg  Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker  respectively   none of whom are likely to challenge the Great Awokening directly  but all of whom offer something to Democratic voters wary of the left  However  To run the way I m suggesting  on his record rather than against it  would exact a possibly extraordinary cost  Just to campaign this way would make Biden hated by many liberals in a way that would make today s Twitter animosity look mild  To win the nomination this way would produce fury on a scale that far eclipsed the pro Sanders anger in 2016 and guarantee a strong 2020 showing for Jill Stein s grifter left  if not a more sincere alternative   And to lose the nomination this way   which would remain  obviously  a strong possibility   would ensure that Biden exited the stage of liberal politics not as an elder statesman but as a wrong side of history bad guy Naturally I d still like Biden to try it   not least because some of the party s Reagan and Clinton era compromises were Actually Good  and it would be good for today s Democrats if a prominent Democrat defended them  But even as a biased outsider to Democratic politics  I can see why Biden would shrink from the strategy  shrink from dividing his party by challenging its new consensus  shrink from being hated by his co partisans If so  though  I hope he has

WASHINGTON   He flew across the ocean to celebrate NATO s 70th anniversary with the largest and most important member of the military alliance  So to outsiders it appeared to be an awkward moment on Tuesday for Jens Stoltenberg  the NATO secretary general  as he sat stiffly by while President Trump criticized German defense spending and predicted that the United States would get along with Russia  I accept there are differences  but when it comes to defense spending we all agree   Mr  Stoltenberg said in an interview after his meeting with Mr  Trump  putting a positive spin on the situation He said the president had helped push member states to budget an additional  100 billion in defense spending and credited Mr  Trump with  having a real impact   I say that because it is a fact   Mr  Stoltenberg said   Allies are now really stepping up  But not all  Germany will most likely slow the growth of its defense spending   meaning that Europe s economic powerhouse will defy a spending target set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  And other member states are struggling to reach the current goal of spending 2 percent of their economic output on the military by the end of 2024 The scene on Tuesday was just the latest example of Mr  Stoltenberg s unenviable efforts to bridge seemingly irreconcilable positions between Europe and the United States He is the European leader who has shown the most deft hand with Mr  Trump  A trained statistician  Mr  Stoltenberg came to the White House with charts showing how defense spending has risen But his credit of Mr  Trump for the spending increases has annoyed European leaders  He is a little too diplomatic   said Jim Townsend  a former Pentagon official who oversaw relations with NATO and is now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security   Sometimes he has a hard time whacking an ally over the head  Mr  Stoltenberg has sought to balance Mr  Trump against German politicians  who have made clear they are sick of the president s demands  The challenge will only grow throughout this week as Mr  Stoltenberg appears before members of Congress to praise both their support of the military alliance and Mr  Trump s drive for a more equitable share of military burdens Germany this year is putting 1 35 percent of its gross domestic product toward defense spending  and in 2020 will spend 1 37 percent  New budget projections by Berlin show Germany will spend 1 25 percent of its economic output by 2023 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the defense minister  Ursula von der Leyen  have said they remain committed to the 2 percent goal   Germany will keep its promise   Ms  von der Leyen said Tuesday on German public radio Hours later  fueling the pressure  Mr  Trump said member states should spend potentially even more than 2 percent on defense In the Oval Office  Mr  Stoltenberg sat stone faced as Mr  Trump criticized Germany for  not paying their fair share   The president also predicted   I think we ll get along with Russia   ImageGerman armored vehicles and an American helicopter during NATO led exercises  Germany s defense spending levels fall below what President Trump is demanding from alliance members CreditIrakli Gedenidze ReutersSince 2014  NATO has deployed military forces to Eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression  It has also intensified efforts to rebuild European militaries that have eroded since the end of the Cold War But the alliance faces an array of challenges it has not previously confronted  and does not yet know how to tackle   including Russian interference in elections and domestic politics  and China s economic investments in telecommunications networks In the interview with The New York Times  Mr  Stoltenberg suggested the alliance s policy on Russia was consistent with Mr  Trump s desire for better relations  He pointed to the cooperation by his own home country  Norway  with Russia on fisheries and other matters  We now have a strong  common understanding of how to approach Russia   Mr  Stoltenberg said   Those allies who were skeptical of dialogue with Russia have seen that we have delivered on deterrence and defense  The gatherings to commemorate NATO s anniversary were originally planned as a week of events in Washington for heads of state and government  But Mr  Trump s angry speeches  public and private  at other alliance gatherings over the last two years persuaded allies to downgrade the anniversary celebration to a meeting of foreign ministers The goal  according to current and former American and European officials  was to limit Mr  Trump s participation Even Tuesday s meeting with Mr  Trump was not originally on Mr  Stoltenberg s agenda  But then Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had invited the NATO chief to address Congress  a speech that is scheduled for Wednesday European officials said Mr  Stoltenberg had not yet accepted the invitation when Ms  Pelosi announced it  That put him in the position of potentially leaving Washington without seeing the president but addressing the Democrat led House  which has approved a measure that seeks to block Mr  Trump from withdrawing from the military alliance Last week  NATO made the unusual move of extending Mr  Stoltenberg s term a second time  by two more years  meaning he would leave office in 2022  It is an acknowledgment of Mr  Stoltenberg s deft touch not just with Mr  Trump  but also with other difficult alliance leaders  including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary Mr  Trump endorsed the extension on Tuesday   I had no doubt in my mind who I wanted   he said European officials said their worries about Mr  Stoltenberg s cozy relationship with Mr  Trump were pushed aside  largely to avoid giving the president an outsize role in selecting a new NATO leader  Mr  Stoltenberg was scheduled to step down in 2020  at the height of an intense election in the United States In the interview with The Times  Mr  Stoltenberg said he had consulted with Ms  Merkel  and noted that the new budget unveiled by Germany was not final  Germany has submitted a spending plan to NATO that shows defense spending rising by 80 percent between 2014 and 2024  he said  adding that he expected Berlin to live up to that plan  The Germans have told me it will further increase   he said Friction is growing in Germany  The Social Democrats  Ms  Merkel s center left coalition partners who control the finance ministry and were in charge of the latest budget plan  are using the dislike of Mr  Trump in their election campaign ahead of European parliamentary elections in May Julianne Smith  a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin and a former Obama administration national security official  said the Social Democrats were using the military budget to show they were the party  that stands up to Donald Trump   This decision became a bit of a referendum on Donald Trump  instead of a referendum on Germany s hollowed out forces that desperately need these resources   she said  

WASHINGTON   Former U S  Vice President Joe Biden attempted on Wednesday to tamp down a controversy over allegations of unwanted physical contact with women  releasing a video in which he pledged to be  more mindful  of respecting  personal space  The move marked the most extensive and personal effort yet by Biden to quell the furor ahead of a likely bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination  An announcement is expected later this month  In recent days  four women have said Biden made them feel uncomfortable when he touched them at political events in past years   The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset and I get it  I get it  I hear what they re saying   Biden said in the two minute video posted on Twitter  I will be much more mindful  and that s my responsibility   he said   I ve worked my whole life to empower women  I ve worked my whole life to prevent abuse   After a former Nevada politician  Lucy Flores  said last week that Biden made her feel  uneasy  gross  and confused  when he kissed the back of her head at a 2014 campaign event  Biden released a statement saying he believed he never acted inappropriately during his many years in public life Three more women followed suit with similar complaints  Biden s political team has tried to contain the damage  encouraging women who have known him to come forward with positive accounts of their interactions with him Flores could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday  She supported U S  Senator Bernie Sanders during his 2016 Democratic presidential campaign  Sanders is running again  and his campaign has denied any involvement in her going public with her story There was no immediate response to Biden s statement from leading Democratic contenders  U S  Senators Kirsten Gillibrand  Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and former congressman Beto O Rourke  among others  have expressed sympathy for Biden s accusers and have said they deserve to be heard  President Donald Trump poked fun at Biden on Tuesday over the allegations  On Wednesday  the Republican president  who during his 2016 campaign faced multiple accusations from women of unwanted sexual contact  wished his potential rival luck  saying it was up to Biden to decide if he should apologize  Biden  76  has long been known for a warm and intimate campaign style  He served eight years as vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama after 36 years as a U S  senator from Delaware But his propensity for hugging and physical touching has come under new scrutiny in the era of  MeToo and  TimesUp as awareness about sexual assault and harassment has grown and damaged the careers of dozens of men in politics and entertainment accused of sexual misconduct CAMPAIGN PREPARATIONSSources close to Biden told Reuters that preparations for a run had not been slowed by the controversy  I don t think there is anything to change the work we are doing   one source connected to the putative campaign said  Another source who has been in contact with Biden s team said the flap over his personal conduct had been anticipated  Both sources asked not to be named in order to speak freely about the campaign A top Biden donor  New York attorney James Kreindler  said his support of Biden had been unshaken by the controversy  Dick Harpootlian  a prominent lawyer in Democratic Party circles in South Carolina  added he did not think it would harm Biden s bid Public opinion polls have consistently shown Biden to be atop the 2020 field  which features more than a dozen candidates  There is yet to be any evidence that he has suffered lasting political damage from the accusations  Tracy Sefl  a Democratic strategist in Chicago and former adviser to Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign  said Biden s supporters were largely familiar with his public persona and unlikely to desert him over the issue The challenge for Biden if he does mount a run  Sefl said  was to appeal to voters who may be more skeptical about his behavior  She suggested he place women in high profile roles within his campaign as one way to send a signal he is adapting to the times She also encouraged him to talk about his work supporting causes such as the Violence Against Women Act  which Biden sponsored while in the Senate  She recalled witnessing Biden speaking in support of the legislation as vice president  He was as emotional as any woman in that room   Sefl said   I want to see that should he be a candidate     Reporting by James Oliphant and Ginger Gibson  Additional reporting by Alexandra Alper in Washington  Editing by Colleen Jenkins  Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney  

OTTAWA   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s Liberal Party rallied behind him on Wednesday over his expulsion of two former Cabinet ministers who had questioned his leadership  but he is still in a battle to regain dwindling support before a general election in October Trudeau told an emergency meeting of legislators on Tuesday that former Justice Minister Jody Wilson Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott had undermined the party and betrayed its trust The almost two month old scandal centered on Wilson Raybould  who in February said officials had inappropriately pressured her while she was justice minister to ensure construction company SNC Lavalin Group Inc would escape a corruption trial In recent weeks  senior party figures and lawmakers had grown frustrated with Trudeau s handling of the crisis  especially since both former ministers remained in the caucus despite their open hostility A long list of ministers and Liberal parliamentarians echoed Trudeau s emphasis on party unity on Wednesday  but the opposition reiterated that the expulsions were proof of a cover up It is too soon to say whether Trudeau s problems are over  political analysts said   This scandal has blotted out the sun  Now the question is  did he kill it   said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker  Last week Ipsos put the Conservative Party 10 points ahead of the Liberals  thanks to the SNC Lavalin affair  This issue has taken Trudeau into a territory where he could really lose   Bricker said  adding that while the prime minister had now shored up his standing as party leader  he still must win back public opinion But another pollster  Frank Graves at Ekos  said there were signs the damage had been limited and that there was fatigue over the issue among the general public  Ekos polls showed the Liberals had lost 3 4 percentage points during the scandal   But the numbers we are seeing now are same as they were before   Graves said Wilson Raybould and Philpott  who quit as minister because she disagreed with how the SNC Lavalin affair was being managed  stood side by side while speaking to reporters on Wednesday They said they had defended the independence of the judiciary and had no regrets  but they stopped short of attacking Trudeau head on or threatening legal recourse The affair has hurt the prime minister s image as a self avowed feminist and a leader who has taken to heart the cause of Canada s indigenous population  He recruited candidates such as Wilson Raybould  who was named as the first indigenous justice minister  and Philpott in part because they were new to politics  During a special event in parliament aimed at encouraging more women to get involved in politics  some of the attendees turned their backs on Trudeau as he spoke  prompting several of his Cabinet ministers to come to his defense   We have a strong prime minister that is a feminist   Tourism Minister Melanie Joly told reporters  I would argue that loyalty and feminism are two different things  There s no male or female definition of loyalty  Either you want to work in a team  or you don t    Reporting by Steve Scherer and Julie Gordon  editing by David Ljunggren and Grant McCool  

LONDON   Italy is suffering from an  epidemic  of racism inside soccer stadiums fuelled by right wing politics  according to the head of European football s anti discrimination watchdog FARE Reacting to alleged racist abuse directed towards Juventus striker Moise Kean in Cagliari on Tuesday  FARE s executive director Piara Powar said he was not surprised  Italy in particular has got a very big problem  I would go as far as to say it s an epidemic   Powar told Reuters at a keynote conference organised jointly by UEFA  the English Football Association  FA  and the Football Against Racism in Europe  FARE  network  I think part of the problem in Italy is the rhetoric of the right wing government  It s anti migrant and anti African and clearly that will always feed into stadiums  Then you have a football association that doesn t know how to respond  given the government s position  and historically hasn t responded very well  In Tuesday s incident the 19 year old Kean  jeered throughout by some Cagliari fans  celebrated his late goal by standing in front of the home fans and opening his arms Cagliari s fans then made the noise which is described in Italy as  buu  and is regarded as a racist taunt  although some argue it is simply to annoy opposing players regardless of race There was no official comment on Wednesday from either club while Serie A s disciplinary committee is likely to deal with the incidents on Friday Immediately after the game Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci said Kean was  50 50  to blame for the incidents while boss Massimiliano Allegri also questioned his player s reaction to scoring the goal  That was the most shocking part about it  Powar said  UNBELIEVABLE Former Barcelona and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure  a guest at the Equal Game conference  described the reaction to Kean by some of his team mates as the  worst scenario   It was unbelievable   Ivorian Toure told reporters   You can t imagine how hurt I was when I saw those things happening  For me  Bonucci  was disrespectful of his team mate  I don t want to be harsh with him but if he was my team mate he would feel me today  believe me  Bonucci should be a bit cleverer than that  a bit smarter  because this is a very difficult situation  We want to see things move on and if a footballer  who is Italian and white is talking about this as 50 50    I don t want to say more  Later on Wednesday  Bonucci posted a photograph of himself and Kean playing for Italy on Instagram with the caption   Regardless of everything in any case       no to racism  Powar said his organisation was seeing a rise in discrimination across Europe with fans inside stadium often echoing the country s politics  In Hungary  for example  where the prime minister says he wants a white Christian country  we have seen banners inside stadiums against the so called  Islamification  of Europe   he said  In Poland where the party is very conservative and wants to enforce  traditional values  there have been in the last three weeks huge banners in stadiums abusing the LGBT community  These banners are 150 metres wide so there is an organised campaign and many clubs are turning a blind eye or a deaf ear  This is what happens when you have a political environment that creates hatred    Reporting by Martyn Herman  Editing by Christian Radnedge

RALEIGH  N C    The chairman of North Carolina s Republican Party  an insurance magnate and two of his associates are facing federal charges for a plan to shower the state s top insurance regulator with campaign contributions to ensure special business treatment  a criminal indictment unsealed Tuesday said State GOP Chairman Robin Hayes and insurance and investment firm founder Greg Lindberg were among those charged with bribery  conspiracy and other crimes The four defendants appeared Tuesday before a federal magistrate Hayes also was charged with lying to the FBI  The 73 year old former congressman announced Monday that he wouldn t seek re election as party chairman  citing health problems Hayes  steadfastly denies the allegations made against him  and is eager to clear his name  his attorney  Kearns Davis  said in a statement Lindberg   largely unknown politically until his contributions started flowing heavily in 2017   has given more than  5 million to North Carolina candidates  party committees and independent expenditure groups Federal prosecutors allege that between April 2017 and August  Lindberg sought to shower Republican state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey with contributions through the state GOP and an independent committee in exchange for actions helping Lindberg s businesses  Lindberg sought  among other things  the removal of a Causey deputy responsible for examining Lindberg s Durham based Global Bankers Insurance Group The unidentified deputy commissioner was  deliberately and intentionally and maliciously hurting my reputation with other regulators   the indictment quoted Lindberg as saying to Causey Lindberg  political consultant John Gray  and John Palermo   a former county Republican chairman who was working for Lindberg s investment company Eli Global LLC   met with Causey at least five times in the winter and spring of 2018 to discuss favors and money  prosecutors said Lindberg s team urged Causey to hire Palermo to replace the deputy commissioner or become her boss  prosecutors said  Causey eventually refused  fearing Palermo s ties to Lindberg s company would be discovered by journalists  the indictment said  Lindberg then proposed  we recruit someone brand new to the Department with the same skill set   the indictment said Palermo then created an independent expenditure committee with limited public disclosure and the ability to spend unlimited amounts on political campaigns that was funded with  1 5 million of Lindberg s money  prosecutors said  In all  Lindberg and his associates promised Causey  2 million in donations Lindberg asked Hayes to direct  250 000 to Causey s re election campaign  Hayes initially protested  saying transferring so much money would attract attention  but he went along  prosecutors said  Whatever you all want to do  we ll do   Hayes said  according to the indictment   Alright  I ll get  er done  In October  as the investigation was building steam  Causey turned over  250 000 in donations from the state GOP to U S  Marshals  The commissioner also returned  5 000 that Lindberg had donated directly to Causey s campaign Causey   first elected to a four year term in 2016   was not charged in the indictment  Prosecutors said in a news release that he voluntarily reported the scheme  Everything I did was in cooperation and with direction of the federal investigators   Causey said in a phone interview Causey said he was sorry to hear about the indictments   but everybody makes their own decisions  The case also threatens to embroil an unidentified official who prosecutors described as speaking to Causey several times on Lindberg s behalf  Lindberg made a  150 000 contribution to a political committee backing  Public Official A  on the same February 2018 date he learned the politician was willing to help sway Causey  prosecutors said Federal Election Commission records show Lindberg made a contribution in that amount to Republican U S  Rep  Mark Walker s  Mark Walker Victory Committee  around the same time  It s the only  150 000 contribution by Lindberg listed in 2018 on the FEC website Walker s spokesman  Jack Minor  said he couldn t confirm if Walker was  Public Official A   adding that the February 2018 contribution eventually went to the Republican National Committee and wasn t used for Walker s campaign  Walker is not and never has been a target of this investigation  and has committed no wrongdoing   Minor said in a statement  adding that Walker has assisted federal investigators Palermo  63  of Pittsboro  didn t return calls seeking comment  A published number for Gray  68  of Chapel Hill  was disconnected The state GOP cooperated with the investigation  including turning over requested documents  attorney Josh Howard said in a statement  Greg Lindberg is innocent of the charges in the indictment and we look forward to demonstrating this when we get our day in court   his attorney  Anne Tompkins  said in a statement A spokesman for Global Bankers and Eli Global noted the companies were not charged  Global Bankers has cooperated with federal prosecutors and will continue doing so  spokesman Steven Goldberg said Lindberg s contributions included at least  250 000 to the state Democratic Party  He s also given in the past to outside groups that have supported then Insurance Commissioner Wayne Goodwin  who s now chairman of the state Democratic Party  and Republican Lt  Gov  Dan Forest  who is running for governor in 2020    Follow Emery P  Dalesio on Twitter at http   twitter com

Gail Collins  Happy April  Bret  Since we re past Fools  Day  I will avoid any wisecracks about Donald Trump Where are you on the Mueller report  Ready to consign it to the dustbin of history  Demanding to see the full document  I have to admit I m sort of ready to give up and move on  Although you could definitely talk me back into the fold Bret Stephens  Four thoughts  Gail First  Thank God the president of the United States  whatever else we may think of him  did not collude with Russia to get himself elected  I d rather have a scoundrel in the White House than a traitor Gail  You re setting the bar pretty low there  but you re still right Bret  Second  Thank God we have a report at all   which  considering the vindication it brings Trump  and the vindictiveness it brings out of him    would not have happened if the Trumpists had gotten their way and Mueller had been fired  All of those conservatives who impugned Mueller s integrity and his team s impartiality owe them a giant apology Gail  Not holding my breath waiting  Go on Bret  Third  Thank God for Mueller himself  He didn t pontificate on the Sunday talk shows the way Jim Comey or Adam Schiff did  He didn t pull any punches when it came to prosecuting the likes of Paul Manafort  He ran a tight ship  He demonstrated that even in Washington there is no substitute for character  professionalism and reputation  That s why I suspect that when the full document is released  we ll be able to treat it as the last word on the subject Finally  The news media  especially cable news  needs to do some major soul searching  Too many reporters and pundits got way out ahead of their skis  creating a collusion narrative out of a series of unconnected dots  When historians examine why public confidence in journalism fell to such lows in our era  episodes like Russiagate will be a major part of the story Gail  You didn t have to believe Trump was actively engaged in a conspiracy to point out a whole lot of unnerving stuff going on  For instance  there s still a terrible potential for Russian sabotage via internet that this administration isn t taking seriously Bret  For sure  There was a lot of smoke  There were plenty of dots  The investigation was warranted  The president repeatedly behaved in ways that suggested guilt  from lying about his business ties to Russia to seizing his translator s notes after a conversation with Vladimir Putin to his cavalier attitude about Russia s intentions The media was right to report all this and raise questions  But there was also a lack of skepticism about some of the evidence  and a tone of certitude about where that evidence was bound to lead Gail  I ll give you the whole impeachment thing  That was perhaps over the top  But we re still waiting to hear the results of investigations into Trump   mainly his business practices   that are still going on here in New York Bret  I agree in the sense that I think his behavior as  Individual No  1  in the payoffs to former paramours are felony violations of campaign finance laws  But I m also becoming increasingly convinced that the endless investigations into Trump s past business practices are going to wind up doing more harm to Trump s opponents than they do to him  It makes him look like the victim of an endless inquest into his pre presidential behavior  And it distracts Democrats from talking about the things that Americans actually want from politicians  like better schools and a growing economy Gail  Glad you brought that up  I m way more interested in the attack on Obamacare than his unappetizing history in real estate What s your opinion on where to go with health care  I will start by acknowledging Obamacare is sort of a mess  It began as a mess because certain senators  cough  mutter  Joe Lieberman  were too deeply in the thrall of the insurance companies to let a sane restructuring occur Bret  Music to my ears  Gail  Obamacare is a mess  even if most Americans have learned to live with it  as we do with other messes   If it weren t a mess  Democrats wouldn t keep talking about  Medicare for all  as the next evolution in health care policy I think that s a huge mistake  both as a matter of policy and politics  It requires another major reorganization of a huge part of the U S  economy  Take Bernie Sanders s plan  for example  It s going to cost a bundle   an estimated  32 6 trillion over 10 years   and the taxes to fund it will have to come from middle class Americans  It will mean a declining quality of health care  And it will lead to a two tier system in which wealthy Americans go  off grid  to get high quality medical attention while the rest of the country is stuck in a system that will resemble the V A Trump will also be merciless about this  politically  claiming that this is just the sort of socialism he warned about in his State of the Union speech  And it will frighten a great many voters  including those all important suburban women  who might despise the president for all kinds of reasons but fear the Democrats are veering toward the Bernie Sanders left Gail  All the Democratic presidential candidates are not talking about Medicare for all  Some of the ones who did are trying to backpedal  not really having thought about what it meant before they went there  Three fifths of the adult population from 19 to 64 get their health insurance from employers  and a lot of them like it  They re going to get very nervous if they think they might have to give it up But we need sweeping change  Our current health care system is wildly expensive because it s structured in a crazy way that creates piles and piles of stupendously expensive paperwork  We could create a government run public policy option that would give people the security of Obamacare without the crazy structure  And gradually  if the option was attractive enough  employers might want to get in on it  too Bret  I definitely agree about the paperwork problem  My own views about health care are pretty libertarian  We need radical price transparency so that people are aware of the huge disparities in price between say  a blood test from Clinic A versus Clinic B  We need tort reform so that doctors don t live in mortal fear of being sued by patients  We need more than just gold  silver and bronze insurance options  Healthy young people should also be able to buy cut rate plans that cover only catastrophes  As for Medicare  the long term goal should be to get rid of it  That s obviously distinct from Medicaid  Even crazy right wingers like me believe that government has a moral duty to ensure that poor people have good access to quality medical care from womb to tomb Gail  Doctors do have to pay heavy insurance premiums to protect themselves from lawsuits  But patients also have to be protected from careless or inept physicians  It s tough to find a perfect solution   people have been trying for years  But fine by me if you want to work on it  Bret  I ll be cheering from the galleries Bret  The deeper problem with all of these health care debates is that we re discussing something that inevitably generates bad outcomes even under the best of circumstances  But can we switch subjects from tragedy to farce  I m curious to know your take on the Jussie Smollett story  which is what everyone I know was talking about last week  when they weren t talking about Mueller  Gail  You do have to thank the guy for taking Donald Trump off our minds  Not every day do you have a TV star making up a story of being attacked by MAGA hat wearing racist thugs  Everybody was stunned when the prosecutor dropped all the charges  She basically said  well  this is what we always do with first offenders who don t pose a threat to the community Not sure that would be true of first offenders whose self promoting lies and evasions cost the city six figures in overtime  But it s a good reminder that we have different criminal justice systems for the poor and the nonpoor Bret  I would not have minded if Smollett had gotten off relatively lightly   provided  that is  that he had admitted the charges  shown contrition and begged forgiveness  It s the arrogance and gall that bothers me  Kim Foxx  the Chicago prosecutor  says her office would have had a hard time securing a conviction  Was Smollett s check to the perpetrators and their confession of the crime not enough  The whole thing reeks of a corrupt bargain  and I hope the Department of Justice gets involved  Even Chicago can t afford Chicago style politics By the way  I don t want us to wrap up the conversation without complimenting you on your marvelous column about statues  specifically their scandalous dearth when it comes to honoring women  I m thrilled Billie Holiday will be getting one soon  in Queens  There are many more worthy would be honorees that I can think of  Gerty Cori was the first American woman to win a Nobel in science  Zora Neale Hurston ought to have one  too  if she doesn t already  And Dorothy Parker  provided the statue itself had a ribald sense of humor Who else should we be honoring Gail  Thanks  Bret  Right now  only five of the 150 public statues in New York are of women   we ve got dozens of ethically compromised politicians and run of the mill generals but we re only now working on Susan B  Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton Once we ve gotten the public figures taken care of  it d be nice to celebrate some low profile heroines  I was just reading about Esther Lewis  a widow who had a farm in Pennsylvania in the pre Civil War era  She ran a stop on the Underground Railroad that sheltered runaway slaves  discovered iron ore on her property and created a serious mining operation  educated

WASHINGTON   A group of American hackers who once worked for U S  intelligence agencies helped the United Arab Emirates spy on a BBC host  the chairman of Al Jazeera and other prominent Arab media figures during a tense 2017 confrontation pitting the UAE and its allies against the Gulf state of Qatar The American operatives worked for Project Raven  a secret Emirati intelligence program that spied on dissidents  militants and political opponents of the UAE monarchy  A Reuters investigation in January revealed Project Raven s existence and inner workings  including the fact that it surveilled a British activist and several unnamed U S  journalists The Raven operatives   who included at least nine former employees of the U S  National Security Agency and the U S  military   found themselves thrust into the thick of a high stakes dispute among America s Gulf allies  The Americans  role in the UAE Qatar imbroglio highlights how former U S  intelligence officials have become key players in the cyber wars of other nations  with little oversight from Washington The crisis erupted in the spring of 2017  when the UAE and allies   including Saudi Arabia and Egypt   accused Qatar of sowing unrest in the Middle East through its support of media outlets and political groups  The UAE camp demanded Qatar take a series of actions  including shuttering the Qatar funded Al Jazeera satellite television network  withdrawing funding from other media outlets Doha supports  and cracking down on the Muslim Brotherhood  an Islamic movement some Arab governments regard as a threat In June 2017  the UAE camp severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed an air  land and sea blockade against the tiny nation  It was an unprecedented confrontation among Arab countries that had historically prized consensus That week  Project Raven operatives sprang into action  launching operations to break into the Apple iPhones of at least 10 journalists and media executives they believed had connections to the Qatari government or the Muslim Brotherhood  according to program documents reviewed by Reuters and four people involved in the activities Raven targeted Arab media figures who spanned a range of political thought   from a Beirut based BBC host to the chairman of Al Jazeera and a producer from a London satellite channel founded by a member of the Muslim Brotherhood The goal  the former Raven operatives said  was to find material showing that Qatar s royal family had influenced the coverage of Al Jazeera and other media outlets  and uncover any ties between the influential TV network and the Muslim Brotherhood  Reuters couldn t determine what data Raven obtained Al Jazeera has long maintained it is independent from Qatar s government  Jassim Bin Mansour Al Thani  a media attaché for Qatar s embassy in Washington  said  the government of Qatar does not request  ask  or enforce on Al Jazeera any agenda whatsoever   Al Jazeera  is treated like any other respected media outlet  The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment  The NSA declined to comment  A Department of Defense spokeswoman declined to comment Dana Shell Smith  the former U S  ambassador to Qatar  said she found it alarming that American intelligence veterans were able to work for another government in targeting an American ally  She said Washington should better supervise U S  government trained hackers after they leave the intelligence community  Folks with these skill sets should not be able to knowingly or unknowingly undermine U S  interests or contradict U S  values   Smith told Reuters Among the Arab journalists hacked  Raven project documents show  was Giselle Khoury  Beirut based host of BBC Arabic s  The Scene   a program that interviews Middle Eastern leaders on current events  Three days after the blockade began  Raven operatives hacked her iPhone  Raven program documents show she was targeted because of her contact with Azmi Bishara  a Doha based writer who has been critical of the UAE and founded the news outlet Al Araby Al Jadeed  They need to spend their time on making better their country  their economy   Khoury said in an interview after Reuters informed her of the hack   Not on having Giselle Khoury as a hacking target  On June 19  2017  Americans working for Raven targeted Faisal al Qassem  host of a popular Al Jazeera show called  The Opposite Direction   interviews and documents show The show features guests who heatedly debate controversial topics such as corruption in Middle Eastern governments  Informed by Reuters about his hacking  al Qassem said he was not surprised he was targeted by the UAE  which he accuses of being  a symbol of corruption and dirty politics   In a word  they are afraid of the truth   he said That same day  Raven operatives targeted the iPhone of Al Jazeera s chairman  Hamad bin Thamer bin Mohammed Al Thani  Through an Al Jazeera spokesman  Al Thani declined to comment The attacks utilized a cyber weapon called Karma  As Reuters reported in January  Karma allowed Raven operatives to remotely hack into iPhones by inputting a target s phone number or associated email address into the attack software  Unlike many exploits  Karma did not require a target to click on a link sent to an iPhone  they said  Apple declined to comment Karma provided Raven operatives access to the contacts  messages  photos and other data stored on iPhones  It did not allow them to monitor phone calls While Raven operatives broke into the devices  they did not have full access to the data they collected  they passed the material on to UAE intelligence officials overseeing the operation  It s unclear what they found In January  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash was asked by reporters in New York about Project Raven after the initial Reuters report  Gargash acknowledged his country has a  cyber capability  but didn t specifically address the program  He denied targeting U S  citizens or countries with which the UAE has good relations SPYING EFFORT S U S  LINKSThe UAE created Project Raven in 2009 with the help of American intelligence contractors and former senior White House officials from the George W  Bush administration  The U S  National Security Council declined to comment on Project Raven At first  the goal was to crack down on terrorism by helping the UAE monitor militants around the region  But Raven s mission quickly expanded to include monitoring and suppressing a range of UAE political opponents  the documents show Among its targets was Qatar  which the UAE and Saudi Arabia had long accused of fueling political opposition across the region  in part through the Qatari government s funding of Al Jazeera During the Arab Spring protests of 2011  Gulf countries viewed Al Jazeera s expansive coverage of street demonstrations as a deliberate attempt by Qatar to fuel opposition to their monarchs   It was seen as a tool to foment popular unrest   said Elisa Catalano Ewers  a former advisor on the region for President Obama s National Security Council Al Jazeera s protest coverage  had a huge psychological impact  for demonstrators  said Moncef Marzouki  the former president of Tunisia  who was elected in 2011 after Arab Spring demonstrations ousted long time ruler Zine al Abidine Ben Ali  The broadcasts sent a message to protesters that  this battle is happening everywhere  you are not alone  Al Qassem  the host hacked by Raven  said Al Jazeera presents all sides  without censorship   The street and the Arab people can decide what s right   he said Wary of the Muslim Brotherhood s growing influence in the region after the 2011 protests  UAE authorities launched a crackdown on dozens of suspected Islamists  many of whom have been convicted of planning to overthrow the government  In 2014  the UAE formally designated the Brotherhood and local affiliates as terrorist groups The Emiratis also tapped Raven in the effort to contain dissent at home  according to former Raven operatives and project documents  In the years after the Arab Spring  the operatives were increasingly tasked with targeting human rights activists and journalists who questioned the government TARGETING JOURNALISTSIn June 2017  after Gulf nations began their blockade of Qatar  the UAE ramped up efforts to spy on journalists seen as tied to Qatar  That month  Project Raven s Qatar mission expanded from two full time operatives assigned to the country to seven On June 20  Raven operatives hacked into the iPhone of Abdullah Al Athba  chief editor of Qatar s oldest newspaper  Al Arab  program documents show In an interview with Reuters  Al Athba said he believed he was targeted  because I am a supporter of the Arab Spring since the beginning   who repeatedly criticized the Emiratis for their opposition to the movement The Raven effort went beyond the Middle East  Operatives used Karma to target the mobile phones of other media figures the UAE believed were being supported by Qatar  including journalists for London based Arabic media outlets Al Araby TV and Al Hiwar  Both networks televise Arabic language channels popular in the Middle East Al Thani  the Qatari spokesman  said the government does not support Al Araby TV  Al Hiwar or Al Arab The satellite channel Al Araby TV and its namesake website are units of London based Fadaat Media Ltd  owned and supported by Qatari businessmen  The outlet sees itself as the voice of  secular  liberal  pro democracy  Arabs  said Abdulrahman Elshayyal  director of Al Araby TV  He and two other Araby employees were hacked in the weeks following the start of the blockade  Raven documents show  It s a very worrying trend that a state is using all these things to spy on people critical of them   Elshayyal said in a phone interview   I m not a terrorist or a money launderer  Bishara  the founder of Al Araby Al Jadeed  was also targeted by Raven  He told Reuters he regards his outlet as  relatively independent  in the context of the Arab world   Nobody tells us what to say   said Bishara  a Palestinian Christian who lives in Qatar  though  sometimes the newspaper might be sensitive about what not to say  because you are not there to provoke the people that finance you  Al Hiwar  another London based Arabic satellite channel  was targeted by Raven on the day the blockade began  Al Hiwar founder Azzam Tamimi said he believes the UAE was fearful of his channel s support for political reform and democratization in the Arab world Unlike others caught in the crosshairs of Project Raven  though  Al Hiwar doesn t deny being sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood  which the outlet supports  because they are the victims   he said  Tamimi told Reuters he is a longtime Muslim Brotherhood member and a supporter of the Palestinian militant group Hamas Tamimi declined to say whether the channel received money from the Qatari government but said he ll accept any support  provided there s no strings attached  He said the channel gives voice to a range of opinions and encourages dialogue  But there are limitations  The majority of our viewers are Muslim   he said in a phone interview   We are not going to market ideas that are alien to our culture  That s what makes us popular    Editing by Ronnie Greene and Michael Williams  

TOKYO   Japan on Monday unveiled a new name for the imperial era that begins on May 1  drawing from an ancient Japanese text for the first time  echoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s conservative agenda that aims to bolster national pride The name  Reiwa  for the new era when Crown Prince Naruhito becomes emperor  comes from two Chinese characters  the first meaning  good  or  beautiful  as well as  order  or  command  and the second meaning  peace  or  harmony  The characters were taken from the Manyoshu  an ancient collection of Japanese poetry  in a break with the tradition of selections from ancient Chinese texts The name implied  culture is born and nourished when people s hearts are drawn beautifully together   Abe told a news conference  Asked the significance of its selection from a Japanese classical text  Abe said   It is a collection which expresses our nation s rich culture  which we should take pride in  along with our nation s beautiful nature  We believe this national character should be passed along to the next era  Abe returned to office in 2012 after abruptly resigning in 2007 following a year plagued by scandals and stalled politics He rode a wave of popularity sparked mainly by a pledge to revive the stagnant economy  but has also long favored a conservative agenda aimed at restoring traditional values such as group harmony and pride in Japanese history and culture  His  Abe s  interpretation echoes his calls for Japan to be proud of its roots and its tradition   said Koichi Nakano  a professor of political science at Sophia University  He wants Japan to be proud of their country and this was seen as an opportunity to boost that  Japan imported the imperial calendar system from China about 1 300 years ago  There have been four era names in the modern period  Meiji  Taisho  1912 1926   Showa  1926 1989  and the current Heisei  which means  achieving peace   It was unexpected that it  Reiwa  was taken from the Manyoshu  but it expresses Japanese culture in  kanji   characters    said Isao Tokoro  a professor emeritus at Kyoto Sangyo University  It means  to get along well  and  to be tender  and shows an important value for 21st century Japan and the world     Additional reporting by Ami Miyazaki and Yoshifumi Takemoto  Editing by Clarence Fernandez  

CHICAGO   Cook County State s Attorney Kim Foxx was elected in 2016 mainly because of anger that the prosecutor she ousted had waited a year to charge a Chicago police officer in the killing of black teenager Laquan McDonald  Then Foxx  who is a survivor of sexual assault as a child  grabbed national attention by charging singer R  Kelly with aggravated sexual abuse But in the course of just a few days  her reputation as rising political star and legal crusader was badly tarnished by her office s handling of two celebrity cases involving  Empire  actor Jussie Smollett and Kelly  The dismissal of all charges against Smollett enraged many  from President Donald Trump to Chicago s mayor and the city s police union  They accuse her of allowing Smollett to walk away from faking a hate crime attack and lying about it to police without so much as an apology or admission of guilt And adding to her woes  Kelly s attorney Steve Greenberg on Monday accused Foxx of caving in to pressure from celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti to charge Kelly  Avenatti  who is accused by federal prosecutors in a separate case of trying to shake down shoe company Nike  said he had provided Foxx with a video of Kelly having sex with a 14 year old girl David Erickson  a former state appellate judge who teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law  said you d have to go back 50 years to find a Chicago prosecutor so embroiled in controversy  Edward Hanrahan was charged with conspiracy in the deaths of two Black Panther members in a raid by agents from Hanrahan s office in 1969  He was acquitted  but ultimately ousted by voters  Looking back  that s the only thing that comes close to this   said Erickson  pointing out that Foxx s troubles may be far from over Retired Illinois Appellate Justice Sheila O Brien vowed on Monday  in an opinion piece posted on the Chicago Tribune s website  to file a petition to the courts asking that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate Foxx and her office  This is exhausting  but it has to be done   O Brien wrote Foxx declined to comment for this article  Her fate was literally debated in the streets of Chicago Monday at dueling protests   one organized by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson in support of Foxx and another by the police union where demonstrators chanted  Foxx must go  The praise she received for opening up about being raped as a small child  and then taking on R  Kelly   a Chicago native who had beaten child pornography charges in 2008   has been drowned out  Her office has been severely criticized by two major legal groups for what they called ethical lapses in the Smollett case Kelly s attorney on Monday asked a judge to order all of Foxx s communications with Avenatti preserved and suggested that Foxx fed clients to Avenatti  They got in bed with Avenatti and Avenatti is toxic   Kelly attorney Greenberg said in reference to Avenatti s cooperation with Foxx s office in the Kelly investigation Even Foxx s decision to recuse herself from the Smollett case is being questioned  Former judge O Brien said a special prosecutor should answer whether Foxx really stepped back from the Smollett case after she said she was removing herself because of communications with a relative of the actor  I can say without any reservation that her reputation has been damaged among people who work in the criminal justice system   said Terry Ekl  a local defense attorney How it plays out politically is anyone s guess  Voters may have to wait until next year s primary election to do anything about Foxx Dick Simpson  a University of Illinois at Chicago political scientist  said the only way he knows of to remove Foxx from office before an election would be to impeach her  But she hasn t done anything impeachable   he said  citing her recusal from the case

LONDON   Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn eyed each other uncertainly on Wednesday  like two subjects in a laboratory experiment Wednesdays are the days  in British politics  when the leaders of the government and the opposition face off in the scorched earth partisan slugfest known as Prime Minister s Questions It is a spectator sport  For 30 minutes  the leaders skewer each other with clever put downs and hostile questions  each backed by hundreds of lawmakers mooing and jeering in support But this Wednesday was different Prime Minister May and Mr  Corbyn  the leader of the Labour Party  were preparing to try something truly risky   to set their party loyalties to the side and try to devise a plan together  in a last ditch effort to save Britain from a chaotic exit from the European Union Cross party cooperation goes so profoundly against the grain  in Britain s old  tribal Parliament  that Wednesday had a slightly unreal feeling  as if the laws of physics had been suspended Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn circled each other gingerly during Wednesday s question time  glancing one by one over issues that divided them   unemployment  the minimum wage  the cost of television licenses   but they were mechanical  phoning it in  Neither said much about the one thing that mattered  Brexit  and the meeting they would have later in the day It fell to Mrs  May s own party members  trained to fear and mistrust Mr  Corbyn  to nail her to the wall  Prime Minister  if it comes to the point where we have to balance the risk of a no deal Brexit versus the risk of letting the country down and ushering in a Marxist  anti Semite led government  what does she think at that point is the lowest risk   asked Caroline Johnson  a Conservative who had  up until now  displayed staunch loyalty She was referring to accusations that under Mr  Corbyn  the Labour party has failed to tackle anti Semitism within its ranks Lee Rowley  another Conservative lawmaker  reminded the prime minister of words she had spoken last week  when she said Mr  Corbyn was  the biggest threat to our standing in the world  to our defense and to the economy   In her judgment   he continued   what now qualifies him for involvement in Brexit  The rumblings from Tory Brexiteers were ominous all day  Two ministers resigned in protest over the talks between Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn  one sputtering his outrage that  you and your cabinet have decided that a deal   cooked up with a Marxist who has never once in his political life put British interests first   is better than no deal  Then Mrs  May and Mr  Corbyn vanished into a room with their teams  and  shortly thereafter  a great thunderclap split the air above Westminster There was nothing to do but wait  Will they put party before country  Or country before party   asked Rob Ford  a professor of political science at the University of Manchester   There was always going to come a moment when the irresistible force of tribal partisan loyalties and distrust of the opposition came up against the immovable object of a no deal Brexit deadline  ImageJeremy Corbyn  center  leader of the Labour Party  at Parliament on Wednesday CreditStefan Rousseau Press Association  via Associated Press If they don t do something   he added   they re all going down together  By compromising  each runs the risk of inflicting permanent damage on their fragile parties  which are both deeply split over Brexit  And one thing they have in common is that their entire adult lives have been spent serving their parties Mr  Corbyn  who grew up in the prosperous and conservative Wiltshire countryside  was one of the few boys in his school to sign up with the Young Socialists  Labour s youth wing  at 16  Mrs  May began working for the Conservative party before she was a teenager  spending weekends with Tory matrons stuffing envelopes and delivering fliers  The party is her life   Mr  Ford said   She is an old school kind of politician  Her whole life is bound up with it  By pivoting to a form of Brexit that Mr  Corbyn could endorse  likely one with closer ties to the European Union  Mrs  May will likely lose the votes of 40 or 50 of her own lawmakers  but could potentially gain 150 votes from Labour lawmakers  Mr  Ford said Labour is deeply split  with most members in favor of a second referendum and a large faction intent on stopping Brexit altogether  Many Labour supporters warned Mr  Corbyn against cooperating with the prime minister  cautioning that she might be setting a trap  so that Labour would be held responsible for a failed policy Grace Blakeley  who covers economics for the New Statesman and supports Labour  said she had come to the view that Mr  Corbyn should compromise  Initially I would have said absolutely not   she said   But at the moment there is so much general disdain directed toward our political class  and that hasn t discriminated according to party  There has been a bit of antipathy toward Labour as well  The vast majority of people in Britain  she said   are looking at the politicians and saying   Why can t they get on with it   Tony Travers  a professor of government at the London School of Economics  tried to imagine what the meeting would be like  They aren t either of them warm  friendly  easygoing people   he said   It will be stiff and formal  not showing the warmth of human interaction that good negotiation surely needs   In their public debates  he said  while Mr  Corbyn stuck to diatribes about poverty  but Mrs  May was often  banging on about him personally   This is not the best starting point for a handshake over a glass of whiskey   he said Startlingly  nothing leaked from the leaders  two hour meeting until late afternoon  when the city was enveloped by a freakish storm  which buffeted the city with lumps of crusty  wet snow known in meteorological circles as graupel After the meeting  the government s spokesman called the talks  constructive  Mr  Corbyn released a statement saying he and Mrs  May had discussed the benefits of a customs union but made no commitments  I also raised the prospect of a confirmatory vote   he said  meaning a public vote seeking

NEW DELHI   After a suicide bombing on Feb  14 in the disputed border region of Kashmir  India accused neighboring Pakistan of harboring the terrorists who it said had orchestrated the attack  The two countries quickly traded airstrikes Online  there was another battle One clip that circulated widely on Facebook and other services purported to show an aerial assault by India on an alleged terrorist camp in Pakistan  It was  in fact  taken from a video game  Photographs of dead bodies wrapped in white  supposedly of Pakistani militants killed in the attack  actually depicted victims of a 2015 heat wave  according to fact checkers  And local news outlets raced to post shreds of  exclusive  information about the hostilities  much of it downright false ImageFacebook executives said the flood of fake posts online after a February suicide bombing in Kashmir was extraordinary Facebook executives said the deluge was extraordinary   I ve never seen anything like this before   the scale of fake content circulating on one story   tweeted Trushar Barot  a former BBC journalist who leads the social network s anti disinformation efforts in India The flood of fake posts gave Facebook a taste of what is to come as India prepares for the world s biggest election  Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party are seeking another five years in power  and as many as 879 million people are expected to vote over five weeks starting on April 11 But as campaigning goes into high gear  Facebook is already struggling to cope with the disinformation and hate speech on its core social network and on WhatsApp  its popular messaging service On Monday  the company said it had removed hundreds of misleading pages and accounts associated with the B J P  and its main rival  the Indian National Congress  many of which were publishing false information  Facebook also removed more than 100 fake pages and accounts controlled by the Pakistani military India   where the company has 340 million users  more than in any other country   poses distinct challenges  Posts and videos in more than a dozen languages regularly flummox Facebook s automated screening software and its human moderators  both of which are built largely around English  Many problematic posts come directly from candidates  political parties and the media  And on WhatsApp  where messages are encrypted  the company has little visibility into what is being shared How WhatsApp Leads Mobs to Murder in IndiaFalse rumors of child kidnappers have gone viral on WhatsApp in India  prompting fearful mobs to kill two dozen innocent people since April India s elections present a unique set of issues  including a large number of languages and an extended time period for voting   said Katie Harbath  Facebook s public policy head for global elections  She said the company had been planning for the election for more than a year Other major social media platforms like Twitter and Google s YouTube are also grappling with false news and hate speech around India s elections  For the first time  the country s Election Commission has asked online services to police election related content from candidates and parties But the stakes are especially high for Facebook  which has been under scrutiny since the 2016 United States presidential election for distributing misinformation and for being misused by Russian agents to stir discord  While the company survived the 2018 American midterm elections relatively unscathed  it still found foreign influence networks attempting to use it to sway voters  And Facebook s services were plagued by misinformation in last year s Mexican and Brazilian elections India is one of Facebook s most important electoral tests this year  company officials said  along with major elections in places including the Philippines and Indonesia  Facebook s performance will be a prelude for how it navigates a likely onslaught of propaganda  false information and foreign meddling during the 2020 presidential election in the United States ImageFacebook participated in an educational event to raise awareness about false news and the spread of misinformation at a school in Lucknow  India  in 2018 CreditAbhishek Verma Agence France Presse   Getty Images The Indian elections in 2019 are an important test case for how they get 2020 right  and how they get elections right everywhere going forward   said Graham Brookie  director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council  a think tank working with Facebook to study disinformation campaigns India has been a laboratory for Facebook s election efforts since 2014  when the country last chose a Parliament  In that contest  Facebook worked closely with Mr  Modi s campaign to target ads and rally fans   part of a global effort to spread the use of the platform in politics  With Facebook s assistance  Mr  Modi became the world s No  2 most  liked  politician behind President Barack Obama  according to campaign officials After Mr  Modi s victory  Facebook advised him on how to use its service to govern  including getting government agencies and officials online  In 2015  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  hosted Mr  Modi for a televised chat at the company s Silicon Valley headquarters  Facebook held India up as a model for how governments could use the social network Facebook has since played down its connection to politicians around the world  including Mr  Modi  amid a rise in political misinformation  Ajit Mohan  a former Fox executive who became the social network s first India chief in January  said   We are absolutely not affiliated to any political party in India or anywhere else in the world  ImageAjit Mohan  a former Fox executive  was appointed Facebook s first chief of its India operations in January CreditVivek Singh for The New York TimesNow all the major Indian parties have sophisticated disinformation strategies  which include posting false and manipulated photos and videos and coordinating posts across a network of paid acolytes and volunteers  That has put Facebook  which has said it does not want to stifle free expression  in an awkward position For the past year  the company has relied on two independent organizations   first a local group called Boom and  more recently  the news agency Agence France Presse   to fact check a handful of posts in India every day  In February  Facebook added five more organizations to the stable and expanded the number of languages covered to seven  up from just English initially Facebook s algorithms flag potentially fake posts to the fact checkers  who decide which ones to investigate  After they publish their findings on Facebook  the company said  it reduces the visibility of false posts Yet some of Facebook s fact checkers may themselves be contributing to misinformation  Alt News  an Indian fact checking site unaffiliated with Facebook  recently found two of the social network s new partners   the large media houses India Today Group and Jagran Media Network   had repeatedly published false information related to the Kashmir attack Pratik Sinha  the founder of Alt News  said Facebook did not seem to view false news as a serious problem   The whole thing is a P R  effort   he said  Jency Jacob  the managing editor of Boom  said Facebook needed to do more  including making it easier for users to report misinformation ImageJency Jacob  managing editor of Boom  an Indian fact checking organization  said Facebook needed to do more to limit misinformation CreditAtul Loke for The New York TimesBalkrishna  who heads the fact checking effort at India Today  said that mistakes happened and that the company tried to correct them promptly  Pratyush Ranjan  a senior editor at Jagran New Media  the company s digital division  said its fact checking site  Vishvas News  operated separately and followed strict ethics guidelines  Facebook said it relied on the Poynter Institute  an American journalism organization  to certify its fact checkers and review their ethical standards A separate Facebook effort to assemble a broad coalition of Indian news organizations to combat false news during the election has been delayed amid funding problems and the departure of a key journalist who had worked on it The company has also tried to shed more light on political advertising on its site  posting weekly reports on top advertisers and how much they spent  Since Feb  21  when Facebook began tracking the data for India  spending has totaled about 103 million rupees  or about  1 5 million But the social network has not pushed for transparency on who is really paying for the ads  While the site s top three political advertisers in India were all associated with the B J P  s election efforts  none of them explicitly disclosed that affiliation to viewers India Election 2019  A Simple Guide to the World s Largest VoteHow does the election work  Will Modi win  What are the main issues facing India and its 900 million voters Facebook has also had difficulty dealing with hate speech  which is expected to intensify during the election For example  Raja Singh  a fiery right wing Hindu legislator in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad  refers to Muslims as  cow killers    an inflammatory phrase that has led to some deaths since the country s Hindu majority considers cows to be sacred  Although Facebook had removed some of Mr  Singh s posts for violating its hate speech rules  at least one threatening rant   in which he calls Muslims  dogs  and talks of cutting off their necks   remained on his official Facebook page for months Facebook removed the video  and then deleted Mr  Singh s Facebook page  after The New York Times inquired about it In an interview  Mr  Singh said he was simply defending Hindus from Muslims   It is imperative that we threaten them in our own style   he said Thenmozhi Soundararajan  the founder of Equality Labs  a human rights group in the United States  said her organization recently studied more than 1 000 Facebook posts that attacked caste and religious minorities  It found that 80 percent of the posts stayed on the social network after they were reported as hate speech  and nearly half of the posts that were initially removed were up again several months later Mr  Mohan said Facebook recognized that it had more work to do  It recently decided to set up an election  war room  in India to better respond to problems  This will evolve and continue to get better   he said   There is a tremendous amount of sincerity that we need to get this right   

ISLAMABAD NEW DELHI   Pakistani social media campaigner Hanzala Tayyab leads about 300 ultra nationalist cyber warriors fighting an internet war with arch foe India  in a battle that is increasingly sucking in global tech giants such as Twitter and Facebook  Tayyab  24  spends his days on Facebook and encrypted WhatsApp chatrooms organizing members of his Pakistan Cyber Force group to promote anti India content and make it go viral  including on Twitter where he has more than 50 000 followers That ranges from highlighting alleged Indian human rights abuses to lionizing insurgents battling Indian security forces in Kashmir  a disputed Himalayan region at the heart of historic tensions between Pakistan and India  Tayyab s job became harder on Monday when the Pakistan Cyber Force s Facebook account was taken down  one of 103 Pakistani accounts the social media giant said it had deleted because of  inauthentic behavior  and spamming  Some Indian nationalist accounts have also been suspended in recent weeks Portraying himself as an online combatant defending Pakistan from India s attempts to destabilize his country  Tayyab plans to continue playing his role in the broader information war being fought between the nuclear armed foes  We are countering the Indian narrative through social media  we are countering the enemies of Pakistan   Tayyab told Reuters in the capital Islamabad With a combined population of 1 5 billion  India and Pakistan are hot growth markets for Facebook and Twitter  say analysts But with many rival ultra nationalist and extremist groups in the region using Facebook and Twitter platforms to advance their political agenda  both companies face accusations of bias whenever they suspend accounts Facebook has been buffeted by controversies across the globe in recent years  including for not stopping the use of fake accounts to try to sway public opinion in the 2016 U S  Presidential election and Britain s vote to leave the European Union  and for not acting to stamp out hate speech on its platform that was fuelling ethnic violence in Myanmar Four Facebook and more than 20 Twitter accounts belonging to members of the Pakistan Cyber Force have been shuttered in the past two months  according to Tayyab  who is still angry at Twitter for shutting down his previous personal account in 2016 A Twitter spokeswoman said   We believe in impartiality and do not take any actions based on political viewpoints  A Facebook spokesperson told Reuters the company did not remove the Pakistani accounts because of Indian government pressure  but because people behind them coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves   When we disrupt these networks for coordinated inauthentic behavior  it s because of their deceptive behavior and not because of the content they re sharing  or the ideology or political leanings of the people behind them   Facebook said FLARE UPPakistan and India flirted with war in February  when they carried out aerial bombing missions against each other s territory for the first time since the 1971 war and fought a brief dogfight over the Kashmir skies That flare up was accompanied by a fierce propaganda war on social media This online battle of political and ideological narratives is one that Pakistan s military believes it must win at all costs  analysts say  Military spokesmen often warn unconventional  fifth generation warfare  is being waged against Pakistan Facebook said on Monday the 103 accounts removed were part of a network linked to employees of the Pakistani military s public relations arm Tayyab denies the Pakistan Cyber Force is linked to Pakistan s military  saying the group is made up of volunteers But analysts say such cyber armies work directly either for Pakistan s military or civilian state organizations  acting as de facto proxies or militias in the online battlefields  These groups who are being resourced and organized are actually a kind of a line of defense for this fifth generation warfare   said Shahzad Ahmed  from Pakistani digital rights group Bytes for All Pakistan s military did not respond to a Reuters request for comment  CASE OF TREASON In India  similar nationalist groups are popping up and pushing to purge and punish those who they perceive to be critical of India   or supportive of Pakistan   on social media One such group  Clean the Nation  says its actions have resulted in more than 50 people who had posted what it called anti India comments and remarks critical of India s armed forces being arrested or suspended from work or education  This is our motherland and if someone is abusing people who are protecting our motherland  actually fighting on the ground  I don t believe they should be allowed to work here or allowed to live here   Rahul Kaushik  one of co founders the group  told Reuters   This is a clear case of treason  in our view  Kaushik said Clean the Nation had no formal links with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   though one BJP leader praised the group when it was founded in late February  following an attack by a Pakistan militant group in Indian controlled Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitary police Two of Clean the Nation s founders  Siddharth Kapoor and Ashutosh Vashishtha  are followed on Twitter by India s Prime Minister Narendra Modi  Others including Kaushik have posted pictures on social media of meetings with Modi and other members of his cabinet   Amit Malviya  the BJP s head of social media  did not respond to a request for comment  Clean the Nation said some of its accounts had been banned or suspended by Facebook last month  That action was unconnected with the 549 accounts and 138 pages linked to India s opposition Congress Party that Facebook said on Monday had been taken down    Additional reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal in New Delhi and Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI  Editing by Alex Richardson  

FALLS CHURCH  Va    House Republicans said Tuesday that they tried and failed to broker a deal with Democrats that would allow for a bipartisan public hearing in which two women who accuse Virginia Lt  Gov  Justin Fairfax of sexual assault could testify under oath Republican Speaker Kirk Cox issued a statement blaming Democrats for refusing to participate in what he said would be a bipartisan hearing  effectively blocking any hearing from taking place  There should be no mistake about what has happened here  the alleged victims are seeking a bipartisan hearing  Republicans are seeking a bipartisan hearing  Democrats in the House of Delegates are refusing to allow that to happen   Cox said Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson leveled their accusations against Fairfax in February  Tyson says Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex in 2004  Watson says Fairfax raped her in 2000 when both were students at Duke University Their allegations have received new attention after televised interviews this week with CBS News in which they tearfully described their experiences Fairfax  a Democrat  has said his encounters with both women were consensual and says he took a polygraph test that determined he s telling the truth Both women have said they want to testify in front of the General Assembly  Cox  in his statement  said Republicans have reached out to both women and they are willing to share their stories at a legislative hearing  but only if there is bipartisan cooperation to conduct the hearing Cox released a letter he received from House Minority Leader Eileen Filler Corn in which she rejected Republicans  overtures for a joint hearing  Law enforcement officials are best equipped to investigate these matters  and we certainly would not want to harm their inquiries or deny due process to either the complainants or the Lieutenant Governor by conducting a hearing that could easily be exploited for political purposes   she wrote In a phone interview  Filler Corn noted that the House Democratic Caucus has called for Fairfax s resignation   You can t help but be moved by these women s stories   she said   They ve shown uncommon bravery  for sure  Fairfax has also said a law enforcement investigation is the better path  My accusers have not filed criminal charges and they have not sued me   Fairfax said in a written statement provided Monday to the AP   Instead  we see escalating media appearances and stated desire for a political process that is unprecedented in Virginia and could not be designed to get at the truth  Such a process would instead be a media circus used for partisan and political purposes  Cox s statement came a few hours after  CBS This Morning  aired a tearful interview with Watson in which she said she had been friends with him for more than a year before he locked her in a room and raped her  I completely trusted him   she said   It was a huge betrayal  He was my friend  I don t understand how you do that to someone that you ve been a friend to  She rejected Fairfax s claim the sex was consensual  saying Fairfax held her down during the attack   If you have to hold someone down  it s not consensual   she said The Associated Press typically does not identify people who say they were sexually assaulted  but Tyson and Watson stepped forward voluntarily and have expressed a desire to testify in public The women leveled their allegations against Fairfax at a moment when he seemed poised to ascend to the governor s post  Virginia Gov  Ralph Northam was facing numerous calls to resign after a racist photo showing a person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume was found on his medical school yearbook page Then  the next in line after Fairfax  Attorney General Mark Herring  acknowledged that he appeared in a photo wearing blackface as a student at the University of Virginia  and the prospect of all three statewide officeholders leaving and handing power to Republicans cooled demands for their resignations  Northam  Fairfax and Herring  all Democrats  have remained in office and at the head of their party ahead of November elections in which Democrats hope to gain control of the state Legislature

For weeks  millions of protesters filling Algeria s streets have demanded the end of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika s 20 year rule  as well as the  System  of cronyism and corruption he oversaw  On Tuesday night  the wheelchair bound  82 year old president was finally forced from power The final push came from the army chief of staff  Ahmed Gaïd Salah  a former ally who belatedly came around to the protesters  view that the president was physically unable to perform his role  and was being used by a tight circle of family members and businessmen to preserve their privileges The country s constitutional council ratified the resignation on Wednesday  formally ending the rule of a man who had locked down Algeria s politics for a generation  but leaving the country on the threshold of new uncertainties Even though the protesters remarkably succeeded in removing Mr  Bouteflika from office without a single life lost or shot fired by the security services  the standoff is far from over What happens now ImageSenate Speaker Abdelkader Bensalah  a Bouteflika ally  is to oversee an interim government for 90 days  while elections are organized CreditFethi Belaid Agence France Presse

 Bouteflika on Sunday night is still in charge  It will be presided over by a Bouteflika ally  the elderly head of the country s senate  Abdelkader Bensalah  for 90 days  while elections are organized The prime minister named by Mr  Bouteflika  former Interior Minister Noureddine Bedoui  is seen as a Bouteflika loyalist and hard liner  castigated by the political opposition and protesters as the man who organized rigged legislative elections in 2017 and has violently put down protests before Who is running things ImageThe ailing President Bouteflika  shown on state television  handing over his resignation letter to the head of the constitutional council  Tayeb Belaiz  as Mr  Bensalah  looked on Creditvia ReutersThe interim government presided over by Mr  Bedoui and Mr  Bensalah is nominally in charge  But it is certain that the army will keep a close watch on it  It is equally certain that its credibility with the street is limited  And it is an open question as to how long it lasts The images on Algerian television were telling  A feeble looking Mr  Bouteflika handing his resignation letter to the elderly president of the country s constitutional council  watched by another elderly man  Mr  Bensalah  who will decide the country s destiny as Mr  Bouteflika s temporary replacement That scenario is unlikely to reassure the thousands of youthful protesters who gathered to celebrate Mr  Bouteflika s departure Tuesday night in central Algiers  Although their main demand has been met  the two other men in the televised images symbolize the protesters  other complaint  that Algeria remains in the hands of the  System   the nexus of compromised politicians  businessmen and military who have kept democracy firmly at bay Will this satisfy the protesters ImageA protest against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algiers last week CreditMohamed Messara EPA  via ShutterstockThat is unlikely  The interim government is already seen as Mr  Bouteflika s creature  and Mr  Bensalah is widely known as a Bouteflika loyalist and the beneficiary of the ex president s patronage The protesters have been unified under the slogan    Système degage   or   System Get Lost    Everybody associated with the Bouteflika regime is suspect in their eyes and has no legitimacy  They are demanding nothing less than a clean slate   new leaders  real elections  and a real rule of law  Algeria has known none of these things Meetings of opposition politicians and civil society groups are taking place in Algiers to map out a future for the country  Out of these meetings a few figures have emerged who could play a leading role  notably the human rights lawyer Mostefa Bouchachi What is the military likely to do ImageThe army chief of staff  Gen  Ahmed Gaid Salah  gave Mr  Bouteflika a final push CreditAnis Belghoul Associated PressThe unresolved question for the coming days is  how far is the military likely to let the protesters go in their demand for an overhaul of the  System   General Salah himself  though now proclaiming himself on the side of the crowd  was very much part of the old regime The army has been the ultimate arbiter of political life since independence 57 years ago  This time  too  it was the army that gave the final push to Mr  Bouteflika  Without the army s support it is unlikely the protest movement would have been successful in its goal to oust the ex president Is the army now willing to turn the country s future entirely over to civilians  with no say  Unlikely  They are not going to stop Algerians from searching for a new Algeria  but they want to be present   an actor   because they have interests to protect   said Hasni Abidi  Algerian Swiss director of the Center for Study and Research on the Arab and Mediterranean World  in Geneva  It this role that is problematic   Mr  Abidi said   The army is the only decisive actor  But since Feb  22    the date of the first demonstration    there is

Look at the numbers  and something of a mystery emerges regarding the Trump administration s claims of a surge of uncontrolled arrivals Net migration across the southern border is at historic lows  Border apprehensions of unauthorized arrivals were at the lowest in modern record in 2017 and 2018  Apprehensions are up this spring  but still far below the highs of the 1980s  1990s or early 2000s Yet processing centers and detention centers are filling  some to near capacity  straining to meet even basic medical needs of migrant families  Images from the border show women and children huddling in overcrowded facilities The answer  immigration experts say  is that the crisis isn t primarily caused by the number of arrivals  but by Trump administration policies that disperse them to a handful of centers and that treat families who voluntarily surrender as invaders   creating the appearance of an invasion Far from being unique to the Trump administration  it is merely the latest in a pattern across Western democracies  where anti immigration sentiment is driving demand for harsh policies that may not only fail to reduce arrivals  but to also make the problem look even more uncontrolled and overwhelming The causes of that self reinforcing cycle may run far deeper than policy mismatch or even matters of immigration Economic dislocation and demographic change have provoked feelings of lost control and lost status among some whites  however real or imagined  It is a combination of forces  research suggests  that taps into deep seated instincts to seek safety in a familiar group identity   and to try to reimpose control Those feelings tend to focus on borders  even if undocumented immigration is not actually up  And policies that deliver on desires for a strict response can make the problem appear worse  deepening fears of chaos and of being overwhelmed This feedback loop  building in the United States and Europe since long before the latest upticks in arrivals  may be a major driver of the populist revolt  And it is playing into the growing global conflict between old style national identities  imagined as homogeneous and fixed  and a world that no longer aligns with them  Migration is really tough because  as Catherine Dauvergne said  it s the last bastion of sovereignty   said Jaya Ramji Nogales  an immigration scholar at Temple University s law school   At points in history where the demographic shift is changing  that s an easy thing for people to be scared of  ImageCuban asylum seekers waiting in Ciudad Juárez  Mexico  on Sunday CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesThe Cycle of CrisisSome 30 years ago  the United States constructed a wall on its southern border between the San Ysidro crossing  which links San Diego with Tijuana  and the Pacific Ocean This had an unintended effect  It funneled some migrants onto Interstate 5  which cut through the barriers  When a handful were hit by cars  transit authorities posted now infamous yellow signs showing a silhouette of a dashing family   widely known as  immigrant crossing  signs  That gave the impression of utter chaos at the border   said Douglas S  Massey  a Princeton University immigration scholar   But nothing had really changed   we were just hardening the border and pushing people into different places  The signs fed into a nationwide backlash against unauthorized immigration  Mr  Massey said  leading the Clinton administration to fund more border walls and nearly double border patrol agents But rather than reducing arrivals  this pushed them into desolate routes across the Arizona deserts  Crossing sparse ranch lands rather than dense cities  the migrant flows came to look far more numerous  Mr  Massey said  which made  a big impression and fed the narrative that there was this new invasion  Now  that cycle may be playing out again ImageSigns like this were posted in California in 2006 CreditHector Mata Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesPolicies meant to deter arrivals are putting them into a handful of centers  concentrating numbers in a way that makes them appear overwhelming  The policies have also put asylum claimants and families  who take some time to process  into facilities designed to house unauthorized migrant workers who can be deported quickly At the same time  the increase may appear larger than it actually is because a greater share of arrivals are voluntarily surrendering  hoping to apply for asylum  This is a right guaranteed under international law  but administration policy functionally treats them like undocumented immigrants  and even criminals  That feeds perceptions of a surge and creates the overcrowded conditions at detention centers  The numbers aren t that big  but if you re treating families as criminals and arresting them  holding them  the system can t handle that   said Mr  Massey  the Princeton scholar   It makes it look like there s absolute chaos at the border  but the chaos is because we don t have policies that fit the problem  An Underlying TensionA similar cycle has played out in Europe and Australia  Tightened European Union land borders  for example  led more refugees to travel by boats  When they sank  as many did  the horrifying episodes deepened Europeans  sense of chaos The surge of arrivals to Europe in 2015 and 2016 was an undeniable crisis  but it also hit on much deeper issues  That may help explain why it also fed into fears around immigration in the United States Psychological research suggests that fears about uncontrolled borders may be tied to deeper fears about loss of identity or loss of control Human beings desire the sense of safety they get from a strong  familiar group identity  Though white people in Western countries remain politically and culturally dominant  rising diversity has left some feeling that their status is under threat ImageSyrian refugees arriving in Greece in 2015  Tightened European Union land borders led more refugees to travel by boat CreditSergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesThis is perhaps why heavily white areas where children are likely to be less well off than their parents had been are especially likely to support Mr  Trump  according to a Gallup study Fear that one s in group will decline in relative power  whatever the cause  can make people feel a sense of loss of control  leading them to cling more firmly to their ethnicity and to see outsiders as a threat  It also tends to make people more nationalistic and more skeptical of immigration  according to a recent study of voters in the United States  Britain and Poland  which found that this fear predicted support for Brexit and for Mr  Trump The border  as perhaps the most obvious symbol of national identity and territorial protection  is a natural focal point for those fears  And so to many people  it feels true that there is a wave of uncontrolled immigrants and chaos at the border   even if arrivals are low in historic terms and many of the migrants are simply families seeking asylum It may also feel urgently necessary to reimpose order But stricter border policies tend to attract more attention and controversy  and can end up making immigration fears seem even more salient  As the news shows desperate people huddled in makeshift camps  creating the impression of a swamped border  the cycle repeats The Populist Feedback LoopThese sentiments align near perfectly with the drivers of right wing populism  a sense of lost control  a desire to reassert order and a narrowing national identity  And that populist sentiment can feed back into itself Global immigration flows are expected to increase over the long term due to climate change  deepening economic disparities and technology assisted ease of travel  Demographic trends  though easily overstated  are already making Western countries more diverse ImageWaiting at a port of entry in Tijuana on Sunday CreditMario Tama Getty ImagesA populist sentiment that calls for resisting this long underway change is likely to only heighten awareness of it  much like the strict border policies that tend to worsen the appearance of disorder The resulting policies can have the opposite of their intended effect When the Clinton administration stepped up deportations  it relocated American born gangs like MS 13 to Central America  where they flourished in an environment of poverty and state weakness  Today  many Central American families are fleeing that gang violence for the United States  In response  Mr  Trump has cut aid to three countries most threatened by gang violence These policies can bring significant harm to the migrants and refugees that they target  When you have women and children behind fences under a bridge  that s bad optics   Mr  Massey said  referring to makeshift migrant detention practices in Texas that left children sleeping on gravel and under mylar blankets   It s causing a lot of human damage

ROME   Italy s ruling League party might not forge any more electoral pacts at a national level with its traditional ally Forza Italia  a senior League politician said on Tuesday  signaling the possible end of an era The League has struck repeated alliances with former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia over the past two decades  including at a parliamentary election in March 2018 However  the center right bloc  which also includes the nationalist Brothers of Italy  failed to win an outright majority in that vote  leading to three months of political stalemate  In the end  the League formed a coalition with the anti system 5 Star Movement  leaving Berlusconi in opposition  If we were to vote before the end of the year     I do not know if it would be possible to run again in a centre right alliance   said Riccardo Molinari  the League s parliamentary party leader in the lower house Molinari  who is close to League chief Matteo Salvini  stressed that he did not expect any national election this year  but said if his party performs strongly in EU parliamentary polls in May it might seek more power within the government The centre right bloc still stands together in local elections and has won seven successive regional votes over the past 12 months    most recently last month in Basilicata  At a national level  there is the question of the political vision you want to have  which is very different from local problems   Molinari told foreign reporters  noting the different views of Europe held by the eurosceptic League and more mainstream Forza Italia He did not mention Brothers of Italy  which is ideologically much closer to the League and a more natural partner Although the ruling coalition is constantly riven with tensions over a variety of issues  Molinari said League and 5 Star lawmakers got along well  while their two parties still commanded a clear majority in the polls  The longer we govern with 5 Star  the more it enters the public conscience and it would be hard to understand why the League  subsequently  would run with the centre right   he said The League s own support has roughly doubled from last year s election  with recent polls putting it on around 33 percent  By contrast  backing for 5 Star has dropped to around 22 percent from 33 percent a year ago Molinari said if the polls were borne out in next month s EU ballot then the balance of power would change within the government  If we get more votes than 5 Star  as seems likely  we will try to make our ideas weigh more on certain issues than is the case now   he added   We will clearly have greater weight  but we will want to use it to push the government forward not to break it apart    Reporting by Crispian Balmer  Editing by Catherine Evans  

ALGIERS   Algeria s caretaker government faces the prospect of persistent popular demands for the removal of a scletoric ruling elite and wholesale reforms after ailing 82 year old President Abdelaziz Bouteflika quit in the face of mass protests  We want a president who understands what we want   25 year old Bouzid Abdoun  an engineer at state owned energy concern Sonelgaz  told Reuters on Wednesday   We want to live here  not to migrate to Europe  Bouteflika ended 20 years in power on Tuesday after a final nudge by the military following six weeks of protests calling for democratic reforms after almost 60 years of monolithic rule by veterans of the 1954 62 independence war against France That leaves Algeria extraordinarily in the hands of a caretaker government until elections in three months and with no successor in sight However  protesters made quickly clear that they would accept no new president from  le pouvoir   the popular nickname for the entrenched establishment of elderly veterans  business tycoons and National Liberation Front  FLN  party functionaries   What is important to us is that we do not accept the  caretaker  government   Mustapha Bouchachi  a lawyer and protest leader  told Reuters just before Bouteflika stepped down   Peaceful protests will continue  Ali Benflis  a former head of the ruling FLN party  said other leading figures should also quit  naming Abdelkader Bensalah  chairman of the upper house who is standing in for Bouteflika for 90 days  interim premier Noureddine Bedoui and constitutional council head Tayeb Belai  The Algerian people have just closed one of the darkest chapters in the history of our country   he said in a statement  calling the protest a  peaceful popular revolution Protesters have brushed aside especially Bedoui  whom Bouteflika appointed on Sunday as his grip on power was fading  Bedoui is seen by many in the street as a stalwart of the ruling circles   as interior minister he oversaw elections which the opposition said were not free or fair Algeria s streets were quiet on Wednesday but the next test for the interim rulers looms on Friday  the day of the weekly mass marches since Feb  22 Bouteflika s exit is seen only as a first gesture for young Algerians demanding jobs in a country where one in every four under the age of 30 is unemployed in a highly statist  undiversified economy dependent on oil and gas exports In an emotional letter published by state media  Bouteflika bade farewell to the nation  thanking Algerians several times for having him rule the country for 20 years  Algeria will soon have a new president and I pray that God will help him to pursue the ambitions and hopes of its brave children   he wrote CORRUPTION AND CRONYISMThe outpouring of dissent is also over systemic cronyism that has seen Algeria effectively run by Bouteflika s brothers  tycoons and ex military intelligence officers since he suffered a stroke in 2013 and largely vanished from view  analysts say Protests were initially ignited by Bouteflika s plan to seek a fifth mandate in elections this month  since postponed  but the agenda broadened to calls for root and branch change The top priority for any successor would be to liberalize the economy  shifting away from an expensive but unproductive welfare state  and create jobs for young people who comprise almost 70 percent of the population The North African country has almost no foreign debt burden but its hard currency reserves have halved to  70 billion since 2014 due to a slide in volatile oil and gas prices  Definitely the top priority is to address economic issues to diversify away from oil and gas revenues   said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity  One name with an economic background respected by many protesters who has emerged as a potential successor is Ahmed Benbitour  who served as prime minister under Bouteflika before resigning over lack of progress on reforms He is a technocrat with no ties to political parties  though he is also in his 70s like many senior Algerian officials Earlier this week  in a sign of Bouteflika s imminent political demise  authorities seized the passports of a dozen politically connected businessmen under investigation for alleged corruption  One of them  Bouteflika loyalist Ali Haddad  has been taken into custody  Ennahar TV reported on Wednesday  Bouteflika s group captured the state  so the top priority for whoever replaces Bouteflika is really to re connect with the millions of protesters who marched because they no longer trust the pouvoir   said independent analyst Farid Ferrahi Western powers  some of which had demanded a peaceful solution  will be relieved at Bouteflika s departure  valuing stability in the OPEC oil producer  which is also a key gas supplier for Europe and partner in fighting Islamist militants U N  Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he  looks forward to a peaceful and democratic

CHICAGO   Lori Lightfoot s victory in the Chicago mayor s race signaled hope among voters that the nation s third largest city may someday move beyond long entrenched divides  racial and otherwise  that have left large parts of the metropolis feeling ignored by people in power Lightfoot became the city s first black female and first openly gay mayor when she defeated another black woman  Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle  in Tuesday s election  She joins Chicago s top prosecutor and police chief as black leaders in a city that continues to struggle with race relations But the significance of her win also transcended race or gender  Lightfoot was the outsider  a little known former federal prosecutor who grew up in Ohio and had never been elected to public office  much less climbed through the ranks of Chicago s Democratic machine  Yet she toppled some of the biggest political names and most powerful leaders in the city with a promise to end political corruption and be a voice for low income and minority people and neighborhoods  Today is April 3  a new day for all of Chicago   Lightfoot said Wednesday at a news conference called by the Rev  Jesse Jackson to promote postelection unity  Preckwinkle stood beside her Chicago has long struggled with issues of segregation  housing discrimination mostly targeting blacks and Hispanics and a generationally engrained mistrust of the city s mostly white police department The tension between police and residents exploded in protests following the 2014 fatal shooting of 17 year old Laquan McDonald by a white police office  Jason Van Dyke was sentenced earlier this year to fewer than seven years in prison for second degree murder Chicago also has seen its population drop  due largely to thousands of black residents leaving neighborhoods on the South and West sides   areas South Side resident and political consultant Delmarie Cobb describes as  gutted   At the same time  downtown and predominantly white neighborhoods on Chicago s North Side have been growing and glistening with new investment For black residents   you can t help but feel that the city and the city leaders have turned their backs on you   Cobb said  When you see hundreds of thousands of black people leaving  a city that once had a reputation as being the land of opportunity for black people   people want to know that somebody is going to speak for them   Cobb added Joyce Ross  64  supported Lightfoot and said one of the reasons she s most excited about her taking office stems from her own unsuccessful efforts to get a city job decades ago  She recalled it as a time when who she knew seemed more important than what she knew Then came the election of Harold Washington  the city s first African American mayor  who also was on the outs with the Democratic establishment  I got three calls really quick about jobs I could apply for   recalled Ross  who lives on Chicago s West Side  She did apply  and soon she was working for the city John Allison  a 64 year old dog catcher  also compared Lightfoot with Washington  and said he believes she has a better chance of bringing the city together  She had more of a unity type thing that kind of reminded me of Harold Washington  where she would let everybody in   Allison said Finley Campbell  a spokesman for the Chicago based Unitarian Universalist Multiracial Racial Unity Action Council  said part of what makes Lightfoot s win historic is also that she reached out successfully to white voters She earned broad support  receiving about three fourths of the total vote and winning all 50 Chicago wards  Her margins of victory ranged from about 8 percentage points in a largely black South Side ward to as high as 75 percentage points in predominantly white wards on the North and southwest sides  It is historic because a black  openly gay sister is out there   Campbell said   What s also historic for me is she reached out very successfully to the white ethnic community  where you have traditional Polish  German  Irish type people  There s also a connection to the firefighters and police department  and working class people   Her ability to say  I will represent you  too   accounts for it being successful  Lightfoot said she took Tuesday s results as a mandate for change  and that she plans to  take full advantage of it   But she noted there is much difficult work ahead She said her priorities upon taking office will be to get a handle on violence  rebuild the public school system  ensure Chicago is welcoming to immigrants and confront the city s deep financial problems  Honeymoons come and go  and I want to make sure we re doing all we can to really breathe life into the historic nature of this election   she said    Williams reported from Detroit  Associated Press writer Don Babwin and video producer Noreen Nasir in Chicago also contributed to this report

LONDON   After years of partisan battling  Prime Minister Theresa May and the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn began an emergency  11th hour effort Wednesday to find common ground on Britain s tortuous effort to withdraw from the European Union The question was  could they overcome their antagonistic history and find a way out of the quagmire The first signs  following a two hour meeting between Conservative and Labour leaders in a wood paneled office in Parliament  were guardedly optimistic  at least from the government s side  Today s talks were constructive  with both sides showing flexibility and a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close   a government spokesman said   We have agreed a program of work to ensure we deliver for the British people  protecting jobs and security  Mr  Corbyn  who is navigating treacherous political terrain in the negotiations  was markedly less enthusiastic  There hasn t been as much change as I expected  but we will have further discussions tomorrow to explore technical issues   he said Mr  Corbyn said he told the government that Labour wanted to remain in a customs union with the European Union  with access to the bloc s single market and regulatory structures  adding   I also raised the option of a public vote to prevent crashing out or leaving on a bad deal  ImageMrs  May at a news conference after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday CreditPool photo by Jack TaylorThe spotlight in the cross party negotiations seemed for now to be falling on Mr  Corbyn  who has spent the last two years dodging it A left wing critic of the European Union  he has played coy throughout the preparations for the withdrawal  known as Brexit Throughout the Brexit debate  Mr  Corbyn has ducked and weaved  trying to bridge the gap between the Remainers and Leavers in his own party while letting Mrs  May take the blame for the shambling effort to steer Britain s departure His trick has been to oppose what Labour calls Mrs  May s  Tory Brexit   insisting that he could negotiate something better  while keeping alive the possibility of holding a second referendum  even if he has shown little  enthusiasm for the idea Ahead of the 2016 referendum  he did the bare minimum for the pro European campaign  and many believe he would be happy were Britain to leave the bloc   providing he is not seen as responsible for the exit  His ideal scenario is that May gets her deal through  he votes against it and is not tainted   said Steven Fielding  a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham But after three large parliamentary defeats of the departure deal that Mrs  May negotiated with the bloc  that looks unlikely to happen And now  Mrs  May s cross party initiative threatens to drag him into the Brexit maelstrom  threatening to tear apart the Labour Party  which  like the Conservatives  is internally divided on the stay leave issue What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union Clearly  for Mr  Corbyn  ducking and weaving is no longer an option  This is his moment of decision   Mr  Fielding said   His policy has been one of constructive ambiguity  but now he has to decide  He has to act  he has to come to a decision  Getting there  however  will be devilishly tricky  requiring the balancing of several strong political currents in his party Many of the new  mainly young  supporters Mr  Corbyn has attracted to Labour in recent years are passionate pro Europeans and favor a second vote  where people would choose between the government s Brexit plan and staying in the bloc  A big group of his lawmakers agree But a sizable number of Labour lawmakers  around 20 percent  represent working class districts that voted to leave  Fearing a backlash among their constituents  many want to honor the referendum result and end freedom of movement from the European Union  primarily to cut immigration from Eastern Europe Further complicating matters  some of Mr  Corbyn s closest allies are left wing Brexit   or  Lexit    supporters who believe the bloc s antitrust rules might prevent a socialist Corbyn government from enacting policies like subsidizing loss making businesses or offering government contracts to local companies without opening them up to tendering So far Mr  Corbyn has managed to straddle the divide and keep to the letter  if not the spirit  of last year s agreement at the Labour Party conference  which supported a second referendum in the absence of his preferred option  a general election The idea of a second referendum is gaining momentum among Labour lawmakers On Wednesday  Emily Thornberry  who would be expected to have the foreign secretary post in a Labour government  endorsed the idea But Mrs  May and her Conservative allies have adamantly opposed a second referendum  saying that in a closely divided nation it would yield another close result that would only make matters worse ImageAnt Brexit campaigners near Parliament in London on Wednesday CreditIsabel Infantes Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesAs the two sides continue their talks  one possible area of agreement is Labour s proposal for Britain remaining in a customs union with the bloc  which eliminates tariffs on goods between member nations  But Mr  Corbyn says he wants a post Brexit Britain to also be able to influence European Union trade policy and the deals the bloc strikes around the world that would apply to Britain too That negotiating point  however  would be hard if not impossible to get the bloc to agree to Mr  Corbyn also wants to align British and European Union environmental and product standards  keeping close to Europe s single market albeit from the outside  That is not as far from the deal Mrs  May has negotiated as it may appear Mrs  May s proposal envisions keeping Britain in its current status until 2020  when it would leave the customs union and the single market  giving it control over immigration But the plan  contained in a nonbinding political declaration that is separate from the withdrawal agreement  leaves open the possibility of staying quite close to those structures  And unlike the legally binding withdrawal treaty spelling out divorce terms  it remains a matter still open to negotiation with the bloc Yet even if Mr  Corbyn could agree to a blueprint with Mrs  May  there would remain the problem of devising assurances to Labour that the government would stick to the plan  Given that Mrs  May has already announced she plans to step aside if she secures agreement for her Brexit plan  Labour worries that she will be succeeded by a hard line Brexit supporter who could tear up any deal struck now Even if she were to remain in office  the complexity in trade negotiations is in the details  and those negotiations would be conducted by the government  So Labour would want any agreement reached written into British law  though even that could be repealed by a different Conservative government following an election But perhaps the biggest problem for Mr  Corbyn  If he refused to demand that any Brexit plan be put to a second referendum  that could provoke a huge backlash from pro European Labour lawmakers Mr  Fielding believes Mr  Corbyn would like Brexit out of the way because he sees it as a distraction from his attacks on austerity  But like the rest of the Brexit riddle  the Labour leader s next moves are impossible to predict  Mr  Fielding said  What one person does or doesn t do at a certain point can shape the rest of British history for the foreseeable future   said Mr  Fielding   Isn t that a scary thought   

OTTAWA   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday sought to quell a crisis that threatens his chances of re election  expelling from party ranks two former Cabinet members he said had undermined the ruling Liberals Trudeau said former Justice Minister Jody Wilson Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott would no longer be allowed to sit as Liberal legislators  They were also barred from running for the party in the federal election this October The Liberals have been in turmoil since Wilson Raybould said in February that officials had inappropriately pressured her last year while she was justice minister to ensure that construction company SNC Lavalin Group Inc escape a corruption trial  The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken   Trudeau told an emergency meeting of caucus  Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them   said Trudeau  47  who took office in November 2015 and faces a tough re election battle this autumn Wilson Raybould  who tweeted news of her ouster before Trudeau s announcement  was demoted in January and resigned the next month  Philpott quit shortly afterward  saying she had lost confidence in how Trudeau was handling the matter  If people can t express trust in the party and the prime minister  then they need to find another political vehicle in order to advance their ideas  It s as simple as that   Justice Minister David Lametti told reporters  The expulsion represented a change of course for Trudeau  who said as recently as last week that the Liberals needed strong legislators with differing points of view But increasingly angry parliamentarians had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity Opinion polls show the crisis has cut public support for the Liberals to such an extent that they could lose in October to the official opposition Conservatives Trudeau  who came to power promising  sunny ways  and a greater role for women in politics  admitted it  has been a difficult few weeks  The scandal also cost him the services of his closest aide  Gerald Butts  and Michael Wernick  the head of the federal bureaucracy Wilson Raybould said on Twitter   I have no regrets  I spoke the truth as I will continue to do   Last Friday  to back her case  she released the audio of a confidential conversation with Wernick  who did not know she was recording him  Trudeau said that was  unconscionable  Philpott said on Facebook that she  did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister     it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course  regardless of its short term and long term consequences  Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing  The scandal is starting to hit his fortunes in the populous province of Quebec  where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in October to remain in power Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau s decision sent a message that  if you tell the truth  there is no room for you in the Liberal Party    Reporting by Steve Scherer and David Ljunggren  Editing by Grant McCool and Peter Cooney  

To the Editor Re  Don t Let Language Education Slip   by Bénédicte de Montlaur  Op Ed  March 27  Speaking and understanding another language  or several  opens doors to worlds beyond and also deep within oneself  Knowing only a single language is not only a cultural limitation  but even more  a lack of access to other ways of thought and perception  The variety of our world cannot be sampled in a single neighborhood or country  Reality is strangled in such a vacuum The fruits of multilingualism have enabled this kid from Brooklyn to live and work in a dozen countries  I wonder how foreign literary classics  art  philosophy and politics can be appreciated through a single lens  much less understanding the lives of those with whom one shares no common means of communication But then what does it matter if one prefers a life surrounded by a wall Art RosenbergCresskill  N J  To the Editor The lack of emphasis placed on languages is a challenge that must be addressed at every level of education and in the American culture at large  While the world stage rewards  even demands  the creation of global citizens who are culturally and linguistically fluent  the resources we allocate to language acquisition do not reflect this necessity  With an anti immigration thread embedded in our political discourse  it is even more critical to emphasize language acquisition for American students and indeed for all Americans Jenn KudererGoodview  Minn  To the Editor As a high school student studying French  I can clearly see the benefits that it provides me both personally and academically Learning another language allows me to communicate with people around the world and learn about other cultures in a less cursory and more genuine manner  For example  through learning French  I have made close friends I might not have been able to communicate with otherwise In addition  numerous studies have shown the cognitive benefits of learning a language  like better perception and decision making skills  The United States should prioritize the teaching of multiple languages in schools  as it encourages Americans to be more engaged global citizens and promotes the growth of essential skills like empathy and decision making Fiona McMahonSan Jose  Calif To the Editor As a former professor of French and Italian  I agree with Bénédicte de Montlaur s observations about the importance of language learning The cancellation of language programs is a direct result of the decades of cuts in public universities  While university leaders may want to develop well informed citizens of the world  their balance sheets force them to seek funding from private sources or tuition increases The free market approach to program design creates a benefit to removing burdensome degree requirements  like a foreign language requirement  At the same time  students who might want to major in a language must consider whether that choice will allow them to pay back the student loans that a public education now requires The defunding of our colleges has created a race to the bottom with little space for long term societal goals Richard KeatleyTucker  Ga  

TOPEKA  Kan    Democratic Gov  Laura Kelly will keep her top business development official after some Republicans in the Kansas Senate broke with the GOP majority and defied the state s most influential anti abortion group to confirm his appointment Monday The vote for Commerce Secretary David Toland was 23 14   Toland has been acting secretary since Kelly took office in January and would have been forced to step down if the Senate had rejected his appointment Toland served last year as the unpaid treasurer for Kelly s successful campaign for governor  but Republican critics questioned his business development and recruiting credentials  He served for 11 years as executive director of Thrive Allen County  a nonprofit economic development and public health group based in his hometown of Iola  in southeast Kansas The anti abortion group Kansans for Life  a power in Republican politics  announced its opposition to Toland s appointment last week  Thrive Allen County received grants in 2015 and 2018  totaling less than  20 000  to promote women s health from a fund named for the late Dr  George Tiller  who performed late term abortions in Wichita  I can t support him because of that   said Sen  Rob Olson  a conservative Kansas City area Republican who previously backed Toland but voted against his confirmation Tiller was among a handful of physicians in the U S  known to terminate pregnancies in their final weeks  His clinic was the site of repeated anti abortion protests  including the weekslong  Summer of Mercy  in 1991  He was shot to death in 2009 in his church by an anti abortion zealot who is serving a 25 years to life prison sentence Eleven of the Senate s 28 Republicans voted to confirm Toland  along with the chamber s 11 Democrats and one independent member  Supporters said Toland already has re energized the state Department of Commerce  I think he will put us back on the map   said Sen  Dinah Sykes  a Kansas City area Democrat Toland has received credit for helping to lure a new grocery store to Iola and helping to persuade voters to build a new community hospital  Business leaders and local chambers of commerce from across the state endorsed his appointment  His energy  expertise and collaborative style will ensure that businesses have the partner they deserve and that the Kansas economy continues to grow   Kelly said in a statement after the vote Some opposition to Toland s confirmation had its roots in the local politics surrounding his work with Thrive Allen County  It intensified when GOP critics began questioning his credentials and Kansans for Life weighed in Mary Kay Culp  the anti abortion group s executive director  said it will monitor the Department of Commerce closely for signs that it is using its programs and economic incentives to encourage new abortion clinics to open in Kansas  It doesn t take much to see how this appointment could go horribly wrong   said Sen  Mary Pilcher Cook  another conservative Kansas City area Republican and strong abortion opponent     

UNITED NATIONS   Health and humanitarian workers in war zones are facing unabated and increasing attacks  and the impact on civilians is nothing but catastrophic   the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross said Monday Peter Maurer told an informal Security Council meeting that three years after the council adopted a landmark resolution urging all countries to take action to prevent violence and threats against medical and aid workers   the evidence of meaningful change on the ground is scarce   The taboo that warring parties would not attack aid workers has been trashed   he said   We need strong leadership  political will and determined action to restore this taboo  Maurer said health services in conflict  must be protected in a neutral humanitarian space and not be part of military strategies to defeat the adversary   And he said  rhetoric and practices which exclude adversaries   for example those labeled  terrorists    from basic health services must stop   and  public health regulations must not be tainted by political and military considerations  U N  humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told the council that when he started working on these issues over 30 years ago  there was a broadly shared assumption that in most circumstances warring parties would not attack aid workers  In the last years  however  he said   humanitarian and medical workers have systematically become targets of attack  Last year  Lowcock said  317 attacks against aid workers resulted in 113 deaths  according to the aid worker security database  And 388 attacks against health personnel or facilities resulted in more than 300 deaths  according to the World Health Organization  he said The undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs called for better equipment and vehicles to improve security especially for local staff  saying about  94 percent of aid workers who were wounded  killed or abducted in 2018 were nationals of the country in which they were working  Lowcock said cooperation between civilian and military authorities is also important  explaining that this has enabled U N  humanitarian staff to run the world s biggest relief operation for between 8 million and 10 million people in Yemen in the last 12 months Trust is essential  he added  but it can only be sustained if governments don t politicize assistance or criminalize engagement or aid to particular groups David Milliband  president of the International Rescue Committee  told the council that with increasing attacks on aid and health workers  it s time for action He called for an immediate and independent investigation of every aid worker s death and urged governments to bring perpetrators to justice Milliband asked the council a series of questions including   Will you block attempts to criminalize our ability to engage with armed actors in the name of counter terror restrictions      Will you seek and speak the truth no matter how powerful the state  how sensitive the topic  or how uncomfortable the question  Milliband said IRC staff are waiting for action in Syria where they face increasing attacks  in Congo  where we are working to control an Ebola outbreak amid relentless arson attacks against treatment centers   and in Yemen   where Houthi  rebels   land mines and  Saudi led  coalition airstrikes mean humanitarians risk their lives with every movement   

ANKARA   Turkey s main opposition candidate in Istanbul urged the High Election Board  YSK  on Wednesday to confirm him as the elected mayor after it ruled in favour of a partial recount of votes in 18 of the city s 39 districts Initial results from Sunday s mayoral elections showed the opposition Republican People s Party  CHP  had narrowly won control of Turkey s two biggest cities  Istanbul and Ankara  in a shock upset for President Tayyip Erdogan s ruling AK Party If those results are confirmed in the coming days  the CHP will gain control of municipal budgets with an estimated total value of 32 6 billion liras   5 79 billion  for 2019 in Istanbul  Turkey s commercial hub  and the capital Ankara Erdogan   who campaigned hard for the AKP ahead of the vote   would likely lose some oversight for local contracts in the two cities  possibly complicating his efforts to drag the Turkish economy out of recession  However the AKP submitted objections to election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara  saying the results had been impacted by invalid votes and voting irregularities In Istanbul  CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu  and his AKP rival  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  both said on Monday that Imamoglu was about 25 000 votes ahead  a relatively slim margin in a city of some 15 million people The chairman of the Election Board  YSK   Sadi Guven  said on Wednesday it had ruled that the recount of what had been marked as invalid votes should go ahead in eight Istanbul districts  some of them AKP strongholds  but added that appeals were still underway The state run Anadolu news agency later said the YSK decided to recount invalid votes in 15 districts and all votes in three other districts as a result of the appeals  The AKP had said previously there were more than 300 000 invalid votes  Six of the 18 districts being recounted were initially won by the CHP  one by the nationalist MHP  and the rest by the AKP  according to Anadolu  Imamoglu called on the YSK to  do its job  and name him mayor  accusing the AKP of disrespecting the people of Istanbul  We want justice  We demand our mandate from the YSK  which has given the numbers  as the elected mayor of this city    The world is watching us   he told reporters After Imamoglu spoke  the hashtag  MazbatamiziVerin  Give our Mandate  was the top trending topic on Twitter in Turkey AKP Deputy Chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz said his party was not doing anything illegal and added that the vote difference between Imamoglu and Yildirim had fallen to below 20 000 votes  We believe the reality will emerge tonight and we will all accept the results   Yavuz told reporters LOCAL PURSE STRINGSPro government newspapers on Wednesday said there had been a conspiracy against Turkey in the local elections  with the Star newspaper likening this to an attempted military coup in 2016 and nationwide protests in 2013  Yeni Safak newspaper editor Ibrahim Karagul called for a second vote after what he termed a  coup via elections   adding without providing evidence that supporters of the U S  based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen   blamed by Ankara for the 2016 coup attempt   were involved In Ankara  opposition candidate Mansur Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes on Sunday  nearly 4 percentage points ahead of his AKP rival  Recounts were planned in 11 Ankara districts due to AKP appeals  Anadolu said In some 100 rallies during his election campaign  Erdogan had described the opposition alliance as terrorist supporters linked to Gulen s network and Kurdish militants Erdogan s political success has rested on years of stellar economic growth in Turkey  but a recession that has brought surging inflation and unemployment and a plunging lira have taken their toll on the president s popularity While Erdogan s ruling alliance won a nationwide majority of just under 52 percent of all votes  losing Ankara and Istanbul   where he started his political life   would significantly dent his dominance  It is by controlling the municipality that you keep your support happy because it is at the municipal level that you give away lots of things to your core base   said Wolfango Piccoli  co president of Teneo political risk advisers While official results have not yet been announced  Erdogan has said his alliance had won the majority of municipal councils across Istanbul and Ankara  The AKP has said this was a sign of irregularity in the vote count Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to volatility in the Turkish lira  which sold off sharply nearly two weeks ago  reflecting waning confidence among both Turks and international investors  The lira was flat on Wednesday but slipped 2 percent on Tuesday after relations with Washington soured following a U S  decision to halt delivery to Turkey of equipment related to the F 35 fighter aircraft Adding to investor concerns over fraying diplomatic ties and possible U S  sanctions over the F 35 aircraft and missile defence  the U S  State Department urged Ankara to respect the  legitimate election results  Ankara responded by warning against foreign interference and  any steps that may be construed as meddling in Turkey s internal affairs     Additional reporting by Can Sezer  Daren Butler  Ali Kucukgocmen  and Dominic Evans in Istanbul  Editing by Jonathan Spicer and Gareth Jones  

BHIMTAL  India   When India s Election Commission announced last month that its code of conduct would have to be followed by social media companies as well as political parties  some analysts scoffed  saying it lacked the capacity and speed required to check the spread of fake news ahead of a multi phase general election that begins April 11 Just weeks later  the commission is indeed struggling to cope with the fake news swirling on Facebook  WhatsApp  YouTube  Twitter and other platforms  and even for its staff to spot it before it has spread across India  observers said Tuesday  Millions of voters are waking up to fake news  propaganda and hate speech inciting violence against Muslims and other minorities every day  But all the commission can do is monitor it   said Apar Gupta  a lawyer and executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation Given the findings that Russia used Facebook to influence the U S  election in 2016  India s Election Commission should have been better prepared  Gupta said Alarmed at the surge in misinformation  Facebook said Monday that it was removing hundreds of pages and accounts because  we don t want our services to be used to manipulate people   WhatsApp on Tuesday unveiled a helpline called Checkpoint Tipline on which people can check the authenticity of information they receive Examples of fake political news in India on social media abound An India page on Facebook claimed that Sonia Gandhi  the ex president of the Congress Party and mother of Rahul Gandhi  the party leader  is the country s fourth richest woman  Another fabricated image showed the Pakistani flag being waved at Rahul Gandhi s election rallies  Yet another purported to show a photograph of Rahul Gandhi s sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wearing a cross around her neck  intended to malign her as a non Hindu Other social media messages and images depicted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a poor light or as a sinister force  Facebook said it had removed 687 pages or accounts that  engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior  linked to the Congress Party The scale of the propaganda  false information  manipulated photos and fake videos may have something to do with the scope of India s general election  The outcome of 879 million Indians voting over five weeks starting next week is being seen by some as a watershed moment that could fundamentally alter the ethos of Indian society Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party hopes for a second term to consolidate its pro growth  majoritarian policies  The opposition Congress is desperate for a revival in its fortunes after a long period of a declining voter base With many politicians convinced the election is going to be fought on WhatsApp  political parties have created WhatsApp group chats to spread their message  Reports in the Indian media say that the BJP plans to have three WhatsApp groups for each of India s 927 533 polling booths   or 2 8 million WhatsApp groups in all  With WhatsApp recently limiting group members to a maximum of 256  the forum s group chats could potentially reach millions of voters For the Commission  fake news presents a huge challenge  India has 1 14 billion cellphone connections  Around 240 million Indians use WhatsApp  Facebook has over 300 million users in India  more than any other country In India  rumors present a real threat  In 2018  more than 30 people were lynched by mobs acting on rumors spread on WhatsApp  In response  the messaging platform limited the number of people that messages could be forwarded to in India to five from the earlier 20  But experts say that all this has meant is that the number of small groups has proliferated For Gupta  the Election Commission s methods for tackling fake news are woefully inadequate  The mechanism they have set up is that if they see any fake news  they will request the Internet and Mobile Association of India to contact Facebook or YouTube and ask them to take it down  The Association then requests the platforms to do this  This is ludicrously slow   said Gupta Last month  Facebook  Google  Twitter  WhatsApp and ShareChat agreed to adhere to a voluntary code of ethics in collaboration with the Election Commission to curb the menace of fake news  promising to take down any deliberately misleading information within three hours Palash Goorha  business director of social media analytics firm Konnect Insights  said this agreement alone was a novel and useful initiative for India s general election   the world s biggest democratic exercise  He expects it will be watched closely by other governments  It s the first time for such an agreement  After the Trump election  Facebook is being proactive and it s good that everyone else signed up to this  Yes  the commission is learning on the job  Yes  it will learn the hard way  But it s a start   Goorha said But according to Ankit Lal  head of social media with the Aam Aadmi Party  which rules New Delhi  the commission should have engaged all the parties concerned  including those who work in public policy in this field  much earlier to grasp the sheer scale of the problem and devise more concrete steps to tackle it  For an organized and concerted effort  the commission should have been actively engaged both with the social media companies and other groups who know much more about it than it does  long ago   Lal said   You can t get ready for such a mammoth exercise in a few months  At present  it seems more concerned about being seen to be effective than actually being effective in preventing fake news influencing this election   

Last Sunday  Attorney General William Barr sent us a letter summarizing what he says are the  principal conclusions  of the special counsel  Robert Mueller  The next day  together with five other committee chairmen  I wrote back to the attorney general  demanding that he provide us with the full Mueller report   not a summary  but the full report and all of the relevant evidence   by April 2 For nearly two years  the country has waited to read the report  Over those many months  President Trump has raged against the institutions that make our democracy possible   among them  the free press  the courts and his own Department of Justice  When the special counsel indicted members of the president s inner circle  his attacks got louder Before the formal investigation began  Mr  Trump fired his F B I  director  He later fired his attorney general  He reportedly attempted to fire the special counsel himself  Despite this profoundly unacceptable behavior  the special counsel persevered and wrote his report We   the members of the Judiciary Committee  the House of Representatives and the entire American public   are still waiting to see that report  We will not wait much longer  We have an obligation to read the full report  and the Department of Justice has an obligation to provide it  in its entirely  without delay  If the department is unwilling to produce the full report voluntarily  then we will do everything in our power to secure it for ourselves  The entire reason for appointing the special counsel was to protect the investigation from political influence  By offering us his version of events in lieu of the report  the attorney general  a recent political appointee  undermines the work and the integrity of his department  He also denies the public the transparency it deserves  We require the full report   the special counsel s words  not the attorney general s summary or a redacted version We require the report  first  because Congress  not the attorney general  has a duty under the Constitution to determine whether wrongdoing has occurred  The special counsel declined to make a  traditional prosecutorial judgment  on the question of obstruction  but it is not the attorney general s job to step in and substitute his judgment for the special counsel s  That responsibility falls to Congress   and specifically to the House Judiciary Committee   as it has in every similar investigation in modern history  The attorney general s recent proposal to redact the special counsel s report before we receive it is unprecedented  We require the evidence  not whatever remains after the report has been filtered by the president s political appointee On its face  the attorney general s letter raises more questions than it answers  He tells us  for instance  that he declined to charge the president with obstruction in part because there was no underlying crime to obstruct  Did he discuss that conclusion with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   who  while a federal prosecutor  routinely charged individuals with obstruction without charging the underlying crime  Did the attorney general forget that the special counsel indicted 37 other people  including the president s campaign chairman  deputy campaign chairman and former national security adviser  for various crimes  including conspiracy against the United States  Did he lose track of his own prosecutors  who effectively named the president as an unindicted co conspirator in the Southern District of New York Second  we require the report because Congress has a role that is fundamentally different from that of the Department of Justice  The special counsel s mandate was narrow  investigate allegedly criminal conduct stemming from links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government  Our job is to hold the president accountable any time he undermines the rule of law  and is not limited to his involvement with the Russian government during the campaign Whether or not the president could have been charged with a crime  even the attorney general acknowledges the existence of evidence that has so far been hidden from view  We have every reason to suspect that the unedited obstruction section of the Mueller report resembles the report that Congress received from the Watergate grand jury in 1974  That evidence showed that President Richard Nixon had attempted to obstruct justice  It did not recommend that the president should be prosecuted  It did not say the president should be impeached  It simply stated the evidence so that Congress could do its job Finally  we require the report because one day  one way or another  the country will move on from President Trump  We must make it harder for future presidents to behave this way  We need a full accounting of the president s actions to do that work  When the full scope of the president s misconduct has been revealed  when his lies are debunked and his abuses have been laid bare  I believe that members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will draft legislation to curb the worst of his offenses  Put another way  If President Trump s behavior wasn t criminal  then perhaps it should have been RelatedMore on the Mueller report  Opinion   The Editorial BoardNo Collusion  No  Exoneration March 24  2019Opinion   Neal K  KatyalThe Many Problems With the Barr LetterMarch 24

LONDON   Conservative lawmaker Nick Boles said on Monday he was resigning from Prime Minister Theresa May s governing party after his attempt to seek an alternative route forward to break the deadlock in parliament over Brexit was rejected The proposal Boles put forward for a so called Common Market 2 0  or enhanced Norway style deal which would include membership of the EU s single market as well as a customs arrangement with the EU  lost by 282 votes to 261  I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and our political cohesion  I accept I have failed   Boles told parliament  I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise  I regret therefore to announce that I can no longer sit for this party  Boles later said on Twitter he would sit as an  Independent Progressive Conservative    Reporting by Kate Holton and Paul Sandle  Writing by Kylie MacLellan  editing by William James  

THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORYHow Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West GreatBy Ben ShapiroCLEAR AND PRESENT SAFETY The World Has Never Been Better and Why That Matters to Americans By Michael A  Cohen and Micah ZenkoWhy  exactly  are so many Americans so angry and unhappy  Almost any other country today  and any prior version of the United States  would give its eyeteeth to enjoy our manifold blessings  The country is prosperous and at peace  it faces rivals and nuisances but no major threat  The government acted decisively and capably to crush jihadist terrorism and avert a global depression  Innovation is galloping  crime is down  kids are behaving  and   the ultimate gift   Americans live almost a decade longer than as recently as 1960  President Obama was just plain right when he wrote  in 2016   If you had to choose any time in the course of human history to be alive  you d choose this one  Right here in America  right now  Yet  right here in America  populist rage and illiberal backlash are seizing the day  Why  Two new books approach the question  one of them constructively  the other not so much   The Right Side of History  looks to the politics of meaning   Clear and Present Safety   the politics of fear Remember the politics of meaning  That was the theme of a speech given by Hillary Clinton in April 1993  when she was the first lady   All of us face a crisis of meaning   she said   We need a new definition of civil society which answers the unanswerable questions posed by both the market forces and the governmental ones   Conservatives  and some liberals  made merciless sport of that speech  No one in those end of history days was in the mood to listen Well  they are listening now  Competition  consumerism and globalization worked out much better for some people than others  and the others  who saw their incomes stagnate  their dignified livelihoods evaporate and their communities wither  decided not to go quietly into that good night  In response  some of the best minds on the right are rethinking Reaganism and grappling with the need to humanize neoliberalism Into this conversation steps Ben Shapiro with  The Right Side of History   A conservative writer and speaker whose previous books include  Bullies  How the Left s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans  and  Brainwashed  How Universities Indoctrinate America s Youth   Shapiro begins by saying that we live  in the best world that has ever existed   Yet Americans are losing faith in their democracy and institutions  What changed  In a few introductory paragraphs  he dismisses economics  racial tensions and tribalism as inadequate answers  Instead   we ve spent the last two centuries carving ourselves off from the roots of our civilization   Beginning with the Jewish Bible and ancient Greece  he argues that Western civilization succeeded because it balanced the anchoring moral foundations of its Judeo Christian heritage with the revolutionary dynamism of Enlightenment liberalism  In the past couple of centuries  however  secularism has gone all in on individualism and materialism   Material human progress in the absence of spiritual fulfillment isn t enough   he writes   People need meaning   Mrs  Clinton  call your office Shapiro s spiritual challenge to secularism is not new  In fact  it is venerable  As the liberal tradition s most astute contemporary defender  Peter Berkowitz  often points out  the charge that liberal individualism is self destructively materialistic is itself an important strand of the liberal tradition  Today and in the recent past  its many facets have been explored and debated by some of the right s leading minds  David Brooks  Arthur C  Brooks  Patrick J  Deneen  Yuval Levin  Alasdair MacIntyre  Richard John Neuhaus  Michael Novak and the three most recent popes  to name just a few  Shapiro s argument claims a distinguished pedigree Why  then  did I find his book so dispiriting  Partly because  instead of contending with great ideas  it deploys them as if they were toy soldiers or characters in a video game  The head spins as he trots past thinkers from Plato to Steven Pinker  frequently rendering tendentious judgments along the way  In one typical four page passage  we carom past Marx  Clausewitz  Fichte and Hegel  Most of the name checked play either the role of tradition upholding good guys or relativistic  secular bad guys  Hume leads briskly to Darwin  then Nietzsche  then eugenics and fascism and existentialism and postmodernism and intersectionality  and here we are  kowtowing to the  knowing falsehood  of transgenderism Although I am sympathetic with elements of the author s case  his galloping reductionism left me enervated and wishing his short book were even shorter  But one section is too short  If Western civilization hangs in the balance  how do we save it  In a concluding chapter of only eight pages  Shapiro urges that children be taught that life has purpose  that they have agency  that our civilization is unique and that we are all brothers and sisters  In this way  with  boldness  and  sacrifice   parents will  make warriors of our own children   training them as  defenders of the only civilization worth fighting for  Pondering Shapiro s call for fresh recruits in a never ending culture war  I found myself wondering what sort of book he might have written had he sought out and contended with the real world puzzles and contradictions and trade offs that would complicate his story line  as David Brooks and Timothy P  Carney and Oren Cass and James and Deborah Fallows and George Packer and J  D  Vance  among others  have done  May we hope that someday Shapiro will leaven his combativeness with curiosity  Clear and Present Safety  is less ambitious and more constructive  Michael A  Cohen and Micah Zenko  who are columnists for The Boston Globe and Foreign Policy magazine  respectively  write that  Americans live in a world that is safer and freer than ever before in human history   and it is not even close   Yet  most Americans are simply unaware of the extraordinary and unprecedented political  economic and social progress that has taken place in virtually every corner of the globe over the past three decades  The closest thing America has to a national ideology today may be neurotic safetyism  the doctrine that the country s children and college students and homeland are fragile and besieged by danger  Leaving helicopter parenting and campus safe spaces to others  the authors focus on the exaggerated fear of foreign threats and terrorism   The American public is being fed  by politicians and pundits alike  a steady diet of threat inflation that has made them deeply fearful of the world outside their borders   they write  Fearmongering builds power for politicians and pundits  profits for media companies and defense contractors and publicity for social activists and reformers  The harms include swollen defense budgets  counterproductive military interventions  wasted resources  think  border wall  and demagoguery s toll on democracy itself This argument  too  is not new  In his book  Overblown  How Politicians and the Terrorism Industry Inflate National Security Threats  and Why We Believe Them   John Mueller  of Ohio State University  has written indispensably about threat inflation  and so have others  But Cohen and Zenko march through the evidence commandingly and comprehensively  and their case has never been more apt and important than it is right now  when a professional fearmonger leads the country  Recall President Trump s Inaugural Address  with its theme of  American carnage   Or his first speech to a joint session of Congress  when he lied point blank about immigrant terrorism  Or any of a thousand other examples Next time you hear the words  existential threat  from a politician  hide the silver  The greater threat to American safety is demagogic safetyism  or  as another American president said in much harder times  fear itself  

JERUSALEM   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will fly to Moscow on Thursday to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin  the Israeli leader s office said on Tuesday The statement did not elaborate on the intended topics of discussion  The two leaders will meet five days before Israel s April 9 election in which the right wing Netanyahu faces a strong challenge from a centrist candidate On Monday  Netanyahu told reporters he and Putin spoke by telephone about Syria  whose Russian backed president  Bashar al Assad  has been gaining ground in an eight year civil war Israel worries Assad s Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah reinforcements could set up bases to attack it from Syria  and has carried out scores of air strikes against them  Thursday s meeting could also help Netanyahu in the closely contested election  in which he has played up his statecraft and security credentials in the face of the politically untested challenger Benny Gantz  a former military chief    Writing by Dan Williams  Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Andrew Cawthorne  

HONG KONG   Singapore introduced draft legislation on Monday that it said would combat false or misleading information on the internet  but critics said the measure could be used as a cudgel against the government s critics The legislation  called the Protection From Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill  would require websites to run corrections alongside  online falsehoods  and would  cut off profits  of sites that spread misinformation  among other measures  according to the Ministry of Law The bill is widely expected to become law in the coming weeks because it has support from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong s People s Action Party  which has a supermajority in Parliament  This bill targets falsehoods  not free speech   the Ministry of Law said in a statement outlining the legislation   It will help ensure online falsehoods do not drown out authentic speech and ideas  and undermine democratic processes and society  But human rights advocates said they feared that the bill  which would give government ministers wide ranging powers to fight misinformation that damaged the public interest  would grant the authorities too much leeway to decide what was true or false The bill defines the public interest broadly  saying that ministers could intervene to prevent  a diminution of public confidence  in the government s performance or the  incitement of feelings of enmity  hatred or ill will between different groups of persons   among other threats Kirsten Han  a Singaporean journalist and activist  described the legislation as  worryingly broad   The bill gives ministers so much power and discretion   any minister can direct individuals or websites to post corrections or take down content  or order access to content to be blocked  and these orders have to be complied with first  even if one is going to appeal the direction in the courts   Ms  Han said in an email The Ministry of Law said the bill did not apply to  opinions  criticisms  satire or parody   only to falsehoods that threatened the public interest  According to a draft of the bill  punishments for some violations could include fines of up to about  44 000 and a prison term of up to six years for individuals  or fines of up to about  738 000 in  any other case  Critics say the bill could put a wide range of online publishers in legal jeopardy in Singapore  including foreign media organizations The  public interest  definitions are so vague  they add  that the legislation could be weaponized to target the government s critics  Similar laws have been used by authoritarian governments around Southeast Asia  You re basically giving the autocrats another weapon to restrict speech  and speech is pretty restricted in the region already   said Phil Robertson  the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch Singapore holds elections  but there has never been a change of power as a result  and the government has long exerted control over the domestic news media through defamation suits The advocacy group Reporters Without Borders ranks Singapore 151st of 180 countries in its Press Freedom Index  three places behind Russia The draft legislation is hardly the first of its kind  Governments including those of Russia and of South Korea have recently put so called false news in their cross hairs  Restrictions on online communication are also under discussion in Australia and New Zealand  as both countries try to address popular outrage over the massacre last month of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch  New Zealand In statements on Monday  press officers for Google and Twitter said the companies were still reviewing the bill  Misinformation is a significant challenge  and one that we are working hard to address   said Chris Brummitt  a Google spokesman   We will study the bill to determine our next steps  and urge the government to allow for a full and transparent public consultation on the proposed legislation  Simon Milner  Facebook s vice president for public policy in the Asia Pacific region  said in a statement that the social network supported regulation that  strikes the right balance between reducing harm while protecting people s rights to meaningful speech   We are  however  concerned with aspects of the law that grant broad powers to the Singapore executive branch to compel us to remove content they deem to be false and proactively push a government notification to users   he added Companies like Facebook  Google and Twitter were once lauded for leading free speech and public discourse into a new age  Now  they are more likely to be blamed for providing an outlet for misinformation As skepticism has risen  the platforms have taken measures to combat bogus or harmful information  with varying degrees of success  They have stepped up efforts to police content and enlisted the help of outside organizations to fact check news articles and videos  They have tried to empower trusted publishers  such as traditional news agencies  to improve the overall quality of the information that users are shown But controversies have continued to erupt  And even for the internet companies  it may now be easier to ask lawmakers to lay down guidelines for content  That way  the companies can deflect the blame if the policies cause dissatisfaction In an op ed over the weekend in The Washington Post  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  made a case for regulating his platform  calling for  a more active role for governments and regulators   We need a more standardized approach   Mr  Zuckerberg wrote   Regulation could set baselines for what s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum  On Monday  Jeff Paine  the managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition   whose members include Amazon  Apple  Facebook  Google  Twitter and other technology firms   said the group supported Singapore s efforts to protect harmony  social cohesion  and the integrity of the country s institutions and political processes But Mr  Paine said the group worried that the bill  gives the Singapore government full discretion over what is considered true or false   As the most far reaching legislation of its kind to date  this level of overreach poses significant risks to freedom of expression and speech  and could have severe ramifications both in Singapore and around the world   he said Mr  Lee  the prime minister  previewed the false news bill in a speech last week at a gala dinner celebrating the 20th anniversary of the founding of Channel NewsAsia  a Singapore based outlet Mr  Lee told guests that the city state was  particularly vulnerable  to false news because it was a multiracial  multiethnic society with  enduring fault lines that can be easily exploited  Channel NewsAsia covered Mr  Lee s remarks  but without mentioning that the government s campaigns against misinformation have generated criticism from free speech advocates

WASHINGTON   NATO can look at the possibility of other Latin American states joining Colombia in becoming alliance partners  Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday  while appearing to rule out U S  President Donald Trump s suggestion that Brazil could one day become a full member of the North Atlantic security body  Until 2017  NATO didn t have any partners in Latin America and then in 2017 we got our first partner  which was Colombia  and to be a close partner of NATO is something that is good for NATO and the partner country   the NATO leader told Reuters in an interview ahead of a NATO ministerial meeting in Washington  So of course  it is a possibility to look into the possibility of having also other countries in Latin America become partners which then provides a platform  a framework for close political and practical cooperation   he said At a joint White House news conference last month  Trump said he had told visiting far right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro he would designate Brazil a  major non NATO ally  and possibly go further by supporting a campaign to make Brazil  maybe a NATO ally   something that would imply full membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO membership is currently limited to countries of western Europe  Turkey  Canada and the United States  although NATO partner countries include Australia and New Zealand  as well as European non members Sweden and Finland Ask if a country such as Brazil could become a member  Stoltenberg said  No  Partners are not members  But partners are very close partners  We work very closely with them  practically and politically  and that s a very good way to strengthen cooperation with NATO and countries that are not members of the alliance  Asked about Brazil becoming a partner  he said  Well someone has to propose it and it also has to be a request from Brazil  but     we just agreed with Colombia to make Colombia a close partner with NATO and of course it s absolutely possible to have more partners in Latin America  but it has to be an expressed wish from Latin America and of course  it s  something we have to discuss then among the 29 allies  Earlier Stoltenberg addressed the U S  Congress and delivered an impassioned defense of the partnership he called  the most successful alliance in history   which has often been derided by Trump since he took office in 2017 Colombia reached an agreement in 2017 to become the only Latin American nation to join NATO as a  global partner   a relationship short of  ally  status  which means it would not necessarily have to take part in collective military action Other NATO global partners apart from those mentioned by Stoltenberg include Afghanistan  Iraq  Japan  South Korea  Mongolia and Pakistan  Becoming a  major non NATO ally  in itself implies a status upgrade that would give a country preferential access to purchases of U S  military equipment and technology Supporting Brazil for alliance membership would be a considerable step further  one that Trump recognized would mean he would  have to talk to a lot of people  NATO membership is governed by Article 10 of its 1949 founding treaty  which limits invitations to European states  subject to the approval of existing members and meeting alliance criteria   Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington  Editing by James Dalgleish  

President Trump  in his most recent rebuke of Central American nations for what he says is their failure to address the issue of migration  announced plans to cut off aid to three nations   Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador   known as the Northern Triangle  Critics of the cuts say they will target programs aimed at preventing violence  curbing extreme poverty and hunger  and strengthening the justice system   the very problems residents of those countries give for leaving home and pursuing a more stable future elsewhere  Though the administration has offered little in the way of details about what precisely could be cut  the State Department notified Congress on Friday night that it would divert about  450 million in aid from the region  President Trump also threatened to seal off the southern border of the United States with Mexico if that country  doesn t get with it  So what s really at stake  and what types of programs could these cuts affect in each nation  The United States Agency for International Development describes the multiyear Strategy for Central America  which is responsible for dispersing much of this aid  as focused on institutional reforms and developmental challenges that drive migration  The programs it supports enhance security  improve governance and promote prosperity  Here are some examples of programs financed by American dollars in

increasing farmers  incomes  improving rural nutrition and strengthening food security  The Agency for International Development estimates it will invest  36 million over a five year period from 2017 to 2022 The Youth and Gender Justice Project  a program aimed at providing support and services to victims of violence  including youth  women and other vulnerable people  The project will receive an estimated  37 4 million from 2016 to 2021  The Community Roots Project  a World Vision program that creates educational  cultural  athletic and employment opportunities for young people in Guatemala  The program is estimated to receive  40 million from 2016 to 2021  The Agency for International Development said in a 2018 fact sheet that its programs in Guatemala have led to an increase in income in high migration areas and reduced impunity for criminals by strengthening the courts  Honduras  American aid to Honduras is mostly focused on security  the justice sector and violence prevention  according to the Washington Office on Latin America  with  65 5 million in aid going to those types of programs in 2017  An additional  116 million went that year to projects that supported education  sustainable farming and business development  Some of the projects include Alliance for the Dry Corridor  or ACS  which promotes agricultural diversity and aims to decrease poverty and malnutrition in western Honduras  The program is estimated to receive  60 6 million from 2014 to 2020 Avanzando con Libros  a project set to receive  9 9 million from 2017 to 2020  It provides books for students and teachers in schools in need Alianza de Café  which is to receive  2 million between 2018 and 2022  and provides support to small scale coffee farmers to expand the industry and create opportunities in

supports projects across the spectrum  including those that strengthen the justice system and create jobs  A sample of these are The Crime and Violence Prevention program  which received approximately  39 8 million from 2013 to 2019 from the United States  It partners with the government of El Salvador to bolster community based crime fighting and support innovative ideas for violence prevention

HONG KONG   Hong Kong s leaders launched laws on Wednesday to change extradition rules to allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial  standing fast against growing opposition to a move many fear could further erode the city s legal protections Thousands took to Hong Kong streets to protest against the laws at the weekend  joining an unusually broad chorus of concern from international business elites to rights  groups and even some pro establishment figures However  Hong Kong s Chief Executive Carrie Lam said her government would make no further amendments before introducing the laws to the city s parliament Small groups of protesters supporting the government s bill briefly faced off against opponents outside the Legislative Council but later dispersed without incident  Opponents of the changes fear further erosion of freedoms and legal protections in the free wheeling financial hub   rights that were guaranteed under the city s handover from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 According to the laws presented to the council on Wednesday  the chief executive would have the right to order the extradition of wanted offenders to China  Macau and Taiwan as well as other countries not covered by Hong Kong s existing extradition treaties As a safeguard  such orders could be challenged and appealed against through the city s courts Government officials have said no one at risk of the death penalty or torture or facing a political charge could be sent from Hong Kong  They earlier exempted nine commercial crimes from the new provisions after pressure from business groups Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng said outside the council Hong Kong s courts would play an essential role  It is absolutely not the case that a single person or organization can complete the whole process   Cheng said The laws will be debated by a council committee and are expected to be passed later this year The government has justified the swift introduction of the changes by saying they are needed so that a young Hong Kong man suspected of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan can be extradited  NO TRUST Former Democratic Party leader Emily Lau said that  even with the promised safeguards  ordinary Hong Kongers would still find extradition to mainland China unacceptable  Many Hong Kong people have no trust or confidence in the Chinese judicial system   she told the government funded radio station RTHK  Fair trials were not possible on the mainland  she said Hong Kong s Bar Association said on Tuesday the government s watering down of the changes did nothing to ease fundamental unease over differences with the Chinese system Under the Basic Law  which enshrines Hong Kong s separate system until 2047  Hong Kong is allowed to continue a British style legal system that remains part of the common law  Fugitive property tycoon Joseph Lau launched legal action in a Hong Kong court on Monday challenging the retroactive nature of the bill  Lau is seeking to avoid extradition to neighboring Macau  where he was sentenced in 2014 to more than five years on corruption and money laundering charges  Chen Zhimin  a former deputy minister of public security  told reporters in Beijing last month mainland authorities already had a list of more than 300 fugitives who are in Hong Kong He dismissed fears that political activists would be sought under the pretext of other crimes   Reporting by Greg Torode and Jessie Pang  Additional reporting by Noah Sin  Editing by Michael Perry

To the Editor Re  When Localities Weigh In on Guns   Op Ed  March 12  Jonathan M  Metzl is correct in noting the effectiveness of local gun laws  tailored to fit local needs  That is why there is reason for concern that a challenge to the New York City law restricting gun carrying for  premises license  holders  who are allowed to possess guns only at their homes and travel with them to shooting ranges and clubs within city borders  was accepted for review by the Supreme Court when it has rejected appeals to virtually every gun case in the last decade The court may well use this as an opportunity to extend gun carry rights to the streets  If it does  however  it will be contradicting its own historical standard  never mind common sense  As the country grew  so did its gun restrictions  By the start of the 20th century  every state except four had enacted anti carry laws  Our ancestors knew that civilian gun carrying was an invitation to trouble  That is no less true today Robert J  SpitzerCortland  N Y  The writer  a professor of political science at SUNY Cortland  is the author of books about gun policy  including  Guns Across America

authentic peace loving progressives  and centrists try to show that the parties to the left and right of them are unreasonable Just take a look at the commercials targeting voters on social media as the election next Tuesday draws near  They are in Hebrew and Arabic  but much of what is shown in the ads requires little or no translation  Let s move from the political right to the left Mocking limits on lethal forceAn anti Arab party accuses the Israeli army of being too soft on terrorism  CreditCreditUnion of Right Wing PartiesA fear of letting any right wing or religious votes be wasted on a splinter party spurred Mr  Netanyahu to broker a deal that could allow one such splinter  the extremist anti Arab party Otzma Yehudit  or Jewish Power  into his next governing coalition  But how does that party appeal to voters With absurdist satire  of course  An Israeli soldier is confronted with a knife wielding Palestinian attacker  but before he can shoot in self defense  a military lawyer   tape measure in hand   intercedes to make sure he adheres to rules of engagement that Jewish Power considers too restrictive More settlement  no apologiesThe New Right party emerged to advance the careers of Naftali Bennett  the education minister  and Ayelet Shaked  the justice minister  Ms  Shaked has pushed the Israeli Supreme Court to the right  particularly over settlement of the West Bank  She wants to keep her job and continue that work  Mr  Bennett wants to become defense minister Their ads have often been lighthearted  though some jokes have misfired  But their core messages can be seen in two more sober minded videos  In one  Mr  Bennett aggressively sticks up for Israel in interviews with Western and Arab journalists  showing he believes the best defense is a good offense In another  Ms  Shaked plants herself outside an unspecified Jewish settlement outpost and replays familiar criticisms by settlers  opponents  which she dismisses as  background noise   Then she tells voters to  settle down   I still have a lot to do here   A headline promises that  Shaked will tame the High Court  Putting the ultra Orthodox in uniformThe Russian immigrants who voted en masse for Avigdor Lieberman  the former defense minister  are not as potent a political force anymore  and polls show Mr  Lieberman s career and his party  Yisrael Beiteinu  are in peril  To survive  he offers a blunt slogan   Both right wing and secular  Driving home the second half of that formula  Mr  Lieberman highlights his battle to end the decades old exemption from military service for the ultra Orthodox  or Haredim  whose rabbis have fought tooth and nail to preserve it You don t need to understand the prayers to grasp that men with sidecurls in olive drab and with rifles at their feet are  as Mr  Lieberman assures voters   the worst nightmare  of the Haredi rabbis  Read our guide to the Israeli elections  Belittling the challengersMr  Netanyahu s Likud party is putting out ads at the fastest clip  sometimes several a day  with President Trump frequently playing a supporting role  Mr  Gantz  the center right candidate  is invariably belittled by a sneering announcer as  weak left  Here  Likud taunts Mr  Gantz for his poor performance in a recent TV interview  and his No  2  Yair Lapid  for saying Mr  Netanyahu was wrecking Israel s ties with the United States  Guess who we see in the very next clip bestowing upon Mr  Netanyahu a big political prize  Hint  It takes place in the White House   It s too much for them   the ad says of the challengers   Netanyahu  Strong  Right  Successful  For a tough job  a gang of fourMr  Gantz s ads  like his campaign  have vacillated between making the most of his rough hewed military background and trying to dress him up like a slick politician  His Blue and White party s most effective ads may be those in which he surrounds himself with his top running mates   two other former army chiefs and Mr  Lapid   and talks turkey about what needs to be changed and why Mr  Netanyahu needs to go In this spot  titled  A change in priorities   the specifics are interesting enough  Mr  Gantz says he does not need any lectures from Mr  Netanyahu on security or strength  Mr  Lapid says the rise in the cost of prescription drugs could have been offset by canceling the  superfluous plane    an Israeli Air Force One   that Mr  Netanyahu  insisted on buying for himself  But the words are less important than the visuals  tough guys sitting around plotting how they are going to take down Mr  Netanyahu and fix what is ailing their country  That job has indeed been too much for those who have challenged Mr  Netanyahu in the past  but their message is that together they can pull it off Slashing Netanyahu from the leftThe once mighty Labor party has shrunk to a wisp of its old self  largely because of the rank and file s disenchantment with the party s current leader  Avi Gabbay  But Labor still has some moves  Its ads ridiculing Mr  Netanyahu have been the most cutting and the quickest to capitalize on the news With Israelis from the Gaza border to the suburbs of Tel Aviv routinely running for cover  Labor is hammering Mr  Netanyahu   widely known by his nickname   Bibi    for allowing Hamas to get away with firing rockets into Israel   No security  No peace   this ad says furiously  over images of blazing farmland and cowering children   No reason to vote for Bibi  The view from Tel Aviv s towersIn a choice that could prove either canny or just plain out of touch  Tamar Zandberg of Meretz  the left wing secular party that supports a two state solution with the Palestinians  makes a show of her urbane Tel Aviv lifestyle  asking what kind of Israel voters want to see after the election  a darker  more isolated and violent one  or an Israel of justice  freedom and equality She points to battles for gay rights and affordable housing  laments the rise of the right wing  shows herself meeting President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and embraces the  leftist  label  saying the only way Israel can reverse the path it is on is if people who think like her vote for a  strong left that will have confidence in itself  Demonized  Arabs push backThe strongest Arab party  Hadash Taal  actually includes both Palestinian citizens and Jewish Israelis  and it is running a Hebrew language ad that powerfully addresses anti Arab incitement by Mr  Netanyahu  other right wing leaders and ordinary Israelis You do not need to know what is being said  suffice it to say that when you hear the word  Aravim   or Arabs  it is being used in ways that the people on the screen  whether Arab or Jew  would find hurtful Many Arab citizens of Israel are sitting out the election  partly because the chief alternative to Mr  Netanyahu  Mr  Gantz  entered the campaign by boasting about the numbers of Palestinian militants he killed as commander of Israel s 2014 war in Gaza  And a low Arab turnout  paradoxically  could sink Mr  Gantz s chances of toppling Mr  Netanyahu In this Arabic language ad  Hadash Taal  which would likely support a Gantz led government  wields his commercial against him  saying that 530 children were also killed in the Gaza war   Keep your voice clean   it pleads  by voting for Hadash Taal   not for a man with  the blood of Gaza s children  on his hands  

LONDON   The Latest on Britain s departure from the European Union  all times local  9 30 p m Bank of England governor Mark Carney says the risk of Britain accidentally crashing out of the European Union without a divorce agreement is  alarmingly high  and it s  absolute nonsense  to suggest such a situation could be managed Speaking to British broadcaster Sky News on Wednesday  Carney said that even though Prime Minister Theresa May  Parliament and the European Union all have the stated goal of avoiding a no deal Brexit  the U K  leaving without an agreement remains the default position by law He says that makes it possible  no deal would happen by accident  It would happen suddenly  There would be no transition  It is an accidental disorderly Brexit  Carney also said Brexit has been stressful and he  absolutely  won t extend his term as governor of the central bank past January 2020    7 p m British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn says his Brexit talks with Prime Minister Theresa May were  useful but inconclusive  The Labour Party leader met with May on Wednesday to try to find a compromise deal for leaving the European Union that can break Britain s Brexit deadlock Both the government and Labour called the talks  constructive   and said teams from the two sides would hold more detailed discussions Thursday Corbyn said  there hasn t been as much change as I expected  but we are continuing to have some discussions tomorrow morning to explore some of the technical issues  Britain has until April 12 to pass a Brexit withdrawal deal  seek a Brexit delay from the EU or crash out of the bloc without a divorce agreement    5 40 p m A Brexit related vote in Britain s House of Commons has ended in a tie  the first time that has happened in a quarter century In an illustration of politicians  deadlock over Britain s exit from the European Union  Wednesday s vote ended in a 310 310 draw Under Parliament s rules  the speaker of the House has tie breaking power  Speaker John Bercow cast his vote with the noes  He said that was in keeping with the principle that  it is not for the chair to create a majority that otherwise doesn t exist  The result means lawmakers have rejected the idea of holding a third day of voting on alternative Brexit options Monday Bercow says the last time a vote in the Commons ended in a tie was in 1993    4 25 p m Another minister has quit British Prime Minister Theresa May s government over her decision to seek a Brexit compromise with the opposition Chris Heaton Harris  a junior Brexit minister  said Wednesday that May  should have honored the result of the 2016 referendum  to leave the European Union and withdrawn as planned on March 29 The EU extended that long scheduled date to April 12 at May s request  and the prime minister says she plans to ask for even more time Heaton Harris published his resignation letter to May saying  every time we seek an extension to this process we diminish faith in our political system  Another junior minister  Nigel Adams  resigned earlier Wednesday over May s handling of Brexit May announced Tuesday that she would seek a compromise with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn  after Parliament rejected her EU divorce deal three times    3 50 p m German Chancellor Angela Merkel is underlining her pledge to work  until the last hour  to secure an orderly Brexit but says it is primarily up to Britain to come up with solutions Merkel said Wednesday averting a chaotic Brexit is  in the interest of Britain but  above all  also in our own interest   She plans to visit Ireland on Thursday to discuss among other things that country s border with the U K  s Northern Ireland  one of the most complicated issues in Britain s departure from the European Union Merkel said after meeting regional officials in eastern Germany   These solutions have to be reached above all in Britain itself  of course     you can see that there are really intensive efforts  but you can also see that there are simply very diverse ideas     2 35 p m The European parliament s top Brexit official says despite the chaos in British politics  the U K  has given the continent one great thing  an amazing TV show  Guy Verhofstadt compared the live transmission of the often raucous debates on Brexit in the House of Commons to Premier League soccer   one of the biggest British products the U K  is transmitting to the continent  He says the Brexit debate sessions  have become more popular even than the matches in the Premier League in Europe   He went on with the metaphor  saying  the only difference is that it is always a draw there in the House of Commons   referring to the repeated stalemates over Brexit that have paralyzed British politics Verhofstadt was hopeful that talks Wednesday between British Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn would finally yield a breakthrough     1 35 p m Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz says he doesn t yet see a reason to grant Britain another delay to its withdrawal from the European Union  but is welcoming British Prime Minister Theresa May s efforts to avoid a no deal Brexit Britain has either to leave the EU April 12 or propose an alternative course of action  and all 27 other EU countries would have to sign off on a further delay to Brexit  In Vienna Wednesday  Kurz stressed the importance of avoiding a no deal Brexit but noted nothing has actually changed yet Kurz said   There is  at present  no reason at all for an extension because the chaos in Britain hasn t changed  There is no plan B that has a majority in Britain s lower house  so speculation about an extension would at the moment be pure speculation  Kurz added that he hopes the situation will change  He said   Let s keep our fingers crossed for Theresa May in her efforts     1 p m The European Union s top economy official is warning of long lines at borders and paperwork headaches for obligatory customs checks if Britain crashes out of the bloc without an agreement EU Economy Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Wednesday that Britain would become a third country overnight  creating  instantaneous and very radical legal change  He says that around 11 000 vehicles enter and leave the U K  daily via the Eurotunnel rail service or ferries  EU countries estimate that paperwork would rise by 40 50  in the case of a no deal But Moscovici says  I prefer strict controls at the price of a few lines of trucks to a health crisis or illegal trafficking  The security of Europeans will be our top priority     9 05 a m European Union lawmakers say British citizens should be allowed to travel in Europe visa free after Brexit but only if the U K  grants the same right to EU citizens  as the bloc prepares for Britain s possible departure without a deal The EU s Civil Liberties Committee voted overwhelmingly Wednesday   38 votes in favor  8 against and 3 abstentions   to allow tourism or business trips The move permits stays of up to 90 days in any 180 day period  but does not grant the right to work  The full parliament is likely to endorse the decision Thursday EU officials say it is  very likely  that Britain will depart without a deal  bringing potentially devastating political and economic consequences The Europeans are publicly stepping up their no deal planning  increasing pressure on the U K  parliament to find a compromise    9 a m Britain s Brexit secretary says the government is not offering a  blank check  to the opposition after Prime Minister Theresa May offered to meet with the Labour Party leader in hopes of ending the impasse over the U K  s departure from the European Union Steve Barclay told the BBC on Wednesday that some Labour proposals  such as a customs union with the EU  would be  very difficult  for the government to accept but both sides need to sit down and work out an agreement to avoid a damaging no deal Brexit Barclay said   We re not setting pre conditions  but nor is it a blank check  But he added that the  remorseless logic  of Parliament s failure to back the prime minister s withdrawal agreement with the EU is that Britain must move toward a softer form of Brexit

To the Editor Re  Trump Directs State Dept  to End Aid to 3 Central American Countries   nytimes com  March 30  President Trump s decision to cut off aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras is the worst and most counterproductive decision that could possibly be made to deal with the immigration situation on our southern border  I served as an officer in the Agency for International Development s Alliance for Progress program in Latin America under President John F  Kennedy in the 1960s  The program s economic  social and humanitarian assistance was instrumental in improving the economies  health  education and safety of those peoples  It gave them hope and reason to remain in their countries rather than seek a better life elsewhere  Our aid to Central America is intended to achieve precisely the same goals  Large scale immigration from Central America is caused by uncontrolled gang violence  crime and corruption in those countries  Without our assistance  these conditions will grow only worse and lead to more suffering and more immigration Michael D  ButtermanMiamiThe writer  a lawyer  does pro bono immigration work  

LONDON   British Prime Minister Theresa May s government should have said in 2017 that a softer Brexit was inevitable after it lost its parliamentary majority in an election  the chief enforcer of her Conservative Party in parliament said Chief whip Julian Smith  speaking in an interview with the BBC released on Monday  also criticized senior ministers for  the worst example of ill discipline in cabinet in British political history   The BBC said it was unprecedented for a chief whip to publicly criticize the government  It comes as May s ministers are deeply split over how to break Britain s Brexit impasse Lawmakers are due to vote on Monday on alternatives to May s deal  several of which call for Britain to have closer ties to the EU than foreseen under the prime minister s plan Smith told the BBC that  when it failed to get a majority in the 2017 election   the government as a whole probably should have just been clearer on the consequences of that  The parliamentary arithmetic would mean that this would be inevitably a kind of softer type of Brexit  He said he had seen ministers  sitting around the cabinet table    trying to destabilize her  May     Writing by William Schomberg  Editing by Elisabeth O Leary  

To the Editor Like the weather  everyone talks about bipartisanship  but few in Congress do anything about it  My Democratic Party s net neutrality proposal shows the problem  Public pressure has forced Republicans to support new rules on net neutrality  and there is a bipartisan majority in Congress to keep the internet open and unconstrained  But rather than take yes for an answer  Democrats now want rules that go far beyond net neutrality by micromanaging prices  operations and deployment of new services as well It s hard to avoid the conclusion that they would rather have an issue on which to campaign and raise money than a deal that protects consumers and promotes economic growth  The  permanent campaign  strikes again I was in the Clinton administration  which achieved the original bipartisan deal  the 1996 Telecommunications Act  The  light touch  regulation of the internet it created led to a gusher of new investment and faster  more powerful service than even we imagined at the time Congress needs to go back to that playbook  because a bill signing ceremony for workable net neutrality legislation would be far preferable than yet another round of hearings  news conferences and fund raising emails Ev EhrlichWashingtonThe writer  a consultant  was an under secretary of commerce in the Clinton administration  

Iran s Foreign Ministry accused the Trump administration on Tuesday of blocking efforts to aid Iranian victims of calamitous floods through  inhumane and cruel  restrictions imposed by renewed American banking sanctions on the country The State Department denied the allegation  asserting that the United States stood ready to help  It said a botched response to the flooding by the Iranian government had contributed to the disaster The acerbic exchange came against the backdrop of what is shaping up to be some of the worst flooding to strike Iran since the Islamic revolution 40 years ago Floods have afflicted at least 26 of Iran s 31 provinces over the past two weeks  states of emergency have been declared in several provinces  at least 47 people have been killed  and tens of thousands have been evacuated  state media have reported The actual extent of the disaster has been difficult to ascertain because the Tehran government has not let foreign journalists visit stricken areas  But state television and Iran s news media have provided images that show inundated villages and offered accounts of survivors on rooftops awaiting rescue Nonofficial Iranian accounts  on social media and reports elsewhere suggest many Iranians are outraged over what they see as a bungled government response A spokesman for Iran s Foreign Ministry  Bahram Qasemi  sought on Tuesday to shift at least part of the blame to the United States  which under President Trump reimposed economic sanctions on Iran after having repudiated the nuclear agreement with Tehran nearly a year ago Mr  Qasemi said banking restrictions  an important component of the sanctions  had effectively impeded international aid groups like the Red Cross from sending assistance to victims ImagePushing a vehicle after flash flooding in Shiraz  Iran  last week CreditTasnim News Agency Reuters Normally  all banking systems will not be locked even in difficult and emergency conditions   Mr  Qasemi said in remarks quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency  He said the United States   in an inhumane and cruel approach  has blocked all humanitarian assistance to flood hit people  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  a leading advocate of the Trump administration s renewed sanctions on Iran  rejected the Iranian assertions in a statement posted on the State Department website  These floods once again show the level of Iranian regime mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness   Mr  Pompeo said   The regime blames outside entities when  in fact  it is their mismanagement that has led to this disaster  He said the United States stood  ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief  The administration has said the sanctions are not intended to hurt ordinary Iranians  But many foreign banks and other businesses are now reluctant to deal with Iran  partly over fears of inadvertently violating American prohibitions Iranians have complained that the sanctions have made it difficult if not impossible to obtain imported medicines  for example The floods have emerged as a new political and economic liability for President Hassan Rouhani of Iran  who has been under increased pressure for having negotiated the nuclear agreement renounced by Mr  Trump  Iran s supreme leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  has said the nuclear agreement reinforced his view that the Americans are treacherous Henry Rome  an analyst at the Eurasia Group  a Washington based political risk consultancy  said the flooding would press Mr  Rouhani to dismiss his interior minister and other officials deemed responsible for mishandling the response  The government s overall reaction will further erode public confidence in its ability to manage crises and exacerbate the impact of existing U S  sanctions   Mr  Rome said in an emailed update to clients  

SINGAPORE   Singapore submitted wide ranging fake news legislation in parliament on Monday  stoking fears from internet firms and human rights groups that it may give the government too much power and hinder freedom of speech The law would require social media sites like Facebook to carry warnings on posts the government deems false and remove comments against  public interest  The move came two days after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said governments should play a more active role in regulating the online platform But Simon Milner  who works on Facebook s public policy in Asia  said after the law was tabled  the firm was  concerned with aspects of the law that grant broad powers to the Singapore executive branch to compel us to remove content they deem to be false and proactively push a government notification to users   As the most far reaching legislation of its kind to date  this level of overreach poses significant risks to freedom of expression and speech  and could have severe ramifications both in Singapore and around the world   said Jeff Paine  managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition  an industry association of internet and technology companies in the region Speaking to reporters on Monday  Singapore s Law Minister K  Shanmugam said the new legislation would not hinder free speech  This legislation deals with false statements of facts  It doesn t deal with opinions  it doesn t deal with viewpoints  You can have whatever viewpoints however reasonable or unreasonable   he said  Tech giants Facebook  Twitter and Google all have their Asia headquarters in the city state  a low tax finance hub seen as a island of stability in the middle of the fast growing but often turbulent Southeast Asia region  MALICIOUS ACTORS Singapore  which has been run by the same political party since independence from Britain more than 50 years ago  says it is vulnerable to fake news because of its position as a global financial hub  its mixed ethnic and religious population and widespread internet access It is ranked 151 among 180 countries rated in the World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders  a non government group that promotes freedom of information  below the likes of Russia and Myanmar The new bill proposes that the government get online platforms to publish warnings or  corrections  alongside posts carrying false information  without removing them  This would be the  primary response  to counter falsehoods online  the Law Ministry said   That way  in a sense  people can read whatever they want and make up their minds  That is our preference   Law Minister K  Shanmugam told reporters on Monday  Under the proposals  which must be approved by parliament  criminal sanctions including hefty fines and jail terms will be imposed if the falsehoods are spread by  malicious actors  who  undermine society   the ministry said  without elaborating It added that it would cut off an online site s  ability to profit   without shutting it down  if the site had published three falsehoods that were  against the public interest  over the previous six months It did not say how it would block a site s profit streams  The bill came amid talk of a possible general election this year  Law Minister Shanmugam declined to comment when asked if the new legislation was related to a vote  This draft law will be a disaster for human rights  particularly freedom of expression and media freedom   said Phil Robertson  deputy director  Asia division  at Human Rights Watch   The definitions in the law are broad and poorly defined  leaving maximum regulatory discretion to the government officers skewed to view as  misleading  or  false  the sorts of news that challenge Singapore s preferred political narratives     Additional reporting by Aradhana Aravindan  Editing by Nick Macfie  Mark Heinrich and Michael Perry  

LONDON   Britain is wrecking its reputation for business stability with political divisions over Brexit and risks leaving the trading bloc with a hugely damaging  no deal   the UK head of German industrial giant Siemens has said  After Prime Minister Theresa May s Brexit deal was rejected by parliament for a third time last week there is pressure from rival factions for a no deal exit  a much softer divorce or an election  Where the UK used to be beacon for stability  we are now becoming a laughing stock   Juergen Maier said in open letter to lawmakers published by website Politico   It has been clear for weeks  that the only way that this will be resolved is through compromise between the government and parliament   Maier said  calling for a softer Brexit Maier said it was becoming hard for him to win support from his board for investment decisions as Britain heads towards a  hugely damaging no deal Brexit   Enough is enough  We are all running out of patience  Make a decision and unite around a customs union compromise that delivers economic security and stability   he said  In year to September 2018  Siemens UK generated revenue of 5 billion pounds  the company s website said  At the end of September 2018  the company had 15 000 employees in Britain    Reporting by Elisabeth O Leary  Editing by Jane Merriman

To the Editor Re  Two Veterans Groups Find Common Ground in Opposing Forever Wars   news article  March 17  It is heartening that in an age of intense partisanship in Washington  two veterans groups from opposite ends of the political spectrum are working together on the noble objective of ending America s endless war in Afghanistan  The American people have long become disillusioned with the ineffective strategies that drove our participation in the Afghan conflict and guided all of our efforts in that country  There is an emerging consensus that American foreign policy must undergo a strategic rethinking  so that the United States military is used more judiciously and the full weight of America s national power is leveraged to resolve critical national security issues That the war in Afghanistan has gone on for more than 17 years is a sad indictment of the current approach  Our national security leaders must understand that the United States military is not the option of first resort  nor should it be expected to come to the rescue whenever a problem in the world occurs  The United States must re emphasize the power of nonmilitary tools in its arsenal and decouple military force from foreign policy  The sooner this rebalance takes place  the sooner our country can avoid more forever wars in the future Michael E  SmithAnnandale  Va The writer  a retired rear admiral  is president of the American College of National Security Leaders

DAKAR   Senegalese President Macky Sall said on Tuesday he would prioritize the environment  youth employment and women s rights during his second term in office In an inauguration speech that followed an emphatic election victory in February  he promised  vigorous  environmental action  I m calling on everyone to shape a new Senegal  one with cleaner neighborhoods    a zero waste Senegal   he said During Sall s first term  Senegal s economy grew more than six percent per year as a modernization program produced a new airport  slick highways and a city built from scratch in scrubland outside the coastal capital Dakar Oil and gas production from new offshore fields is expected to keep the economy buoyant in the coming decade But high pollution and rising sea levels have raised concerns about climate change and the price of rapid development Senegal has long been viewed as the region s most stable democracy  with peaceful transitions of power since it gained independence from France in 1960  But the two best known opposition figures were banned from running in February because of corruption convictions that rights groups say were politically motivated  Sall denies those claims  More than a dozen African heads of states attended his inauguration   Writing by Juliette Jabkhiro  Editing by Edward McAllister and John Stonestreet  

WASHINGTON   Washington s cherry blossom season has gone well this year  thanks to warm weather that has coincided perfectly with the annual blooming that draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each spring But officials are claiming that Washington s iconic trees are under a looming threat that requires emergency action Decades of wear and tear from foot traffic  combined with rising sea levels and a deteriorating sea wall  have created a chronic flooding problem in the Tidal Basin   The 107 acre man made reservoir borders the Jefferson Memorial and is home to the highest concentration of cherry blossom trees  The Tidal Basin is at a pivotal moment   said Jeff Reinbold  acting superintendent for the National Mall and Memorial Parks division of the National Park Service   The area was never designed for the kind of use it sees today  The National Park Service  along with the Trust for the National Mall and the National Trust for Historic Preservation  is undertaking a campaign to save the Tidal Basin  In addition to rebuilding the battered sea wall and addressing the flooding problem  the groups want to improve walkways and update security systems Twice a day at high tide  a large stretch of sidewalk next to the Jefferson Memorial is submerged by the rising waters  During the heavy rains that routinely occur in Washington  the floodwaters completely overflow the sea wall in multiple locations and soak the tree roots It s more than just an inconvenience Teresa Durkin  senior project director of the Trust for the National Mall  said the higher silt concentration of the floodwaters is shortening the life span of the hundreds of cherry blossom trees that ring the basin  The infrastructure is breaking down because of the daily flooding  The trees are being inundated with brackish water   she said   People do love these trees and we keep having to replace them  Early estimates are that the rehabilitation project would require as much as  500 million  with organizers seeking a combination of government money and private donations The organizations are partnering with American Express  which is funding the creation of the Tidal Basin Ideas Lab and inviting architectural and landscape design firms to submit proposals for replacing the sea wall and refurbishing and modernizing the entire area Sean Kennealy  the chief of professional services for the National Mall and Memorial Parks division  said the original 1880s design of the Tidal Basin simply wasn t equipped to handle the kinds of crowds and traffic the area now receives  That traffic has only increased as more monuments have been added to the Tidal Basin area over the years  a memorial to Franklin Roosevelt opened in 1997  and the Martin Luther King Jr  memorial was inaugurated in 2011 Even without the worsening flooding problem  Kenneally said the entire network of sidewalks and pathways needs to be expanded to accommodate the modern visitor numbers  People have started making their own paths through the grass because the walkways are either not wide enough or underwater   Kennealy said   The trees just aren t being protected the way they should be  For now the Tidal Basin s structural issues remain fairly low key  Janice Contreras  a tourist from Arizona visiting the Tidal Basin on Wednesday  said it didn t really affect her experience  But it s hard not to notice a large stretch of sidewalk seemingly being reclaimed by the advancing waters  Does that really happen twice a day   she asked   It doesn t really bother me  but there s no way that s good for the trees  right   

How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives  David E  Sanger  a national security correspondent based in Washington  discussed the tech he s using You previously were a bureau chief for The Times in Japan  one of your many roles for the newspaper  When you arrived in Tokyo in the late 1980s  what tech were you equipped with In retrospect  nothing very impressive  Our  portable  computers weighed about the same as an electric typewriter  had a tiny cathode ray tube screen that showed a paragraph or two at most and stored stories on magnetic bubble memory  which in the 1980s was supposed to replace hard drives Needless to say  it was a technology whose time never arrived  Oh  and the computer had two black rubber cups on the top  You put the handset of a hard line phone into them and dialed up a computer in New York to transmit at the astoundingly slow speed of 300 bits per second  Half the time we had to give up and call the dictation room  where someone would type out the story that you read to them When we gave up on bubble memory computers and moved to the first laptops  I sent a note to New York asking what to do with

WASHINGTON   As Mississippi s governor toured massive flooding in the state  the Trump administration said Wednesday that it is giving another look to a long dead flood control and drainage project in the Mississippi Delta that had been killed by the George W  Bush administration because of its potential impact on wetlands and wildlife The project  which the late Sen  John McCain once called  one of the worst projects ever conceived by Congress   had called for huge pumps to be built at the confluence of the Yazoo and Mississippi Rivers in Mississippi  It was rejected by the Bush administration in 2008  Had that veto not occurred  we believe that the flooding  particularly in the Yazoo backwater  would have been much less damaging   said Mississippi Gov  Phil Bryant  after touring the region by helicopter Opponents say the pumps could worsen flooding downstream After touring the flooded region  Bryant told journalists that he had spent Monday and Tuesday in Washington  lobbying the administration to override the 2008 EPAs decision to kill the project  On Wednesday  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler confirmed to a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing that his agency is now reconsidering that 2008 decision Communities along the lower Mississippi River have been dealing with flooding for nearly two months  More than 500 000 acres  200 000 hectares  are submerged in the region  including more than 200 000 acres  80 000 hectares  of farmland  Farmers say flooding is harming them financially The U S  Army Corps of Engineers and local agencies are deploying a complex system of levees  dams  floodgates and floodways to try to contain high water and limit damage along the more than 2 000 mile river Floodwaters  have placed a tremendous burden on the lives and property of thousands of Mississippians   Sen  Cindy Hyde Smith  a Mississippi Republican  told Wheeler at Wednesday s hearing Bryant  who has aligned himself tightly with President Donald Trump  said Wednesday that more than 1 100 homes are affected  although some of those are not flooded  but in areas with roads cut off by flooding  Water is so common in the region that some people build small levees around their houses Environmentalists say the pumps would be capable of draining more than 200 000 acres  80 000 hectares  of wetlands   an area larger than all five boroughs of New York City The soggy and frequently flooded lowlands have comparatively few houses but are vital to waterfowl and other wildlife  environmental groups say  The National Wildlife Federation said the pumps would serve primarily  so large landowners can increase agricultural production on marginal lands that have always flooded  Bob Irvin  president of the American Rivers conservation group  said in an email Wednesday that the EPA was moving to revive a  zombie  project  Nothing has changed since the first Bush administration recognized that the Yazoo Pumps project was an environmental disaster and an economic loser   Irvin said The Bush administration had invoked the Clean Water Act  saying it would cause  unacceptable damage  to valuable resources  At the time  it was one of only about a dozen times the federal water law had been invoked to reject a project outright The pump project has been heavily pushed by the Delta Council  a farming and business lobbying group that includes many large farmers in the fertile Mississippi Delta  Before retiring from the Senate  Thad Cochran  long a proponent of the project  made a final attempt last year to put language in a spending bill ordering pump construction to begin despite the EPA veto  it failed Sharkey County Supervisor Bill Newsom  who also manages a cotton gin  is one of many proponents of the pumps  He says farming is the only industry in the region  and says he doesn t want to drain the region s wetlands  just control flooding  We re just simply wanting to have a flood level we can live in   Newsom said last month    Amy reported from Jackson  Mississippi  Associated Press writer Rogelio Solis in Flowood  Mississippi contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s Senate GOP allies  frustrated by delays in confirming dozens of lower profile nominees  rammed through a rules change Wednesday that cuts back debate on most of his picks The GOP plan  approved 51 48  indefinitely restored rules in place during the first few years of President Barack Obama s second term  Those rules had lapsed  allowing any senator to force 30 hours of debate on a nominee The rules change limits debate on most nominees to two hours instead of 30  White House selections for the Cabinet  Supreme Court and appeals courts would be exempted from the new rules  Every Democrat opposed the maneuver  joined by two Republicans  Susan Collins of Maine and Mike Lee of Utah The Senate changed the rules after a partisan debate that featured unusually personal finger pointing between the chamber s party leaders  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   and Minority leader Chuck Schumer  D N Y  They have battled over judicial filibusters since the administration of President George W  Bush McConnell  no stranger to obstructionist tactics himself  said the situation had gotten out of hand  with the Senate taking 128 votes to end debate on Trump s nominees during his first two years in office  far more than under other presidents  The comprehensive campaign by Senate Democrats to delay Senate consideration of presidential nominations is now more than two years old   McConnell said   It s time for this sorry chapter to end  Pointing at Schumer repeatedly during a tartly worded speech  McConnell said the battles on presidential nominees date back to Schumer led filibusters of Bush appeals court picks such as Miguel Estrada  whose nomination stalled after a lobbying campaign by liberal judicial activists  He started this whole thing that we ve been wrestling with since 2003  cooked it up  convinced his colleagues to do it   McConnell said Schumer said McConnell was Machiavellian  cynical and hypocritical  and used his speech to recount a series of GOP power plays  This is a very sad day for the Senate  At a time when Leader McConnell brags about confirming more judges than anyone has done in a very long time  he feels the need to invoke the terribly destructive and disproportionate procedure of the  nuclear option  in order to fast track even more of President Trump s ultra conservative nominees to the federal bench   Schumer said Schumer  however  supported this step in a 2013 vote orchestrated by then Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   that eliminated the filibuster on Cabinet nominees and most judicial appointees  The maneuver allows the majority to change the rules on a party line vote Republicans said at the time that Reid and Democrats would come to regret the change  which has given Trump largely free rein to fill numerous judicial vacancies that have piled up over the years  I share some of the responsibility for where we find ourselves today   said Sen  Michael Bennet  D Colo  He said McConnell  said at the time that  you re going to come to regret this decision   and I will say this about him  he was right  I do  Many Democrats  who benefited from prior rules changes under Obama  now say the GOP move will enable Trump and future presidents  so long as their party controls the Senate  to run roughshod over the Senate They say the hurdles required to win confirmation should be difficult as a way to ensure nominees are ethical  qualified and responsive to requests by senators for information  There is no emergency that justifies changing the Senate rules  Sen  McConnell himself admitted the Senate has plenty of time to consider nominees   said Sen  Dick Durbin  D Ill   This is all about avoiding close scrutiny for extreme ideological nominees that Republicans want to pack onto the federal courts for lifetime appointments  But other Democrats  McConnell said  indicated behind the scenes that they could support the rules change provided that it wouldn t take effect until the next administration Democrats also say that GOP complaints over their tactics now ring hollow after the obstructionism Obama experienced over his two terms Merrick Garland  a federal appeals court judge nominated to the Supreme Court by Obama  failed to get a Senate hearing  and Republicans stalled numerous other Obama judicial nominees   both when the GOP was in the minority and then after retaking the Senate in 2015 Armed with the White House and control of the Senate  Trump is now confirming both district and appeals court judges at a dizzying pace and is positioned to reshape the federal judiciary even if he fails to win a second term

WASHINGTON   The Trump administration overcame a significant hurdle Wednesday in its effort to bolster ranks at the State Department The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to advance 23 nominations to senior State Department positions  The nominations included an ambassador to Iraq  an ambassador to Saudi Arabia and two assistant secretaries of state Moving forward on nominations was an important step to  get the State Department up and running   said the committee chair  Republican Sen  Jim Risch of Idaho  But he warned  all is not well   citing 40 more nominations that the committee has not yet considered  I don t want to escalate this to the point where we start arguing   Risch told the top Democrat on the panel  Sen  Bob Menendez of New Jersey  pledging to keep working on the nominations in a bipartisan fashion Menendez shot back that of the 40 people nominated to State Department positions  only seven are ready for a hearing   The others are not  plain and simple   Menendez said  He said many of President Donald Trump s nominees were not vetted properly and others had incomplete files  I m not responsible for nominees who don t fill out their files   Menendez said   We work extremely hard to do this  Menendez cited one case where a nominee was found to be under a restraining order and another where the nominee was found to have made insulting comments about senators on the committee Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pledged to fill top posts when he took over last year as America s chief diplomat and has since blamed Senate Democrats for stalling the process The State Department lost many of its top diplomats under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  who implemented a sweeping redesign of the agency Among the 23 nominees advanced Wednesday was retired Gen  John P  Abizaid  nominated for ambassador to Saudi Arabia  and current U S  Ambassador to Yemen Matthew H Tueller  nominated for ambassador to Iraq The nominees await confirmation votes from the full Senate  

NEW YORK   On the opening day of a gathering of black leaders and voters in New York  two Texans seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination delved into the issue of reparations for African Americans over slavery Speaking at the four day conference of the National Action Network  the civil rights organization founded by the Rev  Al Sharpton  former Texas Rep  Beto O Rourke and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro weighed in on the topic  The question of whether to support reparations for African Americans as a means of addressing centuries of slavery and legal discrimination emerged as something of a litmus test earlier this year for Democratic presidential candidates After a speech that at times drew on stories of civil rights history from O Rourke s hometown of El Paso  he was asked by Sharpton whether he would back a House bill that would create a commission to study the issue of reparations  He said equivocally that he would back the bill  sponsored this year by Democratic Rep  Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas Later  O Rourke said that he d discussed the issue with Brian Stevenson  the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative   Foundational to reparations is the word repair  foundational to repair is the truth   O Rourke said  Until all Americans understand that civil rights  also involves  the injustices that have been visited and continue to be visited on people  we will never get the change that we need to live up to the promise of this country  So absolutely I would sign that into law   he said According to Jackson Lee  the bill would  make recommendations concerning any form of apology and compensation to begin the long delayed process of atonement for slavery  O Rourke is the latest 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to back the legislation  Castro  Sen  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen  Cory Booker of New Jersey also support it Castro  one of the most vocal candidates on the issue  said Wednesday that he has long believed  that our country will never truly heal until we address the original sin of slavery   If  under our Constitution  we compensate people if we take their property  why wouldn t we compensate people who were considered property and sanctioned by the state   he asked the crowd The annual Manhattan conference plays host to presidential hopefuls and other influential speakers each year  By the end of the week  a dozen Democrats running in 2020 will take the stage alongside Sharpton to make their pitch to black voters  While the candidates who spoke Wednesday drew distinctions on their views on reparations  they also discussed reforming the cash bail system  endorsed automatic and same day voter registration  and voiced support for legalizing marijuana O Rourke also said that he would support reversing an order from the Trump Justice Department that restricted the federal government s ability to use court enforced consent decrees when state and local law enforcement agencies are accused of abuse  Filed in federal court and overseen by a monitor  a consent decree is generally a road map for changes in fundamental law enforcement practices  Civil rights groups have said the move by the Trump Justice Department rolled back progress made under the Obama administration  There must be accountability for enforcement of the law  there must be accountability for use of force  and federal funds to local police departments and sheriff s departments must be tied to accountability   O Rourke said Wednesday Following his remarks  O Rourke was asked by reporters about the scrutiny former Vice President Joe Biden is facing over his past behavior with women  Two women have said that Biden   who is considering a 2020 presidential bid of his own   had touched them in overly familiar ways  Biden has said he doesn t believe he has acted inappropriately during his long public life but will pay attention to women s experiences  I think we need to listen to those who are raising their stories who have the courage to come forward   O Rourke told reporters  

AUSTIN  Texas   Democratic presidential candidate Beto O Rourke says he raised  9 4 million in donations during his first 18 days of campaigning  taking in more than  500 000 a day The ex Texas congressman didn t release his total number of contributions but announced Wednesday that 98  of his donations were less than  200 and 99  came online He says the average donation was  43 O Rourke raised  6 1 million during his first 24 hours of presidential campaigning beginning March 14  edging Bernie Sanders   5 9 million over the same period to top the Democratic field That was seen as O Rourke passing a key early test of his national appeal Sanders entered the race in February and announced raising  18 2 million in 41 days of campaigning  O Rourke says his haul means he  remains the highest per day raising candidate   

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Wednesday to rein in what the administration calls the  Wild West  of online trafficking in counterfeit goods The memorandum is aimed at stopping the sale of counterfeit products on sites like Amazon  eBay and China s e commerce leader  Alibaba  This president has decided that it s time to clean up this Wild West of counterfeiting and trafficking   said Peter Navarro  director of the White House National Trade Council  The central core of the problem is that right now  third party online marketplaces     have zero liability when it comes to trafficking in these counterfeit goods  That simply has to stop  We are going to attack that on numerous fronts  In a statement released on Wednesday  Amazon said that it  strictly prohibits  the sale of counterfeit products and welcomes more coordinated support from law enforcement to stem the problem  Amazon said that last year it spent more than  400 million fighting counterfeits  fraud and other forms of abuse  We have built industry leading tools like Brand Registry  Transparency and our newly launched Project Zero to protect our customers and help rights owners drive counterfeits to zero   the company said   With these and other tools  we ensure that over 99  of the products that customers view on Amazon never receive a complaint about counterfeits  Navarro said discussion of possible actions the administration will take to deter online trafficking in counterfeit merchandise is premature  He says the directive orders the Department of Homeland Security to work with other agencies on a report identifying the scope of the problem  The report also is to identify the origin of the fake goods and recommend administrative  regulatory  legislative or policy changes to stem the problem Alibaba also released a statement saying it would welcome the administration s work to combat counterfeiting  The company said it has developed systems to protect intellectual property and has worked with brand name companies  law enforcement  consumers and trade associations to battle the problem The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that the value of trade in counterfeit and pirated goods is about a half trillion dollars a year  with roughly 20  infringing on U S  intellectual property  according to the directive The U S  is engaged in a trade dispute with China after the Trump administration made several complaints  including that China was stealing U S  trade secrets and was forcing companies to give them technology to access its market  Trump imposed tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese imports  about half what the United States buys from that country  China retaliated with tariffs on about  110 billion of U S  items  Trade talks are ongoing Navarro told reporters in a conference call  however  that the new memorandum has nothing to do with the U S  China trade talks or Trump s criticism of Amazon owner  Jeff Bezos  Trump has accused Amazon of not paying its fair share of taxes  harming the U S  Postal Service and putting brick and mortar stores out of business A recent Government Accountability Office report examined four categories of frequently counterfeited goods  and  based on a small sample of these goods purchased through various online third party marketplaces  investigators found that more than 40  were counterfeit  Navarro said    AP Retail Writer Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Wednesday said the Trump administration would soon issue an executive order that would open the door for more natural gas pipelines and exports of liquefied natural gas  or LNG  The administration  which is pushing a policy it calls energy dominance  has been considering an order that would push back against states  including New York  that have blocked interstate natural gas pipelines  Kudlow said the executive order would open the way for pipelines and LNG at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor news outlet  New York has blocked pipelines that would take natural gas from Pennsylvania to New England  which means the region sometimes needs imports of LNG  Early last year  a tanker carrying LNG from a project in Russia s Arctic arrived in Boston Harbor to satisfy demand during a cold snap  It was unclear how the order would overrule the authority of states to rule on pipelines Several politicians in New York  including Governor Andrew Cuomo  have said they want energy companies to focus more on renewable power sources and energy efficiency  instead of building more gas and other fossil fuel fired power plants and infrastructure New York State in recent years blocked the construction of several pipelines that would transport fracked natural gas from the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania to New England  including Williams Cos Inc s Constitution and Northeast Supply Enhancement and National Fuel Gas Co s  NFG  Northern Access  In those cases  New York regulators denied the pipelines on environmental grounds  Trump has attempted to use an executive order to jumpstart TransCanada Inc s long delayed Keystone XL crude oil pipeline  signing an order just two days after assuming office in 2017  But that did not save the pipeline from getting bogged down in the courts and last week he issued another order seeking to breathe life into the project Meanwhile an independent federal agency has taken some steps that could help gas pipelines in New York The U S  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  determined last year that New York regulators waived their right to decide on a water quality certification for NFG s Northern Access project because the state waited too long  FERC this week denied New York s request to rehear that decision  Williams has made a similar argument about the Constitution pipeline    Reporting by Jeff Mason and Timothy Gardner  additional reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York  editing by Franklin Paul  Jonathan Oatis and Susan Thomas

WASHINGTON   Congressional Democrats raised questions on Wednesday about security at President Donald Trump s Mar a Lago resort in Florida after a Chinese woman carrying electronic devices bluffed her way through security checks last weekend Representative Elijah Cummings  the Democratic chairman of the U S  House Oversight Committee  said the Secret Service  which protects the president  will brief him and top committee Republican Jim Jordan on the incident  I am not going to allow the president to be in jeopardy or his family   Cummings told Reuters  adding that if the Secret Service needs  to change some things down there in Florida  we want to know  In the Senate  three leading Democrats asked FBI Director Christopher Wray and the Director of National Intelligence to look into issues raised by the incident However  Trump brushed off concerns on Wednesday  calling the incident a  fluke   praising the Secret Service s handling of the intruder and telling reporters he was not concerned about spying at the resort   We will see what happened  where she is from  who she is  but the end result is they were able to get her   Trump said at a White House meeting with senior military leaders   I m not concerned at all  Chinese citizen Yujing Zhang talked her way past checkpoints into the exclusive Trump resort while the president was golfing nearby  After Zhang got inside the resort perimeter  Mar a Lago and Secret Service personnel grew suspicious When she became aggressive under questioning  she was detained by the Secret Service and later charged with making false statements and entering a restricted area After detaining her  investigators found in Zhang s possession four cellphones  a laptop computer  an external hard drive device and a thumb drive  the Secret Service said in a court filing  Initial examination of the thumb drive determined it contained  malicious malware   the Secret Service said Zhang s ability to get inside Mar a Lago without credentials or an appointment  raises very serious questions regarding security vulnerabilities   said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and senators Dianne Feinstein and Mark Warner  the top Democrats on the Judiciary and Intelligence committees  The apparent ease with which Ms  Zhang gained access to the facility during the president s weekend visit raises concerns about the system for screening visitors  including the reliance on determinations made by Mar a Lago employees   the senators wrote  suggesting Zhang s success in getting inside the compound had  serious national security implications  The Democratic senators asked the FBI and DNI to assess the risks posed by the handling of classified information at a facility like Mar a Lago  which is open to the public  The lawmakers also asked the agencies and the Secret Service to suggest measures  needed to detect and deter adversary governments or their agents  from conducting spy operations at Trump properties The White House referred questions about the matter to the Secret Service  which did not respond to queries about the congressional inquiries    Additional reporting by Alexandra Alper  Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh  Alistair Bell and Chris Reese

WASHINGTON   In the first address to Congress by a NATO head  Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday acknowledged serious divisions within the alliance and called for bigger defense budgets to cope with global challenges such as Russian assertiveness  the core reason NATO was created in Washington 70 years ago this week  We have to be frank   Stoltenberg said before a joint meeting of Congress   Questions are being asked on both sides of the Atlantic about the strength of our partnership  And  yes  there are differences  The NATO secretary general credited President Donald Trump with compelling allies to spend more on defense  without noting that Trump also has questioned the value of the alliance and suggested that some members are freeloaders Trump s criticisms have upset a delicate balance within an alliance that has long counted on Washington to be its leader  Stoltenberg s speech provided a diplomatic counterpoint to Trump s sometimes derisive rhetoric  and the enthusiastic reception he received from both parties in the House was testament to an enduring pro NATO consensus in Congress  The secretary general delivered to Congress a powerful affirmation of the value of the NATO alliance   said Rep  Mac Thornberry  a Texas Republican James Stavridis  a retired Navy admiral who was NATO s top commander from 2009 to 2013  called the Stoltenberg address a high point in recent U S  European relations  Given the president s evident and frequently vocalized skepticism of the alliance  it is clear that Congress   on a bipartisan basis   wants to put the full weight of the legislative branch behind NATO   Stavridis said   We will never find a better pool of allies in the world than the Europeans  and this address underscores the importance of the trans Atlantic bridge  which has been creaking a bit lately  Trump s criticisms are not NATO s only source of friction  The alliance also is at odds with long time member Turkey over its planned purchase of a Russian air defense system that is not compatible with the allied air defenses  The Trump administration is threatening to stop delivery to Turkey of the newest U S  fighter jet  the F 35  if the Turks go through with their plan to buy Russia s advanced S 400 system instead of the American Patriot system Escalating that fight  Vice President Mike Pence scolded Turkey at a NATO 70th anniversary event following Stoltenberg s speech  He said the Russian S 400 system  poses great danger to NATO   and suggested that Turkey needs to decide between NATO and Russia  Turkey must choose   he said   Does it want to remain a critical partner of the most successful military alliance in the history of the world  or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making reckless decisions that undermine our alliance  Stoltenberg made a point of highlighting the benefits to the United States of having NATO allies  He noted  for example  that in response to the attacks of Sept  11  2001  NATO invoked Article 5 of its founding charter to come to the aid of a member under attack  He said allies also provide the U S  with valuable military support in peacetime  from tracking submarines in the Arctic to providing bases in Europe from which the U S  can project power  Our alliance has not lasted for 70 years out of a sense of nostalgia or of sentiment   he said   NATO lasts because it is in the national interest of each and every one of our countries  Stoltenberg on Thursday will lead a meeting of NATO foreign ministers  hosted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  to mark 70 years since the alliance s founding charter  the North Atlantic Treaty  The alliance has grown from its original 12 members to 29  with the Republic of North Macedonia about to become the 30th member country Stoltenberg  a two time former prime minister of Norway  is the first head of NATO to address a joint meeting of Congress  He touted the alliance s long record of partnership but also noted it has a history of coping with internal divisions  including strong opposition by France  Germany and other members to the 2003 U S  invasion of Iraq  Open discussions and different views is not a sign of weakness   he said   It is a sign of strength  So we should not be surprised when we see differences between our countries  Today there are disagreements on issues such as trade  energy  climate change and the Iran nuclear deal  These are serious issues with serious disagreements  Trump has sharply criticized other NATO members  including Germany  for not meeting spending targets  On Tuesday  he praised the generally upward trend among the European allies  but hounded them to pay even more because he believes America still shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of protecting Europe In a meeting at the White House  Trump and Stoltenberg had kind words for each other  But in the past  Trump has called NATO  obsolete  and suggested he might pull the U S  out of the alliance if member nations didn t significantly boost defense spending  We ve worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair share   Trump told reporters   At some point  it s going to have to go higher  Trump took credit for the increased spending  However  spending by NATO countries  which dropped after the end of the Cold War  has actually been rising since 2014  before Trump took office  After Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimean Peninsula  member countries agreed to boost defense budgets and  move toward  spending 2  of their gross domestic products on defense by 2024  The U S  spends about 3 4  of its GDP on defense Since Trump took office  European allies and Canada have added  41 billion to their defense budgets  By the end of next year  this is scheduled to reach  100 billion  Stoltenberg said  Germany remains the main target of Trump s ire because it plans to spend 1 5   below the 2  guideline  by 2024 Stoltenberg has said the 2  guideline was not invented by the United States and was a target the 29 allies set in 2014  The allies are really stepping up   Stoltenberg said in an interview with The Associated Press    Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann and Susannah George in Washington and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump told House Republicans on Tuesday that they need to embrace health care reform and make it the first thing they vote on following the 2020 election Speaking at an annual fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee  Trump told GOP lawmakers and supporters they have the advantage on a variety of issues  but conceded that Democrats have the advantage on health care  We have to take that away from them   Trump said  Republicans should not run away from health care   he added   You can t do it  You re going to get clobbered  He told the GOP House members   You are the minority  I hate to say  That s not going to last long   Democrats hold a 235 197 majority in the House with three vacancies The Democrats found success in 2018 by attracting support from women  minorities and college educated voters  particularly in suburban districts  Many wanted a check on the president  That success filtered down to state and local races  with Democrats flipping hundreds of seats in state legislatures and picking up seven governorships To turn that momentum  Trump is focusing on the economy and casting Democrats as outside the mainstream in their support for policies such as  Medicare for all  and the  Green New Deal  to combat climate change  If they beat me with the Green New Deal  I deserve to lose   he said The buzzword for Republicans is  socialism   and Trump turned to it on several occasions Tuesday night Still  he said some of the Democrats  proposals could prove enticing to votes in the short term  He said free health care sounds very seductive  Don t underestimate the power of socialism to get a vote   Trump said  

WASHINGTON   Democrats controlling the House are proposing to cut back President Donald Trump s budget hikes for the Pentagon while significantly increasing spending on the domestic programs they favor Tuesday s move ramps up a battle with Trump and puts the Democratic House on a collision course with the GOP held Senate as the two chambers consider separate paths forward on the 12 annual spending bills  Work on the legislation is sure to consume lawmakers for months Trump s budget promised a 5  defense budget increase to  750 billion next year  while cutting day to day operating budgets for domestic agencies by  62 billion  or 10  Trump s proposal is a nonstarter with Democrats and Republicans alike  but there s been no progress on forging a bipartisan agreement that would be required to stave off the return of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration The Democratic proposal is by Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth of Kentucky and powerful Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York The plan would boost funding for nondefense agencies to  639 billion  up from  605 billion now  with  7 5 billion on top of that to cover costs for the U S  Census Defense would get a boost from  716 billion now to  733 billion under the Democratic plan  cutting Trump s planned Pentagon increase of  34 billion in half Yarmuth failed in his efforts to develop a more traditional   but nonbinding   congressional budget plan that would put lawmakers on the record on tax increases  Medicare and agency spending  Divisions among Democrats proved too difficult to overcome  and even the stripped down plan released Tuesday exposed rifts between party liberals and more pragmatic lawmakers The bill is scheduled for a committee vote Wednesday  but liberal Democrat Ro Khanna of California announced Tuesday evening on Twitter that he would oppose the measure  saying it would fund  endless wars  while not adding enough to domestic programs At issue is the roughly one third of the federal budget called discretionary spending that Congress passes each year  which is comprised of Cabinet agency budgets  Larger  mandatory  programs like Medicare and Social Security mostly run on autopilot Yarmuth said the plan is  a responsible framework for the country that ensures we make the needed investments for American families  our economy and our security  Without a deal signed into law by Trump  crunching budget limits   called spending  caps  in Washington speak   would kick in  whacking the defense budget down to  576 billion and nondefense agencies down to  543 billion  Lawmakers set the painful limits back in 2011 as a deficit cutting backstop in case a budget  supercommittee  failed to come up with an alternative The supercommittee collapsed in failure and lawmakers have been dealing with the hangover ever since  passing three different two year deals to set more realistic caps  The most recent catchall spending bill  passed in February to end a 35 day partial government shutdown  marked the end of the most recent agreement Republicans immediately blasted Tuesday s measure  which  unlike prior spending agreements  doesn t included offsetting spending cuts elsewhere in the budget to limit its impact on the deficit  House Democrats are not focused on doing a budget  nor are they focused on addressing our nation s mountainous debt   said Rep  Steve Womack of Arkansas  the top Republican on the Budget Committee   This bill doesn t include offsets or bipartisan input   key components of past caps deals  Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  D Calif   and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R Ky   would like to forge another bipartisan agreement to establish higher  more realistic spending levels  We have had some conversation about what we would do about the caps and where we go from here   Pelosi said Tuesday at a Washington event hosted by Politico But no real progress has been made  lawmakers and aides say  in great part because the White House is hostile to the idea Once Democrats translate their proposal into spending legislation  it s sure to attract a string of veto threats from the White House Instead  speculation has mounted that any measure to ease the automatic cuts may be tacked on this summer to must pass legislation to maintain the government s ability to issue bonds to cover its expenses

WASHINGTON   A Democratic controlled House panel voted Tuesday to subpoena documents and a witness related to the Trump administration s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census The vote was 23 14  with Rep  Justin Amash of Michigan being the only Republican to join with Democratic lawmakers in the vote Democrats say they want specific documents that will determine why Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross decided to add the question  They say the Trump administration has declined to provide those documents despite repeated requests  The vote is the latest example of the ways Democratic lawmakers are using their majority to aggressively investigate the inner workings of President Donald Trump s administration Ross said the decision in March 2018 to add the question was based on a Justice Department request to help it enforce the Voting Rights Act In response to Tuesday s vote  he said his department  has been nothing but cooperative with the committee s expansive and detailed requests for records  Ross said the department has turned over 11 500 pages of documents and noted that he testified at a recent hearing  But Democrats countered that many of the pages were so heavily redacted that they provided little or no useful information  We don t want thousands of pieces of paper  We want the specific priority documents we asked for   unredacted and in full   said Rep  Elijah Cummings of Maryland  the panel s Democratic chairman Democratic lawmakers said Ross considered adding the citizenship question from his first days in the administration  They fear it will reduce census participation in immigrant heavy communities  harming representation and access to federal dollars  They want more information about the back and forth between administration officials before the decision was made Trump recently tweeted the census will  be meaningless  without the citizenship question Republicans said the census investigation is an example of  partisan oversight of the Trump administration   Why don t Democrats want to know whether you are a citizen or not   asked Ohio Rep  Jim Jordan  the top Republican on the panel Two federal judges have already ruled against the question and the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue before survey forms are printed It would be the first time since 1950 that the full  once a decade census asked people about their citizenship  

WASHINGTON   Civil liberties groups have filed a lawsuit challenging a pre publication review required for people who have had access to government secrets Millions of former government and intelligence agency employees are bound by a lifelong obligation to keep national security secrets as long as the government deems the information classified  Because of responsibility  they are required to submit manuscripts and drafts for government review before publication The lawsuit filed on Tuesday said that obligation is too broad  often implemented arbitrarily and ultimately suppresses free speech  The American Civil Liberties Union and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed the suit jointly on behalf of five former federal employees Vera Eidelman  an ACLU staff attorney  said the case  highlights the possibility of viewpoint based government censorship  and the politicization of the system of classification  Eidelman said proponents of the intelligence community are often fast tracked when detractors are not  The system gets worse every year  and it applies to an increasing number of people each year because these are lifetime obligations   Eidelman said The Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment on the lawsuit Tuesday  Timothy Barrett  a CIA spokesman  said the agency  does not comment on pending litigation  But in statements on the agency s website  the CIA says the pre publication review is necessary to protect national security and protect former employees from legal liability The review process  is neither censorship nor a declassification process   John Hollister Hedley  a former chairman of the CIA s publication review board  wrote in a 2007 essay Hedley said the review aims to determine  the absolute minimum of deletions  if any  that would uphold both the  Director of Central Intelligence s  authority and the individual s constitutional right to free speech under the First Amendment  The suit was filed in federal court in Maryland and against the CIA  National Security Agency  Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Defense Department

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised NATO countries for increasing their financial contributions to the Western alliance  but he hounded them to pay even more  saying America still shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of protecting Europe The president met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg  who was in Washington to mark the 70th anniversary of the organization formed to counter Russian aggression The two leaders had kind words for one another  But in the past  Trump has called NATO  obsolete  and suggested he might pull the U S  out of the alliance if member nations didn t significantly boost their defense spending  We ve worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair share   Trump told reporters   At some point  it s going to have to go higher  Trump took credit for the increased spending  However  spending by the 29 NATO countries  which dropped after the end of the Cold War  has actually been rising since 2014   before Trump took office  Prior to our getting here  NATO s spending was going way  way down   he said   It was just a one way road down  And since I became president     it s been a rocket ship up  and we have to keep it that way  After Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimean Peninsula  member countries agreed to boost defense budgets and  move toward  spending 2  of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024  The U S  spends about 3 4  of its GDP on defense Since Trump took office  European allies and Canada have added  41 billion to their defense budgets  By the end of next year  this will rise to  100 billion  Stoltenberg said  Germany  however  remains the main target of Trump s ire because it now plans to spend 1 5  by 2024  which is lower than the 2  guideline  Germany is not paying their fair share   Trump said   I have a great feeling for Germany  but they re not paying what they should be paying  We re paying for a big proportion of NATO  which is basically protecting Europe  Stoltenberg has said that the 2  guideline was not invented by the United States and was a target the 29 allies set in 2014 before Trump took office  But he thanked Trump for his  strong commitment to NATO  and for his leadership in getting member nations to increase their commitments  The allies are really stepping up   Stoltenberg said in an interview later with The Associated Press  The clear message from President Trump has helped   is having a real impact  And this is about doing what NATO allies have pledged to do  We still have a long way to go   much to do   but we have really seen very strong progress in defense spending from NATO allies  At times  Stoltenberg has served as a buffer between Trump and some European allies that he has angered Trump  who ran on an  America First  platform  slapped tariffs on the European Union  and pulled the U S  out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal  Trump s eagerness to get along with Russian leader Vladimir Putin   in spite of Russia s meddling in the 2016 U S  presidential election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years  has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat  NATO s single greatest challenge is the absence of strong  principled American presidential leadership for the first time in its history   two former U S  envoys to NATO  Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute  wrote in a report on the 70th birthday for the Harvard Kennedy School s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs Lute and Burns said NATO leaders considered not holding a 2019 summit to mark the 70th anniversary at all because they feared Trump would  blow up a meeting in controversy as he has done each time he has met with NATO leaders during the past two years   The alliance plans a scaled down summit of leaders in December that Trump is expected to attend Allies see Trump as NATO s  most urgent  and often most difficult  problem   they wrote in their report  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump  saying their conclusion was  just simply wrong  and adding that the administration has worked hard to make NATO stronger Stoltenberg is slated to address Congress on Wednesday   a first for a NATO secretary general The NATO foreign ministers  first session Thursday will focus on Russia  The ministers are expected to endorse a package of measures to improve NATO s defenses in the Black Sea Other topics will be NATO s mission in Afghanistan and Turkey s announced decision to buy a Russian surface to air missile system  Turkey is a NATO ally  but the Russian system is not compatible with NATO systems and is considered a threat to U S  F 35 aircraft They also will talk about U S  and Russian plans to withdraw this summer from a 1987 landmark arms control treaty  The U S  accuses Russia of violating the treaty  Moscow says the U S  is not in compliance If the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty is scrapped  neither Washington nor Moscow would face legal constraints on deploying land based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between 500 and 5 500 kilometers  310 to 3 410 miles   Defense officials say the Pentagon plans to begin flight tests later this year of two types of missiles that have been banned by the treaty for more than 30 years  Russia is deploying more and more of these weapons and therefore we call on Russia to come back into compliance with this treaty   Stoltenberg said    Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report

WASHINGTON   The head of the 189 nation International Monetary Fund said Tuesday the global economy is at a  delicate moment  with a hoped for rebound in growth later this year being threatened by a variety of factors such as rising trade tensions between the world s two biggest economies IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the IMF does not forecast a recession in its updated economic outlook to be released next week  but she called the current situation  precarious  and vulnerable to policy mistakes She said a hoped for rebound later this year had been helped by the actions of central banks including the announcement of the Federal Reserve earlier this year that because of the economic slowdown  it was putting future interest rate hikes on hold  To be clear  we do not see a recession in the near term   Lagarde said in a speech to the U S  Chamber of Commerce   In fact  we expect some pickup in growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020  The IMF next Tuesday will release an updated World Economic Outlook  In January  it had trimmed its forecast for global growth to around 3 5  for this year and next year  based on the headwinds caused by rising trade tensions  the uncertainty surrounding Britain s planned exit from the European Union and tighter financial conditions  including the Fed s four rate hikes last year Lagarde said that all of those factors had resulted in a dramatic reversal in prospects for many countries  Just two years ago  she said  75  of the global economy was experiencing an upswing in growth  But this year  the IMF is forecasting that about 70  of the global economy will be experiencing a slowdown in growth Many private economists believe that the United States  the world s largest economy  will see growth slow from an annual gain of 2 9  in 2018 to just above 2  in 2019 as the stimulus from tax cuts and higher government spending begins to fade Lagarde said new IMF research shows that an increase in tariffs of 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the United States and China would reduce growth in the United States by up to 0 6  and trim growth in China by as much as 1 6   Nobody wins a trade war   Lagarde said   That is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system so that we all win  Negotiators from the United States and China were scheduled to meet in Washington this week in an effort to resolve differences and avoid further penalty tariffs being imposed by both nations Lagarde s address was a preview of the issues expected to be addressed during the spring meetings of the IMF and its sister lending organization  the World Bank  taking place in Washington next week

WASHINGTON   A career official in the White House security office says dozens of people in President Donald Trump s administration were granted security clearances despite  disqualifying issues  in their backgrounds  including concerns about foreign influence  drug use and criminal conduct Tricia Newbold  an 18 year government employee who oversaw the issuance of clearances for some senior White House aides  says she compiled a list of at least 25 officials who were initially denied security clearances last year  but senior officials overruled those denials The allegations were detailed in a letter and memo released Monday by Rep  Elijah Cummings  D Md   chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee  The documents  which are based on Newbold s March 23 private committee interview  don t identify the officials on the list but say they include  two current senior White House officials  as well as contractors and individuals  in different parts of the Executive Office of the President  According to Ms  Newbold  these individuals had a wide range of serious disqualifying issues involving foreign influence  conflicts of interest  concerning personal conduct  financial problems  drug use and criminal conduct   the memo says The release of the documents sets up another fight between the White House and the Democratic controlled House  and it immediately drew criticism from House Republicans who called the allegations overblown and  cherry picked  Cummings  panel has been investigating security clearances issued to senior officials including Trump son in law Jared Kushner  former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former White House aide Rob Porter  That probe has picked up steam after The New York Times reported that Trump ordered officials to grant Kushner a clearance over the objections of national security officials  and after Newbold spoke out to NBC News and other news outlets about her concerns On Monday  Cummings said he will move this week to authorize his first subpoena in the probe  The subpoena will be for the deposition of Carl Kline  who served as the White House personnel security director and supervised Newbold  He has since left the White House for the Defense Department White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News on Tuesday that she could not talk about individual security clearances  but asserted that Democrats were  acting in bad faith  because they are asking for personal  confidential information  they know they have absolutely no right to see   Let s not forget 3 million Americans have security clearances that work for the government  By exploiting one  you re exploiting all of their personal information   Sanders said Rep  Jim Jordan of Ohio  the committee s ranking Republican  said in a statement that Cummings  probe is a  partisan attack  and an  excuse to go fishing  through personnel files  He also said that one person on Newbold s list is a GSA custodian Also  in a response memo circulated to Republican members  Jordan s staff cast Newbold as a disgruntled employee who had only limited knowledge of the reasons security clearances were granted  The Republican document also suggests Newbold s concerns were  overblown   saying that four or five of the clearance denials for  very serious reasons  were a small fraction of about 5 000 employees who work in the Executive Office of the President According to Democrat Cummings  memo  though  Newbold considered the decisions to be part of a  systematic  problem within her office where the decisions of security clearance reviewers were  continuously  overridden Newbold said she raised her concerns up the chain of command in the White House to no avail  Instead  she said  the White House retaliated  suspending her in January for 14 days without pay for not following a new policy requiring that documents be scanned as separate PDF files rather than one single PDF file Newbold said that when she returned to work in February  she was cut out of the security clearance process  The office also announced a plan to  restructure  that would remove her from a supervisory role  she said In response to Newbold s interview  Cummings is asking the White House to turn over the list she created as well as documents related to the handling of security clearances for several senior officials including Flynn  Kushner and Porter Flynn maintained his clearance even after the White House learned that he lied to the FBI about his conversations with Russia s ambassador and that he was under investigation by the Justice Department for his previous foreign work Kushner failed to initially disclose numerous foreign meetings on security clearance forms  and  according to the Times  career officials recommended against granting him a clearance before Trump personally overruled them Porter had high level access with an interim security clearance even though the FBI repeatedly told the White House

WASHINGTON   People inside and outside the Trump administration scrambled on Monday to figure out what aid it plans to cut from three Central American nations and how that is a good idea given that much of the money aims to curb migration The State Department said on Saturday it would carry out President Donald Trump s repeated threats to end U S  foreign assistance programs with El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras Without providing evidence  Trump said on Friday the countries had  set up  caravans of migrants in order to export them to the United States  A surge of asylum seekers from the three countries  known collectively as the Northern Triangle  has sought to enter the United States in recent days Congressional aides and U S  officials said they were trying to establish what money would be eliminated  and even some of Trump s fellow Republicans questioned the wisdom of curbing the aid  much of which aims to reduce violence  gang activity and the illicit drug trade   all factors that send migrants north  If we cut all this funding  and a lot of it  quite honestly  is seriously law enforcement that we re doing down there     I think it s going to make things tragically worse  not better   said Representative Michael McCaul  the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee The State Department did not elaborate beyond its weekend statement that it was  carrying out the President s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle  and would engage Congress  The U S  fiscal year runs from Oct  1 to Sept  30 Speaking on condition of anonymity  one congressional aide said it was his understanding the administration planned to reprogram   or dedicate to other purposes   about  450 million in fiscal year 2018 funds In addition  according to the aide  the department planned to review fiscal year 2017 and 2018 funds that have been obligated  but not spent  and redirect those to other purposes The aide and others said  however  that Congress had yet to receive any formal notices from the State Department about exactly which funds are involved  what they were originally for or where the department wants to reprogram them Asked if the department knew what programs would be cut  a second congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said   If they do  they haven t told us yet  My sense is they are trying to figure that out   TOTALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE A former U S  official in contact with those still in the government said emails were flying around the State Department among officials trying to figure out what was going on  Nobody knows what this is   he said  adding that by midday on Monday  no instructions had been sent to U S  aid missions in the region on how to implement the decision The situation was reminiscent of a 2018 New Year s Day tweet in which Trump appeared to decree an end to U S  aid for Pakistan  sending officials scrambling to suspend security aid without even knowing how much they were freezing Critics argued the administration s planned Central America aid cutoff would be tantamount to cutting off its nose to spite its face  It s totally counterproductive   said Rebecca Bill Chavez  who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Western Hemisphere Affairs during former President Barack Obama s administration and who is now at the Inter American Dialogue think tank in Washington  If the intent is to slow migration  this is going to have the opposite effect   she added Speaking on ABC News   This Week  program on Sunday  acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the United States needed more help from the  Northern Triangle  countries and Mexico  where the migrants typically enter the United States  You can make all the promises you want but when you re still sending 100 000 people across the southern border  actions speak louder than words   Mulvaney said   We want to work with the Northern Triangle countries but we need their assistance  Democrats were scathing about the planned cuts  Most of this aid is intended to address the causes of migration   reduce poverty  violence  gangs  improve rule of law  and reform justice systems   said Senator Patrick Leahy  the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee   It is shooting ourselves in the foot to cut off the assistance    Reporting by Arshad Mohammed  Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan  Additional reporting by Jonathan Landay and Lesley Wroughton  Writing By Arshad Mohammed  Editing by Peter Cooney

WASHINGTON   As he threatens to shut down the southern border  President Donald Trump is considering bringing on a  border  or  immigration czar  to coordinate immigration policy across various federal agencies  according to four people familiar with the discussions Trump is weighing at least two potential candidates for the post  former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli  according to the people  who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversations publicly Kobach and Cuccinelli are far right conservatives with strong views on immigration  Cuccinelli was seen at the White House on Monday The planning comes as Trump is threatening anew to close the U S  Mexico border as soon as this week if Mexico does not completely halt illegal immigration into the U S  And it serves as the latest sign that the president plans to continue to hammer his hardline immigration rhetoric and policies as he moves past the special counsel s Russia investigation and works to rally his base heading into his 2020 re election campaign Aides hope the potential appointment  which they caution is still in the planning stages  would serve as the  face  of the administration on immigration issues and would placate both the president and his supporters  showing he is serious and taking action White House press aides  Kobach and Cuccinelli did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment  Kobach previously served as vice chair of the president s short lived election fraud commission  which was disbanded after finding little evidence of widespread abuse A Department of Homeland Security official noted that White House czars have been appointed in the past when there has been an  urgent need  for sustained  inter agency policy coordination  While Homeland Security often plays a leading role when it comes to immigration policy and enforcement  the department is not in charge of officials at the departments of Health and Human Services  State  Defense and Justice  which often play key roles Trump has often complained  both publicly and privately  about how he has not been able to do more to stop the tide of illegal immigration  which he has likened to an  invasion  and described as a national security crisis  Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100 000 arrests or denials of entry in March  More than half of those are families with children Still  Trump has been pushing  He has deployed National Guard troops to the border  forced a government shutdown to try to pressure Congress to provide more money for his long promised border wall  and eventually signed an emergency declaration to circumvent lawmakers  He also moved Saturday to cut direct aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras  where citizens are fleeing north and overwhelming U S  resources at the southern border Those moves have involved a swath of government agencies  The Justice Department manages the immigration courts that decide whether a migrant is deported  Health and Human Services manages the care of migrant children apprehended at the border  agencies within Homeland Security manage the allocation of legal status  immigration enforcement and asylum requests  and the Pentagon and the Army Corps of Engineers manage facets of border wall construction But not all are always on the same page Earlier this year  for example  Health and Human Services closed down a temporary facility being used to house migrant children in Tornillo  Texas  creating a problem for border agents who ran out of bed space when the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border spiked  Homeland Security is not allowed to hold children in detention facilities for longer than 20 days And last year  former Attorney General Jeff Sessions instituted a  zero tolerance  policy at the border without consulting others  causing a spike in the number of migrant children separated from their families The separated children were placed in HHS custody  but there was no tracking system in place to link parents with their children until a federal judge ordered one  causing widespread fear and concern about whether families would ever see each other again It has yet to be decided whether the czar position would be housed within Homeland Security or within the White House  which would not require Senate confirmation A person positioned within the White House could coordinate immigration policy across various agencies  working closely with aides who are deeply involved in the issue  including senior advisers Stephen Miller and Jared Kushner  national security adviser John Bolton and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  who supports the idea Appointing a person based within Homeland Security could be trickier because the department s agency heads are all Senate confirmed positions and  in the case of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U S  Customs and Border Protection  are longtime immigration officials with decades of experience dealing with the border While immigration officials would welcome an adviser focused specifically on policy across the varying agencies  the names being floated are likely to spark backlash and criticism Kobach  an immigration hardliner  ran a failed bid for governor promising to drive immigrants living in the U S  illegally out of the country  He has recently been working for a nonprofit corporation  WeBuildtheWall Inc   which has been raising private money to build Trump s wall Cuccinelli has advocated for denying citizenship to American born children of parents living in the U S  illegally  limiting in state tuition at public universities only to those who are citizens or legal residents  and allowing workers to file lawsuits when an employer knowingly hires someone living in the country illegally for taking a job from a  law abiding competitor  Thomas Homan  the former acting ICE director  has also been mentioned as a potential pick  according to one of the people familiar with the talks     

WASHINGTON   The top Republican on the U S  House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee said on Monday that cutting aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras would make the situation there worse  not better  a sign that President Donald Trump will face bipartisan objections in Congress as he pursues the plan  If we cut all this funding  and a lot of it  quite honestly  is seriously law enforcement that we re doing down there     I think it s going to make things tragically worse  not better   Representative Michael McCaul said in a presentation at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington The State Department said on Saturday it was carrying out Trump s directive to end aid programs to the three Central American nations  known as the Northern Triangle  after Trump blasted them for sending migrants to the United States However  congressional aides noted that  since the U S  constitution says Congress  not the president  sets spending policy  Trump cannot overrule spending bills passed by Congress  which he signed into law  without lawmakers  approval To obtain that approval  the administration would have to send Congress a formal notification explaining its plans for reusing the aid money and seeking lawmakers  approval McCaul said those who might want to cut off aid may not understand the issue  arguing that U S  money goes to addressing the problems that prompt migrants to leave their countries  I don t think they thought it through   he said   Reporting by Patricia Zengerle in Washington  Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and James Dalgleish  

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump took a step back on Tuesday from his threat to close the U S  southern border to fight illegal immigration  as pressure mounted from companies worried that a shutdown would cause chaos to supply chains Trump threatened on Friday to close the border this week unless Mexico acted  He repeated that threat on Tuesday but said he had not made a decision yet   We re going to see what happens over the next few days   Closing the border could disrupt millions of legal crossings and billions of dollars in trade  Auto companies have been warning the White House privately that it would lead to the idling of U S  plants within days because they rely on prompt deliveries of components made in Mexico The U S  Chamber of Commerce  the largest U S  business lobbying group  has been in contact with the White House to discuss the  very negative economic consequences that would occur across the country   said Neil Bradley  the group s top lobbyist  on a call with reporters  Trump praised efforts by Mexico to hinder illegal immigration from Central America at its own southern border  On Monday  the Mexican government said it would help regulate the flow of migrants  I really wanted to close it   Trump said on Tuesday night at a fundraiser for congressional Republicans The Mexican government has not published apprehension statistics  but a senior White House official said it had provided daily updates to the Trump administration  including specific apprehension numbers  They say they re going to stop them  Let s see  They have the power to stop them  they have the laws to stop them   Trump said earlier on Tuesday PUSH BACKTrump has made fighting illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America a key part of his agenda  but shutting down one of the world s most used borders might be a step too far  even for many of his fellow Republicans  Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell joined Democrats in warning Trump against such a move  Closing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country and I would hope we would not be doing that sort of thing   McConnell told reporters on Tuesday A group representing General Motors Co  Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said in a statement that  any action that stops commerce at the border would be harmful to the U S  economy  and in particular  the auto industry   Dozens of U S  vehicle  engine  transmission and other auto parts plants could close because of a lack of components in the days after a border shutdown  It would also prevent thousands of vehicles built in Mexico from landing in U S  dealer showrooms Automakers exported nearly 2 6 million Mexican made vehicles to the United States in 2018  accounting for 15 percent of all vehicles sold in the country  Some  like the Chevrolet Blazer SUV  are only made in Mexico  Retailers are also raising alarm bells  according to officials with two groups that represent hundreds of U S  retail firms  It will be unprecedented self inflicted pain   said David French  senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation   We are still nervous about this and we have been talking to some of our companies about maybe ramping up direct pressure on the White House by getting CEOs to call   SLOWER BORDERSenior U S  Department of Homeland Security officials said on Tuesday a recent redeployment of some 750 officers on the border to deal with a surge in migrants   mostly Central American families turning themselves in to border agents   had already led to a slowing of legal crossings and commerce at ports of entry  Wait times in Brownsville  Texas  were around 180 minutes  which were two times the peaks of last year   said a senior DHS official on a call with reporters   We ended the day yesterday at Otay Mesa  California  with a backup of 150 trucks that hadn t been processed   the official said  Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Tuesday that backups were delaying commercial traffic at the U S  Mexico border at several crossings  He said the government had not drastically changed its migration strategy following the shutdown threats DHS officials said border facilities had been overwhelmed by families seeking asylum  fleeing poverty and violence in Central America  DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Manuel Padilla  a 30 year veteran of the U S  Border Patrol  would now serve as the agency s coordinator on the border response U S  Customs and Border Protection estimated that some 100 000 migrants were apprehended or encountered at the border in March  the highest level in a decade   The system is on fire   a DHS official said Because of limits on how long children are legally allowed to be held in detention  many of the families are released to await U S  immigration court hearings  a process that can take years because of ballooning backlogs  To try to address the problem  the Trump administration in January started sending some migrants to wait out their U S  court dates in Mexican border cities  On Monday  DHS said it would dramatically ramp up that program  despite court challenges The biggest priority for Nielsen is to seek action from Congress to change the immigration laws  said a DHS official  She sent a letter to Congress last week repeating many of the Trump administration s demands  including a request to quickly deport Central American minors that cross the border alone  Under current law  minors who are not from the contiguous countries of Canada and Mexico are placed in the care of sponsors in the United States  which Nielsen called a  dangerous  pull  factor  for migrants  Migrant advocates and some Democrats in Congress oppose the proposed legislative changes  saying they would send vulnerable children back to dangerous situations in their home countries  Trump said he had spoken with  a few  Democrats on Tuesday about the administration s proposals and added   They re changing their minds    Reporting by Roberta Rampton  Steve Holland and David Shepardson in Washington and Mica Rosenberg in New York  Additional

WASHINGTON   Democrats mocked President Donald Trump on Tuesday for pushing back his promise of sweeping healthcare reform until after the 2020 election  and said they were happy to make it a central campaign issue Trump had pledged in recent days to use court action to end Obamacare  the signature law of his Democratic predecessor  Barack Obama  and said his Republican Party would push over the next few months for a better healthcare plan at lower cost for most Americans But Republican leaders in Congress quickly shied away from the issue and pushed him to reconsider In a series of late night tweets on Monday  Trump did just that  saying there would be no vote on any healthcare legislation until after next year s election Democrats gleefully jumped on the delay  saying it showed Trump and his party had no idea what to do with healthcare beyond repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021  Translation  they have no healthcare plan   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said   They are for repeal  they have no replace  Mitch McConnell  the Republican Senate majority leader  said he told Trump on Monday the party was not about to restart work on comprehensive healthcare legislation  noting Republicans were unable to pass a plan when they controlled both chambers of Congress in the first two years of the Trump presidency  I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate   McConnell told reporters  Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in November elections after campaigning heavily on strengthening Obamacare FIRST VOTETrump said on Tuesday he and Republicans would draw up a new healthcare plan ahead of the 2020 election and implement it soon afterward  I think we re going to have a great healthcare package     If we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency   which I hope are two good assumptions   we re going to have a phenomenal healthcare   Trump told reporters He said a Republican plan would mean most Americans pay lower premiums and deductibles for their healthcare than they currently pay under Obamacare  revisiting a promise he made during the 2016 campaign Trump told House Republicans in a speech on Tuesday night that they should campaign on a pledge to make healthcare the first vote in Congress after the 2020 election He said one of the major reasons Democrats won control of the House last year was because Republicans did not have a healthcare plan to put forward to voters  Republicans should not run away from healthcare  You can t do it  You re going to get clobbered   Trump said While Trump s delay gives Republicans more time to knit together an alternative to Obamacare  it all but guarantees a 2020 battle over the divisive issue  Don t let President Trump fool you  America  Republicans are not the party of healthcare  They are the party that wants to end your healthcare   Schumer said at a rally on Tuesday   We Democrats will not stop fighting tooth and nail to protect America s healthcare  today  tomorrow  and on in through 2021  Trump and his fellow Republicans vowed in the 2016 presidential election to  repeal and replace  Obamacare but failed to do so during their first two years in power  despite control of both the Senate and the House  Several of the leading candidates for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination  including a number of current U S  senators  have already made healthcare a major part of their campaign message Trump accuses Democrats of seeking  a socialist takeover of American healthcare   and is certain to take that argument onto the 2020 campaign trail   I see what the Democrats are doing  It s a disaster what they re planning and everyone knows it   he told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday   Reporting by Susan Heavey and Susan Cornwell  dditional reporting by Roberta Rampton  Editing by Susan Thomas  Bill Berkrot and Peter Cooney

WASHINGTON   U S  manufacturers grew at a faster pace in March  as the pace of employment jumped and new orders and production improved The Institute for Supply Management  an association of purchasing managers  said Monday that its manufacturing index rose to 55 3 last month  up from 54 2 in February  Readings above 50 point toward an expansion in manufacturing  The sector has been reporting growth for 31 months ISM s survey of companies for the index is a sign that economic growth should continue  even though the global economy  steel tariffs and the trade battle between the United States and China have been sources of concern  The primary driver here was employment   said Timothy Fiore  chair of the ISM manufacturing business survey committee   People are hiring to make sure they have the outputs needed to meet the demand in April  May and June  The employment component of the index surged 5 2 percentage points  while new orders registered a 1 9 point gain and production notched a 1 point increase Out of the 18 sectors surveyed for the report  16 reported growth  including transportation equipment and primary metals  Only the apparel and paper product sectors reported declines  The food and beverage sector performed the strongest in March  

WASHINGTON   One year out from the start of the 2020 census  Census Bureau officials set out Monday to demonstrate the importance of the head count for all Americans  President Donald Trump offered a different message  saying the count will be  meaningless  if it doesn t include a citizenship question In a tweet Monday  Trump blamed  Radical Left Democrats  for opposing the  all important  question on citizenship The Trump administration wants to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census  But the idea faces court challenges from Democratic leaning states and communities that argue it would make immigrants and their families less likely to respond to the constitutionally mandated tally and thus make the count less accurate The official counting begins on April 1 next year  To mark the date one year out  Census Bureau officials held a briefing Monday to begin raising awareness and project confidence that they re up to the monumental task Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham declined to answer a question about the president s tweet  saying  we really want to restrict our comments to talking about the great job we re doing  where we are and how it s going to help this nation  Dillingham noted that the census for the first time will give people the chance to respond online  People can also respond by telephone and mail  He cited how easy it will be to provide requested information and to assure that the information will be secure and confidential  But probably the message we really want to emphasize is how important it is   Dillingham said   We now live in an information age where accurate data improves the quality of our lives and supports our thriving economy  The decennial census is used to help determine how about  675 billion in federal dollars is distributed each year  State and local governments use it to make decisions about where to locate schools and health clinics and provide social services and improve roads and bridges  The survey results are also used to distribute electoral college votes and congressional district seats The citizenship question has been caught up in litigation in federal courts  where lower courts have ruled that the administration s haste to include the question violated federal law and the Constitution Trump tweeted that without a citizenship question  the  Report would be meaningless and a waste of the  Billions  ridiculous  that it costs to put together  Against the advice of career officials at the Census Bureau  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross decided last year to add the citizenship question to the survey for the 10 year headcount  saying the Justice Department requested the question to improve enforcement of the federal Voting Rights Act The Supreme Court is hearing the Trump administration appeal of a federal judge s ruling in New York that the decision violated federal law  Since then  a judge in California has said a citizenship question also would violate the Constitution A resolution of the citizenship matter is needed soon to allow the government to start printing the census questionnaire House Democrats are also investigating the decision by Ross to add the citizenship question  A congressional panel will consider issuing subpoenas on Tuesday if it doesn t get a commitment from the Commerce Department that it will provide certain documents and witnesses A Commerce Department official asked Rep  Elijah Cummings  the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform  to hold off on considering or issuing the subpoena  while our good faith dialogue continues  Cummings warned the department on Friday that his committee wanted to know by Monday whether it would produce the documents and witness interviews his committee has been seeking Michael Platt Jr   an assistant secretary at the Commerce Department  said in a letter obtained by The Associated Press the department believes  the rush to issue a subpoena is premature   Platt said the department s staff is working at full capacity on  both its normal business and its multiple Congressional engagements  and I believe your one day response demand is inconsistent with your constitutional obligation to accommodate the department   We respectfully request adequate time to consider your letter and requests   Platt wrote Monday  

WASHINGTON   U S  retail sales fell in February  as consumers pulled back their spending on building materials  groceries  furniture  electronics and clothing amid signs of a slowing economy The Commerce Department said Monday that retail sales fell 0 2 percent in February  after posting an upwardly revised gain 0 7 percent in January  Still  sales are running below their seasonally adjusted levels from November after a sharp 1 6 percent decline in December Over the past year  retail sales have roughly kept pace with inflation by increasing a slight 2 2 percent The recent dip in consumer spending suggests that more Americans are tightening their belts amid slowing global growth and waning effects of President Donald Trump s tax cuts at the end of 2017  Roughly 70 percent of all economic activity comes from consumers  so a slump in retail sales could have a ripple effect  The end of the government shutdown on January 25 failed to boost spending much  and the initial round of tax data for February showed taxpayers were receiving lower average refunds than in 2018  A couple of special factors   snowstorms and less income tax refunds   may have weighed on spending  though it s disappointing that consumers did not extend January s rebound despite the end of the government shutdown   said Sal Guatieri  senior economist at BMO Capital Markets Sales at building materials stores plunged 4 4 percent in February  Electronics retailers and grocers posted declines of more than 1 percent  Department stores  clothiers and furniture shops also suffered a setback in sales Still  auto sales rebounded slightly in February after a sharp drop in January  And non store retailers  a category that includes online shopping  enjoyed gains of 0 9 percent in February and 10 percent in the past year  

WASHINGTON SAN DIEGO   The Trump administration is intensifying measures to curb the flow of Central American asylum seekers crossing into the United States from Mexico  officials said on Monday  including sending more people back to Mexico to wait for their asylum claims to be heard by U S  courts Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  agency will speed up the reassignment of 750 officers to parts of the border dealing with the largest numbers of immigrants  a shift the administration first announced last week Nielsen was cutting short a visit to Europe and flying back to Washington from London to personally oversee enforcement actions  and would visit the border later in the week  a Homeland Security official said late on Monday  She had been due to also travel to Sweden and take part in a meeting of G7 security officials in Paris U S  President Donald Trump threatened to close the border this week if Mexico does not stop a surge of people  often traveling as families from Honduras  El Salvador and Guatemala  Closing the border would potentially disrupt millions of legal border crossings and billions of dollars in trade  His aides doubled down on the threat on Sunday but offered no specific details or timeline   Graphic  https   tmsnrt rs 2CJe9fh One policy put in place earlier this year to return asylum seekers to Mexico  called the Migrant Protection Protocols  MPP   will be  immediately  expanded by  hundreds of additional migrants per day above current rates   Nielsen said in a statement on Monday As of March 26  approximately 370 migrants had been returned to Mexico since the program began in late January  a Mexican official said last week People who have been returned to Mexico to wait are struggling to find attorneys and receive notice of their proceedings in U S  courts  rights advocates said Trump administration officials say the MPP is a way to address the failings of the current system  which they claim encourages illegal immigration  Families that claim asylum are often released into the United States because of limits on how long children can be held in detention  allowing them to stay for years while their cases move through a backlogged immigration court system even though many claims are ultimately denied SHELTERS AT CAPACITYThe administration is hoping policies of deterrence will reduce the number of people who turn themselves in to U S  border agents  overwhelming the capacity of processing centers along the southern border  CBP estimated last month that some 100 000 migrants would be apprehended or encountered at the border in March  the highest level in a decade  forcing agents to temporarily house migrants for processing in an outdoor enclosure under an international bridge in El Paso  Texas  That overflow site was shut down on Sunday after being used for a month The total number of immigrants being released by U S  immigration authorities in El Paso is averaging 500 600 per day  said Ruben Garcia  executive director of Annunciation House  which coordinates migrant releases with U S  immigration authorities  Annunciation House is preparing for that total to rise to up to 1 100 during the current surge  Garcia said Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that Mexico will help to regulate the flow of Central Americans passing through its territory to the United States  He said the root causes of the phenomenon must be tackled  In a move Democrats and Republicans in Congress have said would be counterproductive  the U S  State Department cut aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador after Trump accused them  without providing evidence  of having  set up  migrant caravans and sending them north The Mexican government did not respond to requests for comment about the expansion of MPP  and it was not clear to what extent Mexico was forewarned  In the past  Mexico has said it was accepting returned asylum seekers for humanitarian reasons although it opposes the policy Shelters in major Mexican border cities such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez are already at capacity because of the increase in asylum seekers in recent months and the U S  policy of allowing only a few dozen people per day to ask for asylum at ports of entry COURT HEARINGSLast week  San Diego immigration judge Scott Simpson heard from the first Central American families that were returned to Mexico under the MPP policy Of four families in court on Wednesday  just one had an attorney  Yanira Esmeralda Chavez  a Salvadoran fruit seller  accompanied by her three boys did not have a lawyer as she made her case to Simpson  The family had been staying at a shelter in Tijuana  and asked to remain in the United States because they feared being sent back to Mexico  I called the numbers on the attorney list that they provided me  but they said they cannot take my case because I am in Tijuana   Chavez said in the hearing   It would be better if I stay in the U S   where I have family members  Simpson gave Chavez two more months to obtain an attorney  and said that her family in the United States could perhaps help her find a lawyer Throughout the day  Simpson expressed his concerns about the policy  saying he was  skeptical  about migrants getting their notices to appear in court  given the court does not have proper addresses for those returned to Mexico   Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati and Jose Gallego Espina  additional reporting by Dave Graham  Sharay Angulo and

WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump said Monday he wants to follow up on criminal justice reform with efforts that help federal inmates find jobs after they leave prison Congress passed legislation last year called the First Step Act that gives judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders and boosts prisoner rehabilitation efforts  The effort drew strong support from Republicans and Democrats worried that mandatory minimum laws had generated unfair sentences in many drug related cases Trump said Americans with criminal backgrounds are unemployed at rates up to five times the national average  which stood at 3 8 percent in February He said a  Second Step Act  will focus on  successful re entry and reduced unemployment for Americans with past criminal records   His goal is to cut that unemployment rate for ex prisoners to single digits within five years The president was short on details about what future legislation would include  but the White House said Trump s budget for the next fiscal year proposes more than  500 million to help prisoners succeed after their release  When we say  hire American   we mean all Americans  including former inmates who have paid their debt to society   Trump said Trump was joined on stage by a handful of former prisoners who have been helped through the First Step Act  He asked each of them to speak  sparking a unique level of spontaneity  sadness and cheer in the White House East Room as they recounted their experience  Gregory Allen noted that two months ago he was in a prison cell  and now he was telling his story at the White House  calling it an example of what would  make America great again   Allen said  borrowing from the president s trademark phrase as the audience laughed and applauded  

WASHINGTON   If there was any school where her daughter would feel safe  Michelle Hoffman thought  it would be Holland Christian High School  Betsy DeVos  the famously religious education secretary  was educated there  and the school preached that its students would seek  in all endeavors to  do justice  love kindness  and walk humbly with their God   But after her 15 year old was sexually assaulted by her 17 year old boyfriend  another student at the school  Ms  Hoffman realized how misplaced that confidence was  Instead of helping  the school s principal called the assault  underage sex  and told her the school was  not taking sides  An ensuing lawsuit filed by Ms  Hoffman against Holland Christian has turned Ms  DeVos s private alma mater in Holland  Mich   into Exhibit A as the secretary moves to overhaul the law that governs school sexual assault   and to bolster the rights of the accused while narrowing the responsibilities that schools have to investigate sexual misconduct The Holland case lays bare some of the biggest concerns about Ms  DeVos s proposals for Title IX   the 1972 law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funding  On Tuesday  the Senate Education Committee will hold a hearing on responding to sexual assault on college campuses  But Title IX also applies to primary and secondary schools   like Holland Christian  We pray that ours can be the case that makes Betsy say   maybe this isn t the right way to go    Ms  Hoffman said Ms  DeVos s proposed regulations have garnered more than 105 000 public comments  making Title IX one of the most contentious rules in the department s history  Her efforts to strengthen the due process rights for accused students have been assailed by victims rights advocates as gutting protections for those who have been assaulted  harassed or raped The particulars of the sexual misconduct asserted in the Holland case are no longer in dispute  In a text message  the boyfriend revealed that the Hoffman s daughter did not like  the way that I ve raped you   He pleaded guilty to a third degree criminal sexual conduct charge  and a judge ordered him off the Holland Christian premises Ms  Hoffman said that Holland Christian not only failed to properly investigate her daughter s assault and to protect her from her perpetrator  but also went to great lengths to protect the male student  The suit described how the school rallied around the boy  who Ms  Hoffman said was the grandson of a former Holland Christian principal The suit charged that those actions were in large part because Holland Christian failed to have Title IX processes in place  despite receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from the U S  Department of Agriculture through its participation in the National School Lunch Program   a little known avenue through which private schools can skirt enforcement of federal civil rights laws while taking taxpayer dollars  This case should be a wake up call for both private and public school families   said Esther Warkov  executive director of Stop Sexual Assault in Schools  a nonprofit organization that publicized the lawsuit   When the U S  Secretary of Education s own alma mater flouts its responsibilities we begin to understand the pervasive disregard for Title IX compliance that includes the majority of public schools nationwide   she said ImageBetsy DeVos  the education secretary  announced in 2017 that she would scrap the Obama era Title IX guidelines and propose new rules CreditErin Schaff The New York TimesThe lawsuit  filed in April 2018  charges that the school violated guidelines issued under the Obama administration  which were in place at the time the assault was brought to Holland officials  attention  The rules required schools to investigate sexual assaults that took place off campus and take steps to protect accusers from their accused while an investigation unfolded  In 2017  before the Hoffman lawsuit was filed  Ms  DeVos announced that she would scrap the Obama era guidelines and rewrite the law  She proposed new rules last fall The Obama administration s guidance drew wide ranging criticism  including from college administrators  as arbitrary edicts that pressured colleges to conduct quasi legal processes with a presumed outcome in favor of victims  And in the last year  significant court rulings  have aligned with Ms  DeVos s efforts to provide a firmer legal framework for campus investigations The case  expected to go to mediation or a courtroom this summer  asserts that the Hoffman s daughter suffered  severe and pervasive  sexual harassment that denied her access to her education  It argues that school administrators had  actual knowledge  of the assault  meaning that it was reported to officials with the authority to take action  and that the school was  deliberately indifferent  in its response Ms  DeVos has proposed to adopt the  severe and pervasive  standard for sexual harassment  along with legal standards that would hold school administrators responsible only if they had  actual knowledge  of sexual misconduct and were  deliberately indifferent   Those standards are based on Supreme Court precedent and used in Title IX court cases already  But in administrative hearings  they would significantly raise the bar for holding schools liable for addressing misconduct compared with looser processes outlined by the Obama administration The new rules preserve some longstanding Title IX requirements  including schools  obligation to have a Title IX coordinator and an established investigative process  They also outline new  supportive measures  for victims  even if they do not file complaints  They would  however  eliminate an Obama era requirement that held schools liable for incidents that occur off campus and outside of a school sponsored program or activity   a change that  had it been in place  would have technically alleviated Holland Christian of its obligation to respond to the claim  Holland Christian does not receive funding from the Education Department  which enforces Title IX in schools and colleges that participate in programs it administers  but court cases suggest that it is still bound by the rules that apply to all education programs that receive federal funding  In 2010 case  a federal judge ruled that a Pennsylvania Catholic High School was required to follow Title IX because it received funding for meals and technology The Hoffmans  lawsuit said that the Holland Christian had received more than  600 000 in federal funding through its participation in the National School Lunch Program  which reimburses schools for serving free or reduced price meals  Currently  4 700 private schools nationwide participate in the program according to Agriculture Department officials  All schools that participate in the voluntary program are required to comply with federal civil rights laws  department officials said But experts and advocates say there is little way of knowing if private schools actually are aware of their legal obligations   or care  This case has unearthed this whole set of protections that haven t really been talked about  and that parents and private schools don t know exist   said Seth Galanter  director of legal advocacy at the National Center for Youth Law  who worked in the Education Department s Office for Civil Rights under former President Barack Obama The Hoffmans initially turned to the Education Department s Office for Civil Rights  which dismissed their complaint in July 2017  citing lack of jurisdiction  The Hoffmans learned months later  as they prepared to file a lawsuit  that the complaint should have been filed with the Department of Agriculture Unlike the Education Department  the Agriculture Department has enforcement power in private schools  but Title IX investigations in schools participating in the National School Lunch Program are rare  Officials said in recent years  the department s office for civil rights has only investigated one such complaint  The agency declined to answer any other questions about its civil rights investigations ImageStudents working at Holland Christian High School  Private schools like Holland Christian are allowed to request religious exemptions from civil rights laws that conflict with their religious tenets CreditRachel Woolf for The New York TimesFor decades  Title IX enforcement in private schools has been contentious A 1984 Supreme Court decision  Grove City College vs  Bell  held that Title IX only applied to a specific program  not the institution  that received federal funding  In response  Congress passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987  which clarified that anti discrimination laws applied institutionwide  President Ronald Reagan vetoed the bill  and Congress overrode it Private schools are allowed to request religious exemptions from civil rights laws that conflict with their religious tenets  But Agriculture Department officials said they have not received any exemption requests in recent years from schools participating in the National School Lunch Program  including Holland Christian In its response  Holland Christian overwhelmingly denied the allegations The school admitted  however  that it did not have a formal Title IX process Gary P  Bartosiewicz  the lawyer representing Holland Christian declined to comment on Ms  Hoffman s allegations  saying only that the school  will continue its defense of both the legal and factual allegations in this litigation  Karen Truszkowski  a Michigan lawyer who is representing the Hoffman family  also declined to comment on the case  But she said   We re at a real crossroads and Title IX is the accountability measure to ensure adults are protecting children  In the lawsuit  Ms  Hoffman said that after her daughter s assault was revealed in the 2016 17 school year  she was in constant communication with Holland officials about her concerns  and that the principal and superintendent   who both have left the district since the suit was filed   did nothing Ms  Hoffman said she asked for her daughter and the boy to see each other as little as possible  The lawsuit said the girl was forced to see him in the hallways and in choir class  and he once brushed up against her   He kept in proximity to her and made sure she was aware of it   the lawsuit said  As a result of the interactions  it claimed  the girl was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety  and she missed school because of  overwhelming emotional crisis  Ms  Hoffman said that the school also failed to accommodate her daughter s desire to enjoy school  but went out of its way to make sure the male student could When she expressed that her daughter was having academic difficulty  the principal said the girl s grades  seemed fine   according to the suit  But after the male student was barred from attending classes  the school sent teachers to his home to tutor him so that he could finish his senior year  the suit said At his sentencing  several Holland Christian teachers wrote to the judge asking for leniency  because he was a  good kid   the suit said  No such letters were written for the Hoffmans  daughter  the suit said  and the girl  had to face each day knowing that authority figures at her school supported her rapist  and not her  Ms  Hoffman said she hopes that her case can help ensure that victims are treated differently under the new rules  We do recognize that Title IX is not perfect   she said   but her changes will definitely be taking a step back   

WASHINGTON   Missouri can execute an inmate who argued his rare medical condition will result in severe pain if he is put to death by lethal injection  the Supreme Court ruled Monday The justices split along ideological lines in ruling 5 4 against inmate Russell Bucklew  who is on death row for a 1996 murder The court s five conservative justices rejected Bucklew s argument that subjecting him to lethal injection would violate the Constitution s ban on cruel and unusual punishment  He said a tumor in his throat is likely to burst during the execution  causing him to choke on his own blood  Today we bring this case to a close at last because we agree with the courts below that Mr  Bucklew s claim isn t supported by either the law or the evidence   Justice Neil Gorsuch said in summarizing his majority opinion from the bench Bucklew   who has a medical condition that causes blood filled tumors to grow in his head  neck and throat   was up against Supreme Court precedent in trying to get the justices to agree with him  The court has previously ruled that inmates challenging the method a state plans to use to execute them have to show that there s an alternative that is likely to be less painful Bucklew proposed that Missouri execute him by having him breathe pure nitrogen gas through a mask instead of by injecting him with a lethal dose of pentobarbital  Missouri countered that no state has ever carried out an execution as Bucklew suggested  calling his proposal vague and untested Gorsuch wrote that Bucklew had  failed present any evidence  that his alternative method of execution  would significantly reduce his risk of pain   Moreover  Bucklew had not shown that Missouri could readily implement his suggestion  wrote Gorsuch In a dissent for the court s four liberal justices  Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that his colleagues acknowledged that the Constitution s Eighth Amendment prohibits states from executing prisoners by  horrid modes of torture  such as burning at the stake  But the majority s decision permits a state to execute a prisoner who suffers from a medical condition that would render his execution no less painful   he wrote Breyer wrote that he didn t believe Bucklew was required to identify an alternative means of execution because the inmate was challenging Missouri s method only as it applies to him  And even assuming he was required to do so  Breyer said  Bucklew did satisfy that requirement The five justices ruling against Bucklew included Justice Brett Kavanaugh  whose vote was seen as pivotal to the outcome of the case  That s because last year his eight current colleagues split 4 to 4 over whether to allow Bucklew s execution to proceed  Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the fifth vote to spare Bucklew  Kavanaugh replaced Kennedy  who retired in July Kavanaugh wrote a 2 page opinion agreeing with his conservative colleagues  He noted that an inmate challenging the way a state plans to carry out the death penalty isn t limited to proposing an alternate method of execution authorized under that state s law  Kavanaugh wrote that he wanted to emphasize the majority s conclusion that   we see little likelihood that an inmate facing a serious risk of pain will be unable to identify an available alternative  Bucklew is on death row for the 1996 murder of Michael Sanders  who was living with Bucklew s former girlfriend  After entering a trailer where the two were living with their children  Bucklew fatally shot Sanders and later raped his former girlfriend  Bucklew was arrested after a car chase and shootout with police Chris Nuelle  a spokesman for the Missouri Attorney General s Office  said in a statement that Monday s ruling put the state and Bucklew s victims  one step closer to justice   An attorney for Bucklew didn t immediately respond to a request for comment following the ruling The case is 17 8151  Bucklew v  Precythe      

WASHINGTON   Barbara Bush didn t bite her tongue in recent years when it came to Donald Trump  She just didn t like him  But a new biography of the former first lady finds that her disdain for the Republican president  who transformed the party her own family had embodied for generations into his likeness  dates as least as far back as a 1990s diary entry She referred to Trump in the entry as  the real symbol of greed in the 80s  Mrs  Bush  who was 92 when she died last April   gave Susan Page  author of  The Matriarch  Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty   access to volumes of her diaries  which she began keeping in 1948  The former first lady recounts in a January 1990 entry about reading a news article on Trump speaking at a Los Angeles charity awards dinner for Merv Griffin  Former President Ronald Reagan and his wife  Nancy  attended the gala  and Trump needled the former president over pricey speeches he had given in Japan Mrs  Bush later showed a friend news clips about Trump s separation from his first wife  Ivana  and noted that allies of the soon to be ex Mrs  Trump were saying a  25 million settlement in the prenuptial agreement she signed wouldn t be enough  The Trumps are a new word  both of them   Mrs  Bush wrote   Trump now means Greed  selfishness and ugly  So sad  Her dislike of Trump spiked more recently over the way he belittled her son  Jeb  when the New York businessman and the former Florida governor competed for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination  Trump also had criticized other members of the Bush clan  including George W  Bush over starting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Page  the Washington bureau chief for USA Today  also reveals that Mrs  Bush blamed Trump for causing her  angst  during the 2016 election   she called it a  heart attack    and leading her to question whether she was still a Republican  Asked in the months before she died whether she still considered herself a Republican  Mrs  Bush answered   I d probably say no today  The book  based also on five interviews Page conducted with Mrs  Bush  is due in bookstores Tuesday  It comes nearly a year after the passing of the second woman in U S  history to be the wife of one president and the mother of another The former first lady had drafted a tongue in cheek letter to send after the November 2016 election welcoming former President Bill Clinton to the club of first spouses  Clinton s wife  Hillary Clinton  was the Democratic candidate  and Mrs  Bush thought  as did many voters  that she would be the next president The letter never saw a mailbox  She woke up the morning after the election  and discovered  to my horror  that Trump had won  Weeks later  however  she wrote to Melania Trump  At the time  Mrs  Trump was the subject of intense speculation over whether she would relocate to the White House from her family s penthouse at New York s Trump Tower  Mrs  Bush encouraged the incoming first lady to do what was best for her and for the couple s young son  Barron  Mrs  Trump attended her predecessor s funeral Until the day she died  Mrs  Bush also kept on her bedside table a red  white and blue digital clock  given to her as a joke  that counted down to the end of Trump s term Mrs  Bush  who had been living in constant pain  fell and broke her back shortly before she died  In the hospital  after receiving the news that she was dying  she asked her doctor to keep it a secret  Once back at her Houston home  receiving only palliative care  she sat in the den holding hands with her husband of 73 years  They had the longest presidential marriage in U S  history He gave  Bar   as he called her  permission to die  and she gave her then 93 year old husband permission to live Then they each had a drink  bourbon for Mrs  Bush  a vodka martini for the former president She died two days later

JERUSALEM   An Israeli watchdog group said Monday that it found a network of social media bots disseminating messages in support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of next week s elections Noam Rotem and Yuval Adam  two researchers operating the Big Bots Project  said in a report that they uncovered hundreds of fake accounts spreading messages in support of Netanyahu s Likud party and smearing his opponents  Likud denied the allegations Adam said his project discovered a network that included a number of real people  along with hundreds of Twitter accounts that appeared to be fake or duplicate  One person might be operating tens or hundreds of accounts at the same time   he told The Associated Press   All these accounts are pushing their political agenda  not only that but also inciting hate speech  attacking very specific people who are opposed to their political agenda  He said this appeared to be a violation of Twitter s terms of use  He said the findings had been forwarded to Twitter in hopes of deactivating the fake accounts  Twitter declined comment Adam said the Big Bots Project was financed through a crowdfunding program  The project also includes researchers from Ben Gurion University s Cyber Research Center and Tel Aviv University Israelis head to the polls in eight days in a close race between Netanyahu and his main rival  former army chief of staff Benny Gantz  Netanyahu is seeking a fifth term in office under the shadow of corruption charges The campaign has focused largely on personal attacks between the two front runners  with Gantz taking aim at Netanyahu s alleged ethical lapses  and Netanyahu painting Gantz as a weak  leftist   The prime minister s Likud Party has also tried to portray Gantz as being mentally unstable Rotem and Adam said they found no direct link between the network and Netanyahu or Likud  But Netanyahu s son Yair  who has run into trouble in the past for controversial social media activity  has frequently liked posts by the network s accounts They said it was unclear who was operating the network  The report said the network had relayed tens of thousands of tweets and garnered over 2 5 million engagements Many of the accounts in the network were largely inactive before elections were announced in December  Since then  these users have tweeted frequently and exclusively about the Likud party and against its opponents  Adam said The report found a huge spike in activity during the first few months of the year compared to the same period in 2018  for example  March 2019 had 13 2 times more average activity than in the same month last year One of the most active Twitter accounts mentioned in the report became private shortly after the 34 page document was published  Adam said At a press conference convened to address the issue  Netanyahu dismissed the report sarcastically as an April Fool s Day prank  He called it a  false libel  by the media based on a  fake investigation   Almost all of the examples  perhaps all of them  turned out to be real people  They have a name  they have a face  they have families  and the worst thing  they have opinions of their own  Independent people   Netanyahu said   Not one of them is fake  One Twitter user named in the report  Ziv Knobler  said in an interview with Israel s Army Radio that  there is nothing organized  We are a group of people who believe in the way of Benjamin Netanyahu   We expressed personal opinions  not on behalf of an organization   Knobler said   We have absolutely no connection to the Likud party  After the Big Bots Project s report headlined Monday s edition of Hebrew daily Yedioth Ahronoth  Gantz s Blue and White party wrote on Twitter that  Netanyahu is trying to steal the elections  and called for a police investigation to determine the network s funding Last month  news broke that Gantz s personal telephone was infiltrated by Iranian hackers  While Gantz contends no sensitive information was compromised  Netanyahu leveraged the breach to argue that Gantz was unprepared to lead the country  

TEL AVIV   An Israeli watchdog group has found a network of hundreds of social media accounts  many of them fake  used to smear opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in next week s election and to amplify the messages of his Likud party  according to a report to be released Monday The messages posted on the network s Twitter and Facebook accounts are frequently reposted by prominent Likud campaign officials and by the prime minister s son  Yair Netanyahu  the report says The watchdog group  the Big Bots Project  an independent organization that aims to expose the malicious use of social media  found no direct links between the network and Mr  Netanyahu  his party or his son  but said it appeared to operate in coordination with the party and Mr  Netanyahu s re election campaign  The network operates through manipulations  slander  lies and spreading rumors   the report said   On its busiest days  the network sends out thousands of tweets a day  The network s activity has intensified almost fivefold since the election was called in December  the report said  and  is mobilized at climactic moments for Netanyahu  such as the announcement of the indictment against him  The report says the network may violate Israeli laws pertaining to elections  campaign finance  privacy and taxation A spokesman for the Likud party said that it did not run a network of fake accounts   All of the Likud s digital activity is entirely authentic and is based on the great support of the citizens of Israel for Prime Minister Netanyahu and the great achievements of the Likud   the spokesman  Jonathan Urich  said on Sunday Mr  Netanyahu  who is facing an indictment on corruption charges  is in a tight race for what he hopes will be his fourth consecutive term  He is facing a strong challenge from Benny Gantz  a retired army chief  in the April 9 election According to the report  154 of the accounts in the network use fake names and another 400 accounts are suspected of being fake  The accounts appear to be operated by people  not bots  making them much harder to detect  the report says  Their posts  all in Hebrew  have had over 2 5 million hits  the report s authors estimate  in a country with 8 7 million citizens ImageBenny Gantz at a campaign rally in Tel Aviv CreditAbir Sultan EPA  via ShutterstockThe report was written by Noam Rotem and Yuval Adam  founders of the Big Bots Project  They were assisted by the Israeli Alliance  a liberal leaning organization  and their investigation was financed through an Israeli online crowdfunding site  Drove The New York Times and the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot received advance copies of the report One of the accounts is under the name  Moshe   whose handsome profile picture actually belongs to the Greek model Theo Theodoridis  Moshe  whose posts praise Mr  Netanyahu and excoriate his rivals  tweeted only 16 times during the first three months of 2018  By contrast  during the first three months of this year  with the election campaign underway  he tweeted 2 856 times The members of the network work in sync with each other  the report says  When one posted the false rumor that Mr  Gantz was a rapist  many of the others reposted it  On Thursday  many of the members almost simultaneously began tweeting that Mr  Gantz was mentally ill  echoing a video clip distributed by the Likud campaign As Mr  Gantz became Mr  Netanyahu s chief rival  the network focused more on him  The network s activity has often spiked at times of key political events The evening before the attorney general announced his decision to indict Mr  Netanyahu  the network circulated a Facebook post by an American woman saying that Mr  Gantz had sexually harassed her when they were in high school Mr  Gantz denied the accusation  and no support for it has been forthcoming  but the fabricated accounts pushed the story with tweets like   Gantz the rapist to jail  and  Lousy scum rapist  Items posted by the network have also described Mr  Gantz  somewhat incongruously  as being gay and having a mistress The network has also attacked the attorney general  Avichai Mandelblit  echoing Mr  Netanyahu s assertion that by seeking to indict the prime minister the attorney general had  surrendered to the media and the left  All accounts in the network are linked to that of a real person  Yitzhak Haddad  a resident of Ashdod The report cites a YouTube channel to which Mr  Haddad is an active subscriber  which has a message offering workers cash in exchange for  responding on Facebook and on the internet with political messages  ImageThe fake social media network s messages have been redistributed by prominent figures like Yair Netanyahu  shown here with his father CreditThomas Coex Agence France Presse   Getty Images You just get political messages and you post them   the message said It was not clear if the message was linked to the fake social network or whether Mr  Haddad ran the network When asked about the network on Sunday  Mr  Haddad said it was  all lies  He declined to confirm or deny that he was the person behind the Twitter account bearing his picture and email address  his connections with Likud  or his relationship to the YouTube channel recruiting workers for the election campaign In a later text message  Mr  Haddad wrote   There is absolutely nothing in this  Anyone publishing this nonsense can expect a very large lawsuit   You have no right to gag people on the right or on the left  period   he added   and the organization that is busy identifying accounts  who are they at all to decide for the open and free world  Mr  Urich  the Likud party spokesman  said that he did not know Mr  Haddad  and that Mr  Haddad was not employed by the Likud party and had no connection with Likud The network s messages have been redistributed by prominent figures in the Likud campaign team  Yair Netanyahu  an unofficial adviser to his father s campaign  has retweeted the network s members 154 times  the report said  Similarly  the network  liked  and replied to his messages 1 481 times  and shared his messages 429 times Yair Netanyahu did not reply to a request for comment  Mr  Urich  speaking on his behalf  said   Yair Netanyahu has no role in the Likud campaign  does not know the people of the network and is not involved in its activities  if any  Some of the tweets that include curse words and anti Arab slurs are written using numbers that look like letters in the Hebrew alphabet  apparently so that a Twitter audit would not identify them as inappropriate and shut down the account There have been efforts to update Israeli election law to cover relatively recent developments in social media  After the work of a special panel headed by a former Supreme Court chief justice  Dorit Beinisch  an amendment to the law was proposed to cover social media The Likud party opposed the amendment and it did not pass Karine Nahon  president of the Israel Internet Association  who was a member of the Beinish panel  said   We made a great effort to submit the recommendations as soon as possible so that legislation could already be enacted in the coming elections  But when a first reading bill was about to be voted on  the Likud decided in the middle of the night to remove it from the agenda   

ISTANBUL ANKARA   President Tayyip Erdogan s AK Party has submitted objections to local election results in all districts of Istanbul and Ankara  party officials said on Tuesday  after results showed the opposition earned narrow victories in both cities The AK Party is on track to lose control of what are Turkey s two biggest cities  its commercial hub of Istanbul and the capital Ankara  in a surprise election setback that may complicate Erdogan s plans to combat recession In Istanbul  the mayoral candidate of the main opposition Republican People s Party  CHP   Ekrem Imamoglu  and his AKP rival  ex prime minister Binali Yildirim  both said on Monday Imamoglu was around 25 000 votes ahead  Istanbul has an estimated total population of 15 million The AKP had previously said it would use its right to object to the results where there were voting irregularities  adding that the errors at the ballots had affected the outcome On Tuesday  Bayram Senocak  the AKP s Istanbul head said that objections had been submitted by the 3 p m   1200 GMT  deadline for appeals  and added that legal action would be taken against electoral officials who made the errors  We have submitted all our appeals to the district electoral councils   Senocak said  as he waved ballot records in which he said vote count irregularities could be seen An AKP deputy chairman later said the difference between Imamoglu and Yildirim was down to 20 509 votes and would keep falling as a result of their appeals  He said the elections were  the biggest blemish in Turkish democratic history  The CHP s Istanbul head Canan Kaftancioglu said her party submitted objections in 22 districts  adding they expected to receive 4 960 more votes after the appeals were resolved  They are trying to steal the will of the people as it was reflected in the ballots   she told reporters in Istanbul The CHP s Imamoglu said on Tuesday he was saddened by the AKP failure to congratulate him after the election board count put him ahead  I m watching Mr Binali Yildirim with regret  You were a minister of this nation  the parliament speaker and a prime minister   Imamoglu said in Istanbul   What could be more noble than congratulating   The world is watching us with shame right now  We are ready to manage the big city of Istanbul  Let go and congratulate us with honor  so we can do our job   he said  MOMENT OF BEGINNING Ahead of the elections  the CHP had formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi  Good  Party to rival that of the AKP and their nationalist MHP partners  The alliances nominated joint candidates in certain cities  including Ankara and Istanbul Imamoglu  who laid a wreath at the mausoleum of modern Turkey s founder  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk  in Ankara  later went to CHP headquarters to meet Mansur Yavas  the opposition s candidate in the capital  Speaking at the CHP building  Imamoglu said the elections marked a  moment of beginning  for Turkey In Ankara  Yavas received 50 9 percent of votes  ahead of his AKP rival and former minister Mehmet Ozhaseki in Sunday s local elections by nearly 4 percentage points  The AKP said it had also submitted objections to results across Ankara Defeats in Ankara and Istanbul would be a significant setback for Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics for more than 16 years  He had campaigned relentlessly ahead of the vote  describing it as a  matter of survival  for the country Erdogan s political success has rested on years of stellar economic growth in Turkey  but an economic recession that has brought surging inflation and unemployment and a plunging lira currency have taken their toll on his popularity Uncertainty generated by the local elections has added to pressure on the lira  which weakened sharply last week as a lack of confidence in the currency among Turks led them to snap up record holdings of dollars and gold On Tuesday the lira weakened more than 2 percent against the dollar on concerns about tensions with the United States after it halted delivery to Turkey of equipment related to the F 35 fighter aircraft   Reporting by Ezgi Erkoyun and by Tuvan Gumrukcu  Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay  Writing by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Daren Butler  Editing by Dominic Evans  Gareth Jones  William Maclean  

Forty years after the 1979 revolution  Islamism is exhausting itself as a legitimizing force for the Islamic Republic of Iran  Studies sponsored by the Iranian government show that resentment toward the state s religious symbols is at an all time high  According to the research arm of the Iranian parliament  around 70 percent of Iranian women do not strictly follow the official diktats for wearing a veil  Anticlerical sentiments have turned violent  Regardless of their ties to the government  clerics are routinely attacked and stabbed in the streets by angry anti regime individuals Iran is responding by cautiously downplaying Islamism and emphasizing nationalism and foreign threats to win over disgruntled citizens  Iran s leaders acknowledged the societal shift away from Islamism by making unprecedented references to nationalism and showing their determination to incorporate patriotic sentiments into the state ideology during the 40th anniversary celebrations of the revolution in February Iran s supreme leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  has repeatedly appealed to Iranians to back the government  even if they do not endorse its Islamist ideology  for the sake of their country and for their own security The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  which was established to preserve the Islamic Republic and the ideals of the 1979 revolution  now portrays itself as the guardian of the nation and the symbol of Iranian power against foreign aggression  Images of the ancient Persepolis ruins and references to the pre Islamic Persian past have become omnipresent in the state controlled media The change in government strategy came as Iranians demonstrated a new yearning for nationalism  challenging the self proclaimed religious political system  Impromptu grass roots gatherings at the Tomb of Cyrus  the founder of the Persian Empire known for his tolerance toward conquered nations and other religions  surprised observers and prompted crackdowns by security forces Iranian leadership s anti Americanism is increasingly at odds with the Iranian people s long held desire for an end to their international isolation  People have openly rallied against the regime s use of religion  anti Americanism and its support of the Syrian government and proxy groups at the expense of their well being  During countrywide protests in 2018  many Iranians shouted   Let go of Syria  think about us  Popular pressure also played an important role in getting Iran to sign the 2015 nuclear deal  Iranians hoped that the deal would be a step toward forcing the regime to further open up to the world  In his book  National Security and Nuclear Diplomacy   President Hassan Rouhani acknowledges that the leadership paid close attention to the government s classified public surveys before making critical decisions with regard to the nuclear program Iran s supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guards commanders made no secret about their reluctance to accept the deal and what could follow  In his campaign for re election in 2017  Mr  Rouhani promised that after securing the nuclear deal  he would resolve other outstanding issues  implying establishing relations with the United States The election of Donald Trump  followed by his withdrawal from the nuclear deal and renewed American sanctions against Iran  has brought Mr  Rouhani s reformist momentum to a halt  Instead  a sense of betrayal by the United States and of a threat to the country s territorial integrity appears to be emerging among Iranians Iranian hard liners have sensed the beginning of a change in the popular mood  Two weeks ago  Kayhan  a daily newspaper known for its close ties to the supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guards  declared  The End of the Western Illusion  as  the greatest achievement  of the last Persian year  which ended on March 20  Iranian elites who once galvanized society and received votes with the promise of better relations with the United States now simply repeat the angry anti American rhetoric of their conservative rivals These days  Javad Zarif  Iran s once smiling foreign minister and the chief nuclear negotiator  sounds more like the former hard line president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  Even Ali Akbar Salehi  the M I T  educated head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and nuclear negotiator  recently said that everyone from the proponents to the opponents of the regime  and from the revolutionaries to the anti revolutionaries have come to believe that the United States is our enemy  In taking away Iran s nuclear leverage  reimposing the sanctions and heavily arming its regional rivals  the United States has intensified anxieties about national security in the republic  Consequently  a national security discourse that brings the elites and the masses together is being constructed  and the Trump administration is providing credibility for it The Islamic Republic of Iran has survived not just because of its security apparatus but also because its leaders have been able to manage public sentiments and intra elite conflicts  And Iran s leaders have found that President Trump s hostility toward Iran is helping to rally otherwise resentful citizens behind the regime and create a new cohesive Islamist nationalist ideology This could have a demobilizing effect on Iran s underground but still vibrant civil society and further boost the Revolutionary Guards  influence over foreign policy  There is less and less popular and elite opposition to Mr  Khamenei s claim that if the Revolutionary Guards did not fight terrorists in Damascus  it would be fighting them in Tehran  It is likely that many will consider investment in the regime an investment in their own and their homeland s security  What was once considered regime security is increasingly seen as national security For four decades  the American and Iranian governments have simultaneously pursued a system of reward and punishment against Iranian citizens for opposite goals  Washington has hoped to foment public uprisings leading to regime change  Tehran has sought compliance and regime durability Sanctions and isolation together with regime repression have often bred popular discontent  turning elections into political movements  and students and women into courageous protesters  Tapping into these sentiments  President Barack Obama conditioned better opportunities for the nation on a nuclear agreement in his messages on Nowruz  the Persian New Year  President Trump set a new bar for Iranian citizens in his Nowruz message on March 20  regime change Washington s unreliable policy toward Iran is jeopardizing the Iranian people s favorable view of the United States  Sanctions may have passed their optimal point of channeling public grievances against the regime  beyond which they only alienate Iranian citizens from the United States  The statements of American officials that they target the Iranian regime and not the people are a bad joke  To ordinary Iranians  they are targeting the people American policies are effectively empowering the hard liners and pushing Iranian citizens toward the regime  Exhausted by 40 years of state repression and international pressure  Iranian citizens may very well shift their anger from sponsors of the former to the latter and signal a reluctant preference for those who wear the garb of Persian nationalism and national security Mohammad Ayatollahi Tabaar  an associate professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A M University  is

SAN SALVADOR  El Salvador   Government officials  aid workers and activists in Central America are mystified by U S  President Donald Trump s threat to cut off nearly  500 million in aid to Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador in response to what he calls an immigration crisis  Over time  they say  it will only worsen the problem At risk of falling on the chopping block are development programs that work to tackle the root causes driving migration  poverty  inequality  violence and corruption  These include outreach to at risk youth to combat forced gang recruitment as well as programs to address gender based violence and support education  workforce development and the uphill fight to root out endemic graft  It s illogical and it s irresponsible      You re talking about long term challenges that are going to require long term  sustainable solutions   said Adriana Beltrán  a Central America specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America   So rather than helping to stabilize the situation and try to address these long term challenges  the cut in assistance will only make the situation worse   Gutting important programs   she added   will eventually lead to more migration  more insecurity  more corruption  more impunity in these countries  It s still not clear exactly what  when or how much could be cut Trump said last week that  we were paying them tremendous amounts of money and we re not paying them anymore because they haven t done a thing for us   and mentioned a figure of  500 million State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said Tuesday that the amount affected by any aid cut would be  450 million from fiscal year 2018 as well as an as yet undetermined amount from 2017  The president has made clear that the decision is aimed at securing the United States borders and protecting American citizens   Palladino said   These programs have not effectively prevented illegal immigration from coming to the United States  and they ve not achieved the desired results  The aid is meant to promote democracy building  good governance  trade  agriculture  education  health  public safety and law enforcement  Experts say all of those areas play a direct role in whether people feel they can get by or even survive in their home countries Reaction from the three governments has been muted so far  perhaps for fear of angering Trump Both Honduras and El Salvador pointedly said they had not been formally notified of any specific cuts in U S  aid  Honduran Defense Minister Fredy Díaz said cooperation with the United States on security is  unchanged   while the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the relationship has been  solid  close and positive  Salvadoran Vice President Oscar Ortiz said Tuesday that an aid cut would not solve the migration problem but have the opposite effect   The best way to tackle the issue of migration     is not with this type of decision   he said   The best way to tackle the issue is to keep working together  Guatemala  the source of much of the recent migration from the region  was particularly circumspect  with presidential spokesman Alfredo Brito saying simply that the official response was not to comment for the time being But those carrying out the boots on the ground work are concerned Rick Jones  who works in El Salvador as the youth and migration policy adviser for Catholic Relief Services  counsels young people to keep them out of gangs and help them get jobs  He also runs behavioral therapy for inmates to deter them from returning to crime   all things that have  a positive impact to help guys think about and change their behavior   he said It s seen as unglamorous but badly needed work  especially in a place like El Salvador  which has a homicide rate that is among the world s highest at more than 50 per 100 000 people last year But all  38 million that Catholic Relief Services gets from U S  government agencies to run programs in the three countries   including ones on education and jobs   could disappear if the cutoff goes through If that happens   it will be sending the message   Help is not on the way     and you re going to be left on your own    Jones said   And basically people left on their own are going to be more desperate and more people are going to leave  Likewise  Vicki Gass  Oxfam America senior policy adviser for Central America and Mexico  said that axing funding for programs that have been running for years  would  in many cases   waste U S  taxpayer dollars that have already been invested  and  foster the same instability that is making people flee in the first place  Some government programs aimed at persuading Central Americans not to emigrate have been put in place  in part in response to Trump s earlier criticism about the migrant caravans that brought thousands trekking toward the U S  border  and the threatened aid cutoff does not take that into account  officials say  This goes against what we have seen in reports that show there have really been some decreases in migration  and that they are the result of the efforts being made on this issue   said lawmaker Yanci Urbina of the left leaning FMLN party in El Salvador  the least populated of the three countries and a distant third in terms of how many migrants are heading for the U S Salvadoran Treasury Minister Nelson Fuentes said U S  aid in his country includes  20 million in technical and fiscal funding over five years  and the government has not gotten word of any cuts  Another  200 million to spur growth and employment is managed in tandem with the World Bank  and it remains to be seen whether this will be reduced  Finally there are direct donations from Washington to the Salvadoran government and private organizations Fuentes said aid for security and migration could be affected  but that actively funded contracts should not be In Guatemala  the most significant aid comes in security assistance to fight drug trafficking   and that has already come under scrutiny recently over questionable use of armored vehicles donated by Washington  Other funds through USAID go to help programs on things like agriculture and education in poor rural communities  plus training for prosecutors  who have waged a high profile fight against corruption in recent years  or for judges Honduran political analyst Omar García called U S  aid to his country  vital  and said the threatened cuts show that Washington is  an unreliable ally for Honduras  Like Guatemala  Honduras has backed the Trump administration on key issues such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital and on the political crisis in Venezuela  It remains to be seen whether such support could waver  A sense of nationalism is surging in this country     and that could be a good thing   García said Beltrán noted that most of the assistance now in jeopardy does not go directly to the three countries  governments but to agencies  NGOs  church groups and others She predicted that an attempt to cut aid could face pushback in Congress if funds are reprogrammed without lawmakers  consent  Particularly in the Democratic controlled House of Representatives  members and committees could try to place holds on money in the next funding bill  she said  It is going to ensue into a battle   Beltrán said   because it is Congress that at the end of the day has the power of the purse     Associated Press writers Sonia Perez D  in Guatemala City  Freddy Cuevas in Tegucigalpa  Honduras  Matthew Lee in Washington and Mark Stevenson and Peter

PUERTO ORDAZ  Venezuela   A pro government lawmaking body installed by President Nicolas Maduro voted on Tuesday to strip the opposition leader Juan Guaidó of parliamentary immunity  paving the way for his potential arrest The move by the Constituent Assembly represents the government s latest effort to raise the pressure on Mr  Guaidó  who declared himself interim president in January in the biggest challenge that Mr  Maduro has faced in six years in office In recent weeks  the government has barred Mr  Guaidó from traveling  frozen his bank accounts  begun investigating him on terrorism accusations  and prohibited him from running for office But thus far the government has stopped short of detaining Mr  Guaidó  The United States has repeatedly said that any attack on Mr  Guaidó would draw a severe reaction Mr  Guaidó has brushed off legal challenges from the government in the past  going so far as touring South American capitals despite the travel ban  The opposition does not recognize the Constituent Assembly  a sort of parallel congress created by Mr  Maduro two years ago as a means of circumventing the opposition controlled National Assembly  The regime believes that by attacking me  they will stop us   Mr  Guaidó told supporters outside his house on Tuesday night   There s no way back in this process  Venezuela s intensifying political battle is unfolding amid an electrical crisis that has led to almost daily blackouts in most major cities since early March  Lights went off in parts of the capital  Caracas  minutes after the Constituent Assembly s vote On Tuesday the government announced that it would introduce national power rationing in peak hours until further notice

LONDON   For all the Brexit tumult  one thing that has remained strong and stable    to borrow a phrase Prime Minister Theresa May once used to describe her leadership    is demand for British government debt  Political crises have pushed up borrowing costs in euro zone countries such as Greece and Italy in recent years In Britain  Parliament has rejected May s divorce deal three times and failed to back an alternative  risking a chaotic no deal Brexit as soon as April 12  although May on Tuesday announced cross party talks to break the impasse But interest rates on Britain s roughly 1 5 trillion pounds   2 0 trillion  of government bonds  known as gilts  have fallen  The main reason is that gilts  representing one of the world s major government bond markets  are influenced mostly by the ebbs and flows of the global economy and financial markets But other factors are at work too Below is a look at some of the reasons for the strong demand for gilts in the face of Britain s political chaos GLOBAL SLOWDOWNThe central banks of the United States and the euro zone recently rowed back on their plans to remove the stimulus they have been providing since the global financial crisis  reflecting worries about a slowdown in the global economy  This has been a major factor in driving gilt yields lower and they have fallen this year in step with those of other major government bonds across the Group of Seven rich countries For a graphic on G7 benchmark 10 year government bond yields  see   https   tmsnrt rs 2CRlp8T Last week the 10 year gilt yield fell below 1 percent for the first time in 18 months  although it rebounded to 1 07 percent on Wednesday as investors judged May s latest plan as likely to cut the risk of a no deal Brexit STILL A SAFE HAVENBritish government bonds retain high credit ratings even after losing their top notch triple A grades as Britain s economy and public finances struggled to recover from effects of last decade s global financial crisis  Part of gilts  appeal is Britain s track record  stretching back hundreds of years  of not defaulting on its debt  bolstered by the fact it issues its own currency  Although British government debt levels rocketed in the aftermath of the crisis  gilts are still regarded by investors as a safe place to store money when the going gets tough  Ultimately  there s someone always willing to buy the debt  unless you make a complete hash of it    we re talking the Venezuela  Turkey arena   said Marc Ostwald  chief economist at ADM Investor Services BIG DOMESTIC OWNERSHIPBritish domestic investors like pension funds and insurance firms  plus the Bank of England  account for the vast majority of gilt holdings  cutting the risk that a sell off from foreign owners of gilts would wreak havoc in the market  Foreign owners accounted for 25 percent of British government debt securities in 2017  compared with 30 percent in Italy and 47 percent in France  according to Eurostat data LONG IN THE TOOTHWhen a government bond matures  meaning the government repays bondholders what they have lent it  they have an opportunity to move their money elsewhere if they choose  The average maturity for gilts is much longer than for equivalent European government bonds  meaning investors have fewer opportunities to move out of British debt    another factor that adds to the relative stability of gilts  The average maturity for British bonds is 14 9 years  compared with 7 5 in France  6 9 in Italy  and 6 3 in Germany  according to European Central Bank data BREXIT EFFECT  LOOK TO THE FTSEGilts  current strength also probably reflects the relatively poor performance of the British stock market  which along with the pound has borne the brunt of shifts in investor appetite in response to Brexit developments  Although the FTSE 100 is up 10 percent year to date  it is vying with Spain s IBEX as the worst performer among the major European bourses in 2019 Some of the money that could have sent British stocks higher probably found its way into gilts   People say  what about Brexit    but investors say  where else am I meant to invest my money    Ostwald said  For a graphic on Performance of European stock markets in year to date  see   https   tmsnrt rs 2CSg4OK   Reporting by Andy Bruce  Editing by Catherine Evans

CANBERRA   Australia s conservative government said on Monday it will increase spending on rural infrastructure by nearly 30 percent in its last budget before an election next month Speaking a day before the presentation of the annual budget for the year beginning on July 1  Prime Minister Scott Morrison said spending on rural roads will increase to A 4 5 billion   3 20 billion  from the A 3 5 billion it promised last year Morrison denied the extra funding was motivated by the election  saying it formed part of the government s strategy of decentralization  We are committed to the satellite cities approach   Morrison told reporters in Canberra   We ve made investments of tens of millions of dollars in supporting our communities to grow together  not grow apart   The spending increase was seen by analysts as a pitch to voters in rural areas   a key voter base for the National Party of Australia  the junior partner in the coalition government  The state election in New South Wales  NSW  showed the Nationals are hemorrhaging support so the government is throwing money at their weak link   said Peter Chen  professor of political science  University of Sydney While NSW  Australia s most populous state  returned Morrison s Liberal Party to power last month  the Nationals lost several seats to the right wing  Shooters Fishers and Farmers party There are strong expectations that the budget will increase overall spending substantially  although Morrison has promised earlier that the government s finances would show its first fiscal surplus since 2007 2008 In recent days the government also confirmed the budget will include a one off cash rebate to elderly Australians  another key voter demographic for the coalition Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said elderly voters will receive A 75 for an individual or A 125 for couples   to help cover their next energy bills   Reporting by Colin Packham  Editing by Simon Cameron Moore  

Good morning  Here s the sign up  if you don t already get California Today by email  The decision last month not to prosecute the police officers who shot and killed Stephon Clark has added renewed urgency to the debate over police shootings in this state  And the state s lawmakers have plunged in headfirst this year with a pair of dueling bills to help deal with the issue Both aim to reduce the number of police shootings  but they come from opposite perspectives  One  Assembly Bill 392  would make it easier to criminally prosecute officers who use deadly force  and is supported by the A C L U  and the family of a victim  Oscar Grant III The other  Senate Bill 230  would require law enforcement agencies to clearly set use of force policies and boost de escalation training for officers  It s backed by police unions Laurel Rosenhall  a reporter for the nonprofit state news site CALMatters  will be tracking the issue in a new podcast called  Force of Law   I talked to her about what she s learned and what the podcast hopes to accomplish   Our conversation has been edited and condensed  Jill Cowan  Why did you and CALMatters decide to tackle this in a podcast form  Laurel Rosenhall  This is a huge issue in the Legislature because it s become a huge issue in so many communities around California  And the death of Stephon Clark in Sacramento really propelled it onto the front burner for the Legislature in a way that earlier shootings hadn t done It s extremely emotional and perceived as a life or death issue by both sides  And that gets to your question about why we re doing a podcast  You know the emotion of that comes through in a podcast in a way that is different than on the printed page  And we re really conceiving of this as a project that goes from now through October when the governor has to decide on all the bills that reach his desk  Tell me about what it is in California s political climate that s giving rise to this particular debate here Obviously having a huge Democratic majority in the Legislature  which is around 75 percent right now  plus having a new governor who has a track record of taking groundbreaking and risky moves that ended up panning out well for him   I think those are definitely big factors in terms of the political landscape But I also think there are factors outside of politics that have led to this moment It s been a sea change on this issue in the last decade largely because of technological changes and between the rise of social media cellphone videos and police body cameras  And so there s just like a broader societal swell And then the death of Stephon Clark   because it happened in Sacramento about 10 miles away from the state capitol   seems to have made an impact in ways that other police

TORONTO   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ousted Canada s former attorney general and another ex minister from the Liberal party caucus Tuesday amid a scandal that has rocked his government in an election year Trudeau cited repeated questioning of his leadership as well as the fact that former attorney general Jody Wilson Raybould publicized a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick  Canada s top civil servant Trudeau called that  unconscionable  Trudeau also ousted Jane Philpott  a former Cabinet minister who stepped down from her role after she said she lost confidence in how the government has handled the affair Both Wilson Raybould and Philpott had remained as members of Trudeau s party in Parliament after resigning from Cabinet but kept making remarks that damaged the prime minister and the party The two were two high profile women ministers in Trudeau s Cabinet  half of which are women  Wilson Raybould was Canada s first indigenous justice minister Trudeau and Liberal lawmakers met Tuesday evening to discuss Wilson Raybould and Philpott Wilson Raybould tweeted that Trudeau had removed her and she will not be a Liberal candidate in the fall election  What I can say is that I hold my head high   that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles   values that must always transcend party   she tweeted   I have no regrets  I spoke truth as I will continue to do  Wilson Raybould believes she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to veterans  affairs minister in January because she didn t give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company accused of bribing officials in Libya That potential solution would avoid a potential criminal conviction that would bar engineering giant SNC Lavalin from receiving any federal government business for a decade  The company is a major employer with 9 000 employees in Canada and more than 50 000 worldwide The scandal has led to multiple resignations  including Gerry Butts  Trudeau s top aide and best friend  And it has damaged the party for eight weeks In a letter released earlier Tuesday  Wilson Raybould pleaded with her colleagues to remain and acknowledged they are enraged but said she was  trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess   Now I know many of you are angry  hurt  and frustrated  And frankly so am I  and I can only speak for myself  I am angry  hurt  and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to   Wilson Raybould wrote to colleagues earlier Tuesday Trudeau has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb  7 via sources that Trudeau s staff put pressure on Wilson Raybould  She denied she was the source of the story  writing  I am not the one who made it public  The secret recording Wilson Raybould made public shows Wernick telling Wilson Raybould that Trudeau  is determined  quite firm  in finding a way to avoid a prosecution that could put 9 000 jobs at risk It also reveals Wilson Raybould saying she regards the pressure as  inappropriate  Philpott said neither she nor Wilson Raybould initiated the crisis now facing Trudeau and the party  Rather than acknowledge the obvious   that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision   and apologize for what occurred  a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious   to attack Jody Wilson Raybould s credibility and attempt to blame her   Philpott said in posting on social media  That approach now appears to be focused on whether Jody Wilson Raybould should have audiotaped the Clerk instead of the circumstances that prompted Jody Wilson Raybould to feel compelled to do so  Wilson Raybould has refused to express support for Trudeau for weeks  a demand many Liberal lawmakers said was necessary if she was to remain in Parliament as part of the party caucusTrudeau said past civil wars within the Liberal party damaged the party  The team has to trust each other  With Jody Wilson Raybould and Jane Philpott that trust has been broken  Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided   Trudeau said to a loud ovation in caucus Nelson Wiseman  a political science professor at the University of Toronto  said Wilson Raybould is angling to eventually replace Trudeau  Her letter  I believe  sets the stage for her run at the Liberal leadership if the Liberals lose in October and Justin Trudeau steps down   Wiseman said  She is a victim of the parliamentary system which in Canada imposes sturdier party discipline than in any of the other Westminster parliamentary systems  The letter reveals her naiveté  as a rookie Member of Parliament  about how the system works   

Americans borrowed an estimated  88 billion over the last year to pay for health care  according to a survey released on Tuesday by Gallup and the nonprofit West Health The survey also found that one in four Americans have skipped treatment because of the cost  and that nearly half fear bankruptcy in the event of a health emergency There was a partisan divide when respondents were asked whether they believed that the American health care system is among the best in the world  Among Republicans  67 percent of respondents said they believed so  that number was 38 percent among Democrats But Democrats and Republicans had similar responses about putting off medical treatment  Asked if they had deferred treatment because of the cost  27 percent of Democrats said they had  compared with 21 percent of Republicans and 30 percent of independents  President Trump retreated on health care Tuesday  saying a G O P  plan would appear after the 2020 election   Respondents from across the political spectrum also reported pessimism about their leaders  abilities to reduce health care costs  About 70 percent of respondents said they had no confidence in their elected officials to bring prices down  And 77 percent said they were concerned that rising health care costs would damage the American economy  Our data shows an American public that s beaten down from this really serious issue   said Dan Witters  a senior researcher at Gallup At the same time  64 percent of respondents said they were mostly satisfied with their experiences in the health care system  When asked if they were satisfied with how well the system was serving Americans generally  only 39 percent said they were The survey s authors noted that Americans  feelings were complicated and at times conflicted  But one thing was clear  High health care costs had created significant anxiety The Best Health Care System in the World  Which One Would You Pick Assessing the systems in eight countries can inform the debate in the U S  over universal coverage Even among households earning  180 000 or more a year  a third of respondents said they were concerned about the specter of personal bankruptcy because of a health crisis   There has been fierce debate among researchers about the extent to which health care costs can be blamed for bankruptcies  Many American families earning less than that  of course  feel the effects of high health care costs acutely  They are forced to cut back on other expenses to pay for health care  or skip appointments and prescription refills  creating health risks down the road Twelve percent of respondents said they had borrowed money for care  including 11 percent of those with health insurance  who may still face high deductibles and other out of pocket expenses Most survey respondents said they believed that Americans were paying too much for health care relative to what they receive  Asked to choose between a hypothetical freeze in their health care costs or a 10 percent increase in household income  61 percent of respondents chose the freeze  Those in low income households were most likely to choose that option  When we re talking about health care and the debate right now  it usually bifurcates between the financial impact of health care or the health outcomes themselves   said Tim Lash  chief strategy officer for West Health  a nonpartisan nonprofit that aims to lower health care prices  But those two things intersect at access   which can have dire health consequences  he said The organization believes that Congress should allow Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies  that there should be more transparency about the prices of medicines and procedures  and that the health care industry should shift toward  value based care    in which doctors are paid based on patient outcomes   rather than the current  fee for service  model Mr  Lash noted that other wealthy countries spend much less on health care than the United States does  while achieving better outcomes in areas like life expectancy and infant mortality  Although about 87 percent of Americans have health insurance  according to data from Gallup  an individual s plan may not cover all costs associated with treatment President Trump  who has sought to undo the Affordable Care Act  tweeted about high deductibles under the law on Monday morning  promising that  Good things are going to happen   and tagging several Republican lawmakers The administration asked a federal appeals court to invalidate the law last week  while Democrats announced a health care bill that builds on the Affordable Care Act and seeks to lower premiums  among other goals The partnership between West Health and Gallup  the analytics and consulting company  was a first  The survey results are based on phone interviews conducted in English and Spanish in early 2019 with a random sample of 3 500 adults across the country  The margin of sampling error ranged from one to two percentage points for results based on the total sample  and three to five percentage points for results based on subgroups such as political identity or income level  so differences of less than those amounts are statistically insignificant Gallup and West Health said they would conduct similar surveys in the coming years  

A glamorous woman  dressed in jeans  a shirt and a vest  looks into the camera  Her full on Afro and styling are retro  a homage  perhaps  to 1970s Blaxploitation stars like Pam Grier and Tamara Dobson  But one telling detail  the high school yearbook she is holding  reminds us that the image is more than a fashion photograph  The school s location  Braddock  Pa   is the struggling hometown of the subject  LaToya Ruby Frazier Elia Alba photographed Ms  Frazier  an artist  on an ornate staircase at the Braddock Carnegie Library  Ms  Alba thinks the image alludes not to movie stars but to a political figure  Kathleen Cleaver of the Black Panther Party  In this context  the portrait honors Ms  Frazier as the  patron saint of Braddock   as Ms  Alba calls her   an activist photographer who uses art for social change  In  The Notion of Family   her 2014 book  for example  Ms  Frazier photographed her own family to document the decline of a once flourishing steel town and the lives of its residents  largely African American  beset by poverty  gentrification and discrimination Image The Braddonian  LaToya Ruby Frazier   2012  CreditElia AlbaImage The Explorer  Dawit L  Petros   2015

edited by Sara Reisman with George Bolster and Anjuli Nanda  which documents Ms  Alba s project  reimagining artists of color as A list celebrities Ms  Alba is influenced by art history  Afro futurist aesthetics and contemporary media  and her fantasy portraits echo spreads in Vogue  Harper s Bazaar and other glamour magazines   Fashion photography is fascinating to me due to its construction of image  the likeness is real time but it s completely hyper real with many elements of fantasy   she said in a recent interview  But Ms  Alba also acknowledged that mainstream publications have historically ignored or marginalized people of color and  still do Riffing on Vanity Fair s  Hollywood Issue   Ms  Alba assigns artists literary names that describe their philosophy  sensibility or reputation    The Alchemist   for example  or  The Oracle    and photographs them in environments reflective of their art  She designs costumes and either constructs sets or photographs her subjects on location  and she adopts the visual devices of posing and styling common to the publications that inspired her  But her interests transcend fashion  These portraits go beyond merely a record of the subject   she wrote in an artist s statement  and convey  a deeper meaning or vision of the sitter  through their art   Arnaldo Morales   The Machinist    for example  is posed against the machines and gadgets that inspire his futuristic sculptures  Maren Hassinger   The Spiritualist   appears as a dancing Orisha in the forest  echoing her themes of spirituality and nature  And a series of portraits represents artists who challenge conventional notions of masculinity  including Angel Otero   The Romantic    whose paintings recast the male body as sensual and vulnerable  and Kalup Linzy   The Star    sultry in drag as Marlene Dietrich Image The Dreamweaver  Chitra Ganesh   2013  CreditElia AlbaImage The Professor  Hank Willis Thomas   2014  CreditElia AlbaImage The Thespian  Wanda Raimundi Ortiz   2014  CreditElia AlbaMs  Alba s project also relates to the history of artists who use other artists as their subjects  At the height of the New York School in the 1950s and 1960s  for example  the photographer Hans Namuth made many such portraits  Much like Ms  Alba  his pictures were stylish and glamorous  displaying a sensibility rooted in his training with Alexey Brodovitch  the renowned art director of Harper s Bazaar  Typically depicting his subjects in their studios  Mr  Namuth described his photographic process as akin to  the feeling of being in a theater  of watching and directing   But his portraits  unlike those of  The Supper Club   were neither theatrical nor art directed While  The Supper Club  both perpetuates and challenges this legacy  it rejects one sensibility inherent to these projects  their view of the art world as largely white  It highlights the accomplishments of contemporary artists of color through work that also reflects the consequential issues engaged by their art  It does so not only through portraits but also a through series of dinners that Ms  Alba hosted   the  supper clubs  of the project s title   in which artists discussed the social  cultural and aesthetic issues reflected in their work and worldview Challenging the cliché of the artist as hermetic and socially insular  these dialogues explored the motivations and intentions of the participants as well as the impact of real life events and issues on their lives and art  In the end  Ms  Alba s project   which recasts the artist s portrait as a complex reflection of artists and their work   underscores the interplay among persona  politics and aesthetics in much contemporary art If the typical celebrity portrait aggrandizes its subject  the photographs in  The Supper Club  give artists of color a place of honor in a mainstream art world that continues to ignore  underestimate or play down their accomplishments  They honor these artists on multiple levels  as icons of originality and brilliance  as interpreters of a changing culture and society  and as role models for people long erased from the history of art  In the end  these vibrant portraits represent their subjects not simply as culturally expressive  but also as embodying the potential of a refreshed and relevant cultural world unencumbered by racism Image The Poet

KIEV  Ukraine   Ukraine s president was holding off a long time rival in a bid to claim the other spot in a runoff set for later this month  while a comic actor with no political experience was leading strongly in the election  according to results released Monday With nearly 97  of the polling stations counted  Volodymyr Zelenskiy had 30  support in Sunday s vote  while President Petro Poroshenko was a distant second with just under 16  of the vote Ex Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko trailed behind in third with 13  support The strong showing for the 41 year old Zelenskiy reflects the public longing for a fresh leader who has no links to Ukraine s corruption ridden political elite and can offer a new approach to settling the grinding five year conflict with Russia backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that has left 13 000 dead since 2014  This is only the first step toward a great victory   Zelenskiy said The top two candidates advance to a runoff on April 21  Final results are expected on Tuesday Zelenskiy dismissed suggestions that he could pool forces with Tymoshenko to get her voters in the second round in exchange for forming a coalition later  We aren t making any deals with anyone   he said   We are young people  We don t want to see all the past in our future  Like the character he plays in a TV comedy show  a schoolteacher turned president angry over corruption  Zelenskiy made fighting corruption a focus of his candidacy  He proposed a lifetime ban on holding public office for anyone convicted of graft  He also called for direct negotiations with Russia on ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine The election was marred by allegations of widespread vote buying  Police said they had received more than 2 100 complaints of violations on voting day alone in addition to hundreds of earlier voting fraud claims  including bribery attempts and removing ballots from polling stations Zelenskiy s headquarters alleged multiple voting and other cheating on the part of Poroshenko s campaign  but election officials said the vote took place without significant violations Election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe hailed Sunday s election as competitive and free  even though it criticized procedural violations and said there were indications that state resources were misused in the vote Poroshenko looked visibly relieved about surpassing Tymoshenko  It s a tough lesson for me and my team   he said   It s a reason for serious work to correct mistakes made over the past years  But Volodymyr Fesenko  head of the Penta Center Kiev based independent think tank  predicted that Zelenskiy will easily win the runoff  He doesn t even need to do anything  the current government already has done it  setting most voters against itself   Fesenko said   Poroshenko needs to prepare for a defeat and try to seek security guarantees for himself and his team  Poroshenko  53  a confectionery tycoon before he was elected five years ago  saw his approval ratings sink amid Ukraine s economic woes and a sharp plunge in living standards  Poroshenko campaigned on promises to defeat the Russian funded separatists in the east and to wrest back control of Crimea  the Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 The OSCE said about 5 million people have been taking off Ukraine s voter registry as the government was unable to organize the presidential vote in Crimea or in the separatist held east In Moscow  Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  refrained from commenting on Zelenskiy s strong performance  but indicated that the Kremlin would like to see a change of government  We would like to see not a party of war at the helm in Ukraine  but a party that aims at a gradual settlement in eastern Ukraine   he told reporters A military embezzlement scheme that allegedly involved top Poroshenko associates as well as a factory controlled by the president dogged Poroshenko before this election After the vote  Poroshenko lashed out at Zelenskiy  describing him as a  puppet  of self exiled billionaire businessman Igor Kolomoyskyi  a charge that Zelenskiy denies Zelenskiy shot back  saying mockingly that it s impossible to say whether a corrupt official allegedly involved in the military embezzlement scheme was Poroshenko s puppet  or the other way round Voters on Monday were ready for the presidential runoff  Poroshenko is taking the country forward   said Serhiy Poltorachenko  a bank employee   He made mistakes  but promised to correct them  Petro Demidchenko  a 38 year old office worker  was supporting the actor  We don t know what to expect from Zelenskiy  but over the past five years we have found out what to expect from Poroshenko   corruption  soaring prices  continuing war and poverty   he said    Mstyslav Chernov in Kiev  Ukraine  Vladimir Isachenkov and Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report

the government won t act urgently   then Parliament must step in    9 35 a m British Prime Minister Theresa May is set for a marathon session with her Cabinet as the government tries to find a way out of the Brexit crisis  after lawmakers again rejected all alternatives to her European Union withdrawal agreement The Cabinet is scheduled to meet for five hours Tuesday amid calls for compromise to prevent a potentially devastating no deal exit in just 10 days The government is pushing for a fourth vote on May s deal  with Education Secretary Damian Hinds saying the agreement already represents a compromise between all sides in the Brexit debate Hinds tells the BBC that the deal  is a good balance  and I hope colleagues can get behind it  Parliament on Monday rejected four alternatives  with proposals for a customs union failing by three votes    8 40 a m EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier says that Britain s exit from the European Union without a deal  becomes day after day more likely  after the U K  parliament again rejected alternatives to the government s unpopular divorce deal Despite the downbeat assessment  Barnier did say that  we can still hope to avoid it  through intensive work in London ahead of an April 10 summit  A no deal Brexit could come as soon two days after that Despite the difficulties of a chaotic exit   the EU will be able to manage   Barnier said  although he warned that  not everything will be smooth  Exit without a deal would affect trade and travel overnight  with new checks on borders and new regulations on dealings between Britain and the 27 remaining EU nations

CANBERRA   Australia s embattled government amended its annual budget on Wednesday  12 hours after it was unveiled  extending an energy rebate to the unemployed after criticism it s pre election budget failed to adequately help those without a job Prime Minister Scott Morrison s conservative government on Tuesday unveiled a 2019 20 budget ahead of an expected May election it is forecast to lose  promising a voter sweetener of  158 billion worth of tax cuts over the next 10 years The budget also contained a one off cash rebate for pensioners of A 75 for an individual and A 125 for couples to assist with rising energy costs  but those on unemployment benefits were excluded  Being told you aren t eligible for the same help with bills as others receiving income support is outrageous and must be remedied immediately   Ian Yates  chief of the Council on the Ageing  said in a statement on Tuesday Opinion polls suggest the government is facing a heavy defeat at the election  due in May but not yet called  and it is banking on the budget and tax cuts to woo voters In announcing the extension of the energy rebate  Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the move would cost about A 80 million   Last night  the prime minister  the finance minister and myself discussed the issue and we thought it was appropriate to extend it   Frydenberg said in a National Press Club speech on Wednesday Frydenberg did not specify why the rebate was extended Haydon Manning  a professor of political science at Flinders University in South Australia  said the move was aimed at deflecting criticism of the budget which will be a major campaign platform  The government needs clear air  particularly this week when voter attention is on them  They are so far behind in the polls  they can not afford to be seen as confused   said Manning An election must be held next month and there is speculation that Morrison could call it after parliament rises this week Morrison said in a television interview on Wednesday that he had yet to decide on a date  but he could choose from May 11  18 and 25   1    1 0000   Reporting by Colin Packham  Editing by Michael Perry  

Once more  President Trump stands ready to dazzle with his willingness to sacrifice the national interest on the altar of his political whims For days  the president has been indulging in one of his made for TV teasers by threatening to shut down the United States Mexico border  Not beef up the Border Patrol  Not tighten security at ports of entry  Just hang up a  Closed  sign and call it a day As the White House tells it  the failures of Mexico and congressional Democrats to stop illegal crossings have left the president no choice  The influx of drugs  criminals and other undesirables has reached the point where drastic action is required Mr  Trump is nothing if not a man of drastic action  or at least ominous vows of drastic action Dismayed critics have rushed to object that shutting the border will do nothing to solve the humanitarian strains caused by the flood of migrant families from Central America   that such a move will  in fact  make things only worse by disrupting the legal flow of people and commerce  wreaking social and economic havoc Such warnings are spot on  They also miss the point  In threatening to shut down the border  Mr  Trump isn t looking to solve a crisis  His primary aim is to make life unpleasant for those who have crossed him   or simply had the misfortune to get in his way In politics  as in life  there are Fixers and there are Punishers  Fixers shine a light on problems or injustices and work to find ways to resolve them  Theirs is a constructive vision  one that values cooperation and pragmatism and getting stuff done Punishers  too  are about spotlighting problems  a skill at which they may excel even more than Fixers  But Punishers aren t looking to make things right so much as to find someone to blame   and chasten   for the perceived wrongs Neither party holds a monopoly on either category  Charlie Baker  the Republican governor of Massachusetts  is a Fixer  Ilhan Omar  the freshman Democratic House member from Minnesota  is fast establishing herself as a Punisher  President Barack Obama was a Fixer  while the entire House Freedom Caucus sprang from the conviction that anyone willing to work with Mr  Obama should be cast into the abyss  Punished with extreme prejudice  as it were Punishers have their charms and their purpose  and whether you see them as avenging angels or vengeful demagogues often depends on whether you share their particular worldview  But every now and again  along comes a Punisher so wanton that he rattles even members of his own team  Mr  Trump is one of this rare breed The desire to crush those who displease him is a defining characteristic of this president  When challenged  his impulse is to lash out   preferably with personal  degrading insults  This has been on most vivid display with the myriad investigations into sketchy presidential behavior  but it also has been a hallmark of Mr  Trump s approach to key policy issues  Border security  health care  trade   you name the debate  Mr  Trump s answer is to stake out his position  vowing pain and regret for those who do not embrace it On Sunday  the acting White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  went on television to rub Democrats  noses in the growing border tumult and defend the president s closure threat   We hate to say we told you so   he said   We need border security  and we re going to do the best we can with what we have  He also dismissed questions about the wisdom of Mr  Trump s plan to end financial aid to El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras  Complaining about the troubled nations  failure to stop their people from fleeing north  Mr  Mulvaney brushed off administration experts who have cautioned that cutting aid would further destabilize the countries  likely worsening the migrant crisis Translation  Fine  No one will give us a border wall  We ll show you the meaning of chaos The president s fans cheer his pugilism  as though he was bravely defending himself   and them   against big  bad bullies  But all too often  the price is paid by the innocent and vulnerable  migrant children snatched from their parents at the border  federal workers thrown into financial turmoil by the government shutdown  farm workers and manufacturers caught up in the trade war  the millions of Americans who stand to lose their health insurance if the administration keeps laboring to kill Obamacare  For Mr  Trump  anyone who stands between him and his objective becomes collateral damage  And pity those considered part of an unfriendly demographic  such as the people of Puerto Rico  whom the president dismisses as a tool of the Democratic Party and mistreats accordingly  As the Senate has worked this week to hash out a comprehensive disaster relief package  Mr  Trump s contribution has been to fire off a series of obnoxious  dishonest tweets charging that  corrupt or incompetent  island officials have wasted epic levels of relief funding and are now hot for Democrats  to give them more  taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others  Disgraceful   A White House spokesman  Hogan Gidley  subsequently appeared on TV with a spirited defense of his boss s broadside against  that country   As for those who actively defy the president  the goal is not simply to punish them for a single transgression but to discourage them from future rebellions

Hundreds of ads on Facebook promised U S  homeowners that they were eligible for huge state tax breaks if they installed new solar energy panels  There was just one catch  None of it was true The scam ads used photos of nearly every U S  governor   and sometimes President Donald Trump   to claim that with new  lucrative tax incentives  people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes  Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses  email  utility information and phone number to find out more Those incentives don t exist While the ads didn t aim to bilk people of money directly   and it wasn t possible to buy solar panels through these ads   they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come ons  both scammy and legitimate  It s not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner Facebook apparently didn t take action until notified by state government officials who noticed the ads The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months  undetected  They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads  especially as the 2020 elections   and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation   loom  This is definitely concerning   definitely  it s misinformation   said Young Mie Kim  a University of Wisconsin Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections   I keep telling people  We don t have any basis to regulate such a thing  Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms Last year  Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs  including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience  But it didn t make that information available for other ads until Thursday  when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads  Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets  Google has an archive for political ads only The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester  One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won t see them  That allows people to do more dirty tricks   said Ian Vanderwalker  senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice s Democracy Program In mid March  some websites linked in the fake solar energy ads disappeared  After complaints from governors  offices  Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them  These scammy ads have no place on Facebook   company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement   We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action  Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images  text  targeting and position of ads posted to its site  In some cases  employees review the ads  Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies Governors  offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as  you can get paid to go solar  Helen Kalla  a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov  Steve Sisolak  said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them Facebook took them down days later  although some continued to re appear days after that complaint  Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas  Illinois  Colorado  Arizona  South Carolina and other states  But the ads had already been running for some time After researching solar panel options for his two story home in Mount Tabor  New Jersey  37 year old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for  free  solar panels because Gov  Phil Murphy planned to release   100 million solar incentives   He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives  but worried others might not be  It s very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people   Fitzpatrick said The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar energy websites that listed the same business address   a mailbox in Carlsbad  California   that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission  the government s consumer protection agency  In 2012  the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company   then called Coleadium  also known as Ads 4 Dough   for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products  according to court records Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a  1 million fine  Akatiff changed his company s name to A4D Inc  in 2015  according to California business filings Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business Though the FTC can investigate fake ads  sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims  thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily  making it harder to catch suspect advertisers Scam ads are popular in certain industries  such as insurance or solar power  where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services  said Peter Marinello  vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers  Marinello said   That s how this whole process plays out     Associated Press investigative researcher

OTTAWA   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s insistence that there is little wrong with how he is handling the worst crisis of his tenure is frustrating lawmakers and senior party figures who believe the approach could cost him re election this October Angry legislators are starting to push back against Trudeau and his team  opening up public divisions of the kind the ruling Liberals have not seen for almost 20 years Trudeau has been under pressure over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on then Justice Minister Jody Wilson Raybould last year to try to ensure SNC Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial by paying a fine instead  Wilson Raybould resigned on Feb  12 after being demoted within the Cabinet  and a second minister  Jane Philpott  subsequently quit over the way the matter had been handled The mood among senior advisers inside the prime minister s office has often been grim  according to two Liberals familiar with the matter  The frustration is certainly more palpable than it was a couple of weeks ago     it s not the happiest of places to spend much time   said one of the people  who like others cited in this story requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation  Despite a sea of unfavorable headlines as well as opinion polls showing the Liberals are on track to lose October s federal election  Trudeau s approach has been to wait it out  His support for keeping the two former Cabinet ministers in caucus   while indicating both could run again for the party in October   is also inexplicable to Liberal lawmakers who say it threatens party unity Both Wilson Raybould and Philpott say they are acting out of principle and that the scandal shows the Liberal Party needs to do better Many lawmakers are furious that Trudeau s team did not do more to shut down the affair soon after it erupted on Feb  7  In a sign of their anger  they look set to defy his wishes and expel at least Wilson Raybould from caucus at its next scheduled meeting on Wednesday   They have bungled this from the start  They should have issued an apology  promised to do better and moved on   said one of the party s most senior figures  Instead  Trudeau initially denied anyone in his office had inappropriately pressured Wilson Raybould  only to have her publicly testify to the contrary  She released more documents on Friday  ensuring the story was kept alive  Some legislators complain that Trudeau s tight knit team has kept them at a distance  that it can be hard to speak to the prime minister alone and that he has ignored people with experience  Trudeau  47  came to power in 2015 with a small cadre of longtime intimates serving as a brain trust  including Gerald Butts  his close friend and top political adviser  Butts resigned in February amid the scandal  Members of the Trudeau team are pushing back against the criticism  arguing they are doing the best they can   No one is claiming the outcome was handled well  but I m not sure it would have gone any better had we tried something else   said a third Liberal  conceding that  perhaps there can be some recalibration  on improving relations with legislators A government official  pressed on Trudeau s handling of the affair and criticism from Liberals  said the prime minister was  very proud of the team  and focusing on his agenda  PUT UP OR SHUT UP  Trudeau has made small shifts in strategy  such as reaching out more to his members of parliament and slightly broadening his circle of advisers  but otherwise insists on staying the course  He doesn t throw chairs against the wall or bang on tables  That s not his style   said the third Liberal   But he can be very stubborn  Once he s decided on something  that s it   Trudeau told reporters last week that his team was  stronger and more united than ever before   but the splits are clear for all to see  Liberal legislator Judy Sgro urged Wilson Raybould and Philpott to  either put up or shut up  and said they were being selfish  Ironically  Liberals say it was the Trudeau team s desire to prevent further outbreaks of intraparty hostility that helped exacerbate the current crisis  Unhappy Liberals complain Trudeau s closest advisers sidelined a raft of party veterans after the 2015 election who were associated with past infighting  They say that deprived Trudeau of the chance to consult people with previous experience of dealing with problems   It s almost like  we are not a continuation of the Liberal Party  we re new and different   And by doing that  there s no question they don t have the same group to circle the wagons and defend them that they once had   said a fourth Liberal  As well  Trudeau  a self avowed feminist who appointed a gender balanced Cabinet  recruited star candidates like Wilson Raybould and Philpott who veteran legislators complain had no experience of federal politics and therefore were unfamiliar with conventions on party loyalty and solidarity  While polls suggest an October election defeat  some insiders are less gloomy  That said  they concede the result could well be a minority government  which would leave the Liberals reliant on opposition parties to push through their agenda Senior Liberals say there are signs the public is becoming bored of the tale  giving the prime minister the chance to grab hold of the news agenda and reduce the pressure on his inner circle  The mood was terrible for a while  but it s getting better   said the third Liberal   Reporting by David Ljunggren  Editing by Peter Cooney  

BALTIMORE   Baltimore s embattled mayor announced Monday that she is taking an indefinite leave of absence  just as a political scandal intensifies over what critics call a  self dealing  book sales arrangement that threatens her political career Mayor Catherine Pugh s office says she feels unable to fulfill her obligations as mayor due to deteriorating health brought on by a recent bout of pneumonia   She s been advised by her physicians that she needs to take time to recover   her office s statement said  adding that the City Council president will take over the Democratic mayor s day to day responsibilities The first term mayor s abrupt decision to go on leave indefinitely came the same day that Maryland s Republican governor asked the state prosecutor to investigate corruption accusations against the leader of Maryland s biggest city and the state s comptroller  a Democrat  urged Pugh to resign immediately In a letter to the state prosecutor released Monday  Gov  Larry Hogan said allegations facing Pugh and her questionable no contract arrangements to sell her  Healthy Holly  children s books are  deeply disturbing   Hogan said he was particularly concerned about  500 000 in sales over seven years to a university based health care system  because it has significant continuing ties with the State and receives very substantial public funding  Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot did not mince words   The Mayor has to resign   now  The people of Baltimore are facing too many serious challenges  as it is  to also deal with such brazen  cartoonish corruption from their chief executive  Some emboldened members of Baltimore s City Council also want Pugh to resign  Councilman Zeke Cohen asserted Monday that she s  lost the moral mandate to govern and the public s trust   Another councilman  Ryan Dorsey  described Pugh as  an embarrassment to the city  The various officials  calls came shortly after Kaiser Permanente disclosed that it paid  114 000  between 2015 and 2018  for roughly 20 000 copies of Pugh s self published  Healthy Holly  illustrated paperbacks for children  And it came about two weeks after news broke that since 2011  Pugh has received  500 000 selling her illustrated books to the University of Maryland Medical System  a  4 billion hospital network that s one of the largest private employers in the state Pugh became Baltimore s mayor in 2016  The next year  Baltimore s spending board  which is controlled by the mayor  awarded a  48 million contract to the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid Atlantic States Inc  Kaiser previously held that contract When asked who Kaiser bought the books from  company spokesman Scott Lusk said   We purchased the books from Healthy Holly  LLC   That is Pugh s company  which she has said was meant to encourage healthy lifestyles Cohen noted that Pugh accepted money from Kaiser for her  Healthy Holly  children s books at the same time the company was seeking a contract to provide health benefits to city employees  Instead of recusing herself from a Board of Estimates vote  she voted in favor of it   he said Additionally  The Baltimore Sun reported that CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield  another city health provider  effectively bought Pugh s roughly 20 page illustrated books for  14 500 in 2011 and 2014  In a subsequent email  a CareFirst spokesman said it made contributions to Associated Black Charities  or ABC  a nonprofit that manages the city s Children and Youth Fund  to fund its purchase and distribution of books  Associated Black Charities said in a statement that between 2011 and 2016  five organizations donated  87 180 to pay for the books  of which ABC kept  9 552 to use as  general support  The firm Pugh identified as her books  printer said it has produced only 60 000 copies and doesn t have any more orders from Pugh  She s only acknowledged sales of her book to UMMS and said they were meant to be distributed to city schools and day cares The attorney representing the mayor  Steve Silverman  said the mayor looked  forward to cooperating with the state prosecutor and providing as much information as possible to put this matter to rest  Since the arrangement with UMMS came to light last month  Pugh has stepped down from the volunteer board and returned her most recent payment of  100 000 for the books  At a news conference last week  Pugh described the book deal with the university based health care system as a  regrettable mistake  and suggested the school system needed to clear up confusion about where tens of thousands of books were But the school system has failed to unearth copies of the books outside of nearly 9 000 copies found stacked in a warehouse One of Maryland s largest private employers  the UMMS paid Pugh  500 000 for 100 000 copies of books  There was no contract behind the deal and the hospital network described some of the purchases as  grants  in federal filings  Pugh   who once sat on a state Senate committee that funded the major health network before becoming mayor  served on the system s board since 2001 One third of UMMS board members received compensation through the medical system s arrangements with their businesses  Legislation is pending in Maryland s capital focusing on board governance On Monday  John Ashworth  interim leader of the University of Maryland Medical System  said he believed nothing criminal took place by UMMS  But NYGREN has been chosen as an independent auditor  he said  to review financial relationships involving the UMMS and board members  among other things  They are due to start work this week  

ISTANBUL   The Latest on Turkey s local elections  all times local  5 25 p m The Council of Europe s election observation mission to Turkey s local elections said it was  not fully convinced  that Turkey had a  free and fair electoral environment  Andrew Dawson  who was heading the mission  urged the government to respect the results  especially in the predominantly Kurdish provinces  Since 2016  the government has replaced elected officials with trustees in 95 municipalities for alleged links to outlawed Kurdish militants The Council of Europe acknowledged Turkey s security concerns  but said the government s definition of terrorism wasn t consistent with European standards  especially when it comes to Kurdish political parties like the HDP Dawson said that  we do not accept

of healthy democratic interest     4 05 p m Behlul Ozkan  associate professor of international relations at Marmara University  says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s loss of ground in local elections in Ankara and Istanbul indicate that his socially conservative and construction driven policies no longer resonate in the cosmopolitan cities  Political Islam s quarter century old hegemony in Turkey s two largest cities is over   he said   The basic problem is that Erdogan is not able to get votes from middle income earners who believe that the economy  education and urban administration are not run well  The fact that there was no major reduction in his overall votes  however  showed that his base still trusted him to put the economy right  Ozkan said  This is what the AKP voter said   Yes there are serious economic problems but Erdogan is the person who can solve them      3 35 p m The ruling party s mayoral candidate for Istanbul says it s still too early to call

50 9 percent of the votes in Ankara  bringing an end to 25 years of administration by the AKP and its Islamic oriented predecessor The AKP s candidate  Mehmet Ozhaseki  currently stands at 47 1

facing a potential loss    1 45 p m The opposition candidate running to be Istanbul s next mayor has declared victory after unofficial results showed him leading in Turkey s local elections Ekrem

elections but the opposition s success in key cities dealt a significant blow to his party s dominance According to unofficial results  the ruling party lost the capital  Ankara  and the head of

JERUSALEM   Two Israeli researchers said on Monday they had discovered a network of hundreds of fake Twitter accounts that promoted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and attacked his political rivals  a week before a national election No direct connection had been found between the network and Netanyahu or his right wing Likud party  said the report by the researchers  who described their work as part of a project aimed at ridding social networks of manipulative practices Opinion polls show Netanyahu and his main challenger  centrist candidate Benny Gantz  locked in a close race ahead of the April 9 election  Researchers Noam Rotem and Yuval Adam said fake names were used in more than 150 accounts in the network and hundreds more might also be bogus  They described the research as independent  Rotem describes himself as an activist committed to rooting out the manipulation of social media The authors of the report said the postings on the fake accounts were controlled by people  not automatic  bots   They named one of the alleged operators  who denied through his lawyer involvement in any organized pro Netanyahu network  Expert analysis shows the network has reached more than 2 5 million Israelis   the report said  putting the number of tweets since the start of the election campaign at more than 130 000  Israel has a population of about 8 7 million A spokeswoman for Twitter  asked by Reuters about the findings  declined comment In a statement broadcast on the Internet  Netanyahu dismissed the report as  fake research  disseminated by media hostile towards him  I thought at first it was an April fool s joke   he said   They are not prepared to accept that you  citizens of Israel  support me  The report said one surge of fake tweets came after Israel s attorney general announced his intention in February to indict Netanyahu on corruption charges  which the prime minister has denied  Another flurry  the report said  was launched after Gantz s Blue and White party kicked off its election campaign  There is a whole network here  funded by big money  for stealing the election   Gantz said at a news conference after the findings were released   This matter demands investigation    Reporting by Jeffrey Heller and Rami Ayyub  Editing by Peter Graff  

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O Rourke has said in recent weeks that his visiting all 254 counties in Texas during his failed Senate bid last year helped boost the state s voter turnout  That may be  but he s giving the wrong numbers on how much turnout among young people increased Since joining the presidential race last month  O Rourke has said in events from Iowa to Texas that youth voter turnout boomed during the race he narrowly lost to Republican Sen  Ted Cruz A look at his claim  most recently made during an event in El Paso  Texas  on Saturday O ROURKE   The state saw young voter turnout up 500  over the last midterm election  THE FACTS  Voter turnout by people under 30 did not jump nearly that much last year  Texas did see a large increase in those young voters  though More than 1 million young voters cast a ballot in the 2018 midterm election  a 234  increase from the 2014 midterm elections  according to voting data from the Texas secretary of state s office Initial reports suggested young voter turnout increased as much as 508  during early voting in Texas when compared with early voting in 2014  according to data released by a political consulting firm a week before the 2018 election O Rourke spokesman Chris Evans acknowledged his candidate used those figures without making the distinction that they represent an incomplete portion of early votes cast   not total turnout in the election Overall  voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election increased 77  in Texas over 2014 totals Dozens of other states saw gains in young voter turnout  according to Abby Kiesa  who researches youth turnout at Tufts University Kiesa said the 2018 midterm elections experienced a  strong trend  of voters under 30 casting ballots  A competitive Senate race and a number of groups that registered college students helped push those voters to the polls in Texas  where young voter turnout has been historically low  Something really significant happened in Texas   Kiesa said of the 2018 election   It s likely attributable to many factors     Find AP Fact Checks at http   apne ws 2kbx8bd 

Amid frantic  last minute negotiations  under a spray of machine gun fire  Vladimir Nabokov fled Russia 100 years ago this week  His family had sought refuge from the Bolsheviks in the Crimean peninsula  those forces now made a vicious descent from the north  The chaos on the pier at Sebastopol could not match the scene that met the last of the Russian imperial family  evacuated the same week  In Yalta  terrified families mobbed a quay littered with abandoned cars  Nor were the Nabokovs  accommodations as good  The Romanovs made their escape on a British man of war  The Nabokovs crowded into a filthy Greek cargo ship  Overrun by refugees  Constantinople turned them away  For several days they lurched about on a rough sea  subsisting on dog biscuits  sleeping on benches  Only the family jewelry traveled comfortably  nestled in a tin of talcum powder  On his 20th birthday  Nabokov disembarked finally in Athens  He would never again set eyes on Russia At the time of the evacuation he had spent 16 quiet months in the Crimea  the last speck of Russia in White hands  Already the Bolsheviks had murdered any number of harmless people  Nabokov s jurist father  as his son would later note  was anything but harmless  In February 1917 riots had delivered a revolution  The czar abdicated  replaced by a liberal government  swept into power on a tide of popular support  Nabokov s father  Vladimir Dmitrievich  played a prominent role in that administration  Months afterward Lenin returned from exile  disembarking at St  Petersburg s Finland Station  Within the year  what had begun as an idealistic  progressive uprising would end   like Iran s  like Egypt s   in totalitarianism  With Lenin arrived another 20th century staple  a one party system in which hacks and henchmen replaced the competent and qualified The terror began immediately  On seizing power the Bolsheviks made their first victims the intellectuals who had preceded them  In a scene that sounds to have been lifted from one of his son s future novels  Nabokov s father managed a narrow escape  he turned out to have been high on the Bolshevik list of deputies to be shot  From Russian shores that year began one of the great exoduses that would mark the century  Nabokov was never to mourn the immense wealth from which he had been separated  only the lost  liberal chapter of Russian history  obliterated by Soviet propaganda The family made their way across Europe to England  Nabokov had on his side the gift of privilege  As he liked to put it  he had been raised  a perfectly normal trilingual child   At the same time  he had fled without the documents required for university admission  He would matriculate at Cambridge thanks to a borrowed  and no doubt opaque  it was in Cyrillic  transcript  On graduation he joined his family   and the greater part of the Russian emigration   in Berlin  There Nabokov met Vera Slonim  his future wife  who had made a harrowing St  Petersburg escape of her own  compounded by the fact that she was Jewish  In 1919 even Russian liberals were infected with anti Semitism  the Jews having been credited   in their customary role amid populist unrest   with having turned the country upside down  Slonim had traveled through Ukraine at a time of widespread pogroms  Also in Berlin  Nabokov would lose his father  assassinated at a political meeting by a right wing fanatic   The meeting topic was  America and the Restoration of Russia   In 1919  on his 20th birthday  Vladimir Nabokov arrived by ship in Athens  a refugee from the Bolshevik Revolution  He would never again set eyes on Russia In the 1920s Berlin absorbed a Russian community so large that the city supported not only Russian grocers but Russian pawnshops  soccer teams and orchestras  Eighty six Russian publishers set up shop there  To some it seemed the émigrés had taken over the town  There was no need to venture beyond the expatriate community  and Nabokov did not  He never learned more than a few words of German   Fortunately Vera had led a perfectly normal quadrilingual childhood   Theirs seemed in any event a provisional existence  Married in 1925  the couple expected to return as soon as the Bolsheviks fell  into the early 1930s  they still faced impatiently east In the meantime Nabokov wrote and wrote  in a void  The writers might well be in Europe  but the readers were in Russia  It would be easy  he remarked later  to poke fun at  all those hardly palpable people who imitated in foreign cities a dead civilization   Theirs was generally a disorienting  vaguely counterfeit existence  it bore an air of  fragile unreality   The Germans struck the beholden newcomers as largely spectral   as flat and transparent as figures cut out of cellophane   No communication took place between them Himself a  semiphantom in a light foreign suit   Nabokov taught English  boxing and tennis  He translated  Alice in Wonderland  into Russian  Vera found a series of secretarial jobs  Officially the couple were stateless  having been issued Nansen passports  a document that in Nabokov s view essentially identified its holder as  a criminal on parole   Those documents turned travel into a herculean labor  whole correspondences would be devoted to the procurement of visas  Nabokov missed his mother s funeral  in Prague  for want of one  The authorities seemed to view the foreigners among them  he noted   with the preposterous disapproval with which certain religious groups regard a child born out of wedlock  While there would be some debate later as to whether the Nabokovs constituted genteel or dire poverty  their finances were undeniably delicate  the more so after their son was born in l934  By that time history had again begun to overtake them  Vera lost her job when the Nazis dismissed the Jewish owners of her firm  With some urgency the couple began to cast about for a new address  The second city of the Russian emigration  Paris  seemed the obvious refuge  The situation grew grimmer in the fall of 1936  when the man who had murdered Nabokov s father was named to Hitler s Department of Émigré Affairs  His mandate  Vera explained  was to register every Russian in Berlin Nabokov began a full scale campaign for the right person  lectureship or publishing contact that might propel the family from Germany  By November he pronounced their position  desperate in the extreme   He searched everywhere for a foothold   I am not afraid of living in the American boondocks   he assured a Massachusetts acquaintance  both men deaf to any hint of prophesy  Nabokov might just as easily have become a great writer of the subcontinent  Was there work anywhere  he pleaded late in the year  if not in Britain or the United States  then in India or South Africa  The couple remained officially stateless  culturally orphaned  A gust might have nudged them in any direction  We re slowly dying of hunger and nobody cares   Nabokov confided to a Paris based cousin in 1937  shortly before the appeals paid off  While France was unhappy about the influx of foreigners   it had been less welcoming to foreigners than Berlin   Nabokov managed to secure a work visa  Vera arrived to be greeted by immense swastikas flying before Albert Speer s pavilion at the International Exposition  The family split up  camping at separate addresses so as not to overwhelm their generous hosts Nabokov had meanwhile acquired a literary agent in New York  She made no headway placing translations of his Russian novels  His latest  she informed him  was  dazzlingly brilliant  and hence wholly without promise for the American market  She suggested something more topical  an idea that left her client hyperventilating   Nothing   he would roar later   bores me more than political novels and the literature of social unrest   He was  he enlightened his representative  neither Sinclair Lewis nor Upton Sinclair   Ultimately he tossed the two over the cliff together  as  Upton Lewis    Weeks later  in the bathroom of a Paris studio apartment  he began    a champion figure skater switching to roller skates   as he complained  speaking for whole cadres of displaced professionals   to write in English Neither an academic post nor a publisher materialized  Nabokov was again offering English lessons in September 1939 when gas masks were handed out and air raid alarms began to sound  How was it possible  he wailed  that no one understood their straits  Émigré publishing shuddered to a halt  He was nearly mobilized  In Russian that winter he wrote a novella about a 40 year old seducer of prepubescent girls  It did nothing to speed him to the continent on which it would blossom  though another fiction did  An American refugee organization promised him a lecture series  understood to be purely  metaphysical   The visas came through though still the family could not afford steamer fare  Two charitable organizations chipped in   I have sound reasons to believe that I shall be able to make good in America   Nabokov assured the American Committee for Christian Refugees ImageVladimir Nabokov s immigrant identification card  1940 CreditUnited States Customs and Immigration ServiceOn May 19  1940  the day that Winston Churchill announced that the Germans had trampled the Maginot Line  as bewildered Belgians filled the Paris streets  the Nabokovs sailed to America  They arrived bedraggled  gaunt  a little suspect    Stranger always rhymes with danger   Nabokov observed   For a third time a world had come crashing down behind them as they escaped  at the 11th hour  through a trap door  A month after their departure the Germans marched into Paris  The Nabokovs had themselves crossed an invisible  if indelible  divide  Briefly evacuees  for two decades émigrés  they were now refugees In New York  Vera found part time work  Nabokov tutored college students  And then he was off and running  briefed by his new friend Edmund Wilson on the secret of circumventing  that man named Ross  who persisted in editing people at The New Yorker  Nabokov set about perfecting a brand of English that had not existed before and has not been seen since  In that realm he acknowledged his plight   My private tragedy   he would say  had been to have had to  abandon my natural idiom  my untrammeled  rich  and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second rate brand of English  In his second rate English he wrote several of the greatest works of the 20th century  the most popular of which propelled him back to Europe  if not to the pre revolutionary world  now extinct  He engaged in no lamentations for it  refusing to attach himself  to his wretched country by his own twisted heartstrings   He did not care to allow the Soviets the satisfaction of thinking they had relieved him of anything of value  Nor did he see himself as part of a mass migration  one that over the next century would surge and swell  leaving more people to read bedtime stories to their children in languages they had not spoken at birth than ever before in history As for the stateless years  they became  in retrospect   21 years of voluntary exile   Tampering a little with the tenses  Nabokov explained   I propelled myself out of Russia so vigorously  with such indignant force  that I have been rolling on and on ever since   It was essential that the exodus feel elective  that deprivation read as renunciation  The events of 1919 left him with a light hold on the world  The man who had grown up amid lush  pre revolutionary luxury perched always in rented houses  ultimately in a Swiss hotel  He claimed he could hear the avalanche crashing his way whenever he contemplated acquiring property  The Communists  it seemed  had relieved an immensely wealthy young man not only of his possessions  but also of the very habit of possession Generally politics left him indifferent  He did not issue political statements  Nor did he vote  Nabokov claimed not to be able to distinguish a Republican from a Democrat  At the same time  certain things were unforgivable  In a Wellesley classroom he could not avoid stressing that Communism and totalitarianism had stunted Russian literature for a quarter century   Stalin had just become an American ally  Nabokov s contract was not renewed   The New Yorker would reject a section of his 1957 novel   Pnin   deemed unacceptably anti Soviet  Nabokov could reconcile himself to a new country and a new language  to a confiscated past and a hijacked future  But he could not abide the suggestion that  Communism was an attractive new revolutionary experiment   Nor would he for a minute forget murderous regimes  brutes  bullies  bigots or philistines of any kind For someone who claimed his sole political credo was to loathe all forms of oppression    I am against any dictatorship right or left  terrestrial or celestial  white  grey or black  pink  red or purple     the opinions could be surprising  They remained accented  sometimes heavily  The Nabokovs supported McCarthyism   We are not with you on Vietnam   Vera informed friends  The couple endorsed President Lyndon Johnson s bombing of the north  They wrote the 1968 student demonstrations down to hooligans   The Russian Revolution had begun in the universities   Read

jacket art for  Pnin   featuring Professor Pnin standing on an American flag  would be summarily rejected  The Stars and Stripes  Vera explained to the novel s publisher  had already suffered enough abuse from protesters   We are the senior authorities in judging the Communist utopia   Vera reminded a close friend  herself a more open minded senior authority   The sentiments read differently for being written in Russian and in pre revolutionary spelling   The couple reasoned like the first Cuban Americans  or the first Vietnamese Americans  or  no doubt tomorrow  the first Venezuelan Americans  No one knew better how fragile was the border between idealism and totalitarianism And then there was  Dr  Zhivago   Published four weeks after  Lolita   it joined Nabokov s masterpiece at the top of the 1958 best seller list  Nabokov wrote off Boris Pasternak s novel as  wretched and mediocre   or  on a better day  as  a sorry thing  clumsy  trivial  and melodramatic   He might shrug off his losses  but 1919 still burned bright  He could not forgive Pasternak for having raced past the liberal revolution on his way to writing about the Bolshevik coup  The Nabokovs knew a Soviet plot when they saw one  They were convinced the Communists had pretended to smuggle Pasternak s novel out of the Soviet Union  Its American publication amounted to a cunning act of currency conversion  Nabokov forbade his publisher from mentioning him and Pasternak in the same breath  It was as if the Cold War played out weekly in America s bookstores  Edmund Wilson wrote off Nabokov s denunciations as sour grapes   He wants to be the only Russian writer in existence   he sniffed  A hint of envy would have been in order   Zhivago  strode past  Lolita  on the best seller list  That fall Pasternak won the Nobel Prize  No page of Nabokov could be read in Russia at the time But Wilson misunderstood his old friend  By some migratory magic  despite the bullies  brutes and philistines

WELLINGTON  New Zealand   New Zealand lawmakers on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of new gun restrictions during the first stage of a bill they hope to rush into law by the end of next week The bill would ban the types of weapons a gunman used to kill 50 people at two mosques last month The bill was backed by both liberals and conservatives  with only a single lawmaker from the 120 that sit in Parliament voting against it  The vote was the first of three that lawmakers must pass before the bill becomes law Police Minister Stuart Nash said far too many people have access to dangerous guns and lawmakers were driven by the need to ensure public safety  We are also driven by the memory of 50 men  women and children who were taken from their loved ones on the 15th of March   Nash said   Their memory is our responsibility  We don t ever want to see an attack like this in our country again  We are compelled to act quickly  Seemingly drawing a distinction with the U S   where gun possession is constitutionally protected  Nash said that in New Zealand  gun ownership remains a privilege and not a right Conservative lawmaker David Seymour voted against the bill  saying it was too rushed  Doing it in nine days before politicians go on their Easter break is starting to look more like political theater than public safety   he said But Seymour was so busy explaining to reporters his reasons for opposing the bill that he missed a procedural vote in which he could have tried to slow its passage Many New Zealanders were shocked at the firepower the gunman was able to legally obtain and favor the legislative changes Some are opposed  More than 14 000 have signed a petition filed in Parliament which says the law changes are  unjust  for law abiding citizens and are being driven by emotions The bill would ban  military style  semi automatic guns and high capacity magazines  It would also ban semi automatic shotguns that could be fitted with detachable magazines and pump action shotguns that can hold more than five rounds The bill wouldn t ban guns often used by farmers and hunters  including semi automatic  22 caliber or smaller guns that hold up to 10 rounds  or shotguns that hold up to five rounds  

LONDON   A group of British lawmakers said on Tuesday they would try to pass a law which would force Prime Minister Theresa May to seek a delay to Britain s departure from the European Union and thus prevent a potentially chaotic no deal exit on April 12 Parliament has failed so far to find a majority for any alternative to May s thrice defeated deal  Leaving the EU without a deal on April 12 is the default legal option if Britain cannot present another viable option to EU leaders holding an emergency Brexit summit on April 10  We are now in a really dangerous situation with a serious and growing risk of no deal in 10 days  time   said opposition Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper  who has proposed the legislation alongside eleven others from several political parties  including members of May s Conservatives  The Prime Minister has a responsibility to prevent that happening     If the government won t act urgently  then parliament has a responsibility to try to ensure that happens even though we are right up against the deadline  The EU would have to agree to any further delay to the Article 50 negotiating period  and have said Britain would need to give a reason for the delay The lawmakers said it would be up to the government to decide how long to propose as a delay  although the draft legislation notes that both parliament and the EU could propose a different length of extension Conservative lawmaker Oliver Letwin  who led the process of so called indicative votes on alternative Brexit options  said the draft legislation was  a last ditch attempt to prevent our country being exposed to the risks inherent in a no deal exit   We realise this is difficult  But it is definitely worth trying   he added Lawmakers are due to take control of parliamentary time on Wednesday and Cooper told BBC Radio they would use to carry out the process that needs to be completed before the bill is debated  The plan is to debate the bill on Thursday Pro Brexit Conservative Bill Cash told parliament seizing control in this way was a  a reprehensible procedure   It is unconstitutional  it is inconceivable that we should be presented with a bill which can be rammed through in one day   he said Parliament s speaker John Bercow said it was not unusual for government legislation to be passed by the House of Commons in a single day   Additional reporting by William James and Elizabeth Piper  editing by Stephen Addison Guy Faulconbridge  

In May 1987  Senator Gary Hart of Colorado was drummed out of the Democratic presidential contest following reports alleging an affair with Donna Rice  a 29 year old woman who was not his wife Months later  Douglas Ginsburg  a federal judge whom President Ronald Reagan had nominated for the Supreme Court  admitted that he had smoked marijuana years before  including as a young law professor  scuttling his candidacy The next summer  the Republican presidential nominee  George Bush  chose the little known Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his running mate  leading to a frantic investigation into how Mr  Quayle had gotten into the Indiana National Guard instead of serving in the Vietnam War   Rumors  never proven  also swirled about affairs and pot use   Mr  Quayle stayed on the ticket  but never quite recovered The late 1980s and 1990s marked a high water mark for a kind of giddy journalistic derangement over politicians  adultery  drug use and draft avoidance   a somewhat arbitrary trio of offenses inflated into mortal sins  Candidates and nominees for various public positions were barraged with questions on these issues  although no one ever showed that they bore on a person s fitness for office  These orgies of saturation press coverage  feverish speculation and moral righteousness were dubbed feeding frenzies In time  the manias subsided  Bill Clinton was elected president as an admitted philanderer  Barack Obama confessed to having used  a little blow  in his youth and no one cared  Not one of our baby boomer presidents served in Vietnam   a fact that troubles few people today So are we now able to evaluate aspirants for high office dispassionately  on the basis of their experience  achievements and qualifications  It sure isn t looking that way  More likely  we have just dropped one bucket of shark bait and picked up another We are now witnessing a feeding frenzy over Joe Biden s penchant for sometimes unwelcome public displays of affection  Mr  Biden  who is famous for overly tactile friendliness  has been dealing with two women s charges that he upset them by greeting them far too intimately  Pundits are now discussing whether these actions should end Mr  Biden s  as yet unannounced  presidential candidacy and even declaring point blank that he is the wrong man to succeed President Trump Charges about inappropriate touching must be heard and evaluated  But the more difficult question for journalists is whether these charges should become grounds for feeding frenzies   all consuming  multi day stories that  by virtue of their blanket coverage  signal to audiences that they outweigh everything else about a candidate  Front page stories  24 7 coverage and viral tweets can easily knock someone out of contention  Should they  How the press handles Mr  Biden s penchant for handling others will test whether it has learned from its mistakes in the days of Hart and Ginsburg and Quayle A historical lens may help us see things with a bit more dispassion  The media obsession with a specific set of gotcha issues  the conviction that they warrant an expenditure of vast journalistic resources  dates to the years after the Vietnam War and Watergate  Chastened by those national traumas  Americans  including journalists  concluded that they had sprung from the debauched or deformed characters of President Johnson and especially President Nixon   Character  became the watchword in politics But character was defined at once too vaguely and too narrowly  The imperative to evaluate character was too broad in that it gave journalists license to vet aspirants for the presidency  as well as for the Supreme Court  Cabinet appointments and other offices  by prying into their personal lives Yet it was also too narrow  because the peculiar foibles that the press fixated on were hardly sufficient to adequately judge someone s integrity or maturity or temperament  The issues of sex  drugs  and Vietnam loomed large for reporters of the Baby Boom generation because they provided an arena in which to work through unresolved feelings about the cultural transformations of the 1960s Eventually  the maturation of Generation X   whose members were largely unfazed by tales of sex  pot and draft dodging   diminished the potential of the boomers  pet issues to blossom into scandal  More broadly  the public was wearying of hyped up controversies that  it was becoming clear  had little or no relevance to how a politician performed his or her job Recently  though  America experienced another trauma  The election of Donald Trump   a rank misogynist and confessed sexual assaulter   over a woman seemingly destined to be America s first female president jolted many voters  Among its other effects  Trump s election helped spark the explosion of women s activism we have seen since 2016  including the long overdue insistence that we call sexual harassers and assaulters to account  If Mr  Trump couldn t be stopped  others guilty of like offenses would be policed with new vigor As many people recognize  however  for all the big shots  predators and cads rightly brought to justice  there have also been moments of excess   of sober judgment suspended  Most infamously  in late 2017  following multiple claims of inappropriate touching  the Senate peremptorily cast out Minnesota s Al Franken  before an ethics investigation could even occur  Mr  Franken denied that his actions amounted to sexual harassment  and apologized for them anyway  But when two new stories were posted to the internet in early December  his senate colleague Kirsten Gillibrand led a parade of lawmakers who demanded he give up his seat Like Gary Hart  Mr  Franken cannot blame others entirely  since he chose to step down  But a lot of Americans had and still have grave qualms about the lack of due process he was afforded  Clearly  both the media and the political class bore some responsibility for ratcheting up the pressure on him  instead of calling   as they could have   for cool deliberation to determine what actually happened  how severe his offenses were  and whether they should overshadow the many reasons his constituents might wish him to keep serving  as polls suggested they did  It is possible to cover stories such as these without creating feeding frenzies  Journalists can run fewer stories on a subject  talk about it once a day on cable news and not every hour  assume a matter of fact tone  remind themselves that Twitter isn t public opinion  question scandal material shopped by someone s political rivals  and in other ways bear in mind that many people deplore the media proclivity for these furors  When scandals relating to personal behavior arise  they can also ask themselves whether those behaviors reflect at all on how the politician might deal with Vladimir Putin  restore democracy to Venezuela  solve an immigration crisis or economic meltdown  or develop a plan for addressing health care costs or planetary dangers  And thoughtful coverage can illuminate the immense differences between  for example  Mr  Biden s occasionally cringe worthy physicality and Mr  Trump s contempt filled view of women as veritable pieces of meat Without such a tempered media environment  though  it is easy to imagine Mr  Biden or other candidates succumbing to media pressure as Mr  Franken did  without any careful weighing of the nature  severity and relevance of the alleged wrongdoing  Nonetheless  in our scandal soaked past there have also been politicians who withstood a media battering only to find their courage rewarded with the news that the public supported them all along   and that the headlines and headline news did not reflect popular opinion In 1989  for example  after disclosures that Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank had hired a male prostitute and kept the man on his payroll  many politicians  along with the Boston Globe  called on the congressman to resign  Mr  Frank resisted the pressure  submitted himself to the judgment of his constituents  and was reelected twelve more times Read moreOpinion coverage of Joe Biden Opinion   Ross Douthat  The

the pundits  calls during the Monica Lewinsky scandal that he abdicate  and he withstood impeachment by a Republican controlled House of Representatives  His approval ratings soared as the drama dragged on  showing again that voters don t always agree when a media mob calls for a politician s head More recently  Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia was found to have displayed a photo in his medical school yearbook of a student in blackface beside another one in Klan robes  Despite a cascade of calls for his resignation  he instead vowed to redouble his commitment to racial justice   and  a short while later  it turned out that most African Americans in the state wanted him to stay put These politicians at some level appreciated that a feeding frenzy is typically not a mirror but a distortion of public opinion  Consciously or intuitively  most of us know that public morality is distinct from private morality   that a great president or Supreme Court justice can be a flawed or rotten person  and a noble soul might be a lousy senator or governor   Of course  we can all think of a horrible human being who also made a terrible president   We need to remember that when we grill candidates about the taboo du jour  we aren t helping ourselves understand their suitability for leadership but rather working through other cultural concerns As for character  the real test of it may be whether a politician has the fortitude and self confidence to brave the media storm David Greenberg is a professor of history and of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University and the

NEW DELHI   Millions of Hindus will wake up at the crack of dawn this Saturday  five days before the start of India s general election  and march to nearby temples to chant a sacred hymn and renew a pledge to build a temple on the ruins of a 16th century mosque Hardline Hindu allies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  say they will mobilize more than 10 million people on April 6   the start of the Hindu New Year   to shore up support for the contentious plan to build a temple in the northern town of Ayodhya But while the event will keep the focus on a core demand of India s Hindu nationalists  it will not overtly be part of the BJP s election campaign  signaling a softer approach by the ruling party  multiple sources familiar with discussions said The commitment to construct a grand temple in Ayodhya to the Hindu god king Ram has been part of the BJP s election manifesto since the 1990s and has helped the party garner Hindu votes in state and federal elections since then However  the BJP and its allies are concerned that focusing on the temple issue could be too hot to handle  especially since it is now the party in power  It could worsen communal tensions and trigger religious riots in the country  said a senior BJP leader  We cannot underestimate the power of Hindu fringe groups  and it s best not to ignite these issues   said a BJP leader who is overseeing the party s election strategy The BJP leader and two other senior party members  two federal ministers and four members of hardline Hindu groups  who didn t wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue  said they reached a consensus to fold the temple issue into a broader religious and cultural discourse  without being too vocal about it Following a meeting between senior religious leaders and BJP politicians in January  the Vishwa Hindu Parishad  VHP  or the World Hindu Council  which is leading the movement for building the Ayodhya temple  put its agitation on hold in February Details of the meeting have not been published previously The VHP  which shares ideological ties with the BJP  would renew its demand only after the general election  its leaders said  While we remain committed to the cause that is so close to the hearts of Hindus  we re unanimous in our view that it s not the right time to amplify the temple issue   said Alok Kumar  international working president of the VHP   Politicization leads to controversies  HINDU MUSLIM RIOTSThe VHP has distributed pamphlets and issued appeals on social media to participate in a chanting ceremony aimed at renewing the pledge to build the temple on the spot where many Hindus believe Ram was born  where the mosque stood Sanjay Mayukh  a BJP spokesman in New Delhi  declined comment on the April 6 event being organized by the VHP  We wish them  VHP  a success and we will celebrate the Hindu New Year too   said Mayukh A militant Hindu mob tore down the mosque in 1992  sparking riots that killed about 2 000 people in one of the worst instances of sectarian violence in India since independence in 1947 The mosque  built by a Muslim ruler in 1528  has been one of the prime causes of conflict between India s majority Hindus and minority Muslims  who constitute 14 percent of the country s 1 3 billion people  India s Supreme Court is now in control of the site in Uttar Pradesh state and has been weighing petitions from both communities on what should be built there In March  the country s top court appointed an arbitration panel to mediate in the dispute  It s verdict is yet to come BJP election candidates confirmed they are avoiding the temple issue in their campaigns Former government minister and BJP lawmaker Sanjeev Baliyan  who is contesting the election from a constituency in Uttar Pradesh  said he has instructed supporters to  refrain from using the Ayodhya issue in any political rally   At least 65 people were killed in clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Baliyan s constituency in 2013  The danger of any religious tension spilling out of our control would change the election mood  Best to keep religious issues away from politics for now   he told Reuters Instead  Baliyan said  his campaign would focus on the BJP s achievements during its last five years in power and national security issues Most pollsters expect the BJP to emerge to win the highest number of seats in the election after recent military exchanges between India and arch enemy Pakistan led to a wave of nationalist fervor that has helped Modi But the pollsters say the BJP is unlikely to repeat its sweeping victory of 2014 because of the government s inability to provide jobs to the millions of youngsters coming into the job market each year and depressed rural incomes The BJP is also under fire from small business owners  traditional supporters of the party  who say they have suffered because of a rocky start to the Goods and Services Tax  India s biggest tax reform  and Modi s shock move to ban high value banknotes in 2016 The big question may be whether the BJP gets enough seats in the 544 member lower house of parliament to govern without having to form a coalition with other parties India begins voting on April 11 and the staggered election is scheduled to end on May 19  Results will be declared on May 23 Ambuj Nigam  the leader of the Vishwa Hindu Dal  a Hindu hardline Hindu group that came into existence in 2018  said the demand for a temple would again gain momentum after the general election  We have put all our controversial works on hold   said Nigam   But as soon as election results are out  we will bring Hindu nationalism back to the forefront    Additional reporting Zeba Siddiqui   Editing by Martin

CANBERRA   Australia s conservative government on Tuesday proposed tax cuts for low and middle income earners and record spending on health and education while promising the first budget surplus in more than a decade  shaping its pitch for votes in an imminent election Treasurer Josh Frydenberg offered A 158 billion  85 66 billion pounds  in tax cuts over the next decade primarily aimed at middle income earners  on top of tax cuts of A 144 billion last year  as the coalition government  which is trailing in opinion polls  tries to win over voters  An election must be held by mid May and could be called as soon as this week  The budget is back in the black  and Australia is back on track   Frydenberg told parliament in a budget speech on Tuesday evening  For the first time in 12 years  our nation is again paying its own way  Analysts long expected a spending plan designed to attract votes  It is the pre election budget to end all pre election budgets   it is extraordinarily generous   said Paul Williams  professor of political science at Griffith University There was muted reaction by the Australian dollar after the budget release  Earlier on Tuesday  it slid after the country s central bank held interest rates steady but still managed to sound dovish to some Standard   Poor s and Moody s left their top AAA ratings for Australia unchanged  S P said the country would achieve stronger fiscal outcomes than anticipated in the near term because of robust commodity prices and terms of trade  Moody s said strong employment growth supported the economy Frydenberg predicted a budget surplus of A 7 1 billion in the fiscal year ending June 2020  up from a December forecast of a A 4 1 billion surplus  as higher export receipts and tax revenues boost government coffers If achieved  it would be the first surplus since 2007 08  before the global financial crisis hit TAX REBATESThe projected surpluses increase to A 11 billion in 2020 21 and A 17 8 billion in 2021 22 before easing to A 9 2 billion in 2022 23  Offering potential swing voters an immediate dividend  the government said it will double the tax rebate for people earning between A 48 000 A 90 000 a year to A 1 080 in the current fiscal year Budget papers showed the cost of the tax cuts out to 2021 22 would be A 15 billion  Polls show the conservative Scott Morrison led government   consisting of the Liberal and rural focused National party   is headed for a resounding defeat against centre left Labour unless it can alter the current trajectory  Williams of Griffith University said the most the budget can do  is  stem the decline in support  The electorate has stopped listening   On Tuesday  Frydenberg also proposed changes in future years that would see income bands widened and tax rates reduced to deliver personal tax cuts The government would accelerate tax cuts for small businesses  it said  with the tax rate for businesses with turnover of less than A 50 million cut to 25 percent in 2021 22 The opposition Labour party said the budget would not address stagnant wage growth or tackle climate change Anaemic wages growth has been a hot political issue and is being used as an election platform for Labour and its supporters to campaign on The Australian Council of Trade Unions described wage growth forecasts in the budget  rising to 3 5 percent in 2021 22  as  fantasy  Strong inflows into government coffers meant Frydenberg could increase spending on healthcare  a strength of the opposition Labour party  to a record A 89 5 billion in 2022 23  That is up nearly 10 percent on expected spending in 2019 20 The government would spend A 100 billion on infrastructure over the next decade to reduce congestion and improve links between Australia s cities and regional towns  a lot of which has already been announced MORE RURAL ROADSSpending on rural infrastructure was forecast to rise by nearly 30 percent  with A 4 5 billion to go for building roads in rural areas  the major support base of the ruling coalition s junior partner The government also included an immediate one off rebate on energy costs to pensioners  another key voter demographic for the coalition  of A 75 for an individual or A 125 for couples And Frydenberg announced a A 3 5 billion package to reduce emissions to meet Australia s commitments under the Paris Accord  The government s environmental record is seen as one of its electoral weaknesses with urban voters  Frydenberg maintained a relatively optimistic outlook for the economy  though he conceded there were risks including from falling house prices and global ones such as Brexit  The government forecast full year economic growth of 2 25 percent in 2018 19  which would need activity to pick up in the January to June period as the economy grew 0 3 percent in the September quarter and 0 2 percent in the December quarter Growth in the A 1 9 trillion economy is seen picking up to 2 75 percent in 2019 20 and 2020 21 The tax cuts and increased spending  if enacted  could offer a boost to the economy  as consumer spending has been soft recently as falling home prices and high debt levels weigh on sentiment  Financial markets are fully pricing in a 25 basis points rate cut later this year  AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said there was some  fragility  around the budget assumptions  including downside risks to wage growth and consumer spending forecasts   It has provided stimulus but from what I can see it is not overwhelming   Oliver said  adding it was probably not enough to prevent Australia s central bank from cutting interest rates around mid 2019   Reporting by Colin Packham and Swati Pandey in CANBERRA  additional reporting by Tom Westbrook and Jonathan Barrett in SYDNEY  Editing by

LONDON   With Britain racing toward a chaotic exit from the European Union within days  Prime Minister Theresa May veered away from the cliff edge Tuesday  saying she would seek another Brexit delay and hold talks with the opposition to seek a compromise May made the announcement after the EU s chief negotiator warned that a disruptive and costly Brexit was likely unless Britain broke the impasse that has paralyzed the government and Parliament After failing repeatedly to win Parliament s backing for her Brexit blueprint  May said the country needed  national unity to deliver the national interest  Following the defeat of the government s plan and a range of lawmaker written alternatives  May said Britain would need a further delay to its EU departure  currently scheduled for April 12  She offered to hold talks with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in an attempt to find a compromise solution  This debate  this division  cannot drag on much longer   May said in a televised statement from 10 Downing St  after an all day Cabinet meeting European Council President Donald Tusk gave a cautious welcome to May s change of course  Even if  after today  we don t know what the end result will be  let us be patient   he tweeted   a suggestion the EU would wait for Britain to present a clear plan Earlier  EU negotiator Michel Barnier offered a downbeat assessment of the situation  As things stand now  the no deal option looks likely  I have to tell you the truth   Barnier said in Brussels Barnier said  we can still hope to avoid it  if London produced a breakthrough before an April 10 EU summit The leaders of the EU s 27 remaining countries have given the U K  until April 12 to leave the bloc or to come up with a new plan  after British lawmakers thrice rejected an agreement struck between the bloc and May late last year The House of Commons has also failed to find a majority for any alternative plan in two days of voting on multiple options May s statement came after a seven hour meeting of her fractious Cabinet  which is split between supporters of a  soft Brexit  that keeps close economic ties with the EU  and Brexiteers who believe a no deal exit is better than compromising May s words seemed to indicate that she was veering away from the possibility of a no deal Brexit   but also that she has not given up on her own unloved withdrawal agreement Her plan is to seek approval for the legally binding agreement   which sets out in detail the terms of Britain s departure from the EU   after securing cross party political support for a vision of future ties between the U K  and the bloc If she and Corbyn fail to reach agreement  May said Parliament would get to vote on a range of options   and the government would be bound by the result  It is the first time she has committed to following the instruction of lawmakers May didn t indicate how long an extension she would seek from the EU  though she said she hoped Britain could pass the agreement by May 22  in time to avoid participating in elections for the European Parliament Corbyn said he would be  very happy  to sit down with May  even though  so far she hasn t shown much sign of compromise  Corbyn said Labour would present May with its conditions for Brexit  which include a close economic relationship with the bloc through a customs union  maintaining high environmental standards and protecting workers  rights May s move infuriated pro Brexit politicians  who say Britain must cut ties to the EU in order to forge an independent economic policy  I think people will feel very short changed   said former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson  a prominent pro Brexit voice in Parliament But May s words brought relief for those who fear the effects of a no deal Brexit  which would complicate trade and travel  with new checks on borders and new regulations on dealings between the EU and Britain Businesses have warned that the economic impact in Britain could be devastating Ford of Europe Chairman Steven Armstrong said  a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for the automotive industry in the U K  Edwin Morgan  interim director general of business group the Institute of Directors  said May s statement was  a welcome step towards compromise   though there remained obstacles ahead  We urge the leader of the opposition to work with the prime minister to find a solution   he said   Both sides must play ball  Britain s political paralysis   and May s failure to get Parliament s approval for the withdrawal agreement she negotiated   have exasperated EU leaders French President Emmanuel Macron said that if Britain s politicians could not agree on a way forward   they will de facto have chosen for themselves to leave without a deal   We cannot avoid failure for them   Macron said before a meeting in Paris with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar But Varadkar stressed  there s still time  for May to come to the April 10 summit with  credible  proposals Meanwhile  British lawmakers intent on avoiding a no deal Brexit have drawn up plans to prevent Britain crashing out of the bloc  by accident or design  We are now in a really dangerous situation with a serious and growing risk of no deal   Labour Party legislator Yvette Cooper said Cooper introduced legislation  which Parliament is set to consider  this week  that would compel May to seek to extend the Brexit process beyond April 12 in order to prevent a no deal departure    Raf Casert reported from Brussels  Mike Corder in Halfweg  Netherlands

BRUSSELS   If Britain ever wants an orderly exit from the European Union  it must pass the withdrawal agreement painfully negotiated with the bloc  Michel Barnier  its chief Brexit negotiator  warned on Tuesday Given how little time remains before April 12  when Britain might have to leave the European Union without a deal  Prime Minister Theresa May emerged from a series of tense cabinet meetings to say that she will ask her European counterparts to grant Britain another short extension to try to pass a withdrawal agreement  Parliament has already rejected her plan three times by margins varying from historic to hefty A majority in Parliament opposes a no deal Brexit  but agrees on little else To show the Europeans that the extension is worth providing  Mrs  May announced that she would try to meet with the head of the opposition Labour Party  Jeremy Corbyn   to agree a plan that we would both stick to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal  Mr  Corbyn favors a much closer trading relationship in the future with the European Union than Mrs  May  But if the two leaders can agree on a softer Brexit  then a parliamentary majority might be found to leave the European Union with a deal  initiating a transition period of at least two years while a future relationship is negotiated In his comments on Tuesday morning  Mr  Barnier made it clear that even if Britain asks for a long extension  the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened  and that negotiations on the country s future relationship with the European Union cannot legally take place until Britain is no longer a member Having failed to achieve a breakthrough on Monday  a group of lawmakers working across party lines were on Tuesday planning a new strategy to try to avert the increasing risk of a no deal Brexit What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union If approved in a vote expected to take place Thursday  the measure introduced by a Labour member  Yvette Cooper  would require Mrs  May to request another delay But the proposed legislation  which will mostly likely be discussed on Wednesday  does not specify what the extra time would achieve  so it remains unclear whether such a request would satisfy European Union leaders  They have said that Britain could get another extension only if it has a new strategy  such as holding a general election or second referendum  and if it agrees to take part in the European elections in May The cabinet held two meetings on Tuesday as Mrs  May attempted to find a way out of the crisis  Though she said she wanted to avoid leaving without a deal and noted that Parliament would try to stop it  the prime minister s office also said that a no deal exit was the default scenario if there were no agreement Britain could also leave without an agreement  which Mr  Barnier said is  day after day more likely   He insisted that the European Union was prepared for this scenario But even then  he said  Britain would have to return to talks with Brussels in a badly strained relationship to manage day to day dealings  including air transportation  trade and customs  The bloc could then negotiate a free trade agreement with Britain  as with Japan or Canada  but key issues would  still be on the table   Mr  Barnier said  listing protections for citizens  rights  preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland  and Britain s legal and financial obligations to Brussels It would be much simpler for Parliament  which Monday night could find no majority for the Brexit plan  to pass the legally binding withdrawal agreement  Mr  Barnier said  Then the two sides could immediately begin to negotiate their future relationship  since the nonbinding political declaration  leaves the door open for a variety of outcomes  and could be easily adjusted to Britain s wishes  If the U K  still wants to leave the E U  in an orderly manner  this agreement  this treaty  is and will be the only one   Mr  Barnier said   If there is no deal  there is no transition  ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain in Parliament in London on Monday  Lawmakers have already rejected her withdrawal agreement three times CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Barnier spoke and took questions on Tuesday at the European Policy Center  a think tank based in Brussels The mood in Brussels has been somber as the British Parliament floundered in its attempts either to pass the withdrawal agreement or to find a majority for any alternative  But that agreement  including the so called Irish backstop  will not change  Mr  Barnier and other European leaders have said Some member countries  like France  tend to favor a no deal Brexit so the issue does not affect European parliamentary elections at the end of May The fear is that Brexit will be taken up by Europe s various populist and euroskeptic parties as another sign of the supposed indifference of Brussels to democratic expression But others  like Germany  believe that Britain is a crucial neighbor and partner in trade and defense  and argue that it should be given a longer extension  The heads of state and government are to meet in Brussels in an emergency session on April 10  two days before the current Brexit deadline  to hear what Britain has decided To get an extension  Britain must tell the other member states why it wants one   for a general election  another referendum or some other reason that promises a way out of the impasse rather than just allowing more time for bickering and deadlock But a long extension has political and economic costs for both sides  Mr  Barnier noted  citing uncertainty that is damaging business relationships and investment and the need for the European Union to concentrate on other pressing issues  like migration  economic growth  inequality  refugees and terrorism  The leaders  he said  would have to  balance the different costs  between no deal  even if by accident  and a long prolongation  The European Union will protect its single market no matter what  Mr  Barnier said  since 500 million people and 22 million businesses depend on it   We will never fragilize or unravel the single market   he said in English   If we fragilize or unravel the single market  we are lost

NASHVILLE  Tenn    Tennessee lawmakers are working to become the latest state to ensure faith based adoption agencies can refuse to place children with gay parents and other families because of their religious beliefs with facing any penalties The GOP dominant House on Monday overwhelmingly voted 67 22 in support of the proposal after a brief but tense debate  The bill must now pass the similarly GOP controlled Senate before it can reach Republican Gov  Bill Lee s desk for final approval Lee hasn t said publicly whether he supports the legislation but his religious faith has often been a cornerstone of his political career  Kansas and Oklahoma enacted similar laws last yearSupporters argue that while faith based adoption agencies in Tennessee have been operating without issue  the move is needed to protect against potential lawsuits hostile to the group s religious beliefs Furthermore  if the proposal becomes law  current adoption practices in the state aren t expected to change  Some faith based agencies already do not allow gay couples to adopt  But this measure would provide legal protections to agencies that do  For example  denied applicants couldn t sue an agency for damages if the religious belief or moral conviction was cited a reason  We re doing the same as nine other states have done   said Republican Rep  Tim Rudd of Murfreesboro  the bill s sponsor   Throughout the country  these faith based organizations have been sued to the point they re being driven out of business due to costs  However  opponents counter the measure will give adoption agencies free reign to discriminate against LGBT families  single parents and non Christians in placing children based on  religious or moral convictions or policies  Some experts have said same sex couples are nearly three times as likely to adopt as heterosexual couples  We have children across this state looking for loving homes  why are we doing anything to prohibit a loving family or a couple from being able to care of a child and take it in and provide for it  why   said Democratic Rep  John Ray Clemmons after a brief back and forth with Rudd over the bill s purpose In 2011  Illinois declined to renew its state contract with Catholic Charities adoption services due to its policy of refusing child placement to same sex couples  Catholic Charities has also stopped handling adoptions in Washington D C   Massachusetts and San Francisco over concerns they would be required to act against their religious beliefs     

CAIRO   An Egyptian province on the Red Sea will impose a ban on disposable plastics  prohibiting everything from single use straws to plastic bags in an effort to fight pollution and protect the environment  its governor said Tuesday The ban will apply to restaurants  supermarkets  grocery stores  pharmacies and on cruise ships that dock off the shores of this province  called Red Sea  It will also apply to the hotels in Hurghada  the provincial capital  and elsewhere in the province Plastic spoons  forks and knives  cups and dishes will also be among the banned items  It s a fight against the sea of plastic that people carelessly discard   Gov  Ahmed Abdallah told The Associated Press   And it all ends up in the Red Sea  The ban will go into effect from June  he said  adding that it was first proposed by the Hurghada Environmental Protection   Conservation Association to protect the province s  threatened and endangered species  The organization said it will launch campaigns across the province to clean up islands  beaches and famous diving areas around Hurghada  one of Egypt s most popular beach resorts and diving centers Abdallah  who realizes the campaign will be an uphill battle  did not elaborate on how the ban would be enforced  His hope is that by saying  no to plastic   Egypt will draw more environment conscious tourists In 2017  Egypt launched an EU funded initiative to encourage people to limit their use of plastic bags and to shift to more environment friendly alternatives  The country produces 970 000 tons of plastic waste per year The environmental affairs agency said last year that Egyptians use around 12 billion plastic bags a year  causing severe problems to the Nile River and the country s two seas   the Mediterranean and the Red Sea Single use plastics  which are used once before they are thrown away or recycled  have added to the problems  as have items like coffee stirrers  plastic bags  straws  soda and water bottles Egypt s vital tourism industry has been hit hard by extremist attacks and political turmoil following the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that toppled longtime autocrat  President Hosni Mubarak The once multibillion tourism industry  a vital pillar of the country s economy and source of work for millions of people  has been decimated  The tourism sector suffered a further blow after an Islamic State group bombing brought down a Russian passenger plane over the Sinai Peninsula in 2015  killing all 224 people on board Egypt s government has tried to lure tourists back by promoting new archaeological discoveries and boosting security around historical sites  

ROME   Italy s finances will deteriorate this year and next  with debt and the budget deficit both rising because of recession and higher public spending  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Monday In a special report on Italy  the Paris based OECD said the deficit would rise to 2 5 percent of gross domestic product this year  above the 2 percent target Rome agreed in December with the European Commission The economy will shrink by 0 2 percent this year  the OECD said  confirming a forecast last month  before expanding 0 5 percent in 2020 Political uncertainty and high borrowing costs will offset the expansionary policies adopted by the coalition government of the 5 Star Movement and the League  it warned Most other forecasters expect Italy s economy to stagnate this year rather than shrink  The government still officially forecasts 1 percent growth  although it s expected to lower that in a new planning document later this month  Italy continues to suffer from long standing social and economic problems   the OECD said  citing issues ranging from low employment and rising poverty to gaping regional disparities and stagnant productivity Italy s inflation adjusted  per capita GDP is lower than in the year 2000  it said  making it unique among the OECD s 36 member countries In a bleak 153 page report  the think tank forecast unemployment would rise from 10 6 percent in 2018 to 12 0 percent this year  The dearth of job opportunities pushes many young people to emigrate  exacerbating Italy s already fast population ageing and depriving the country of energy  talent and entrepreneurship   it said  The budget deficit will rise to 3 0 percent of GDP in 2020  the OECD said  assuming the government does not adopt increases in sales tax included in its latest fiscal plan Italy s public debt  proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece s  will hit a record 133 8 percent of GDP this year and climb to 134 8 percent in 2020  the OECD said The government targets a decline in debt from 132 1 percent in 2018 to 130 7 percent this year and 129 2 percent in 2020 Rome s 2019 budget  rightly aims to help the poor   the OECD said  but it warned that the  citizens  income  welfare benefit would require marked improvements in job search and training programmes to help people find jobs The budget s other flagship measure  a reduction in the retirement age  will lower economic growth in the medium term and risks worsening inter generational inequality and increasing the public debt  the OECD said

ANCHORAGE   Working through two winters in the biting arctic cold  roustabouts bored three miles deep into the coastal plain of northeast Alaska in search of oil  In the spring of 1986  they packed up and left  uttering not a word about what they had found and leaving only a short section of steel pipe to mark the spot For more than three decades  the findings from the  40 million exploratory well have been one of the oil industry s most closely guarded secrets  Outside of the oil giants that paid for it  only a handful of people know what was discovered there Now the secret has become much more than a curiosity  The Trump administration  undoing decades of environmental protections  plans to sell drilling leases in the area  which is part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and has long been believed to contain North America s biggest untapped onshore trove of oil Anyone interested in drilling in the area urgently wants to know  Was the well   the only one ever drilled there   a dry hole or a potential gusher No one will say officially  but The New York Times found an answer in clues hidden 4 000 miles from the Arctic tundra  in the archives of a Beaux Arts style courthouse in Cleveland  The discovery well was worthless   said Sidney B  Silverman  a retired lawyer who was involved in a long since forgotten lawsuit filed there in 1987  Read more about how the Trump administration is clearing the way for oil exploration in the Arctic refuge  Mr  Silverman  who is now 86 and divides his time between Long Island and South Florida  reached that conclusion while representing shareholders of Standard Oil of Ohio as it was being acquired by British Petroleum  Both companies had a stake in the Arctic test well and were poised to benefit from further development ImageSidney Silverman  a retired lawyer  learned about the findings in a confidential deposition in the 1980s  but hasn t spoken out until now CreditEve Edelheit for The New York TimesIn merger documents  BP had placed only a  nominal  value on the potential reserves in the refuge  and Mr  Silverman and other lawyers suspected that Standard Oil s shareholders were about to be cheated They quickly learned otherwise BP allowed Mr  Silverman to conduct a confidential deposition about the well with a BP executive  David Jenkins  Reached by The Times  Mr  Jenkins said his memories were vague  but he recalled the deposition   which was sealed by the court   and telling Mr  Silverman that  there was never any evidence at all  at that stage  that there was anything material within the refuge  Mr  Silverman  similarly  remembered being convinced that  either there was no oil and gas there  or the oil couldn t be produced at an economic value  Some of the documents in the case are missing from the court file  perhaps lost over the decades  But in more than 1 000 pages of legal and regulatory filings  The Times discovered other hints that the findings were disappointing  Under oath  a Goldman Sachs banker who worked on the merger testified that BP had led him to believe that the test well results were  not particularly encouraging  John Warden  a lawyer who represented BP  said that he had only dim memories of the case but that the well results  became a nonissue   Told of The Times s reporting  he added   It looks to me like you have gotten it right  Mr  Silverman hinted at the findings in a memoir he self published 10 years ago  but has never before spoken out directly about what was said in the deposition  He said he was breaking his silence because of the Trump administration s decision to open the refuge   protected by Congress for decades   for oil development  This is important for the whole country   he said One dry hole does not necessarily mean there is no oil to be found  especially since some decades old seismic tests indicate that the area may hold as much as 12 billion barrels  worth  And knowledge of the area s subsurface geology is valuable  But confirmation that the results of the only test well were discouraging could embolden opponents of drilling and prompt second thoughts among potential lease bidders  Knowing that information would help you in an extremely competitive bid   said Larry Persily  a former federal gas official responsible for Alaska  who noted there had been billion dollar lease sales in the state  While the well is all but  a pimple on a speck  of the Arctic s massive landscape  he said  it is a prevailing mystery   And we love mysteries  ImageWhen the oil companies were finished with the test well  they hauled everything away   even  according to one account  the rock cuttings CreditTom Cook Papers Anchorage MuseumOil and gas development in the Arctic refuge  or ANWR   an expanse about the size of South Carolina that is home to caribou  polar bears and other wildlife   has been a goal of Republicans in Congress and many Alaskans for a half century But efforts to open the refuge s coastal plain  known as the 1002 Area  foundered for years as opponents argued that exploration would irreparably harm one of the country s largest pristine landscapes Republicans saw an opening with the election of Donald J  Trump  In 2017  the Republican controlled Congress passed a measure to sell oil leases in the refuge  Since then  the Interior Department has moved rapidly to sell leases for the 1002 Area before the 2020 election  when Democrats could regain the White House and block the sales The exploratory well was drilled under an agreement among BP  Standard Oil  Chevron and two Alaska Native corporations created to improve economic conditions among the indigenous population  The deal also allowed the oil companies to pursue further exploration on Native lands within the 1002 Area  if the federal government offered leases for the rest of the coastal plain At a congressional hearing last week  Richard Glenn  an executive with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation  one of the Native partners  played down the data s significance   You can t determine the quality of any single basin by one well   he said The corporation declined to comment for this article  as did BP  Chevron said in a statement that the results of its activities in the area remained confidential Joe Balash  the Interior Department official overseeing the leasing efforts  told reporters in December that the potential oil riches should attract plenty of interest despite the enduring mystery surrounding the well   a site known as a  tight hole   an industry term for wells with confidential findings  In the oil and gas industry  there s secrets and then there s secrets   Mr  Balash said   This is the tightest hole  I think  that has ever been drilled  A Legal CircusA year after the exploratory well was completed  a fleet of lawyers descended upon the Cuyahoga County Courthouse in Cleveland  BP  which already held a minority stake in Standard Oil of Ohio  had offered  7 4 billion to buy the rest of it  and the lawyers were there to lodge claims that Standard Oil s shareholders were being shortchanged The deal and the ensuing litigation led to a legal spectacle  with lawyers  executives and bankers shuttling from London to New York  often on Concorde jetliners  and then on to Cleveland and California  The case generated financial headlines around the world Eager to distinguish himself from the other lawyers  Mr  Silverman seized on the lack of detail in BP s offer about what had been found at the test well  known as KIC 1  In a filing  he and his team suggested that the omission had led to a significant shortfall in the value of the deal Soon after  BP s lawyers let Mr  Silverman question Mr  Jenkins  the oil executive  The proceeding was unusually secretive  No copies were made of the transcript  and the original is said to have been stored in a safe at a law firm representing BP Mr  Jenkins  who is 80  lives near London and still works in the oil industry  said he had found a notation about the meeting in his 1987 appointment book  He did not remember details of the KIC 1 findings  he said  but recalled that  there wasn t anything in that well that was particularly encouraging  Mr  Jenkins holds out the possibility that there is oil in the refuge   But not where the KIC well was drilled   he said Mr  Silverman  who ultimately agreed to a settlement  said he had been satisfied by what he learned during the deposition   I assure you right now that if that property were valuable  if it had any value  I would not have agreed to that merger  Mr  Silverman and the other lawyers agreed to a small increase in the offer price and BP stock warrants for Standard Oil s shareholders  allowing them to potentially share in future profits Just as a settlement seemed imminent  lawyers for a large shareholder  the California Public Employees  Retirement System  known as Calpers  lodged a challenge  also asking whether the price reflected the drilling results To allay those concerns  lawyers for Calpers were allowed to see information about the well findings  Yeoryios Apallas  a former California deputy attorney general who represented Calpers at the hearing  said that after reviewing a document that showed details of the test well  he concluded  there was no reasonable basis on which to question the fairness of the price  The case was over in about three months  Mr  Silverman and the other plaintiffs  lawyers shared  22 million in legal fees as they completed one of the era s largest mergers In the decades since  as the debate flared in Congress over whether to open the refuge to oil exploration  Mr  Silverman and others involved in the case quietly kept the secrets of the test well  To date  there has been no drilling in ANWR   Mr  Silverman wrote in his 2009 memoir   A Happy Life  From Courtroom to Classroom   Environmentalists think their efforts have preserved the wilderness area   he wrote   I know better  but must remain silent  ImageMr  Silverman wrote about the lawsuit in his memoir   A Happy Life  From Courtroom to Classroom  CreditSidney SilvermanKeeping the SecretThe oil companies drilling KIC 1 were so concerned about secrecy that  by one industry account  they even shipped the rock cuttings from the well out of Alaska  In 1988  the companies and one of their Native corporation partners sued Alaska to keep the well data confidential After a four year legal battle  the sides reached a tentative agreement that would allow only a few state officials to see the findings  But the state wanted to be sure the data was significant enough to warrant concealing it   that  as the companies contended  it would help in valuing subsurface mineral rights nearby  So  Mark Myers  a state petroleum geologist at the time  became one of the few people outside of BP or Chevron to see it In a conference room at BP s Anchorage offices  Dr  Myers said  he was allowed to comb through the information  which included geological and geophysical data from the well  He was not allowed to take notes  When he finished  he reported only that the findings were significant Since then  the state s files have remained locked away at the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in Anchorage  To this day  Dr  Myers  who went on to lead the United States Geological Survey and Alaska s Department of Natural Resources  and now works as a consultant  has not said whether the results were positive or negative  even as many news reports have speculated about them Proponents of opening the refuge to exploration have long cautioned that the KIC 1 findings are only one data point  While no other wells have been drilled within the refuge  many have been drilled near it A year after KIC 1 was completed  Tenneco and several partners drilled a well off the coast about seven miles to the northeast  The well was intended not to discover oil  but to learn more about any potential oil bearing rock formations  The results were not encouraging  according to Douglas R  Choromanski  who helped analyze data from the well  called Aurora Other wells have been drilled just west of the refuge  closer to the huge oil field at Prudhoe Bay that spurred Alaska s oil boom in the 1970s  Some have tapped into significant oil reserves  and some have not Dr  Myers said that given new understanding of where oil reserves may be found  much of the focus on the refuge has shifted to the western side  away from the KIC 1 well  A 3 D seismic testing program has been proposed to help pinpoint any oil reserves in the 1002 Area A full airing of the KIC 1 findings  though  could come if the Interior Department moves forward with selling leases  Under state rules  lease sales near the well are likely to set off a public release of the data ImageSteel pipe marks the location of the  40 million KIC 1 exploratory well from 1986 CreditFran Durner Anchorage Daily NewsIn the meantime  the secrecy surrounding the results   and their location   remains a source of gossip  rumor and political intrigue In February  Alaska s new Republican governor  Mike Dunleavy  fired Hollis French  a Democrat on state s oil and gas conservation commission  In a letter the month before  the governor accused Mr  French of several transgressions  including disclosing to a journalist details of where the KIC 1 files were kept and the protocols for gaining access to them  Mr  French was not accused of revealing the actual data At a disciplinary hearing  another commissioner  Dan Seamount  said that after he concluded that Mr  French had divulged the data s location   in the dead of night we moved the information to somewhere more secure   fearing that many people wanted to get to the findings and that  all it would take would be a bulldozer and 15 minutes    My policy is to tell no one where the data reside  not even what country it resides in   Mr  Seamount said   It is arguably the most valuable well information in the world   

This article is part of the Frank Bruni newsletter  You can sign up here to receive the free newsletter every Wednesday How do Democrats properly vet their candidates for president without cannibalizing them  How do they rightly insist on sensitive and inclusive leaders while making allowances for past mistakes  present quirks  human messiness and the differences in the conversation and the culture now versus 10 or 20 or 40 years ago That s emerging as a central challenge of the Democratic presidential primary  And it s worrying me I m worried because there was an actual mini debate on the left recently over whether Pete Buttigieg is gay enough  Do his whiteness  upper middle class background and Harvard and Oxford degrees nullify his experience as a minority and undercut his status as a trailblazer  This question is out there  in both senses of that phrase I m worried because it in some ways echoes an earlier question about whether Kamala Harris   whose father came from Jamaica  whose mother came from India and whose husband is white   is black enough And I m worried because of what Joe Biden is going through   because of the intensity of the censure that he faced after the Nevada politician Lucy Flores s allegation and because of the fixation on precisely what kind of apology he must issue  Get a more personal  less conventional take on political developments  newsmakers  cultural milestones and more with Frank Bruni s exclusive commentary every week  Sign up for his newsletter  Flores of course accused him of coming up behind her  touching her shoulders and kissing the back of her head  a gesture that s inappropriate and demeaning  Biden says that he doesn t recall the incident  from 2014  The media has given this breathless coverage I ve written that I don t think Biden  76  should run  for many reasons  including that someone in politics as long as he has been carries too much baggage  that Democratic voters have generally preferred candidates significantly younger than he is  and that he mismanaged and failed miserably in his two prior presidential campaigns But I feel just as strongly that Democrats need to show some proportion  realism and reason as they assess and react to candidates  or  in Biden s case  probable candidates   With Biden especially but with others as well  too many Democrats aren t doing that It s nonnegotiable that Democrats hold their presidential aspirants to high standards on issues of racial justice  gender equality and more  It s crucial that the party nominate someone who can credibly represent its proudly diverse ranks  But it s also important that the party not demand a degree of purity that nobody attains I m not recommending the Republicans  course in accepting and protecting Donald Trump  which was to bury principles so deep that they may never be exhumed  I m saying that to turn the Democratic primary into a nonstop apology tour when the nominee will be going up against a president never expected to apologize for anything is a risky strategy  It obsesses over the flaws in candidates who have many strengths  defining them in terms of what they seek forgiveness for  It blurs the line between job interview and inquisition  Taken too far  it rips contenders to shreds before Trump even takes out his scissors As for the mini debate about Buttigieg s gayness  it arose principally from this column in Slate  which included the following paragraph  A marginalized sexual orientation can remain unspoken and unnoticed for as long as a queer person desires  A gay man who conforms to a critical mass of gendered expectations can move through life without his sexuality attending every interaction  even after he comes out  Buttigieg  for instance  would register on only the most finely tuned gaydar  Most people who are aware of his candidacy probably know he s gay  but his every appearance doesn t activate the  Hey  that s that homosexual gentleman  response in the average brain  That doesn t mean he s not gay enough   there s really no such measure  It just means that he might not be up against quite the same hurdles that a gay candidate without such sturdy ties to straight culture would be  The author is asserting that Buttigieg  37  the mayor of South Bend  Ind   doesn t come across as particularly gay  meaning       what  That he lacks stereotypical mannerisms  That his voice isn t high pitched  I m kind of floored  because I and other gay people around my age  54  or older spent most of our lives educating people about the bigotry and inaccuracy of those very stereotypes and trumpeting the message   the truth    that gay people can be every bit as buttoned down and strait laced as  well  Pete Buttigieg  Now his divergence from those stereotypes is deemed remarkable and in need of dissection  Strange days indeed Also  I guarantee you that Buttigieg s adherence to  a critical mass of gendered expectations  and failure to  activate  the homosexual alert siren don t mean that being gay has been incidental to his life and is incidental to his perspective  That he didn t come out until he was 33 is all the proof you need that he wrestled privately with his sexual orientation and with fears about how the world would respond to it and to him And when I first met and interviewed him nearly three years ago  this is how he argued that Democrats should reclaim the word  freedom  from Republicans  who have tried to reserve it for their brand  You re not free if you have crushing medical debt  You re not free if you re being treated differently because of who you are  What has really affected my personal freedom more  the fact that I don t have the freedom to pollute a certain river  or the fact that for part of my adult life  I didn t have the freedom to marry somebody I was in love with  We re talking about deep  personal freedom  He sounds sufficiently gay to me  His powers of empathy seem plenty informed by his sexual orientation  And we need to stop making assumptions about how well someone can understand and address what minorities go through based on his or her looks or vocal inflections or anything of the sort  That s the quintessence of prejudice  And it s the antithesis of enlightenment The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think

ALGIERS   Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  who is now expected to resign this month after resisting weeks of protests  established himself by ending a ruinous civil war but came undone over corruption and economic stagnation Bouteflika  82  a veteran of Algeria s war for independence  has rarely been seen in public since a stroke in 2013 but held out despite mass demonstrations against his two decade old rule He had sought to fend off the wave of dissent that began on Feb 22 by reversing his decision to seek a fifth term  But he did not say when he would go  further angering protesters In a report on Monday  the APS news agency also avoided mentioning a date  but said Bouteflika would leave before his term ended on April 28  Two private TV channels said on Sunday he could step down this week A fighter in the 1954 1962 war to end French colonial rule  Bouteflika became independent Algeria s first foreign minister and one of the forces behind the Non Aligned Movement that gave a global voice to Africa  Asia and Latin America He championed post colonial states  challenged what he saw as the hegemony of the United States and helped turn his country into a seed bed of 1960s idealism He welcomed Che Guevara  and a young Nelson Mandela got his first military training in Algeria  Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver  on the run from U S  police  was given refuge  Cleaver held court in his Algiers safe house with Timothy Leary  the drug taking high priest of U S  counter culture As president of the U N  General Assembly  Bouteflika invited Yasser Arafat to address the body in 1974  a historic step toward international recognition of the Palestinian cause By the end of the 1970s  though  Bouteflika had fallen from favor at home and went into exile  He returned to public life when Algeria was being ravaged by a conflict with Islamist militants which killed an estimated 200 000 people First elected president in 1999  he negotiated a truce to end the fighting and wrested power from the secretive military based establishment known as  le pouvoir   the powers that be  Helped by oil and gas revenues  Algeria became more peaceful and richer  But it remains mired in corruption and political and economic torpor in a region where uprisings brought changes in neighboring countries With a cushion of foreign reserves and a population wary of major upheaval after their civil war  Algeria avoided the Arab Spring revolutions that toppled leaders across the region in 2011 But protests against poor living standards  the lack of job opportunities and services were common even before the mass protests  and foreign investors are keen for economic reforms that will cut the red tape that often hampers business THIRD WORLD S SPOKESMANSome biographers say Bouteflika was born in Tlemcen  western Algeria  and others give his place of birth as Oujda  just over the border in Morocco Aged 19  he joined the rebellion against French rule as a protege of Houari Boumediene  a commander who would later become Algerian president After independence  Bouteflika became minister for youth and tourism at the age of 25  The following year he was made foreign minister Dressed in the tailored suits and sunglasses fashionable in the 1960s  Bouteflika became a spokesman for states emerging from colonial rule  given added authority by the cachet Algeria had earned from defeating France Bouteflika demanded that Communist China be given a seat in the United Nations  He railed against apartheid rule in South Africa The invitation to Arafat to address the General Assembly was controversial  Only two years before  Palestinian gunmen took hostage and killed members of the Israeli team at the Olympic Games in Munich  Bouteflika watched from the chairman s dais as Arafat  a gun holster on his waistband  addressed the assembly in New York When pro Palestinian militant Illich Ramirez Sanchez  better known as  Carlos the Jackal   kidnapped oil ministers from an OPEC meeting in Vienna in 1975  he demanded to be flown with his hostages to Algiers  Bouteflika was shown on camera embracing Carlos at the airport before they sat down to negotiate the hostages  release RETURN FROM EXILEWhen Boumediene died in 1978  Bouteflika lost his mentor  He was replaced as foreign minister and an investigation was launched into financial impropriety  Bouteflika said the allegations were invented as part of a political plot He left Algeria in the early 1980s and settled in Dubai  where he became an adviser to a member of the emirate s ruling family  He returned home in 1987 but kept a low profile  refusing offers of government posts In the meantime  Algeria was unraveling  The military backed government annulled a parliamentary election in 1992 that Islamists were on the verge of winning  In the conflict that followed  whole villages were massacred and civilians walking in city streets had their throats slit Bouteflika  backed by the military  was elected president in 1999 with a pledge to stop the fighting  Against fierce opposition from the establishment  he gave an amnesty to militants who laid down their arms  The violence declined dramatically He won re election in 2004 and again in 2009  although his opponents said the votes were rigged  Through a series of ferocious turf battles with his security forces behind the scenes  Bouteflika had  by the start of his third term  become Algerian s most powerful president in 30 years He consolidated that power last year by dismissing about a dozen top military officers Little is known about his private life  Official records mention no wife  though some accounts say a marriage took place in 1990  Bouteflika lived with his mother  Mansouriah  in an apartment in Algiers  where she used to prepare his meals Age and poor health caught up with him  French doctors operated on him in 2005 for what officials said was a stomach ulcer  Leaked U S  diplomatic cables said he was suffering from cancer  He became weaker after his mother died in 2009 Bouteflika said in a speech in Setif  in eastern Algeria  in May 2012 that it was time for his generation to hand over to new leaders   For us

Four years ago  the news that the Oregon Shakespeare Festival had commissioned modern English  translations  of all of Shakespeare s plays drew headlines  and no small alarm  from purists who saw it as a kind of literary vandalism Now  the public will have a chance to judge the full fruits of the effort for itself The Play On  Festival  to be held at Classic Stage Company in New York from May 29 to June 30  will feature readings of all 39 translations  While some have previously had public readings  or even full productions  this is the first time the full Shakespeare canon will be presented  Read more about the Oregon Shakespeare Festival s project  The purpose of the project  Lue Morgan Douthit  the longtime head of dramaturgy and literary development at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival  explained at the time  was not to  improve  or junk Shakespeare s language  but to challenge a diverse group of playwrights to engage deeply with it  line by line More than half of the playwrights   who include Marcus Gardley   King Lear    Ellen McLaughlin   Pericles    Lloyd Suh   Henry V   and Mfoniso Udofia   Othello     are women or people of color  They were charged with considering meter  rhyme and rhythm  and conveying Shakespeare s meanings and metaphors in accessible and contemporary  but not slang y  English  The first rule was  Do no harm   No one felt they re going to out Shakespeare Shakespeare   Ms  Douthit said in a statement announcing the festival   Instead  the project asked what would happen if we weed and weave the language a little bit  If anything  I think we have even more respect for Shakespeare than we had when we entered this   Check out our Culture Calendar here  One thing the playwrights were absolutely not supposed to do was  fix  problematic aspects of the plays  inject political critiques  add or subtract characters  or adapt the story to new settings and situations  though participants may go on to do that on their own The playwright and performer Taylor Mac translated  Titus Andronicus  for the project  but declined to have his work in the reading series  according to the festival  Separately  he has written  Gary  A Sequel To Titus Andronicus   which opens April 21 on Broadway   A spokesman for  Gary  did not respond to a request for comment  Instead of Mr  Mac s translation  the festival will feature a  Titus  from Amy Freed  who also translated  The Taming of the Shrew  As for the impact of the project on the playwrights more broadly  Ms  Douthit  in an email  said it was too soon to tell  and also hard to untangle the various strands of influence  It has been an interesting couple of years for some of the writers   at least six of them are deeply engaged in writing for television   she said   That will certainly affect their playwriting too  I suspect  She added   One of the most moving aspects of the project has been watching playwrights and actors dive into the machinations of these large scale plays   

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  Los Angeles traffic is so bad that buses crawl along at less than 12 miles an hour  In San Francisco  car speeds have fallen to 10 miles per hour  And Seattle s streets are so choked the city needs to find ways to have fewer cars altogether Major cities across the United States are facing increasingly clogged roads and have had frustratingly little success in dealing with them  But now that New York has adopted congestion pricing in Manhattan  the rest of the country is far more likely to seriously consider embracing such a policy   even though it was once considered politically toxic  according to municipal officials and transportation analysts  New York s use of congestion pricing could be a game changer   said Travis Brouwer  an assistant transportation director in Oregon  which has considered congestion pricing for traffic jammed Portland  If New York City can prove that congestion pricing can work and gain public acceptance  it could give cities like Portland a boost as we look to introduce pricing  New York  the country s largest city  will charge drivers to enter Manhattan s most congested neighborhoods as a way to raise money for public transit and to persuade people to abandon their cars  The tolls are expected to start in 2021 Philadelphia is now considering congestion pricing for the first time  closely watching New York s move   to see how this can help improve equity  safety  sustainability and mobility   said Kelly Cofrancisco  a spokeswoman for Philadelphia s mayor  Jim Kenney Los Angeles and San Francisco are already conducting studies to lay the groundwork for congestion pricing  and Seattle s mayor  Jenny Durkan  is leading efforts to have congestion pricing in place by the end of her first term in 2021  It really does help to be able to point to some peer city and say  They re doing this and it s working    said Michael Manville  an associate professor of urban planning at The University of California  Los Angeles  who has advised Los Angeles on congestion pricing   At the very least  it changes the conversation in other cities  Not everyone is ready to sign up  Kathryn Barger  a Los Angeles county supervisor  has raised concerns that congestion pricing could unfairly penalize drivers in communities with limited public transit  where  driving isn t a choice  it s a necessity  A handful of cities in Europe and Asia already have congestion pricing in place  it has helped clear roads in London  Stockholm and Singapore  But it has also been assailed by drivers and critics as an unfair tax that hurts the poor Fueled by an economic boom  a revival of urban areas  a proliferation of Uber and Lyft cars and an explosive growth in package deliveries propelled by the rise of Amazon  the average speed in urban downtowns fell to 15 miles per hour last year  down from 18 miles per hour in 2015  according to INRIX  a transportation analytics company  I believe the time has finally arrived to explore congestion relief pricing in major cities   said Phil Washington  the chief executive of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority   Here in Los Angeles  our congestion challenges are just as bad  if not worse  than Manhattan s  ImageIn New York  Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio pushed the congestion pricing plan to alleviate traffic and to raise money to revive the ailing subway system CreditDave Sanders for The New York TimesHe added   We cannot sit idly by and watch it get worse  In New York  many details of a congestion pricing plan   including how much drivers will be charged   are still being worked out  The plan was the culmination of a campaign that started 18 months ago and drew transit groups as well as prominent business  civic and labor leaders  who saw no other way to tackle gridlock Gov  Andrew M  Cuomo staked his name on it and wielded his political power to push it forward  making it a centerpiece of the  175 billion state budget after past efforts had unraveled  Even Mayor Bill de Blasio  who had been lukewarm about congestion pricing and has had a frosty relationship with the governor  threw his support behind it  They had made the case that it was crucial for raising the money needed to modernize the city s crumbling subway system And city transit officials  facing a growing financial crisis  warned repeatedly that the alternative would be huge fare increases Congestion pricing s moment follows decades of failed efforts to unclog roads around the country  Historically  cities responded to congestion by building more roads or widening existing ones   only to find that those  too  became jammed  said Matthew Turner  an economics professor at Brown University As a result  America s roads are carrying more traffic than ever  The number of people driving to work climbed to about 130 million in 2017  up from 121 million in 2012  according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer  a research company  Of those  more than 116 million drove alone  and only 14 million car pooled  Just 8 million workers took public transportation The increasing traffic has been accompanied by concerns over health  safety and environmental implications  The number of pedestrians killed in traffic in the United States is approaching a three decade high Traffic woes have emerged as the underside of successful cities  The boom leads to an influx of new residents  businesses and construction  More than two dozen major American cities  including New York  Boston  Philadelphia  Austin  Los Angeles  San Francisco and Seattle  have more congestion now than a decade ago  according to an annual global traffic scorecard by INRIX The most recent scorecard found that congestion left American drivers sitting in traffic an average of 97 hours last year  up from 82 hours in 2015  That  in turn  cost the economy roughly  87 billion in lost productivity last year  up from  74 billion in 2015  according to INRIX  It only takes one car that doesn t get through an intersection to block two lanes of traffic   said Trevor Reed  an INRIX transportation analyst In Seattle  Amazon s relentless rise has helped to turn the city into a major tech hub  Now  major infrastructure and development projects are expected to lead to even more gridlock  As we build a city of the future  we must reduce our reliance on cars   Ms  Durkan said   My goal is to make our downtown core a healthier place for all with fewer cars  a more equitable transportation system and less climate pollution  Road pricing has been used on some American highways since the 1990s  with tolled express lanes   or so called Lexus lanes   built alongside regular lanes  offering a faster alternative to drivers who are willing to pay for it Cities are trying to figure out how to make it work on streets   There s a critical mass forming where people are saying   enough is enough    said Stuart Cohen  the founding director of TransForm  a California based group that released a recent report on congestion pricing   They ve tried everything else and nothing s working  ImageIn Seattle  the rise of Amazon has turned the city into a leading tech hub  but has also overwhelmed the city s roadways  prompting the mayor to embrace congestion pricing CreditRuth Fremson The New York TimesStill  Charles Komanoff  a New York economist whose models were used to develop the congestion pricing plan  said the idea of  putting a price on driving  clashes with America s car loving culture in which driving wherever the road may lead is often seen as the ultimate freedom  He compared pushing congestion pricing forward to  shooting a rocket to the moon    There s so much gravity   the forces opposing this are so powerful   it almost seems like defying nature   he said Oregon looked at congestion pricing in 2005  but  our traffic wasn t that bad  so people weren t willing to pay a toll to escape it   Mr  Brouwer said  But Portland has been gripped by congestion as Amazon and others have opened offices  State officials are seeking federal approval for what would be the state s first highway tolls on a seven mile stretch through Portland Congestion pricing has also been seen as a burden on drivers who are poor and have been displaced from downtown areas by rising housing costs  and now must drive to work because of minimal access to public transit  Social equity was the conversation stopper when it came to congestion pricing   Mr  Cohen said   In West Coast cities  equity is very high on the political agenda  But Mr  Cohen said gridlock also slows down the bus and transit services many poor people depend on  Congestion fees  he added  can be discounted or subsidized for impoverished drivers In Los Angeles  public buses traveled at an average of 11 8 miles per hour last year  down from 12 2 miles per hour in 2013  according to transit data  Mr  Washington said he wanted to use the congestion fees to pay for transit improvements and to cover fares so that everyone can ride free A spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said he has supported looking at congestion pricing  because it has the promise to dramatically reduce traffic and improve quality of life  Still  congestion pricing remains a tough sell  After a recent report by Boston leaders and educators that recommended charging  5 to drive in some neighborhoods  Boston s mayor s office said the city would not be implementing congestion pricing In New York  drivers would be charged for entering Manhattan below 60th Street  where the average speed for vehicles is down to 4 7 miles per hour  from 6 9 miles per hour in 1994 John Corlett  a lobbyist for AAA in New York  said the new fees could shift gridlock to other parts of the city if drivers bypass the central business district to avoid tolls   To say this is going to reduce congestion may be a false hope   he said But Sam Schwartz  an architect of the city s congestion pricing plan  said he had received calls from officials and others in more than a dozen cities that have been monitoring New York s progress   If you can do it in New York  you can do it anywhere   he said San Francisco is considering congestion pricing after trying other options to combat gridlock downtown  including expanded bus and rail service  installing dedicated transit lanes and added bike routes  said Tilly Chang  executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority  which is leading the city s congestion pricing effort  Everyone agrees there s a problem   Ms  Chang said   There are multiple views of the solution  But frankly  we ve tried a lot of them and they re not enough   

BRUSSELS   The European Union launched legal action against Poland on Wednesday that alleges recent justice laws undermine the independence of the country s judges and comes amid concern the rule of law is being increasingly abused around the bloc The EU s executive commission sent a letter of formal notice   the first step in legal action   to the nationalist government in Warsaw and wants a reply addressing its concerns within two months Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said disciplinary measures for judges contained in a 2017 law on the Supreme Court of Poland seem designed  to systematically subject judges to the political control of the executive  Timmermans said investigations that were opened since the rule change have  an obvious  chilling effect on the activities of judges  and this is incompatible with the requirements of judicial independence  He said the letter gives Poland a chance to explain or change its mind about the laws Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court established under the 2017 law is necessary to ensure the justice system applies in  equal measure to all citizens   including judges accused of wrongdoing As evidence of the problem the chamber is meant to address  Ziobro cited a case in which the Supreme Court acquitted a judge who had been seen on CCTV appropriating a 50 zloty   13  banknote Poland s government argues that the deep changes it has made to the judiciary were needed to eliminate corruption and inefficiency left over from the country s communist era  Critics say the government has used it to install ruling party loyalists in key positions The EU s move was the latest in a series of procedures launched against Poland that the commission insists is meant to safeguard the rule of law there  The commission has also launched similar action against Hungary Timmermans said Brussels believes it is time for a broader reflection on what can be done to protect democracy  personal freedoms and the justice systems of some EU member countries  There is a growing consensus that further action to protect the rule of law into the whole of the European Union is needed   he told reporters  Asked whether he is worried about the rule of law in Italy  Timmermans said   I do not see at this stage a systemic problem  But he did express concerns about possible back sliding on reform in Romania  particularly in the fight against corruption  I want to warn against any government action that would disrupt the Romanian judicial system by creating a systemic  de facto impunity for high office holders who were sentenced for corruption   he said   Such a move would compel the commission to act swiftly  Wednesday s legal action and warnings have been announced in the run up to the May 23 26 EU elections  Timmermans is running as a candidate to take over from Jean Claude Juncker as president of the commission    Monika Scislowska contributed from Warsaw

LONDON   Britain s chaotic exit from the European Union has cost the economy about 600 million pounds per week since the 2016 referendum  Goldman Sachs said on Monday in a report that underscores how Brexit uncertainty has dented investment The report found that Brexit had cost the world s fifth largest economy nearly 2 5 percent of GDP at the end of last year  compared to its growth path prior to the mid 2016 vote on exiting the bloc It has also lagged other advanced economies   Politicians in the UK are still struggling to deliver on that vote   Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note to clients  The resulting uncertainty over the future political and economic relationship with the EU has had real costs for the UK economy  which have spilled over to other economies  The U S  bank said Brexit uncertainty has been a major driver of economic output losses as they are concentrated in investment  Uncertainty shocks weighed on investment growth in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote  as well as more recently amid the renewed intensification of Brexit uncertainty   the economists said The bank s estimates came as data showed factories in Britain stockpiled for Brexit at an explosive rate last month  unlike anything seen before in a major rich economy and a prelude to a likely sharp investment shortfall ahead Britain s parliament will vote on different Brexit options on Monday  after the third defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May s Brexit divorce deal left it still uncertain how  when or even whether the UK will leave the EU In a no deal Brexit  a scenario Goldman sees a 15 percent chance of  UK GDP would fall by 5 5 percent and a  substantial  global confidence shock would see sterling depreciate by 17 percent European countries would be most exposed to this scenario  the economists estimated  and could see output losses of around 1 percent of real GDP  A Brexit transition deal would reverse part of Britain s economic output lag  with limited foreign spill overs  they said  estimating UK GDP would grow by a cumulative 1 75 percent and sterling would appreciate by 6 percent  A scenario in which Britain remains in the EU after all would see it fully recoup Brexit related output costs and drive a rebound in business confidence while sterling would appreciate by 10 percent Overall  the drag from weaker UK growth has been felt most strongly in countries with larger export exposure to the UK  such as Germany and France  the economists said  While a  deal  would certainly be positive for the UK economy  only  no deal  would trigger substantial spill over effects  with European countries being most exposed   they added   Reporting by Helen Reid  Editing by Josephine Mason  

LONDON   The eurozone economy received a double dose of bad news Monday as inflation fell further away from the European Central Bank s target and a closely monitored survey showed the crucial manufacturing sector shrinking at its fastest rate in six years The developments suggest Europe is struggling to cope with global trade tensions and the uncertainty of Brexit  among other things They are also likely to cause concern among policymakers at the ECB  In an acknowledgement of the more challenging economic environment  the ECB last month delayed the earliest date for any rate increases and announced plans to offer banks cheap loans Rate setters are particularly concerned by stubbornly low inflation even after solid economic growth over the past few years has helped lower unemployment to decade low rates Monday s official figures from statistics agency Eurostat showed consumer prices rose by only 1 4 percent in the year to March  down from 1 5 percent the previous month  The ECB aims for an inflation rate of just below 2 percent Stripping out volatile items like energy and food  the so called core rate was 0 8 percent year on year  down from 1 percent One factor that depressed both measures is the timing of the Easter break  which last year fell in late March and early April  That has implications for travel and tourism  such as the price of package holidays  That was evident in the fall in the inflation rate in the services sector  which fell to 1 1 percent from 1 4 percent  Next month will likely see some overshooting of 1 percent due to the Easter effect reversing  but the underlying story remains one of subdued core inflation as businesses continue to take higher wage growth in their margins because of global uncertainty   said Bert Colijn  senior eurozone economist at ING There was further disappointing news from financial information IHS Markit  which publishes monthly surveys into the eurozone economy that feed into the ECB s policymaking deliberations It found that the eurozone purchasing managers  index for the manufacturing sector   a broad gauge of economic activity   fell to 47 5 points in March from 49 3 the previous month  Anything below 50 indicates a contraction in activity and March s level points to a 1 percent monthly decline in output  March s rate is the lowest since April 2013 and stemmed from particularly weak levels of new orders  Looking at the forward looking indicators  downside risks have intensified  and the trend could clearly deteriorate further in the second quarter   said IHS Markit s chief business economist  Chris Williamson  Concerns over trade wars  tariffs  rising political uncertainty  Brexit and perhaps most importantly deteriorating forecasts for the economic environment both at home and in export markets  were widely reported to have dampened business activity and confidence

STRATFORD UPON AVON  England    What does a black man think has happened since South Africa had democratic elections in 1994  What does a white man think  John Kani  one of South Africa s most celebrated actors  posed the questions rhetorically  with characteristic gravel voiced resonance  while Antony Sher  another celebrated actor born in South Africa  looked on The subject  Mr  Kani s new play   Kunene and the King   which opened at the Royal Shakespeare Company s Swan Theater on April 3 In  Kunene   directed by Janice Honeyman  Mr  Kani  76  and Mr  Sher  69  reincarnate the black white divide under apartheid that dominated their youth Mr  Kani  who grew up in a township outside the city of Port Elizabeth  began to act in 1965 with a group that included Athol Fugard and Winston Ntshona  The three men began working on material together and wrote  Sizwe Banzi Is Dead  and  The Island   a pair of one act plays that helped bring the realities of apartheid to the world  it won Mr  Kani and Mr  Ntshona a joint best actor Tony Award in New York in 1975 When they returned to South Africa  they were arrested and placed in solitary confinement for several weeks  Ten years later Mr  Kani lost an eye  he wears a prosthetic one  after a beating by the police  He continued to write  and played South Africa s first black Othello in a contentious 1987 production In post apartheid years he became the director of Johannesburg s Market Theater and he has recently appeared in  Captain America  and  Black Panther   among other movies ImageMr  Sher  right  portrays an aging actor and Mr  Kani his caretaker in the Royal Shakespeare Company production CreditEllie KurttzMr  Sher grew up in a middle class Jewish family in Cape Town  and left South Africa at 19 to train as an actor in England  By the early 1980s  he was performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company  his breakthrough came in the title role of  Richard III  in 1984  He was awarded a knighthood in 2000  Kunene and the King   produced by the R S C  and the Fugard Theater in Cape Town  is set in the present  25 years after the end of apartheid   which did not  Mr  Kani suggests  mean the end of racism or injustice It tells the story of the relationship between Lunga Kunene  a black nurse taking care of Jack Morris  a famous white actor  who is terminally ill  but nonetheless preparing to play King Lear It s the second time Mr  Kani and Mr  Sher have performed together  in 2008 and 2009 they played Caliban and Prospero in  The Tempest   also directed by Ms  Honeyman Following a preview performance of  Kunene   Mr  Kani and Mr  Sher talked about their relationships to South Africa  and Shakespeare as a unifying force  Here are edited excerpts from the conversation How long have you known each other  Antony Sher In 1995  I was part of a workshop run by the National Theater studio at the Market Theater in Johannesburg  and I remember many conversations and meals  We had known one another a bit before  but that was the real meeting John Kani Tony was well known in South Africa because he was this famous English actor  We were proud of him  Then in 2008 and 2009  we had the chance to work on  The Tempest   During that time  I had an idea about a two hander for us  and we talked about it  Life went on  I didn t think about it  and then last year  the idea suddenly came back to me  I felt  We need to look at South Africa s democracy  We are littered with incidents  issues and geographical segregation that prevent us from becoming a united society  I wanted to write a story about two men who seem to be happy with what s going on  but when you bring them together  the rifts quickly surface Sher  Sorry to embarrass John  but he is one of my heroes  both as an actor and an activist during the bad old days  When he called last year  and said   We once talked about this  would you read it    I was very excited ImageMr  Kani  left  and Winston Ntshona in a 2008 revival of  Sizwe Banzi Is Dead  at the Brooklyn Academy of Music CreditSara Krulwich The New York TimesDo the different experience of the black and white characters in the play have parallels with your own lives Kani A good friend of mine  Barney Simon  once said you can t write a play  about   You must tell a story from personal experience  When that s in front of you  all these things come in  How many times do we pretend to one another with a Colgate smile  I decided to put Lunga in Jack s house  and see what surfaces Sher John and I went in completely different directions  I left South Africa and my South African identity behind  My family was typical of white families at the time  almost ignorant about apartheid  which sounds impossible  but it was true  When I became politicized in England  I couldn t believe that a Jewish family had made no comparisons between what had happened to them  with pogroms in Eastern Europe  and what was happening to black South Africans Life is a dangerous business and if it works out well  you mustn t regret  But I celebrate the way it has come full circle  that John and I can be in this play together  marking a moment in South African history Mr  Kani  what did you want to convey in the play  Is there a specific idea about what is happening as South Africa celebrates 25 years of democracy Kani I was 51 when I voted for the first time in 1994  and I look at South Africa through those spectacles  I see a lot of progress  a lot of good  When I talk to my son  who was born in 1994  he sees so many things that were not fulfilled in the promises that were made  There are still many South Africans who think they had nothing to do with apartheid  But I am trying to talk about collective responsibility here Sher What is clever in John s writing is that making my character an actor lets you assume he will be a liberal man  But he lets seep through a lot of old apartheid views  and he isn t overjoyed at sharing his home with a black man  Yet he depends upon and needs him so completely Kani Shakespeare is the link between them  what brings them together  even if South African history and politics divides them  The kingdoms that Shakespeare writes about have their parallels in the kingdoms of Africa What role can political theater play in South Africa today Kani  I still remember the moment when my teacher  Mr  Budaza  walked into class and said   Today we are going to study  Julius Caesar   one of Shakespeare s most important plays   That moment  and  hearing  Mark Antony s speech in Xhosa  are in this play  Shakespeare examines how democracy is built  In South Africa  now is the time for protest theater once more  

JERUSALEM   The Israeli army on Wednesday said it had recovered the body of a soldier who went missing in a bloody 1982 battle with Syrian forces in southern Lebanon  closing a famous case that has plagued Israel for nearly four decades Lt  Col  Jonathan Conricus  an Israeli military spokesman  told reporters that the remains of Zachary Baumel had been returned to Israel and identified after years of  significant intelligence operations  Conricus declined to elaborate on how the return was arranged or where the remains were found  saying only that  an opportunity arose to locate the body  through an unnamed country Baumel  a U S  citizen from New York  went missing in action along with five other Israeli soldiers near the Lebanese village of Sultan Yacoub Several years later  two of the missing soldiers were returned alive to Israel in prisoner exchanges with Syria  but the fate of the other three had remained unknown In a nationally televised speech  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Baumel s remains  along with his clothing and tzitzit  the knotted ritual fringes worn by observant Jews  had been returned to his family in Jerusalem Netanyahu said that Baumel was  full of Zionist zeal  that led him to Israel and to the battle where he disappeared  He recalled the pain of his late father  who  traveled the world to track down any peace of information about his missing son  Osnat Haberman  Baumel s sister  told Netanyahu   I told my mother years ago that it was not enough to want and to search  There needs to be someone with the winning card and now you have brought it  Cases of missing soldiers have a powerful emotional and political resonance in Israel  where military service is compulsory for most Jewish men  In his remarks  Netanyahu lauded the repatriation of Baumel s remains as an  expression of mutual responsibility and feeling of unity  that epitomizes Israel  He described the homecoming as a  moral obligation  to fallen soldiers and their families Anwar Raja  a Syria based official with the Palestinian militant group PFLP GC  said that insurgents excavated graves in the capital of Damascus last year in search of the remains of the three missing Israeli soldiers  He said that their remains had been transferred to Syria after the 1982 battle Lebanese politician Walid Joumblatt  a harsh critic of the Syrian government  hinted in a tweet Wednesday that Syrian authorities were responsible for the return of the Israeli soldier  Handing over the remains of the Israeli soldier through unknown mediators is a free and valuable gift to Netanyahu in his elections   Joumblatt tweeted Israel holds its general election next week  largely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu s rule Joumblatt poked fun at the Syrian government  adding sarcastically   Greetings to the Syrian regime that is spearheading Arab  regional and international rejectionism  The disastrous battle  which occurred soon after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  resulted in the deaths of 20 Israeli soldiers The military confirmed it was still working to secure the return of the other two missing soldiers    Associated Press writers Sarah El Deeb and Bassem Mroue in Beirut  Lebanon contributed to this report

MONTGOMERY  Ala    Alabama is the latest Republican leaning state seeking to enact a strict abortion ban as conservatives take aim at the 1973 U S  Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion Energized by new conservatives on the Supreme Court  abortion opponents in multiple states hope to ignite new legal battles that could prompt the justices to revisit Roe v  Wade Alabama lawmakers introduced legislation Tuesday that would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony unless the mother s health is in jeopardy  That comes after Kentucky and Mississippi approved bans on abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected  which happens as soon as the sixth week of pregnancy  Other states  including Georgia and South Carolina  could enact similar bans  The Alabama bill   HB314  goes even further  It would ban all abortions  even those using prescription drugs  as soon as a woman is  known to be pregnant   It does allow for ending a pregnancy when the fetus has a  lethal anomaly  or to avoid a  serious health risk  to the mother  but there are no exceptions for rape and incest  Any attempt to end a healthy pregnancy would be a felony  It simply criminalizes abortion   said bill sponsor Rep  Terri Collins  a Republican from Decatur  Alabama  said of the Alabama bill   Hopefully  it takes it all the way to the Supreme Court to overturn  Roe versus Wade   The text of the Alabama bill likens legalized abortion to history s greatest atrocities  including the Holocaust  The bill has more than 60 co sponsors in the 105 member Alabama House of Representatives Staci Fox  president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast  called it a  death sentence for women across this state   These bans are blatantly unconstitutional and lawmakers know it   they just don t care  Alabamians are just pawns in this political game to challenge access to safe  legal abortion nationally   Fox said  Georgia s governor is considering whether to sign a law banning abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected  More than 50 Hollywood actors  including Alyssa Milano  Alec Baldwin and Amy Schumer sent a letter threatening to pull business out of Georgia   a hub for television and movie production  if the ban is enacted A South Carolina House subcommittee passed a similar  heartbeat  bill on Tuesday Opponents say the Republicans are needlessly launching legal battles that will prove to be expensive and futile  Here s the problem  This bill is unconstitutional   Vicki Ringer  director of Public Affairs Planned Parenthood South Atlantic  said during subcommittee debate of the South Carolina bill   You believe that  Justice Neil  Gorsuch and  Justice Brett  Kavanaugh will save you on the Supreme Court  That court has already blocked an abortion bill  Collins said she s not concerned that her bill conflicts with Supreme Court precedent The  whole point is to get the courts to relook at this issue   she said   I think people are seeing a possibility that the Supreme Court might have a more conservative leaning balance     AP writer Christina L  Myers contributed to this report from Columbia  South Carolina

China s promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods  For Mr  Trump  this is an essential element that will help reduce the United States  record trade deficit with China     But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state  and most will be carried out by state controlled Chinese businesses  further cementing Beijing s role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese   Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by next week  to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He  the Chinese special

By threatening to close the border with Mexico and moving to cut off aid to El Salvador  Honduras and Guatemala   the so called Northern Triangle countries  from which many migrants headed to the United States are coming   President Trump is effectively shooting America in the foot  to paraphrase one expert Kevin McAleenan  the commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection  noted last week that the near record number of migrant families with children seeking asylum both at and in between official ports of entry on the southern border was stretching his agency to a  breaking point   This was made startlingly clear as photos of hundreds of migrants  including many small children  confined behind razor wire in a makeshift enclosure beneath a bridge in El Paso  spread quickly across the internet  The agency has since closed the holding area ImageKevin McAleenan  Customs and Border Protection commissioner  speaking last week in El Paso about the impact of the increase in illegal crossings along the southwest border  CreditJose Luis Gonzalez ReutersC B P  and Immigration and Customs Enforcement  both of which operate under the Department of Homeland Security  have taken steps to grapple with the increased flow of migrants  a vast majority of them families with children seeking asylum  The agencies have diverted resources and personnel to process and care for the migrants  even agreeing to release some families to American cities far from the border  We are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a C B P  facility   Mr  McAleenan said   But with these numbers  with the types of illnesses we re seeing at the border  I fear that it s just a matter of time  In an attempt to ease the problem  Kirstjen Nielsen  the homeland security secretary  signed a compact with officials from the Northern Triangle last week to help curb the complex drivers of irregular migration   including crime and gang violence in the region  Mr  Trump  less than a day later  announced he was ending aid to those countries  Nonsensically  Mr  Trump has insisted that the real problem is Mexico  which he suggested is doing  nothing  to help stop the tide of migrants  That s despite the efforts by Mexican leaders to intercept migrant groups  providing temporary visas to asylum seekers and allowing some making the trek north to remain in Mexico while they await court hearings in the United States As with the president s wall  which would do little to discourage unauthorized migration  let alone illegal drug trafficking  no one with a working knowledge of immigration policy believes that closing the border is a solution to the recent surge  The economic disruption for border communities and the impact on trade would be disastrous  Plus  closing the border won t stop migrants from stepping onto United States soil and claiming asylum  as many of the groups surrendering to border agents in recent months have done in between ports of entry What would help much more is action to address the root causes of the surge in border crossings  from reforming federal immigration laws to aid to improve economic conditions in Central America  And most urgently  Congress needs to come up with a more nimble legal framework to address the glut of asylum claims and more funding for log jammed immigration courts to process them  This moment calls for proactive measures   not incendiary policies that are destined to backfire RelatedMore on aid to Central America Trump Turns U S  Policy in Central America on Its HeadMarch 30  2019Opinion   Anita Isaacs and Anne PrestonWhat Trump Gets Wrong About Central American AidApril 1  2019The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email  letters nytimes com Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook  Twitter   NYTopinion  and Instagram  

FAIRFAX  Va    A Virginia judge on Monday temporarily sealed divorce records for Stephen Moore  President Trump s presumptive nominee for the Federal Reserve board  adding to the tax and child support drama surrounding the pending nomination A Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County issued a temporary injunction sealing the 2011 divorce records at the request of Mr  Moore s former wife  Allison Moore  The court order does not list Mr  Moore as opposing the request  The judge scheduled a Friday hearing on the merits of keeping the documents under seal Those records  posted online Monday by The Guardian  which first reported details of the divorce  show that a judge found Mr  Moore in contempt of court in March 2013 for failing to pay more than  330 000 in spousal support  child support  attorney s fees and a one time fee to his ex wife  Mr  Moore had failed to pay six consecutive months of child support   and only a small fraction of the nearly  19 000 a month he had agreed to pay his ex wife in the divorce settlement   at the time of the ruling According to the records  Mr  Moore failed to respond to repeated requests from the Virginia court to make payments and did not show up for a deposition in the case  The court ordered him to sell his home to raise money to pay the debt and forced him to set up an automatic bank transfer each month  After Mr  Moore paid  217 000 toward the debt  Ms  Moore asked the court to revoke the order for Mr  Moore to sell his home  which it did The divorce case is the latest twist in the nomination saga of Mr  Moore  who is in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over  75 000 in back taxes  which are related to his child and spousal support payments Mr  Trump said last month that he would nominate Mr  Moore  a campaign adviser who  like Mr  Trump  was a loud critic of the Fed s interest rate increases last year  At the time of the announcement  Mr  Moore had not been formally vetted by the White House  The administration has not yet submitted his nomination to the Senate In her 2010 divorce complaint  Ms  Moore accused Mr  Moore of  emotional and psychological abuse  during their 20 year marriage  and accused him of carrying on an adulterous relationship that he was  neither discreet nor inconspicuous  about  The complaint said Mr  Moore had left receipts for dinners with his mistress around the house and that he purchased a T shirt for his lover with the words  Doing It  In his response  Mr  Moore said he did not contest anything in Ms  Moore s petition Neither Mr  Moore nor Ms  Moore responded to repeated requests for comment over the weekend or on Monday Mr  Moore is a longtime champion of tax cuts  deregulation and other conservative economic policies  He is a former editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal and the founder of the Club for Growth  which advocates lower taxes  He has held shifting positions on monetary policy over the years  including endorsing a return to the gold standard and  when President Barack Obama was in office  criticizing the Fed for leaving interest rates low in an effort to stoke economic growth Since Mr  Trump took office  Mr  Moore has pushed for lower rates  In December  angered by the fourth rate increase of the year  he called for the Fed s chairman  Jerome H  Powell  to step down or be fired Mr  Trump has lauded Mr  Moore s views on the Fed  but it is unclear whether he could win Senate confirmation Last year  the I R S  filed a lien against Mr  Moore related to the  75 000 in back taxes  Mr  Moore  in an interview last week with The New York Times  described that lien as a  huge miscalculation  by the agency It is unclear whether the  75 000 tax lien relates to the child  and spousal support payment delinquencies laid out by The Guardian Mr  Moore said in an interview on Thursday that  for a single tax year  he had claimed both the value of his alimony  which at the time was deductible for all divorces  and the value of his child support payments  which are not  He said the child support amounted to about  18 000  which  given his tax bracket  worked out to about  6 000 in taxes that he owed but did not pay  He blamed the error on his accountant But Mr  Moore said he was not simply hit with a back tax bill  After an audit  he said  the I R S  deemed his return for that year  fraudulent  and disallowed other deductions  With penalties and fees  the amount came to more than  75 000  he said Mr  Moore said he and his current wife had tried for years to resolve the issue with the I R S   including dispute resolution  but had not heard from the agency in nearly two years A prominent critic of Mr  Moore s nomination  the University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers  said he was deeply troubled that Mr  Moore had been held in contempt of court given that he could soon hold a seat on the Fed  For a Fed governor  your credibility is an important asset   Mr  Wolfers said   Putting someone in a position of trust who has been in contempt of court could easily create difficult situations  particularly in an institution like the Fed  which at least during the crisis had to invent new responses on the fly while making sure they were legal  White House officials were adopting a wait and see approach on Monday before deciding whether to go through with the nomination  according to two people familiar with the discussions  who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal White House conversations Mr  Trump  these people said  remains personally fond of Mr  Moore and values his loyalty  but has been surprised by the criticism of Mr  Moore and the negative reaction among some Senate Republicans  who were angered by Mr  Moore s previous comment that the president should fire Mr  Powell for raising interest rates  Mr  Moore has since apologized for that statement Questions have also arisen over Mr  Moore s tenure at The Wall Street Journal  including whether he wrote editorials that referred to groups that paid him to give speeches In May 2013  for example  Mr  Moore spoke at the Civitas Institute  a nonprofit conservative research group in North Carolina  He was paid more than  3 000 for an honorarium and expenses  said Brian Balfour  executive vice president for Civitas  The next month  Mr  Moore wrote an editorial about tax cuts in the state and approvingly quoted Civitas s former president  In July  in another editorial criticizing liberal protesters at the state s capital  Mr  Moore cited a Civitas analysis of financial statements from groups supporting the protests According to a Journal spokesman  editorial board members are  allowed to accept compensation for speeches from nonprofit organizations if they are approved in advance and do not overlap with the member s coverage area  Mr  Moore s predicament did not come up during a round of discussions on Monday at the White House between Mr  Trump and his economic team  according to a person familiar with the discussion  who also requested anonymity  The discussions  this person said  were focused on rebooting a repeal of Obamacare and included a presentation by Kevin Hassett  chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers  warning against the possible damage to the economy of closing the border with Mexico Appearing on CNBC on Monday morning  Mr  Hassett was not asked about the records  but called Mr  Moore  a great guy  Mr  Hassett suggested that Mr  Moore would likely avoid the public spotlight in coming days  When you re getting ready for Senate confirmation  you have to focus 100 percent on that   he said   I expect that s what we ll see from Steve going forward   

President Trump said last week that he would cut off aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  the home countries of most of the migrants arriving at the United States  southern border to seek asylum The Trump administration has already taken the first step to act on the president s directive  notifying Congress that it wanted to divert the  450 million allocated to the region  By Monday  though  the administration had not offered details about whether any aid   such as military aid or support to combat drug trafficking   might be exempt from the order If the aid withdrawal does go ahead  aid advocates say  it would probably affect  the region s most vulnerable people  including small farmers struggling to adapt to climate change and teenagers pressured to join gangs in a region that is a major drug transit route  according to State Department estimates  Advocates say that  should these threats to lives and livelihoods grow  many more people will take their chances on the road and leave for the United States The decision to end aid is likely to provoke anger in Congress  where lawmakers in both parties have supported efforts to address the root causes of migration  If the money is ultimately withheld  it would affect a wide range of programs designed to improve citizen security  promote economic development and encourage accountable government Security and justiceMr  Trump has complained that the governments of the three countries have done too little to halt immigration  and portrayed the withdrawal of aid as punishment for their leaders A vast majority of the aid  however  goes to nongovernmental organizations  churches  charities and private contractors that carry out projects for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development  According to the Washington Office on Latin America  a human rights research group  the largest portion of aid has gone to improving security and justice systems  and to preventing violence Aid varies from country to country to address their different needs  In El Salvador  where the United States has helped support a broad antiviolence program  57 percent of the  149 million in aid allocated in 2017 went to projects intended to prevent violence  improve security and community policing  and train judges  prosecutors and public defenders In Honduras  where aid reached almost  182 million in 2017  the highest percentage of funds   some 44 percent   went to support programs that improved justice and security  with an additional 30 percent allocated for antipoverty programs among the country s rural poor The aid also supports anticorruption measures by providing funds for international prosecutors who have been investigating graft in Honduras and Guatemala  and a special anticorruption unit in the Salvadoran attorney general s office  In advance of Guatemala s elections in June  the United States has also helped finance the country s electoral agency The United States also supported border security and efforts to combat drug trafficking  though those funds accounted for a smaller percentage of the overall aid  The Pentagon set aside millions to improve drug interdiction and to supply equipment and training to counter trafficking in Honduras Economic aidIn Guatemala  poverty  rather than violence  is the main driver of migration  More than half of the  178 million in 2017 aid went to programs to alleviate poverty  particularly in the country s western highlands  where many children suffer from chronic malnutrition Economic aid is the next largest block of American support in Central America  after security and related programs  The funds support small businesses in Guatemala  schools in Honduras and job training for at risk youth in El Salvador  among other projects  Some of the programs are broader  such as an effort to bring down high power costs by connecting electrical grids and financing new infrastructure In 2017   18 million was allocated to help farmers in Honduras diversify their crops and improve productivity  to reduce extreme hunger and poverty  and  14 5 million to help small business owners  including funds to help create a sustainable system for cacao production In Guatemala that year  more than  10 million was designated to help communities adapt to climate change s effects   such as increased drought and coffee destroying fungus   and  6 3 million to help the Health Ministry prevent maternal and infant deaths  and prevent H I V  infections Changing prioritiesUntil a large wave of unaccompanied minors from Central America arrived at the Texas border in 2014  American aid to the region focused on economic growth and law enforcement  But the surge of child migrants  which was in part spurred by the high murder rates in the Northern Triangle  prompted the Obama administration to request more money from Congress for a broader approach to the region As a result  aid increased to  750 million in 2016 before beginning to drop under the Trump administration  Over all  Congress allocated almost  2 1 billion to Central America from 2016 to 2018  most of it for the Northern Triangle countries  though agencies have been slow to spend all the money Murder rates have fallen in all three countries but poverty remains as entrenched as ever   and it remains difficult to assess how effective the aid has been  particularly over such a short period  Advocates argue that programs need years to take effect The Trump administration has also redirected its emphasis toward security and away from the focus on ethical governance  That shift has taken pressure off Central American governments to become more accountable  and both the Guatemalan and Honduran governments have recently pushed back against anticorruption efforts  

TOKYO   The Nidec Corporation likes to say it makes everything that  spins and moves   from the intricate motors that whir in hard drives to the hulking ones used on oil rigs  In recent years  things had been going well for the company  Global demand for precision engineering  especially from China  increased sales for Nidec and other Japanese companies  helping to lift long sluggish Japan out of its economic doldrums  Then sales to China plunged in November and December as the country s economy slowed  Nidec  which counts on China for about 40 percent of its revenue  slashed its profit projections by more than 25 percent   I ve been in management for 46 years   the company s founder and chief executive  Shigenobu Nagamori  told reporters in January   and seeing our monthly orders plummet like this is a first  Japan s economic rebirth is in trouble  and China shares part of the blame  Exports have slumped  and companies that depend on Japan s fast growing neighbor are slashing profit forecasts and considering idling factories  Combined with other problems   including lackluster spending at home and an aging society   China s slowdown presents a major challenge to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his namesake economic program  Abenomics  as he prepares for an important national election this summer  Specifically  it raises questions about how Mr  Abe  who took office in 2012  can fix problems at home without the boost from China s powerful growth engine Japan s economy continues to grow for now  and the fate of Abenomics is far from certain  Still  Mr  Abe s political opponents are sharpening their knives   It s the beginning of the end for Abenomics   Yuichiro Tamaki of the opposition Democratic Party for the People told reporters in mid March The Abe administration points to signs that Japan s economy is still on track   We continue to see an increase in consumer spending and capital investment  which are pillars of demand   Yoshihide Suga  chief cabinet secretary  said at a March news conference   There has been no change in the moderate recovery of the economy  But even the government is wondering how much longer the expansion can continue  Exports plummeted starting in December  Industrial output fell for three months straight before rising slightly in February  The annual salary negotiations between Japan Inc  and unions ended with only modest gains after the government softened a pressure campaign on companies to raise wages In mid March  the government downgraded its economic assessment for the first time in three years  pointing to China s economy as a major factor Mr  Abe s economic proposals were supposed to lift Japan out of a slump that had begun in the early 1990s  They included what he called the  three arrows  of Abenomics  increasing Japan s money supply  raising government spending and proposing fixes to longstanding problems that discouraged companies from hiring and investing Pumping money into Japan s economy provided the quickest fix  Under Mr  Abe s influence  the central bank began printing more yen in 2013  The value of the currency dropped  making Japanese exports more appealing to foreign buyers  ImageA construction site in Jurong  in eastern China  in November  China s economic slowdown has shown how much of Japan s growth in recent years came from Chinese purchases of its exports CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesThe strategy added gas to Japan s export machine  Except for a brief downshift in 2015 when a Chinese slowdown hit global growth  Japanese sales abroad picked up speed  Nidec and many other companies like Renesas  which makes semiconductors  and Fanuc  which makes high end robots  enjoyed steadily rising sales  The easy money policy did little to help other parts of the economy  however  Longstanding problems like deflation  bureaucracy and a shrinking population added friction to the country s growth As deflation pushed down prices  companies struggled to increase profits  Deflation generally discourages consumers from making major purchases as they wait for lower prices and better deals  An entrenched and backward looking corporate culture made it difficult for Japan to keep up with the times  Many companies have resisted government efforts to improve corporate governance and introduce more women into the work force  leading to mixed results for Mr  Abe s initiatives  As a result  corporate oversight remains weak  And although more women are working than ever  the quality of jobs available to them is still low  Increasing government spending has also proved tricky  Japan has the highest level of debt in the industrialized world  so finding money to spend can be difficult  Mr  Abe has long pushed for an increase in the country s consumption tax to 10 percent to help finance public spending  But after a first increase in 2014  to 8 percent from 5 percent  shook the economy  the government has twice delayed the politically unpopular second round Should Japan s economy continue to weaken  a tax increase could do even more damage  Nonetheless  Mr  Abe has committed to the move  Economists say he has few other options   There s no space left for thinking up some additional policies   said Shinichiro Kobayashi  a senior economist at the research arm of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ImageShinzo Abe  Japan s prime minister  delivering a speech to Parliament in January  Questions about the sustainability of Japan s growth streak could undermine one of his signature accomplishments CreditFranck Robichon EPA  via ShutterstockThat means Japan s future growth may heavily depend on China As Japan s population has aged and demand has weakened  Japanese companies have increasingly looked to China to expand revenue  Growth in the Chinese middle class and the increasing sophistication of its manufacturing base have whetted the country s appetite for high end consumer and industrial goods  all underwritten by a cheap yen But in the short term at least  that demand  too  is weakening  In January  Japan s exports to China across a wide range of industries   from consumer electronics to the machines that make them   fell more than 17 percent from a year earlier  after a drop of over 6 percent in December  Although exports to the country rebounded in February  the gains did not make up for lost ground The sudden shift in the Chinese market has forced many Japanese companies to revise their earnings forecasts down  Consumer electronics companies and automakers in particular have expressed pessimism about market conditions  with flagship brands like Nissan  Nikon and Sony moving to temper investors  expectations for sales in the country It isn t clear when Chinese demand may bounce back  Beijing has pledged to focus on job creation  made more money available for its state controlled banks to lend out and promised to make business friendly moves like cutting taxes and red tape  However  the government reduced its growth target for 2019  saying it is seeking an economic expansion that emphasizes quality over quantity The picture has been further complicated by trade frictions between the United States and China  as President Trump s decision to slap tariffs on the country has squeezed Japanese companies with manufacturing there The trade war is  the biggest risk to Japan s economy   Mr  Kobayashi of Mitsubishi UFJ said Nidec is hanging its hopes for a turnaround on China s government  Beijing  understands the current critical situation well  Mr  Nagamori said  addressing questions about the future of his company s business in China   and we re sure they ll use every possible strategy to quickly work out a solution  In the meantime  he said  the company can t dwell on its present difficulties  If it does   we won t be able to respond when demand comes rushing back   Mr  Nagamori said  He added   We ll lose a big opportunity  Hisako Ueno contributed research  

BERLIN   Lawmakers are warning Germany s finance minister that they will block any attempt to invest public money into a merged Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank  a deal which could require up to 10 billion euros   11 2 billion  of fresh capital They intend to deliver this message at a closed door meeting next week with Olaf Scholz  although it is unclear whether the Social Democrat finance minister still plans to attend  The merged bank will probably need fresh capital  One thing that we will not stand for is that the state gives more money   said Bettina Stark Watzinger  who chairs the Bundestag s finance committee  emphasizing a hurdle to any deal Deutsche Bank s exploratory merger talks with state backed Commerzbank come after prodding by Germany s finance ministry  which is worried about the future of the country s biggest bank A deal would see Berlin become a shareholder in the combined group  which one German official said will need up to 10 billion euros of fresh capital because of restructuring costs and the fact that losses on investments could be triggered by a tie up  While German parliamentarians cannot stop the merger itself  they are warning that the Bundestag can block any fresh money to fill a capital shortfall  a crucial pillar to any deal  This goes contrary to one of the lessons of the financial crisis   that the taxpayer should not foot the bill for troubled banks   Stark Watzinger said A spokesman for Scholz  who was the first to publicly reveal the merger talks but has since sought to distance himself from the process  insisting it is up to the banks to decide on their future  declined to comment  as did Deutsche Bank  UNTHINKABLE Lothar Binding  a leading Social Democrat on the committee  also said the government needed approval from the Bundestag if it wanted to back the merged group with fresh funds  This would not be triggered if Germany s 15 percent Commerzbank stake automatically translates into a roughly 5 percent stake in the merged group  but approval is needed if the bank asks investors for fresh money  as expected  As things stand  it is unthinkable that the Bundestag would agree   said Binding   Any synergies in this deal would come at an immensely high price  huge unemployment  25 000 to 30 000 jobs could go  I m against a merger  Some conservatives are similarly opposed to the deal   We need competition in the banking market  not mega mergers   said Hans Michelbach  a lawmaker from the Christian Social Union  the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democratic Union   How on earth can we sell a merger with this bank to our voters  I won t support it under any circumstances  Frustration has been growing in parliament because lawmakers believe Scholz is ignoring their concerns Through its stake in Commerzbank  the German government would become a top shareholder in a merged group  playing a central role in any fusion  Lawmakers fear this puts it on the hook to shoulder losses if the bank later runs into trouble Berlin could yet pull the plug if it believes a deal would be politically unpalatable  This merger is rubbish  It will cost not only jobs but hard cash as well   said Lisa Paus  a Green party member of parliament  adding that she would reject any government participation in a capital hike   It is a running joke in parliament   Where is Scholz    she said  adding that his failure to explain the merits of a merger had infuriated many lawmakers   He doesn t speak to us    Additional reporting by Tom Sims in Frankfurt  Editing by Alexander Smith  

NEW YORK   With key federal funding nowhere in sight for a new  13 billion rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey  project organizers said Tuesday they are taking a hard look at whether to shift focus to performing major electrical repairs to the 108 year old tube It s an approach similar to the one taken by New York Gov  Andrew Cuomo with New York City s L subway line connecting Brooklyn and Manhattan  which had been scheduled for a lengthy shutdown this year  In January  the Democrat announced a plan to keep the line open by changing the nature of the repairs to the Canarsie Tunnel  which runs under the East River The Hudson River tunnel  through which more than 400 trains operated by Amtrak or New Jersey s commuter rail service pass each day  is at the center of a bitter dispute between the two states and the federal government over how it is to be paid for  Recently  the Federal Transit Administration gave the tunnel project and an associated rail bridge project in northern New Jersey low ratings that make them ineligible for federal grant funding Democratic members of both states  congressional delegations have accused the Trump administration of withholding money for political reasons  something federal rail officials deny Gateway Development Corp  board members overseeing the Hudson tunnel project said Tuesday that while they remain committed to continuing pre construction design and engineering work on the tunnel and reaching a funding agreement with the federal government  they have enlisted the help of the same experts from Columbia and Cornell universities who advised Cuomo on the subway project Both tunnels handle more than 200 000 passengers per day and suffered significant saltwater damage during 2012 s Superstorm Sandy  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved an initial plan to remove damaged concrete that lines the Canarsie tunnel and encases power cables  The cables would have been replaced and the wall rebuilt Under the new plan  cables will be installed on racks along the inside of the tunnels and the old cables will be left where they are  The surrounding concrete would be repaired and encased in a protective fiber reinforced polymer The Hudson tunnel s electrical cables also are encased in concrete that juts out from the tunnel walls  That part of the tunnel bore the brunt of the saltwater damage from Sandy  We don t necessarily believe that one size fits all   Gateway Development Corp  Chairman Jerry Zaro said Tuesday   We have a 108 year old tunnel and the cables are one issue  but we have many others  Racking sounds interesting  and it definitely warrants exploration and we are doing that  frankly  as we speak  The New York based Regional Plan Association  an urban research and advocacy organization that focuses on transportation issues  noted earlier this year that the cables in the Canarsie tunnel use 625 volts to power the subway  while the Hudson River tunnel s cables use 12 000 volts and are larger and require more protection  In the interim  we have to deal with the reality that we may have to consider some other options that are available to ensure the tunnels are durable for as long as possible   Amtrak Chairman Tony Coscia said Amtrak already performs maintenance work on the tunnel during overnight and weekend hours but has said that isn t enough to prevent further deterioration that could cause lengthy shutdowns  

Carlo Levi s memoir   Christ Stopped at Eboli   was a literary sensation in post Fascist Italy  First published in 1945  the book is Levi s memorable account of life among impoverished Italian villagers in the 1930s  Three decades later  an immersive and engaging film adaptation directed by Francesco Rosi enshrined the book s underlying neorealist credo   giving voice to the voiceless Originally made for Italian television as a 220 minute mini series  Rosi s  Christ Stopped at Eboli  was shown in the United States in 1980 at approximately half its length and under the title  Eboli   Considering the significance of the book and the stature of the director  the American theatrical premiere of the full version  now at Film Forum  is an event Levi   a painter  doctor and man of letters in his native Turin  was forced into exile in the southern hinterlands as a punishment for his anti Fascist activities  In the mid 1930s  as Italy prepared to invade Ethiopia  he was sent to a small town he calls Gagliano  his account of his yearlong stay there was written years later  in Florence  while he was hiding from the Gestapo  The book s title comes from a local saying about Gagliano s isolation  Eboli is the last station on the train from the north  not even Christ cared to venture this far south  Christ Stopped at Eboli  was published the year World War II ended  At the same time  Roberto Rossellini s  Rome  Open City  heralded a new naturalistic Italian cinema  and like that movie  Levi s memoir was an international success  A front page essay in The New York Times Book Review described it as sui generis  by turns  a diary  an album of sketches  a novelette  a sociological study and a political essay   Rosi gives  Eboli  a more straightforward narrative  juxtaposing everyday fascism with Gagliano s archaic ways  a populist historical pageant where modernity meets the medieval ages The movie was shot on location in the region where the book is set  Levi  Gian Maria Volontè  finds himself in a starkly beautiful and backward place  a crumbling town of cavelike quarters  The superstitious peasants  largely played by local people  live with their animals and a host of unseen presences   skittish angels  the mischievous spirits of unbaptized infants and Mussolini  the godlike figure who addresses them on the radio Soon after Levi s sister  Lea Massari  comes from Turin to visit  encouraging him to be engaged with his new neighbors  the movie erupts with ideas  If the first half suggests the neorealist Rossellini of  Paisan  in showing the condition of life in Gagliano  the second half is closer in spirit to his TV biopics  like  Socrates   in allowing the people to hold forth on their various philosophies  As Levi comes to understand the peasants  way of thinking  the movie becomes a series of disquisitions   including a drunken priest s Christmas Eve sermon opposing the Ethiopian war  Ironically  it s this victory in Africa that frees Levi to return home under a general amnesty  A brief coda shows him back in Turin  pondering his experience  This is a movie that repeatedly sends its audience back to the book on which it is modeled   Janet Maslin wrote in her Times review of  Eboli   That s not necessarily bad  particularly if the book is as rich as Levi s  But midway through  Rosi s movie is fully its own thing   a 20th century saga played out in a remote backwater and compressed into a single year

TOKYO   Japan s government said Tuesday that the official translation of the era name for the new emperor will be  Beautiful Harmony   setting off confusion while offices rush to make changes before Crown Prince Naruhito takes the throne The era of  Reiwa  begins May 1  a day after 85 year old Emperor Akihito abdicates and hands over the chrysanthemum throne to his elder son The cultural importance of the imperial family and the secretive naming process created a frenzy of attention for the announcement of the era name on Monday Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the name  composed of two Chinese characters  was taken for the first time from an ancient Japanese book instead of from Chinese classics  He said it comes from a section about plum blossoms in Manyoshu  a poetry anthology from the 7th 8th centuries  and suggests that  culture is born and nurtured as the people s hearts are beautifully drawn together  Abe did not say which of a range of meanings for each of the two Chinese characters applied to the era name Experts and media had a variety of interpretations of the meaning  and initial reports generally settled on  pursuing harmony   The first character can also mean order  rule  good or auspicious  The second can mean peace  reconciliation or soft A Foreign Ministry official gave the official translation Tuesday   Reiwa  is best interpreted as  beautiful harmony    said Masaru Sato  the deputy consul general and director of the Japan Information Center in New York    Reiwa  refers to the beauty of plum blossoms after a tough winter  and is taken to mean the beauty of people when they bring their hearts together to cultivate a culture  However  some experts said the first Chinese character   Rei   today is most widely thought to mean  order     command  and  dictate   with an authoritarian tone Historians and experts on the monarchy noted that an 1864 era name proposal of  Reitoku  using the same first character was rejected by the Tokugawa Shogunate  which said it sounded like the emperor was commanding Tokugawa  The name sounds as if we are ordered to achieve peace  rather than doing so proactively   Kazuto Hongo  a University of Tokyo historian  said on TV Asahi Yoshinori Kobayashi  a conservative cartoonist who has written books on Japanese emperors  said the character  Rei  portrays  the people kneeling down under the crown  It s meaning  after all  is a command of a monarch or a ruler      It is inevitable that  Reiwa  gives a somewhat cold impression  As discussions of the era name dominated Japanese newspapers and television talk shows  stores began selling Reiwa goods A bakery in Tokyo sold cupcakes decorated with Reiwa toppings  and sweet bean cakes carrying Reiwa logos quickly sold out at a souvenir shop inside Japan s parliament building  Some bookstores set up Manyoshu sections  and many editions of the anthology were out of stock on Amazon  Department stores were planning to sell gold coins emblazoned with Reiwa The announcement gives the government  businesses and people only a month to adjust to a change that affects many parts of Japanese society  though the emperor has no political power under Japan s postwar constitution  Era names are still widely used in government and business documents and on calendars  Many people use them to identify generations and historical periods Discussing an era change in advance was not considered a taboo this time because Akihito is abdicating  a highly unusual step

MOSCOW   The email came out of the blue  from an aide to the mysterious Russian billionaire  Oleg V  Deripaska  who is said to be close to President Vladimir V  Putin and an on again  off again character in the two year investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election Would I be interested in interviewing Mr  Deripaska  the aide asked  It was a bit like being summoned to meet with Greta Garbo or J D  Salinger Of course  I said  aware that Mr  Deripaska normally communicated  if at all  through the phalanx of lawyers and publicity agents he surrounded himself with  I wondered to myself why he had suddenly decided to speak out Soon enough  I found myself sitting alone in a hotel conference room  at a table bearing a gigantic fruit platter  unsure what to expect  This was  after all  a man who had emerged on top in Russia s bloody aluminum wars in the 1990s  and was accused in United States Treasury Department documents of suspected ties to organized crime  money laundering and ordering a contract killing He is a man of about average stature  whose most striking feature is his large  round head  He was intense  and spoke in a robotic English  so as not to worry about mistranslations  he said It soon became clear that he saw the determination of the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  that the Trump administration had not colluded with Russia  at least according to a Justice Department summary of his findings  as an opening to rehabilitate his image in the West This despite the fact that Mr  Deripaska had refused to cooperate with the investigation  revealing for the first time that he had received written questions from the Mueller team but had declined to answer them  Do I feel like your president  that I am exonerated   he said at one point   I never felt guilty  It was annoying for me  There was this huge crush on my business  on my companies  when sanctions were put on the companies I founded  ImageLike President Trump  Mr  Deripaska took a victory lap after the special counsel s report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election CreditDoug Mills The New York TimesOver cups of special black tea from his home region  Krasnodar  he complained of the tendency of the American news media to rush to judgment and professed confidence in the United States justice system  which he said would ultimately prove his innocence of any wrongdoing A graduate of a prestigious physics faculty  Mr  Deripaska rose to wealth in the 1990s  strong arming his way to a virtual monopoly over the Russian aluminum industry  When it placed sanctions on him and his companies last year  the Treasury Department cited his links to the Russian government  saying he profits from the country s  malign activity around the globe  Even while keeping a low profile  he pursued a costly lobbying and legal effort to assert his innocence  Initially  this revolved around sanctions on his businesses  and with the help of a global influence buying operation he did persuade the Treasury Department to lift sanctions on his aluminum empire in January Mr  Deripaska now wants to escape the personal sanctions  which hinder his ability to do business in the United States  Last month  he filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of those sanctions  which he claims have cost him  7 5 billion The conclusion that members of the Trump campaign had not colluded with Russians  Mr  Deripaska said  suggested the tide was shifting in campaigns of innuendo and guilt through leaks to the news media  If so  he said  the American justice system might also eventually clear him of other accusations never proven in court  such as ordering a contract murder  I always believe in justice   said Mr  Deripaska  whose lawyers have frequently fought to keep suits from being brought in American courts  saying they have no jurisdiction   For us outside the United States  Mueller signals that the U S  legal system is still alive  it still exists  Mr  Deripaska had faced scrutiny for financial entanglements with a former Trump campaign chairman  Paul J  Manafort  who in July 2016 reportedly asked an associate to offer Mr  Deripaska a private briefing on the presidential race  in hopes of settling a  26 million lawsuit stemming from a failed investment venture  The two had been business associates a decade ago  Mr  Deripaska had denied receiving the offer  but had not addressed these matters in detail while the investigation continued  There was a new reality in the U S  In politics  in social life  you do not respect presumption of innocence   he said  speaking of the sanctions imposed on him last year and leaks to the news media about the Russia investigation   There is no due process  Without any court  the public can consider people guilty of something  Mr  Deripaska was an early focus of the F B I  investigation into Russian meddling  In September 2016  two months before the election  F B I  agents questioned him in an early morning visit to his New York residence He declined to elaborate on the specific  written questions the special counsel later sent to Moscow  but said they generally tracked news media reports about prosecutors  suspicions  He did not answer on the advice of his lawyers  he said  Besides  he said   Why should I  ImageOnce business associates  Paul J  Manafort and Mr  Deripaska had fallen out by the time Mr  Manafort joined the Trump campaign in 2016 CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesMr  Manafort agreed to work for the Trump campaign for free  but did seek compensation elsewhere  In an email reported by The Washington Post  Mr  Manafort suggested to a former employee  Konstantin V  Kilimnik  that his dispute with the Russian tycoon might be resolved by offering  private briefings  about the campaign  Mr  Manafort also transferred internal Trump campaign polling data to Mr  Kilimnik  who the special counsel said had ties to Russian intelligence These circumstances still have congressional investigators alarmed   You might think it s O K  that the campaign chairman of a presidential campaign would offer information about that campaign to a Russian oligarch in exchange for money or debt forgiveness   Representative Adam B  Schiff  the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  said at a hearing last week   I don t  In the interview  Mr  Deripaska denied  as he had when The Washington Post first reported the offer of private briefings in 2017  ever having received from Mr  Manafort either an offer or any information about the campaign  For me  it s just absurd   he said   I had no interest in the U S  election  Why on earth  if I have no interest  would somebody offer private briefings to me   He last met Mr  Manafort in 2011  he said  It s not even sociable   he said of the reported offer of briefings   It looks like this  You haven t seen this guy  you know you have this huge sum of a dispute  and then you are like   Let s go and drink a cup of coffee   Mr  Deripaska said that he indeed suspended his multimillion dollar lawsuit against Mr  Manafort  but not because Mr  Manafort had asked him to do so or because he had received anything from the campaign chairman in return  My lawyers felt that might put me at risk  which anyway happened later  when Manafort appeared in the campaign   he said  referring to the eventual sanctions that came in 2018   They didn t want to bring more attention   to the business dispute with a man who had become prominent in American politics  he said  He later refiled the lawsuit In fighting to lift the personal sanctions  Mr  Deripaska must overcome years old accusations of ties to organized crime related to his path from the ashes of the former Soviet Union s aluminum industry to a billionaire with global reach  and allegations he is a front for the Kremlin on foreign policy matters Mr  Deripaska called these accusations  balderdash  and his lawsuit challenged the sanction on constitutional grounds  He also denied he is close to Mr  Putin  insisting he only deals with the government on matters of business regulation The conclusion of the special counsel s investigation  he said  gave him hope for success   I reaffirm to myself that the U S  systems  that U S  institutions  still exist   

SAN JOSE  Costa Rica   Back in Nicaragua  she owned her own home and made enough as an elementary substitute teacher and lawyers  assistant to eke out a stable  if not luxurious  life Now she spends her days on the streets in and around Costa Rica s capital begging for spare change and clutching a can decorated with Nicaragua s blue and white flag  an unmistakable reminder to pedestrians of the political turbulence that has claimed hundreds of lives in her native country  I never did this before   said the 53 year old woman  who asked to be identified only by her nickname   the teacher   for fear of retaliation against loved ones back home   We were modest   she said   but life  there  is cheaper  The fate of the estimated 50 000 Nicaraguans who ve fled violence and persecution for exile in Costa Rica over the last year is a central point in fledgling peace talks between Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega s government and the opposition  which is demanding guarantees for their safe return But while negotiators in Managua haggle over that and other thorny issues with little progress  many exiles are struggling  Some formerly middle class citizens are having trouble putting food on the table and keeping a roof over their heads  while others from the working class are reduced to living in near indigence The most vulnerable among them have become  the forgotten among the forgotten   said Esteban Beltran of Amnesty International Spain  who recently visited Costa Rica to document their plight Like many others  the teacher fled during the so called Operation Cleanup launched by Ortega last July  which the United Nations has termed a  witch hunt  aimed at suppressing dissent  In her hometown of Diriamba  paramilitary forces aligned with Ortega s government left a trail of dead and wounded  she said Her offense was feeding and supporting student protesters  One day as she brought them breakfast  gunshots rang out   I don t know how I m alive   she said   They were grabbing everybody  The only thing to do was run Like many exiles she ended up in La Carpio  a shantytown on the outskirts of the Costa Rican capital  San Jose  where the number of Nicaraguans has swelled since the protests began last April  though nobody s sure by how much It s a neighborhood of cement and sheet metal homes where sleeping quarters and a latrine often occupy a single space  Water is scarce  trash piles up in the streets and sewage flows in open channels  Even before the latest influx of Nicaraguan refugees  half of the estimated 18 000 people in the neighborhood lived in inadequate homes and 70 percent of households subsisted on less than  330 per month  according to a government study last year The  3 that the teacher is able to beg on a bad day isn t nearly enough and like others she relies heavily on aid from churches and help from neighbors who are in equally precarious situations  Still lacking a work permit after eight months  she s sleeping on the floor of a rented  300 square foot  30 square meter  house along with her two adult children  two grandchildren and six others from another family  On a recent day the only things in the pantry were a packet of pasta  a Nicaraguan flag and a Bible While asylum seekers are guaranteed the right to work  the sheer number of Nicaraguans has overwhelmed Costa Rica s system for processing such requests  Authorities are able to handle only about 600 asylum applications per week  and securing work permits involves yet another bureaucratic hurdle  So far only 8 000 have secured work permits compared with the nearly 29 000 who have received credentials as asylum seekers  More than 20 000 are awaiting appointments Last week Amnesty urged the Costa Rican government to put an aid plan in place for Nicaraguan refugees with help from the international community  including identifying the most vulnerable and fast tracking access to basic services they have a right to and may not be aware of  Costa Rica s government said the plan is ready and simply awaiting presidential sign off Ortega s government did not respond to a request for comment  Ortega officials have had little to say about exiles  though in a recent speech the president compared all opposition supporters to Cain  the biblical figure who killed his brother Abel out of envy Peace talks between Ortega s government and the opposition Civic Alliance began Feb  27  but progress has come in fits and starts  The government has freed more than 160 jailed government opponents to house arrest  but hundreds more remain behind bars under a slow release plan that s supposed to take place over 90 days On Friday the government and the opposition reached two accords  one of which supposedly restored the right to demonstrate freely   only for police to forcefully break up a protest the following day during which an apparent government sympathizer shot at demonstrators who sought refuge in a mall Recently the government also emphatically rejected calls for early elections scheduled for 2021  another central opposition demand So there s plenty of skepticism among exiles that Ortega officials will abide by another deal struck Friday  that Nicaraguans who fled can return  with full guarantees of personal and family security   In Nicaragua we say about Ortega   You may sign  but you ll never follow through    said Cesar Gutierrez  63 Gutierrez is a regular at gatherings where he and fellow exiles plan demonstrations  coordinate with government opponents back in Nicaragua  share news of home gleaned from the internet and gossip about the latest from the talks He said he ll believe Ortega is acting in good faith only when all prisoners are released and freedoms of speech and assembly are restored   two other core Civic Alliance demands  along with the annulment of trials  convictions and arrest warrants for government opponents  The disarming of the paramilitaries  is a must  Gutierrez added   because otherwise they are going to bully us  Then it will be the moment to think about how we return  Gutierrez  a former fighter in the revolution that first brought Ortega to power in 1979  later soured on the president  joined the protests and fled after receiving threats against his life and home  He  too  is living in La Carpio  taken in by a family friend who is letting him sleep in the living room of her modest home where seven others also live He scrapes by selling homemade cheese to fellow exiles after leaving his family back home and his businesses  a bakery and some billiard halls At least 168 Nicaraguan exiles are wanted due to their political activities  opposition leaders say Among them is Sadie Rivas  who slipped across the border in August after being accused of a laundry list of crimes more associated with a narco kingpin than a 19 year old college student  torture  terrorism  money laundering  drug trafficking  weapons possession  destruction of public property  disturbing the peace  Such accusations are typical in cases against protesters  and both they and international observers call them groundless Rivas  father and brother remain in hiding in Nicaragua  moving from safe house to safe house  Her mother joined her in San Jose after being targeted for arrest for sheltering and feeding her daughter    covering for terrorists   as the government charges An artist who made artisanal soaps and jewelry back home  Rivas and her mother now clean houses and wait tables  Like Gutierrez they re fortunate enough not to be living in slum conditions  but it s not the life they re used to  Rivas plans to return but thinks opposition negotiators at the talks need to be more aggressive  They have to be more demanding   she said   We exiles are an important element     Verza reported from Mexico City  Associated Press writers Carlos Gonzalez and Javier Cordoba in San Jose  Costa Rica  and Gabriela Selser in Managua  Nicaragua

ALBUQUERQUE   Mention the border with Mexico these days and dystopian images might come to mind  Agents detaining children in a holding pen  blimps hunting drones  the corpses of border crossers marking the frontier But even as President Trump presses ahead with his cry for a wall along the entire border   implying  yet again  that neighbors to the south threaten the richest and most powerful country on Earth   history offers other perspectives The photographer Tomas van Houtryve had in mind the nuanced past of what is now the American West when he set out on the border No  not the current one  but the long forgotten boundary that existed before the Mexican American War ImagePatrick Garcia  left  a descendant of Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo  a Mexican general who was taken hostage at the

Lake  right  near the early 19th century border between Texas  Mexico and Louisiana  2017 CreditTomas van Houtryve VIIMr  van Houtryve  44  wanted to challenge what he calls the West s  puffed up mythology  in which Hollywood nurtured the view that the expansion of the United States spread ideas like equality  liberty and democracy in conquered lands  In reality  these values arrived in the West straight from Mexico City   said Mr  van Houtryve  who was raised in California and now lives in Paris   The main ideological import of Anglo Americans to the West at the time was actually strident white supremacy  Before President James K  Polk prodded the two nations into war  Mexico was nearly twice as large and the border was some 700 miles north of where it is now  Mexico prohibited slavery  American slave owners wanted to expand the institution Then came the 1845 annexation of Texas  where American immigrants to what was then Mexico s state of Coahuila y Tejas had staged their slaveholder rebellion  The Texas Revolution s martyrs included men like the slave trader James W  Fannin A few years later  the United States orchestrated the war with Mexico that led to

have made its debut in Europe   Mr  van Houtryve traveled along Mexico s old northern border to meet families who have lived in the region for centuries His equipment in the Instagram age  A 19th century camera he found in a Paris antique shop  He stocked up on the glass plates and pungent potions needed for the wet collodion process  a technique invented in 1851 Doing so  Mr  van Houtryve conjures what the West may have looked like in the Mexican era in places such as Medicine Bow Peak  in Wyoming  and the Bonneville Salt Flats in northwest Utah Using 19th century technology requires meticulous planning  Instead of taking hundreds of digital photos in an hour  then sifting through the images  he takes about two in the same amount of time with the wooden camera  It puts your thoughts and intentions at the start of the process instead of the end   he said ImageIn 1540  Francisco Vasquez de Coronado and his expedition entered what is now the United States at this remote

capture the scenes of forgotten atrocities like the 1847 massacre by American troops of more than 150 Indians and Hispanics in the San Gerónimo church in New Mexico s Taos Pueblo  His work will be on display at the Photography Show presented by Aipad in New York from April 3 to April 7  and a monograph is scheduled to be published by Radius Books  this fall  Mr  van Houtryve also photographed people like Susan Calderon Belman  a descendant of Luis Manuel Quintero  a black man who was one of the original pioneers of what is now California As Mr  van Houtryve reminds us  most of the original colonists who founded El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angéles in 1781 had varying degrees of African ancestry  though public recognition of the city s Afro Mexican origins remains sparse Mr  van Houtryve  who previously photographed countries where communism endures in the 21st century  like Nepal and North Korea  said he embarked on this project after the 2016 election in the United States was marked by resurgent bigotry  With his pictures  he homes in on the historical amnesia that envelops not just the Mexican American War but so much else of America s past  effectively enabling our new era of intolerance This practice of remembering reminds us of the Americans whose ancestors never crossed the border with Mexico  It crossed them ImageNathan Alexander Steiner  left

PARIS   A landmark order from China for 300 Airbus jets signed during a state visit last week was bolstered by repeat announcements of dozens of existing deals and advance approval for deals that have yet to be struck  two people familiar with the matter said Echoing an umbrella order for 300 Boeing jets awarded during a visit to Beijing by U S  President Donald Trump in 2017  the headline figure for the new  framework order  for European jets was partly driven by political considerations  the people said The Airbus deal would have been worth some  35 billion at list prices but the amount of new business is lower  they added  Duplicate announcements included a deal for 10 A350 aircraft to an unnamed buyer  which represents a repeat announcement of an order for 10 jets by Sichuan Airlines at an air show last year The disclosure takes some of the shine off an announcement widely regarded as the economic highlight of a trip to Europe by Chinese President Xi Jinping  Nonetheless the deal marked a return to the aircraft market by China s state buying agency after a pause of over a year during global trade tensions The overall figure of 300 was introduced late in the process and after Xi s visit was underway  although plane orders typically take months to negotiate  one of the people said Airbus declined to comment on detailed orders but left open the possibility that the large total contained gaps The agreement  creates the approval framework for aircraft ordered by Chinese airlines  be it existing orders or future orders   a spokesman said TRADE TIESAirbus shares fell 0 7 percent on Tuesday  extending earlier losses after Reuters reported gaps in the China deal  Airbus  stock had risen almost two percent after China s mega order  signed in Paris on March 25 in front of Xi and French President Emmanuel Macron Industry sources say major planemakers play by similar rules when selling to China  where they face a two tier system of negotiations with airlines within a framework of state backed umbrella deals that may be influenced by geopolitics But the headline figures for new orders during high profile diplomatic visits  which for several years hovered around 150 aircraft for both Airbus and Boeing  have increased as trade ties between Washington and China go through highs and lows In November 2017  months before a trade war erupted with the imposition of tariffs  China announced an order for 300 Boeing jets during a visit to Beijing by U S  President Donald Trump Analysts expressed doubts at the time over how much of that was new business  and said part of the announcement represented renewed government support for deals already on Boeing s books  The most recent Airbus and Boeing deals followed a similar pattern   said a China aircraft industry specialist Boeing is now seen as next in line to secure a 200 300 plane order as part of a possible economic truce being negotiated to end the trade war  but the recent grounding of one of its jets has cast uncertainty over the timing of the deal Boeing and Airbus compete fiercely to serve the needs of the world s fastest growing airplane market  while bracing for future competition from China s own aerospace industry  Analysts say Beijing tends over time to balance U S  and European purchases  though recent years have seen the rise of a growing number of independent Chinese leasing companies and an increase in autonomous decision making by several airlines   Reporting by Tim Hepher  Additional reporting by Marine Pennetier  Editing by Sudip Kar Gupta and Richard Lough  

To the Editor Re  N R A  s Next Target  Violence Against Women Act   news article  April 2  It s hard to imagine what the National Rifle Association was thinking by targeting the Violence Against Women Act  Can it truly believe that an angry  jealous  stalking  abusing  assaulting  drunk  dismissed man with a gun isn t dangerous  Really Can it really believe that this position will be well received  Can any Republican or Democrat want his or her name associated with this position  In an America where the  MeToo movement has raised the consciousness of everyone  where the names of sexual abusers make headlines  where students are rallying against the use of guns  where parents grieve the loss of children  where places of worship and entertainment are targets of gun violence  the N R A  s position is arrogant  inexcusable and dangerous and needs to be challenged on Capitol Hill and in statehouses across the country Doris FenigBoca Raton  Fla  

If you find plausible psychology aggravating and a humane outlook just rubs you the wrong way  please meet John Webster  A playwright with a deep devotion to gore  he churned out some of the 17th century s most lurid tragedies and there was nothing   books  a helmet  a tennis racket  a fart   that he didn t long to empoison   The urchin from  Shakespeare in Love  who liked to torture mice  That s him   Red Bull Theater resurrects his 1612 play   The White Devil  with mischief and raunch and sibling incest and maybe necrophilia  because hey  why not  Anyone expecting Shakespeare might see if the box office does refunds T S  Eliot famously credited Webster as showing the skull beneath the skin  The director Louisa Proske s production shows some skin  too  The set thrusts impudently into the audience and the costumes  by Beth Goldenberg  look like knock off Versace  appropriate to this sleazy imagined Padua  Here  the Duke of Brachiano  Daniel Oreskes  is infatuated with Vittoria Corombona  Lisa Birnbaum     The White Devil  was based on a true story  Like a lot of its characters  that basis is loose   The snag  They re both married to other people  The solution  Murder  In a Webster play  murders are like jelly beans  Who can stop at just one In the play s first half  Ms  Proske doesn t seem to have decided how seriously she should take Webster s mad  bad world  But in the second half  more enjoyable  she seems to have figured out that just because everyone and everything is terrible doesn t mean we can t party down  The play bops from one shockaroo to the next  indicting religion  politics and the patriarchy  when it s not busy with the blood packs  Sometimes the staging is too much   there are some terrible video sequences and then some better ones   but typically it s stylish and spry Webster s verse is a blunt  evocative instrument  Though Ms  Proske could have cut some of the more obscure lines  the figurative language catches the ear like a barbed hook  Characters speak of the  soft down of an insatiable bed   of poison under  gilded pills   of playing football with severed heads  If there had been psychoanalysts in 17th century England  they would have had a field day with this stuff Certainly the cast has a nice wallow  A couple of the more seasoned actors  like Jenny Bacon  who plays the duke s not long for this world duchess  T  Ryder Smith who plays her conniving brother  and Derek Smith who plays both Vittoria s doomed husband and then her murderer  are able to layer three or four big  distinct emotions onto each line  to meet the play s extravagances with energy and rigor Because if the play is incontrovertibly over the top  decadent and then some   I mean  the revenge plot even enlists the pope   it has its own complexities  Are the murders meant to condemn immorality or celebrate it  You tell me  And in the character of Vittoria  whom Ms  Birnbaum embodies with vigor and a high ponytail  he has created  with obvious ambivalence  a singular antiheroine  His Vittoria is both a protofeminist who outargues the men around her   I scorn to hold my life At yours  or any man s entreaty  sir   and a  strumpet   a  whore  who meets a stabby end  unmourned Nihilism can leave a bitter taste in your mouth  but Webster is such fun to bite into  an invitation to revel in people at their very worst  to taste depravity  If that depravity leaves you feeling a little dirty  isn t that the point  As the cardinal says   Dost thou imagine  thou canst slide on blood  And not be tainted   Exactly

LONDON   Britain s economy looks likely to shrink over the coming months  after Brexit worries caused the dominant services sector to contract for the first time in nearly three years  a survey showed on Wednesday The IHS Markit CIPS Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI   a survey of services ranging from giant banks to high street hairdressers  tumbled to 48 9 in March from 51 3 in February  weaker than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists  The PMI  a closely watched barometer of the economy s health  is now below 50 and in contractionary territory for the first time since July 2016  immediately after Britons voted to leave the European Union  Amid all the noise in Westminster  the latest Markit CIPS PMI makes it clear the economy is being hit hard   ING economist James Smith said in a note Britain s economy has been sluggish since the 2016 Brexit referendum and saw its weakest expansion in six years in 2018  even though unemployment fell to its lowest in more than 40 years  The slowdown in the global economy has also weighed on growth  But until now few surveys have pointed to an outright contraction in the world s fifth largest economy Britain had been due to leave the EU on March 29  but parliament repeatedly opposed the Brexit deal Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated with Brussels  There were widespread reports that domestic political uncertainty had constrained demand in March  with clients hoping for clarity about Brexit outcomes before committing to new projects   IHS Markit said  Late on Tuesday  May said she would seek another Brexit delay to try to reach an agreement with Jeremy Corbyn  the opposition Labour Party leader  a last ditch gambit to break an impasse over Britain s departure that enraged many in her party Sterling dipped after the PMI release  to  1 3156 compared with  1 3175 beforehand  but it quickly recouped losses as traders focussed on the outcome of the talks between May and Corbyn  A broader PMI released this week  including manufacturing and construction data  also fell to its lowest since July 2016  It escaped outright contraction only because firms bought more raw materials to prepare for a potentially disorderly Brexit   A stalling of the economy in the first quarter will     likely turn into a downturn in the second quarter unless demand revives suddenly  which given the recent escalation of Brexit uncertainty  seems highly improbable   IHS Markit said But some economists cautioned that past PMIs had tended to be too downbeat when economic uncertainty has been high  GDP growth probably is holding up a little better than the PMIs imply   said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics  Unlike in 2016  when demand rebounded rapidly after the initial shock of the referendum result  British businesses have now reported falling orders for the past three months  the longest such run since the depths of a recession in 2009 Last week  the head of the British Chambers of Commerce said business was angry with politicians for  chasing rainbows  rather than accepting that some Brexit goals were unrealistic And in news likely to depress growth this month  carmakers BMW and Peugeot said May s delay to Brexit had come too late for them to cancel stoppages at their British factories  which they had planned because of fears of parts shortages after Brexit ING s Smith pointed to further uncertainties  including another extension of the Brexit date   While this would give firms a temporary reprieve from the  no deal  risk  we suspect companies will continue to make their preparations for this scenario   he said   All of this is costly  and we think under the scenario of a long extension  growth would continue to suffer     Reporting by David Milliken  additional reporting by Catherine Evans  editing by Larry King

TOKYO   Japan s government has unveiled an era name   Reiwa   or  pursuing harmony   for soon to be Emperor Naruhito  who will succeed the Chrysanthemum throne on May 1  His father  Emperor Akihito  is abdicating  with his  Heisei  era coming to an end the day before  A selection of the name was a top secret and the decision comes after highly guarded closed meetings and intense media speculation On Monday  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ultra conservative government chose the name for the first time from an ancient Japanese document  breaking with the tradition of taking them from Chinese classic literature  a step seen as reflecting Abe s attempt to bolster national pride Some questions and answers regarding the process of picking an era name    WHAT IS THE ERA NAME The era name  or  gengo   is a 1 400 year old Japanese tradition tied to emperors  reigns to showcase their power  The names change when a new emperor takes the throne  It becomes an emperor s official posthumous name   Akihito s father  Hirohito  is now named after his era   Showa  Originally a Chinese tradition  the era name is made of two Chinese characters taken from classic Chinese literature  Japan adopted the system in 645 and has since had 247 eras  including Akihito s 1989 2019  Heisei   which means  achieving peace   Showa is the longest era  at 64 years  Akihito s Heisei is the first decided by the government under the postwar constitution  in which the emperor is stripped of political power and had no say over the choice Still  the government  with its highly secretive and sensitive handling of the process  is underscoring that  the emperor has power in an invisible  subtle way   said Hirohito Suzuki  a Toyo University sociologist    HOW WIDELY IS THE ERA NAME USED The era name is only for domestic use  Although its use is not compulsory  Japanese government offices and businesses still widely use the system in official documents  coins  calendars and for other paperwork  Middle age to elderly people often use  gengo  to identify their generations  while younger people prefer the Western calendar over the era name as conversions are cumbersome in a highly globalized and digitalized society Popularity of era names has dropped to less than half over the past four decades since the late 1970s  Though impractical  the era name is considered Japan s traditional culture and is expected to continue despite persistent calls by some to abolish it    WHO DECIDES THE ERA NAME AND HOW The procedures to change the era name is based on a 1979 law  with the government picking a team of experts on classical literature in Chinese to find and nominate several names each for top officials to review  It is a complicated process that must meet certain criteria   easy to read and write but not commonly or previously used  Japanese media have been scrambling to get scoops out  The names of the scholars and their nominations have been and will be classified for decades On Monday  Abe s government chose the name drawn from Japan s oldest poetry book   Manyoshu  from the 7th century  breaking with Japan s 1 400 year old tradition   a step seen reflecting Abe s attempt to bolster national pride that he says was weakened by war guilt campaigns during U S  occupation after Japan s World War II defeat    WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE ERA NAME CHANGES A change of an era name causes a major hassle for government offices and businesses  which have to revise computer systems and software  It also leads to printing new train tickets  stamps  coins  receipts and calendars  The new era name was announced a month ahead of the start of Naruhito s reign to allow for time to adjust Because of a festive mood surrounding the upcoming era change  the event is also creating businesses for both the outgoing and the incoming eras  The abdication and succession events that come in the middle of the annual  golden week  expand the holidays to 10 days  bolstering tourism and other consumer spending     

LONDON   British lawmakers wrested control of the Brexit process for a second day on Monday in order to try to find a majority for an alternative way forward that could break the parliamentary deadlock over Prime Minister Theresa May s proposed deal The first phase of so called indicative votes held on March 27 did not show majority support for any options  but lawmakers hope a second round  on a narrower range of options  could see parliament coalesce behind a way forward  Since the last round of votes  May s deal has been rejected for a third time  Below is how the process will work WHAT OPTIONS COULD BE VOTED ON Last week  speaker John Bercow selected eight Brexit options to be put to a vote  from a list of 16 proposals put forward by lawmakers Lawmakers put forward nine proposals for Monday and Bercow chose the below four to be voted on  C  Customs Union   Kenneth ClarkeCalls on the government to ensure any Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration negotiated with the EU includes a commitment to negotiate a permanent and comprehensive UK wide customs union  and to enshrine this aim in law The same proposal from Clarke last week was rejected by just 6 votes  with 265 lawmakers supporting it and 271 opposing it D  Common Market 2 0   Nick BolesCalls for an enhanced Norway style deal which would include membership of the EU s single market as well as a customs arrangement with the EU While Boles has tweaked some of the detail  a broadly similar proposal he put forward last week was supported by 189 lawmakers and opposed by 283 E  Confirmatory public vote   Peter KyleCalls for a confirmatory referendum to approve Brexit deal before it is ratified by parliament The same proposal  then put forward by Labour lawmaker Margaret Beckett  was supported by 268 lawmakers and opposed by 295 G  Parliamentary Supremacy   Joanna CherrySays that if Britain has not ratified an exit deal within two days of the day it is due to leave the EU  the government should seek a further extension to the Article 50 negotiating period If a Brexit delay has not been agreed by the day before exit day  the government should seek parliament s approval for leaving without a deal and if that approval is not given  the government should revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit  This is an expanded  more detailed version of a proposal put forward by Cherry last week  That proposal was supported by 184 lawmakers and opposed by 293  For more details of each  https   publications parliament uk pa cm201719 cmagenda OP190401 pdf https   publications parliament uk pa cm201719 cmagenda OP190401 pdf HOW WILL LAWMAKERS VOTE The options selected by the Speaker will be printed on a ballot paper and lawmakers will be asked to vote  aye  or  no  to each of them  They will be able to vote for as many of the proposals as they wished WHAT TIME WILL THE RESULT BE ANNOUNCED The debate is due to end at 1900 GMT and lawmakers will then be given 30 minutes to record their votes  The Speaker will announce the results once they have been counted  Last week this took just over two hours DO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE TO ACCEPT THE RESULT The votes are not binding on the government  but Justice minister David Gauke said on Sunday that it would have to  consider very carefully the will of parliament  Asked if May would have to go back to Brussels and seek a customs union if parliament voted for it  Gauke said   If parliament is voting overwhelmingly against leaving the European Union without a deal but is voting in favor of a softer Brexit  then I don t think it is sustainable to say we will ignore parliament s position and leave without a deal  Oliver Letwin  the Conservative lawmaker behind the process of votes  has previously said that if parliament succeeded in finding a majority for a way forward  he hoped the government would accept that outcome but if it did not  then lawmakers would bring forward legislation seeking to force it to do so He has set out plans for lawmakers to take control of parliamentary time again on April 3   Additional reporting by Elizabeth Piper  editing by Guy Faulconbridge

ISTANBUL   Even before the important election of Istanbul s mayor has been settled  the opposition candidate  who claims to have won  is challenging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by pressing ahead with his promise to have an independent audit of the city s books Mr  Erdogan and his party have been in control of the city since 2002  and analysts and opponents say they have warped the economy through kickbacks and crony schemes  There has not  however  been real proof of this Now  Mr  Erdogan s party is demanding a recount of the vote  The opposition candidate  Ekrem Imamoglu  says this is a delaying tactic  And  at a news briefing on Wednesday  he said the party was trying to erase town hall records from computers before he takes over and brings in independent auditors to examine the city s books His promise of an audit dramatically raises the stakes for Mr  Erdogan  who was confronted with a stunning electoral defeat Sunday night  when his Justice and Development Party  or AKP  was shown to be losing the contests for mayor in both Ankara and Istanbul At the Wednesday news briefing  Mr  Imamoglu said he had evidence that the Istanbul municipality had applied to a technical company for help in deleting data from its computers  In comments on Tuesday he had appealed to city workers to do the correct thing and not destroy government property  There are many issues   he said   When the day comes  once authorized  we will go there and we will start sharing them with the public  Mr  Imamoglu said he wanted the audit to examine not only the municipality s budget  but also private companies that serve as subsidiaries and partners to the municipality  This is the soft belly of AKP   Bahadir Ozgur  a business columnist  wrote Tuesday in the online newspaper Gazete Duvar The  AKP style municipal work  would end  he added  when independent auditors entered the town hall and  name by name expose how much money was transferred to whom  whose relative  brother  uncle won which bid  Mr  Erdogan s party has yet to cede to the opposition  and the High Election Council has yet to certify the results of Sunday s election  Opposition officials have said the legal process could take a week or more Mr  Imamoglu demanded a swift declaration of the results   We want justice   he said on Wednesday   We want our election certificate  ImageBillboards reading  Thank You Istanbul  had been put up on behalf of President Erdogan and his party  so confident were they of success in Sunday s mayoral vote  Current tallies show they lost CreditBulent Kilic Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesHe accused the AKP of playing for time and suggested the delaying tactics were partly to clean traces of their misdeeds  He promised new rules of transparency and international standards of accounting when he took over  This process here absolutely requires transparency   he told a news briefing on Monday   If you are going to govern Istanbul  which is a city of 16 million  you have to develop an exemplary model  and this is what I am aiming for  Mr  Imamoglu s opponent  former Prime Minister Binali Yidlirim  accused him Wednesday evening of trying to gain support abroad by stirring controversy   You do not have the right to tamper with the nerves of the nation   he said Mr  Erdogan had surprised many with the ferocity of his campaign in the local elections in Istanbul and Ankara  and some analysts have pointed to the importance of the big cities as a source of wealth for his network of family and friends Huge billboards of Mr  Erdogan and his candidate for Istanbul mayor  Binali Yildirim  thanking the public for their votes  have gone up around the city since Sunday night  a sign the party had been confident that their candidate would win  What makes the loss heavy is actually a secret known by everyone   Cigdem Toker  an investigative reporter with the fiercely opposition newspaper  Sozcu  wrote in a column on Wednesday She added that Istanbul and Ankara were important to Mr  Erdogan s party because  they are the centers of distributing financial resources   We are talking about tens of thousands of bids  public resources that can be identified with hundreds of billions  and the authority to spend them   wrote Ms  Toker  who is facing several court cases brought by Mr  Erdogan s government for her investigative reporting A new administration in Istanbul could end the flow of major city contracts for construction projects and city services that have been granted to favored businessmen A new administration could also end payments worth millions of dollars to endowments of charities and foundations run by the Erdogan family In January  Ms  Toker published details of payments made in 2018 by the Istanbul metropolitan municipality to foundations and charities run by Mr  Erdogan s children and their spouses Ms  Toker wrote that TUGVA  the Turkish Youth Foundation  received 74 million lira  or approximately  13 million by current exchange rates  that year from the municipality  Bilal Erdogan  Mr  Erdogan s younger son  sits on TUGVA s board ImagePresident Erdogan at a news conference in Istanbul on Sunday CreditMurad Sezer ReutersThe Archers Foundation  an archery sports club  received 16 million lira  or about  2 million  she reported  Bilal Erdogan sat on the board  she reported at the time  He has been widely known for his association with the foundation  although his name no longer appears on its website TURGEV  the Turkey Youth and Education Service Foundation  received 51 million lira  or about  9 million  she said  Esra Albayrak  Mr  Erdogan s daughter  is on its board The Turkey Technology Team Foundation  known as T3  where Mr  Erdogan s son in law Selcuk Bayraktar is head of the board  received 41 million lira or about  7 million  she also reported Her source for all of the payments was the 2018 Istanbul Municipality Report  which was not made public  underscoring Mr  Erdogan s sensitivity to the wider disclosure of such documents by the opposition Mr  Erdogan s signature success has been construction projects  from public residential building to infrastructure projects and expensive megaprojects like bridges and mosques  Opponents say that government contracts go to favored business partners  and that the AKP receives payments in a system of kickbacks from every deal Both the Ankara and Istanbul municipalities are heavily in debt  Mr  Ozgur warned in his column  and they may suffer if Mr  Erdogan  who controls the national budget  refuses them central government funds as punishment for the way they voted on Sunday Mr  Imamoglu  who announced his plans for Istanbul to international reporters Monday night  said he was prepared for that retribution and was confident Istanbul could generate enough of its own money to run itself He added that he had received indications of support from high within Turkey s state apparatus  if not in the lower ranks of the government  where support for Mr  Erdogan remains strong As president  Mr  Erdogan retains sweeping powers and could make life difficult for the incoming mayors  said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli  the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States  The AKP will control the municipal councils  and they have a say in particular in how the budget is allocated   he said  This control over the purse strings has long been a source of support for Mr  Erdogan and his party Ms  Toker reported Wednesday that there were signs already that the government was seeking ways to

scenario could lead it to downgrade Britain s AA long term credit rating U K  lawmakers are voting later Monday on alternatives to the European Union withdrawal deal proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May  Parliament has voted down May s deal three times The EU gave Britain until April 12 to come up with a new plan or to leave the bloc without a deal It s unclear if May would accept any option that

take part in May s European Parliament elections if it remains an EU member beyond April 12 Britain either has to leave the EU on April 12 or come up with an alternative plan  which   unless it decides to revoke Brexit   is likely to involve delaying its withdrawal from the bloc well beyond the May 23 26 European Parliament vote Some British politicians have suggested the U K  could stay for longer without participating in the EU elections  But European Commission chief Jean Claude Juncker told reporters in Saarbruecken  Germany that  if the British haven t left by April 12 and there is an extension  then Britain must take part in the European election  He added  that is  in  the treaty  Whether I want that is another question     12 35 p m European Commission chief Jean Claude

a BBC documentary to be broadcast Monday Smith says May called the election to strengthen her hand in delivering Brexit  but was weakened when she lost her majority  He says the government  should have just been clearer the consequences of that  the parliamentary arithmetic  would mean that this would be inevitably a kind of softer type of Brexit  The comments come after Parliament rejected May

The children of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi have received tens of thousands of dollars and millions in real estate from the rulers of the kingdom as compensation for the murder of their father by a team of Saudi agents  according to a person close to the family and a former Saudi official familiar with the arrangement The payments appear to be part of an attempt to deter the Khashoggi children from speaking out against the kingdom s de facto ruler  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  whom American and other Western intelligence agencies have concluded ordered the killing Mr  Khashoggi  a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist  had four adult children  at least two of whom are American citizens  Saudi Arabia has now provided each of the four with a house in the family s home city of Jidda worth about  4 million in addition to a steady stream of cash payments of  10 000 to  15 000 a month  according to the people familiar with the arrangement  All spoke on condition of anonymity because the arrangement is confidential The former official said that the crown prince s father  King Salman  had ordered the payments shortly after he had first learned that Saudi agents had ambushed and killed Mr  Khashoggi  and that the payments were intended as a form of financial support  without conditions  that would continue indefinitely A current Saudi official compared the arrangement to royal payments to the families of soldiers killed in battle or to Saudis killed in a natural disaster But the Khashoggi family members also have felt pressure to refrain from criticizing the rulers of the kingdom  several people close to them have said  driven in part by fear of official retaliation against relatives still inside the kingdom  Although the other siblings are now in the United States  Mr  Khashoggi s eldest son  Salah  still lives primarily in Jidda  where he works as a banker  and after his father s death he was initially barred for a time from leaving Saudi Arabia All four of Mr  Khashoggi s children have privately raged at the royal court over their father s death  many people who have talked to them have said  But in their few interviews and public statements  all of his children have avoided directing any blame or resentment toward Crown Prince Mohammed and the Saudi royal family In an interview with CNN last fall  for example  Salah Khashoggi disputed the characterization of his father as a dissident  described him instead as a loyal supporter of the monarchy and accused unnamed critics of the kingdom of exploiting his death  in a political way that we totally don t agree with  ImageSalah Khashoggi  center  a son of the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi  and his relatives received mourners at a hall in Saudi Arabia last year CreditAmer Hilabi Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesMr  Khashoggi s son Abdullah and daughter Noha did not respond to requests for comment  Neither did William Taylor  a Washington lawyer who has represented the family  The payments were first reported on Monday in The Washington Post People close to Mr  Khashoggi s children have said that  although they have now reconciled with one another  his two daughters initially took a more confrontational approach and criticized their brothers as  sellouts  for their willingness to accept the Saudi payments The brothers  outlook was more fatalistic  these people said  Mr  Khashoggi s son Abdullah  for example  complained privately that it was of little use to fight  because the new rulers of the kingdom had both killed his father and taken control  one friend recalled The family could soon receive additional payments in the form of so called  blood money  in connection with a trial for Mr  Khashoggi s murder that is now unfolding in Saudi Arabia Under pressure from Western governments to hold accountable those responsible for the killing  Saudi Arabia has said that its public prosecutor has charged 11 officers or officials with involvement in the operation  Of those  five face potential death sentences on charges that they played a direct role at the moment when Mr  Khashoggi was killed   Saudi officials have said he was given a tranquilizer and then suffocated or strangled to death inside a consulate in Istanbul  The trial  however  may pose a dilemma for the Saudis  A guilty verdict could create the potential appearance of more severe punishment for obedient officers who carried out the operation than for more senior officials who ordered it   a group that may include the crown prince himself That could send a demoralizing message to other security officers or intelligence agents  or trigger a backlash from the extended families of the accused But the Saudi legal system sometimes allows the families of killers   or other benefactors who support the families   to pay  blood money  to the relatives of murder victims in exchange for an agreement to relinquish the right to demand the death penalty If security officers are convicted of the killing  the payment of blood money to the Khashoggis could give the king or crown prince leeway to issue pardons or suspended sentences that could defuse internal dissent Saudi Arabia has not disclosed the names of those accused or the details of the charges or evidence against them  But in a departure from Saudi custom  some Western diplomats have been allowed to observe sessions of the trial  in an apparent effort to show the world the kingdom is pursuing justice  

INDIANAPOLIS   The Indiana Senate approved legislation Tuesday aimed at getting Indiana off a list of five states without a hate crimes law  and Republican Gov  Eric Holcomb promised to sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk The Republican dominated chamber voted 34 14 Tuesday to approve the bill s bias crimes language after several Democratic senators urged its defeat  saying it falls short of what s needed because its language does not explicitly cover age  sex or gender identity Holcomb  who had pushed for more comprehensive legislation with an enumerated list of traits that include gender and gender identity  said he ll sign the measure  which would allow judges to impose longer sentences for crimes motivated by bias  Criminals who attempt to instill fear by attacking others based  for example  on who someone loves  who they are  how they identify  how they pray  should know their sentences can  and I believe should  be enhanced to the fullest extent of the law   he said in a statement Holcomb and other Republicans argue that the bill covers all 6 6 million Hoosiers because it covers all characteristics and traits  whether expressly listed or not The law s language refers to Indiana s bias crimes reporting statute that mentions color  creed  disability  national origin  race  religion and sexual orientation  but doesn t explicitly cover age  sex or gender identity  However  the bill says bias can also be considered due to the  victim s or the group s real or perceived characteristic  trait  belief  practice  association  or other attribute  A Senate committee had passed another hate crimes bill in February  but a few days later the state Senate stripped out a list of specific protected traits   including sexual orientation  gender identity and race Members of the House voted 57 39 last week to advance the current bias crimes legislation after the new language was amended into an unrelated bill Democratic Sen  Karen Tallian of Portage said during Tuesday s debate on the bill that while the original bias crimes bill went through an open legislative process that included debates and amendments  the measure that emerged from the House came from a process she called  obnoxious  cowardly and a disrespectful misuse of the system   She said the way it was handled was a failure of House leadership  It could have been taken from the playbook on how to minimize debate   she said   There was no committee hearing  there was no committee debate  Instead it was slipped in a second reading amendment like a thief in the night  Throw it in there  vote right now     This was a total shirking of duty  Senate Democratic Leader Tim Lanane of Anderson said in a statement that he s  deeply disturbed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saw this language and thought that leaving out age  sex and gender identity from the list of protected classes was good enough   The Republican supermajority showed their true colors this session in regards to their feelings towards our minority communities in this state  It is cowardly to not specify an all inclusive list   he said Holcomb has pushed for comprehensive hate crimes largely because the Anti Defamation League lists Indiana as one of only five states  along with Georgia  South Carolina  Wyoming and Arkansas  without hate crimes protections The Anti Defamation League said Friday that it was  deeply disappointed  by the legislation  saying in a statement that the current bill is too vague and  does not meet our standard for a real and effective hate crimes bill in 2019  House Speaker Brian Bosma said Tuesday that the legislation  meets or exceeds  bias crimes statutes on the books in 21 other states  and all of those states are off the list of states without a bias crimes law   There s no reasonable assertion as to why this all inclusive measure doesn t take Indiana off the list   he said in a statement The Indiana Chamber of Commerce s CEO  Kevin Brinegar  urged Holcomb to sign the bill  calling it  a big step in the right direction   Though the list is not as comprehensive as we had advocated for  what the Legislature has passed is still a meaningful hate crimes bill   he said in a statement       To those wanting a perfect bias crimes bill that spells out everything  we hear you and we understand  that was our shared goal  While that s ideal  it was not politically realistic at this time In 2015  then Gov  Mike Pence signed a religious protections law that critics widely panned as sanctioning of discrimination against lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people  After the state faced boycott threats  lawmakers made changes to the law to prevent it from being used to justify discrimination against LGBT people in the state  

CANBERRA  Australia   The Australian government unveiled a plan on Tuesday to balance the national budget next year and pay off all debt in a decade as it prepares for a general election next month Treasurer Josh Frydenberg outlined a strategy to deliver a 7 1 billion Australian dollar   5 billion  surplus in the fiscal year starting July 1   Australia s first surplus budget in 12 years   while promising tax cuts and cash handouts for most Australians Prime Minister Scott Morrison hopes the budget will be positively received by voters whom he will ask to re elect his conservative coalition for a third three year term  Morrison is expected to announce within days that an election will he held on May 11 or May 18 The government expects surpluses to grow annually to AU 17 8 billion in 2021 22 before slipping to AU 9 2 billion the following year as tax cuts take effect on government revenues Net debt would peak at AU 373 billion in the current fiscal year   at 19 2 percent of GDP   and be paid off by 2029 30 Frydenberg described proposed income tax cuts as the largest since Australia s mining boom years before the global financial crisis in 2008 The cuts  which include lowering the 32 5  tax rate to 30  from July 2024  are forecast to cost the nation s coffers AU 158 billion in tax revenue by 2030 The budget strategy has to be endorsed by Parliament to become law But the government does not propose to get much of its economic blueprint through Parliament before the next election  which opinion polls suggest the center left opposition Labor Party is likely to win Frydenberg said he will try to pass legislation this week that would give AU 284 million to pensioners in one off payments by July to help pay soaring energy bills He said voters must decide at the election between the low taxing conservatives and high taxing and high spending Labor  There s a clear contest in this election between one side of politics which wants to reduce taxes and the Labor Party which will try and increase taxes   Frydenberg said Opposition treasury spokesman Chris Bowen said Labor would go to the May election promising bigger surpluses than the ruling coalition  Based on the figures we ve seen tonight  we would have a better bottom line     paid for by a whole range of policies   Bowen told Sky News TV Annual GDP growth is forecast to accelerate from 2 25  in the current fiscal year to 2 75  for the next two years  The jobless rate is expected to remain unchanged at around 5  The Australian economy is vulnerable to commodity swings that the Treasury Department regards as particularly volatile at the moment Exports are forecast to grow by 4  in the next fiscal year  supported by major liquefied natural gas projects ramping up production  Australia recently overtook Qatar as the world s biggest LNG exporter But prices of Australia s most lucrative exports   coal and iron ore   are forecast to decline next year A dam collapse at a Brazilian iron ore mine in January that killed more than 110 people elevated prices of Australian iron ore in the current fiscal year  But the price will settle as supply issues are addressed  Treasury said Australian coal shipments have also been held up at Chinese ports with conflicting reports of Chinese policy changes  There is greater uncertainty than usual around commodity prices as a result of heightened price volatility and policies in China and Brazil   a Treasury document said Frydenberg said one of the government s  chief concerns  is a forecast downturn in the Australian housing market next year  Housing prices are falling in Australia s largest cities  Sydney and Melbourne  where construction has slowed Frydenberg said the downturn would be worse if a Labor government is elected and implements its promised reduction of tax breaks for landlords The budget continues the government s policy of increasing defense spending to 2  of GDP by 2020 21  with AU 38 7 billion allocated next year  President Donald Trump has called on U S  allies to raise their defense spending to that level A AU 2 billion fund to invest in infrastructure construction among Australia s Pacific island neighbors will become operation on July 1  The fund offers an alternative to growing Chinese investment in the Pacific A conservative Australian government delivered annual surplus budgets for a decade before the global financial crisis struck during a Labor government s first year in office  Labor ran up debt through stimulus spending and avoided a recession  But Labor s failure to curb debt during six years in office damaged the party s economic credentials If opinion polls are correct and Labor wins the next election  Morrison would become the sixth Australian prime minister since 2007 to fail to last an entire three year term Labor has said if it wins the election  it will outline its own economic blueprint before September  

LONDON   Royal Dutch Shell Plc on Tuesday became the first major oil and gas company to announce plans to leave a leading U S  refining lobby due to disagreement on climate policies  citing its support for the goals of the Paris climate agreement In its first review of its association with 19 key industry groups  Shell said it had found  material misalignment  over climate policy with the American Fuel   Petrochemical Manufacturers  AFPM  and would quit the body in 2020 The review is part of Shell s drive to increase transparency and show investors it is in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement s goals to limit global warming by reducing carbon emissions to a net zero by the end of the century It is the latest sign of how investor pressure on oil companies  particularly in Europe  is leading to changes in their behavior around climate  Last year  Shell caved in to investor pressure over climate change  setting out plans to introduce industry leading carbon emissions targets linked to executive pay Its chief executive  Ben van Beurden  has since repeatedly urged oil and gas producers to take action over climate and pollution  staking out a more radical position than the heads of other major oil companies   AFPM has not stated support for the goal of the Paris Agreement  Shell supports the goal of the Paris Agreement   the Anglo Dutch company said in its decision  The need for urgent action in response to climate change has become ever more obvious since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015  As a result  society s expectations in this area have changed  and Shell s views have also evolved   van Beurden said in the report The company has disagreed with AFPM on a number of issues for some time  according to two lobbying sources  Shell said it also disagreed with AFPM s opposition to a price on carbon and action on low carbon technologies  Shell and AFPM have also been at odds in recent months over regulation over the use of renewable fuels  While Shell and other large refiners invested in cleaner fuel technology  AFPM has fought hard against standards requiring refiners to blend or subsidize the blending of biofuels into the gasoline pool   saying it hurts independent refiners Shell and rivals Exxon and BP have in recent years left the American Legislative Exchange Council  a conservative political group  over its stance on climate change  AFPM Chief Executive Chet Thompson thanked Shell for its  longstanding collaboration   We will also continue working on behalf of the refining and petrochemical industries to advance policies that ensure reliable and affordable access to fuels and petrochemicals  while being responsible stewards of the environment   Thompson said in a statement  AFPM counts around 300 U S  and international members including Exxon Mobil Corp  Chevron Corp  BP Plc and Total SA that operate 110 refineries and 229 petrochemical plants  according to its 2018 annual report French oil major Total said in a statement to Reuters that consensus required by organizations such as AFPM does not always reflect its position  and that it regularly monitors the relevance of its participation  In this case  Total takes a pro active approach in order to convince its peers  particularly on climate issues  In case of differing points of view  Total publicly defends its position  and is ready to reconsider its participation in case of disagreement   the company said Total said it was fully aware of climate issues  has publicly recognized them and takes them into its strategy  Shell s review was welcomed by Adam Matthews  director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board  which invests in Shell and led discussions with the company over its climate policy  This is an industry first   Matthews said   With this review Shell have set the benchmark for best practice on corporate climate lobbying not just within oil and gas but across all industries  The challenge now is for others to follow suit  WALK AWAYShell also found  some  misalignment with nine other trade associations  including the American Petroleum Institute  the oil and gas industry s main lobby  Shell said that while it had some climate related differences with the API  it welcomed the lobby s advocacy on a range of state and federal issues such as trade and transport  as well as the API s efforts to reduce methane emissions Shell said it will continue to engage with the API and other groups over climate policies and monitor their alignment Shell last month urged President Donald Trump s administration to tighten restrictions on emissions of methane  a potent greenhouse gas  instead of weakening them as planned   Reporting by Ron Bousso  Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in New York and Bate Felix in Paris  Editing by Louise Heavens  Emelia Sithole Matarise  Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler  

LONDON   Prime Minister Theresa May has brought a new word to the Brexit lexicon  compromise May offered Tuesday to hold talks with the leader of the opposition in an attempt to avoid a chaotic departure from the European Union in just 10 days The shift comes after lawmakers rejected the government s Brexit deal on three occasions  and twice failed to agree on any other option A look at what might happen next NO DEALThe EU s chief Brexit negotiator  Michel Barnier  has warned that a  no deal  Brexit is  likely  because of Britain s political impasse Earlier this month  the EU agreed to postpone the original Brexit date of March 29  but gave Britain only until April 12 to come up with a new plan and seek a further extension  or leave without an agreement or a transition period to smooth the way Most politicians  economists and business groups think leaving the world s largest trading bloc without an agreement would be damaging for the EU and disastrous for the U K  It would lead to tariffs imposed on trade between Britain and the EU  customs checks that could cause gridlock at ports and which could spark shortages of essential goods A hard core of Brexiteer legislators in May s Conservative Party dismiss this as  Project Fear  and argue for what they call a  clean Brexit   But most lawmakers are opposed to leaving without a deal  Parliament has voted repeatedly to rule out a  no deal  Brexit   but it remains the default position unless a deal is approved  Brexit is canceled or the EU grants Britain another extension May says the only way to guarantee Britain does not leave the EU without a deal is for Parliament to back her deal  which lawmakers have already rejected three times On Tuesday  she said she would be prepared to compromise with her opponents   potentially pledging to keep closer ties with the bloc than she wants   in order to win their backing for the withdrawal deal    MAY S UNDEAD DEALAfter almost two years of negotiations  Britain and the EU struck a divorce deal in November  laying out the terms of the departure from the bloc and giving a rough outline of future relations But it has been roundly rejected by lawmakers on both sides of the Brexit divide  Pro Brexit lawmakers think it keeps Britain too closely tied to EU rules  Pro EU legislators argue it is worse than the U K  s current status as an EU member Parliament has thrown it out three times  May s attempts to build support for the deal have so far focused on persuading pro Brexit lawmakers to back it  But many have refused to budge Now May is changing tack  saying she will talk to the opposition on compromise proposals for Britain s future relations with the bloc in a bid to get their support for the deal    SOFT BREXITMay s offer of opposition talks suggest she is pivoting to a softer form of Brexit than the one she has described for almost three years May has always insisted Britain must leave the EU s single market and customs union in order to forge new trade deals around the world   but those ideas have strong opposition support In Monday s Parliament votes on alternative Brexit proposals  a plan to keep the U K  in an EU customs union  ensuring seamless trade in goods  was defeated by just three votes Tweaking her deal to adopt a customs union could gain May valuable votes in Parliament  It also would likely be welcomed by the EU and would allow Britain to leave the bloc in an orderly fashion in the next few months However  it would also cause a schism in the Conservative Party  sparking the potential resignation of pro Brexit government ministers That instability raises the chances of an early British election  which could rearrange Parliament and break the deadlock    BREXIT DELAYEDMay conceded Tuesday that Britain will need a further delay to its departure in order to sort out the mess and avert a  no deal  departure The EU is frustrated with the impasse and has said it will only grant another postponement if Britain comes up with a whole new Brexit plan  Still  EU Council President Donald Tusk has urged the bloc to  be patient  and give Britain a Brexit extension if it plans to change course    NEW BREXIT REFERENDUMParliament on Monday also narrowly rejected a proposal for a new referendum on whether to leave the EU or remain The proposal for any Brexit deal to be put to public vote in a  confirmatory referendum  was defeated by 12 votes  It was backed by opposition parties  plus some of May s Conservatives   mainly those who want to stay in the bloc Her government has ruled out holding another referendum on Britain s EU membership  saying voters in 2016 made their decision to leave But with divisions in both Parliament and in May s Cabinet  handing the decision back to the people in a new plebiscite could be seen as the only way forward    Follow AP s full coverage of Brexit at  https   www apnews com Brexit

When did leggings make the leap from garment to cultural lightning rod  For what are essentially stretchy footless tights in a seemingly endless array of patterns and colors  they have been an unexpected source of controversy The latest uproar came last week  when Maryann White  the mother of four sons  wrote a letter to the The Observer  the school newspaper for both the University of Notre Dame and the nearby women s college St  Mary s  asking female students to ignore fashion and stop wearing leggings  It was for their own as well as the greater good  she suggested  in part because leggings made it hard for men to control themselves The you wear it you re asking for it implication of the letter  not to mention the sheer idea of censoring clothing  set off the predictable firestorm of protest  both on campus and off  For two days students wore leggings in a show of group defiance  there was a  leggingsdayND hashtag on Twitter  and assorted men and women posted pictures of themselves in solidarity with leggings wearers Ladies of Notre Dame   we re with you  Wear them loud  wear them proud   yourbody  yourchoice  leggingsdayND  leggingsdayND pic twitter com uZPabHetJI  TLC Sport   TLCSport  March 28  2019 By Friday The Observer had another piece  this one from the editors in response to the furor  saying   Having received over 35 letters to The Observer  in addition to the countless verbal comments  tweets  memes and class discussions about Monday s letter  we have been astonished by the conversations the leggings piece has sparked   Meanwhile  those wider conversation continued over the weekend This follows a 2017 United Airlines incident when two teenagers who were  pass travelers   a category that includes relatives of airline employees  were prevented from flying because they were wearing leggings  Observers complained  social media got up in arms  and the makers of leggings had a field day  Puma  for example  jumped into the fray and burnished its image by offering a 20 percent discount on leggings to anyone presenting a United ticket And that in turn punctuated the endless debate among parents and schools and students that can be summed up as  leggings are not pants yes they are  In general this existential interrogation of the soul of a garment  because  really  that s what it is  centers on women  women s bodies and the general discomfort with seeing too much of them  or believing you are That s certainly where Ms  White was going with her letter  and it s generally the political offense used by those who are on the pro leggings side  How dare you accuse me of dressing to seduce  an argument that has particular resonance in the era after  MeToo  But leggings began their rise to wardrobe domination with the advent of comfort culture  the post casual Friday turn of the millennium move away from formality that picked up steam with the rise of fleece wearing hedge funders  the fall of Old Wall Street and the fetishization of Silicon Valley s hoodies  and Teva clad geniuses  and became even more pronounced under the influence of the Wellness movement Leggings also function differently for different age groups  for Gen Y  they tend to be lifestyle signifiers that have more to do with health and activity than  say  everyday workwear  for Gen Z ers  who largely reject uniformity and traditional labels  they are simply a basic  the equivalent of jeans  They are something you put on without thought Which is to say  leggings are about a lot of things  and sex may be the least of them   if sex plays any role at all One thing that was striking about the Notre Dame protest was the rejection of what they saw as the traditional gender assumptions involved  Leggings are not the sole province of the siren female was the idea  In their editorial  The Observer s writers asked   Why has the legging controversy generated a larger impact than other controversial topics  Students and community members have spent hours debating the merits and faults of a popular clothing choice  But where is the willingness to speak up about other issues with substantial policy implications  legally and on campus  The truth is  it s possible leggings may be simply standing in for those other issues  One of the great gotchas of fashion is that what may appear superficial or unimportant  leggings   is  in fact  representative of a more complicated  harder to express reality  identity   This is what gives clothes their power As a result  what the leggings uproar may have exposed is not so much anyone s physique per se  but rather a cultural fault line that runs through generations  This historical pattern includes miniskirts and jeans  Mary Quant and James Dean  and garments that seemed egregious and inexplicable to what is generally referred to as the establishment but play a key and highly visual role in upending norms to make way for the next  Sure  it s possible that is overstating the matter  It s possible they are just stretchy footless tights that are easy to wear But judging by Lululemon s recent results  which saw net revenue rise 21 percent in the third quarter of 2018  and the fact that part of Levi s much heralded IPO was attributed to the  stretch  now included in jeans to cater to the leggings market  this  popular clothing choice   as The Observer labeled them  is not going away any time soon  All this suggests that the Notre Dame uproar may not be a fluke  but a harbinger

design and use of artificial intelligence The administration has also started to discuss a new law to protect privacy in the digital age  seeking consensus domestically and common ground

level   said David Redl  a senior Commerce Department official helping to guide the administration s privacy effort On both issues  the administration has  moved from indifference to engagement   said Julie Brill  a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission  who now helps oversee regulatory affairs for Microsoft   It certainly has been welcome  The shift is a pragmatic recognition that regulations that will affect the nation s tech industry and its citizens are coming  and that if federal officials want a say in them  they must participate ImageSurveillance cameras near a portrait

for Economic Cooperation and Development   has gone its own way  using personal data and artificial intelligence as tools of a government backed surveillance state  If the United States were another digital island  experts warn  there would be a real danger of a fragmented global marketplace Privacy can be seen as the first step toward regulating artificial intelligence more broadly  Vast volumes of data  often personal information  are the fuel of modern A I  systems Several American states  led by California  have passed or proposed privacy laws  threatening to fragment the marketplace in the United States  too  They are following Europe  where a sweeping privacy law took effect in May  harnessing the popular backlash against American tech giants like Facebook and Google  Europe is saying   We re in charge   defining the global rules in the next iteration of the digital economy   said Daniel Weitzner  a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a policy adviser in the Obama administration The new European privacy law  known as the General Data Protection Regulation  lets people request their data online  restricts how businesses obtain and handle information  and opens a door to class action style lawsuits and huge fines Just how strict or effective enforcement will be remains to be seen  But other nations are adopting similar rules  and tech companies are retooling their data handling software to comply  Last year  Europe and Japan agreed to allow personal data to flow freely between the two economies  since Japan s rules were deemed the equivalent of Europe s Mounir Mahjoubi  the French secretary of state for digital affairs  pointed to the European Japanese pact as the  first impact worldwide  of the European standard ImageGoogle s

CreditTing Shen for The New York TimesMr  Redl of the Commerce Department said the administration had been prompted to seek a new privacy law by action in Europe and state legislatures  Though it has solicited public comments  the administration has not yet drafted a proposed law  and passage would require bipartisan support in Congress But the goal  Mr  Redl said  is a federal law that will  harmonize  data privacy rules in the United States and mesh enough with the European standard to avoid a more splintered marketplace One sign of the administration s more cosmopolitan approach to technology policy was a small  private forum on  industries of the future  at the White House in early December  Most of the guests were tech company leaders  including Sundar Pichai of Google  Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Ginni Rometty of IBM At that session  White House technology advisers discussed the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s artificial intelligence guidelines and the importance of shaping the outcome  That impressed the tech executives as a newfound embrace of international engagement  according to a person briefed on the meeting  who would speak only anonymously The White House confirmed that its side had brought up the organization s guidelines at the meeting  In February  President Trump signed an executive order on artificial intelligence that called for not only more investment but also regulation to  foster public trust in A I  systems  In a statement last week  Michael Kratsios  deputy assistant to the president for technology policy  said   We re focused on promoting an international environment that supports A I  research and development and ensures the technology is developed in a manner aligned with our nation s core civil liberties and freedoms  The administration s emphatic cooperation on artificial intelligence guidelines contrasts with an earlier arms length wariness of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  In 2017  for example  the administration  given its nationalist trade agenda  insisted that the term  free trade  not appear in a ministerial statement  according to two people involved in drafting the language  who would speak only on the condition of anonymity ImageMichael Kratsios  second from left  assistant to the president for technology policy  in 2017  The administration wants to ensure that artificial intelligence  is developed in a manner aligned with our nation s core civil liberties and freedoms   he said last week CreditStephen Crowley The New York TimesThe organization s A I  initiative has involved meetings and presentations around the world  Groups from engineers to human rights activists are represented on the advisory panels that help draft recommendations  which are tentatively scheduled for ministerial approval in May Their guidelines are  soft law    suggestions  not requirements  But the Paris based organization has a track record of influencing global policy The most recent  eight page draft lays out rights and responsibilities  Those responsible  it says  include any individual or organization that makes or operates A I  technology   and these  A I  actors  should do systematic risk assessments of  privacy  digital security  safety and bias  People affected by an A I  generated prediction or recommendation  it says  should have the right to challenge the outcome  based on plain and easy to understand information  on how an automated decision was made The draft recommendations call for global A I  standards that are  trustworthy  and allow for data to flow fairly freely across borders so that it is  interoperable   The latter is a vital point for the American side  National laws and approaches will differ  they say  but they should not hobble the global data economy No one is entirely satisfied in the collective  give and take of developing guidelines  Marc Rotenberg  executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center  a nonprofit digital rights research and advocacy group  is one of the expert advisers  He is a champion of more forceful guidelines like a prohibition on Chinese style scoring of individuals based on their personal information and online behavior But Mr  Rotenberg described the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s effort as  the right synthesis to pursue   combining  economic development and a fundamental human right to privacy   The guidelines  he said  should be  a very important policy framework

NEW YORK   News industry leaders are fighting back against the charge by President Donald Trump and his supporters that the administration s summation of special counsel Robert Mueller s report proved that journalists were  so wrong for so long  in their coverage of the Russia investigation The latest to weigh in was Steve Coll  dean of Columbia University s Graduate School of Journalism  who wrote in a New Yorker magazine essay this week that it s wrong to conclude journalism failed because Mueller did not charge Trump with conspiring with Russians to influence the 2016 election  The New York Times and The Washington Post shared a Pulitzer Prize  awarded by Columbia in 2018  for their reporting on the issue  a prize Trump says should be taken away Complicating the issue is the broad definition of the news media circa 2019  encompassing everything from painstakingly sourced investigative stories to overheated tweets to opinionated pundits  It s premature to pronounce this coverage as some kind of epic press failure   said Nancy Gibbs  former Time magazine editor and a Harvard University professor of press  politics and public policy  People angered by the press  role in investigating the president will use Mueller s findings as a lever in any way they can  she said  That doesn t mean that they re right   Gibbs said The phrase  so wrong for so long  was used by White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney during a CNN appearance on Sunday  He said  we need to figure out  what happened with reporting on the story  Sean Davis  co founder of the Federalist online magazine  said the same thing in the lead of a Wall Street Journal editorial earlier in the week that argued  America s blue chip journalists botched the entire story   The president retweeted his story  I m not sure what you re saying the media got wrong   replied CNN s Jake Tapper   The media reported the investigation was ongoing  Other than the people in the media on the left  not on this network  I don t know anybody who got anything wrong  We didn t say there was conspiracy  We said that Mueller was investigating conspiracy  Mulvaney  without offering specifics  said to Tapper that  if that s your recollection of history  that s great  Face it  the media got this wrong   he said   It s OK  people get stuff wrong all the time  Just not at this level  There were obviously disputed individual stories along the way  ABC suspended Brian Ross for a story wrongly alleging that Trump had asked former national security adviser Michael Flynn to discuss foreign policy with the Russians before he was elected  Three CNN journalists resigned over a story falsely linking a Trump aide to a Russian investment fund  The special counsel s office denied a Buzzfeed report that it had evidence Trump had directed lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress over a Moscow office project Yet much of what the public learned over the past two years on the story was the result of relentless digging by reporters In tweets over the past week  Trump repeated his contention that the mainstream media is the enemy of the people  and said the Times  and Post s Pulitzers should be stripped  The Times  in response  tweeted a picture of its Pulitzer winners and noted that every story cited in their prize winning entry has been proven correct Top editors at the Times and Post  Dean Baquet and Marty Baron  and CNN chief Jeff Zucker offered similar statements noting it was their organizations  job to show what people in power are doing  and prosecutors  responsibility to determine what is legal or illegal  A sitting president s own Justice Department investigated his campaign for collusion with a hostile nation   Zucker said   That s not enormous because the media says so  That s enormous because it s unprecedented  Not every top news executive was eager to get involved  representatives for news presidents at ABC  CBS and NBC either turned down or didn t reply to interview requests   We re going to keep doing our job   MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement  The coverage of the investigation did include embarrassments   specious chyrons  tendentious talking heads and retracted scoops  among them   Columbia s Coll wrote   Yet it does not follow that American journalism failed because the best resourced newsrooms in the nation chose to report assiduously on the Mueller investigation and its subjects  only to learn that Mueller did not prove that Trump had conspired with Russia  If there s any media soul searching to be done  it may involve cable news  In the Trump era  Fox News and MSNBC are frequently the most watched cable networks in general  both appealing to different camps Fox News Channel s Sean Hannity has been Trump s biggest advocate on cable news  making him a target for the president s opponents  Yet MSNBC s Rachel Maddow was criticized this week by Slate s Willa Paskin  who said turning on her show  was like discovering a Facebook friend is on the verge of a nervous breakdown   She said that while Maddow s audience was not as malignant as Hannity s   more than one cable news host can disservice their audience at the same time  Harvard s Gibbs recalls watching reporters and pundits sitting side by side on cable panels  with roles confused when pundits were asked what they were hearing and reporters questioned about what they thought Journalists have long believed that readers and viewers understand the difference between reporting and commentary  Coll said  It would be unrealistic to expect them to make such a distinction now   he said  

With school out of session and those vacation plans to Europe tentatively approved by the boss  summer is a prime season for international travel Travel to the European Union by U S  citizens increased significantly between May 2017 and June 2018  according to the National Travel and Tourism Office  But as travel into and out of Europe surges during the summer months  the likelihood of a delay at major hubs such as London Gatwick and Manchester also increases If that happens on your next trip  you might be able to take advantage of a little known policy  Flight Compensation Regulation 261 2004  It offers all travelers  regardless of nationality  reimbursement in the event of a flight delay  denied boarding or cancellation  If your airline approves the claim  you are entitled to compensation between  250 and  600   281 and  676  per person for your inconvenience But before you call the airline or type out a tersely worded tweet  you should know that your trip may not be covered by the regulation  If an airline is able to put you on a connecting flight or another nonstop flight under the threshold  then technically they don t owe you anything   said Jamie Larounis  founder of travel blog The Forward Cabin Here s what you should know How can I file a claim for compensation First  it s helpful to know that the type of compensation you can receive depends on the nature of your delay or cancellation  If your flight was delayed by fewer than three hours  then you aren t covered under the rule  Also  if your flight was delayed or canceled for  extraordinary circumstances   like severe weather or political unrest  then it isn t covered either Airlines generally have flight compensation information located on their websites  though you may have to look closely to find it   The airlines  according to the legislation  are required to inform passengers of their rights When you file the claim with your airline or through a watchdog agency such as FlightRight  you will be asked to provide your flight number and booking reference  as well as information about why your flight was delayed or canceled  so it s helpful to have that information handy Does the regulation apply only to airlines with headquarters in E U  countries To be eligible for compensation  your flight must be on an E U  airline only if you re flying into an E U  country  But if your flight originated in  or if you re traveling within  the E U   then you are also covered under the regulation regardless of the airline For example  if Air France canceled your flight from Paris to Chicago for mechanical issues  then you would be covered under the regulation because the trip originated in an E U  country and the flight is on an E U  airline  However  if your American Airlines flight traveling from Dallas to Rome was delayed  then it wouldn t be considered eligible for compensation because American isn t an E U  carrier  even though the flight terminated in an E U  country How long does it take to get compensated Technically  you re entitled to be reimbursed for your journey within seven days  But patience is key   you might have to follow up with your airline by calling or sending a message on Twitter or Facebook Before filing for compensation  airlines may also offer you perks like free miles or travel vouchers instead of what they are legally obligated to provide you   money  Ultimately  you should decide what s best for you and your travel plans  You re entitled to cash  but you may be able to receive airline miles or upgrades to business or first class  depending on availability  for the inconvenience  Once the reimbursement has been processed  the airline will pay you in cash  check or by bank transfer More on airlines and savings4 Tips to

claim AirHelp  a website that helps passengers file compensation claims  says British passengers alone received almost  800 million in compensation between 2017 and 2018 Until Britain formally exits the European Union  the country   and its airlines   is still subject to the E U  261 legislation  Flights on U K  carriers including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic must comply with the rule until Britain leaves the E U   but it s unclear what will happen after the Brexit deadline Can I file a claim through a third party Third party companies like Refund  Me and FlightRight com can do much of the heavy lifting of filing your claim with an airline   but they don t do it because they are nice people who understand the frustration of canceled flights  Some companies charge steep fees to file a claim for you  The airline has to verify the flight  verify why it was delayed and verify that you were on it  The intermediaries have some legal power to expedite that process   said Mr  Larounis Can I retroactively file for compensation The regulation does not specify a blanket statute of limitations for compensation  Each country in the E U  decides how far back a claim can be filed  In Germany  for example  the statute of limitations is six years Victoria M  Walker is a multimedia journalist who covers travel and a lecturer in the Department of Media  Journalism  and Film at

Almost exactly 10 years ago  President Barack Obama went before the nation to unveil an urgent overhaul of the nation s automobile industry The financial crisis and plummeting economy had swept America s already fragile carmakers into an existential crisis  Unaided  a complete collapse of the sector  including its many suppliers and dealers  was inevitable  At Mr  Obama s instruction  the auto task force  which I led  administered a strong dose of tough medicine  The ensuing turnaround was remarkable  Vehicle sales  which had fallen nearly in half  bounded back  reaching an 18 million pace in late 2017  Massive losses became massive profits  Employment across the sector  which had fallen to 623 000  has grown to a million Americans In acting so muscularly  Mr  Obama defied both conservative critics and public sentiment  A poll in October 2009 showed that 54 percent of Americans opposed government help for the industry That  too  has flipped  By 2012  56 percent of Americans supported the help given to the car companies  And little has been heard from the loud voices that denounced Mr  Obama for reaching forcefully into the private sector While we didn t get everything right  I came away from the job with some pre existing views reinforced and some new lessons learned Lesson One  As successful as our private enterprise system has been  the auto crisis and  for that matter  the entire financial crisis reminded me that government has an important role to play in overseeing business In normal times  capitalism needs supervision to ensure that companies compete fairly  don t take advantage of workers and produce safe products  to name just a few examples  In extraordinary times  such as when markets fail  government can prudently step in with salutary effects  That was the case in 2009  Without help from Washington  the collapse in auto sales would have exhausted General Motors s and Chrysler s cash reserves  forcing them to close their doors  lay off all their workers and liquidate The collateral damage would have been vast  perhaps a million Americans would have lost their jobs  at least in the short run  at a time when unemployment was already nearing 10 percent  Our critics said we should let private capital handle it  But in those terrifying days  not a penny of private money would have been made available to the auto sector RelatedMore on the auto bailout Opinion   Steven RattnerTrump Is Wrong About the General Motors BailoutNov  28  2018Lesson Two  Saving American companies is not necessarily the same thing as saving American jobs  Yes  domestic employment in the auto sector has recovered nicely  But the number of Mexican autoworkers has grown even faster That s because workers in Mexico and elsewhere have become more productive while wages have stayed relatively low  Pressure remains on auto companies  with their persistently low margins  to shift jobs offshore Lesson Three  Our system of government does not make speedy  effective interventions of this sort easy  In providing capital to the auto sector  we were lucky to have access to the  700 billion fund passed by Congress to rescue the financial system  and so was the George W  Bush administration  which wisely provided emergency bridge loans in December 2008  Without that  I am convinced that the failure of at least one major auto company would have had been required to get Congress to act expeditiously  In 1979  when Chrysler previously requested emergency aid  it took five months for Congress to approve  1 5 billion in rescue loans and an additional six months for Chrysler to meet the numerous conditions that Congress imposed before the company could receive its first tranche of funds Lesson Four  Solving an existential crisis is best done without political pressure  Even under truth serum  I would affirm the president s decision to insulate our team from the lobbying of innumerable special interests  some of which had been major supporters during his election campaign just a few months earlier Lesson Five  Management matters  Why did General Motors and Chrysler almost vaporize while Ford  although struggling  never needed help from the auto task force  Largely because Ford had better leadership that had anticipated the downturn and prepared for it In my 35 years working with companies  I have repeatedly been struck by the transformational impact that a single individual can have on a business  even on a massive multinational corporation with hundreds of thousands of employees Happily  governance at General Motors is much improved  and in Mary Barra  the company has a first rate chief executive Lesson Six  Success can be transitory  Today  it is Ford that is struggling  And all automakers are facing profound changes  some of which were not even a glimmer on the horizon in 2009  During my time at the Treasury Department  we heard a bit about electric cars  but to my recollection  the words  autonomous driving  and  ride sharing  were never uttered Far from its ostrichlike behavior in the years before the rescue  the American auto industry appears to have taken this lesson to heart  particularly in prescient moves like General Motors  decision to move early into self driving car technology For the sake of all Americans  let s hope that the lessons of the industry s near death experience a decade ago remain fresh The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor  We d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles  Here are some tips  And here s our email

BRUSSELS   The United States and its allies are stepping up cooperation in response to Russian aggression  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday while playing down differences among members as the military alliance marks its 70th anniversary Foreign ministers from NATO countries are meeting in Washington this week for the occasion  determined to show a united front in the midst of a long military stalemate in Afghanistan and tensions with Russia returned to Cold War era levels But as NATO deploys thousands of troops and equipment to deter Russia and seeks solutions to fast evolving new threats such as cyberattacks and hybrid warfare  its biggest challenge arguably lies within  Damaging infighting over defense spending and authoritarian tendencies exhibited by some allies undermine NATO s values  according to experts  The strength of NATO is that despite these differences  we have always been able to unite around our core tasks  That is  to protect and defend each other   NATO chief Stoltenberg said in Brussels before the trip Stoltenberg has talks with U S  President Donald Trump planned for Tuesday  He is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday A big source of the internal strain is Trump s recurrent demand that countries devote an amount equal to at least 2 percent of GDP to defense spending   though that metric takes no account of how well the money is spent   as well as the U S  president s reluctance to criticize strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin  NATO s single greatest challenge is the absence of strong  principled American presidential leadership for the first time in its history   two former U S  envoys to NATO  Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute  wrote in a report for the alliance anniversary Trump  they said  is seen by allies as NATO s  most urgent  and often most difficult  problem  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified last week before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in Washington  He was asked if he was familiar with the report by Burns and Lute Pompeo said he hadn t read the report but he had known Lute since he was a young military office and had  great respect for him   But on the subject of Trump and NATO  Lute was  just simply wrong   Pompeo said If the conclusion he drew that President Trump is the biggest impediment to NATO  he s just simply wrong   he added   We have worked diligently to make NATO stronger  I am convinced that we have done so  Trump made a memorable impression on leaders from Canada and European nations during his first NATO summit in May 2017  During a speech outside NATO s new Brussels headquarters  he publicly humiliated them  Trump also cast doubt on whether they could count on Washington to fulfill NATO s collective defense clause The speech was delivered by a memorial made from a twisted piece of the World Trade Center towers felled by al Qaida s airliner attacks on Sept  11  2011  Since the founding Washington Treaty was signed on April 4  1949  NATO has only once activated the clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on them all  after the 9 11 attacks Trump also delayed a summit last year with fresh demands on burden sharing  That time  at least  his dressing down about the U S  spending more on defense than the other NATO members combined happened behind closed doors Trump s routine tirades have fueled suspicion his aim mostly is to drum up business for the U S  defense industry But the attitude of Trump   who walked away from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate change agreement his allies in Europe value while making tariff threats against them   also is similar to authoritarian or populist streaks showing up in NATO members Turkey  Hungary  Italy and Poland  The political and trans Atlantic unity that underpins NATO has been weakened  Only bad guys benefit from trans Atlantic division and a U S  retreat from its global leadership role   Anders Fogh Rasmussen  Stoltenberg s predecessor as NATO s top civilian official  said in an email exchange with The Associated Press  We see the consequences of U S  retreat  with autocrats and dictators filling the vacuum   he added Burns and Lute say this retreat from democracy  individual freedoms and the rule of law is  a potentially cancerous threat  Still  NATO has survived formidable challenges over the decades  including the Cuban missile crisis and the missile race in Europe  It s also remained intact after internal divisions over the Suez Canal  the Iraq war  and France s departure from the alliance s command structure  Officials say they are confident NATO will endure now  too The White House said last month in a statement about Stoltenberg s talks with Trump on Tuesday that the two would  discuss the unprecedented success of NATO  including the recent increased commitments on burden sharing among European allies and ways to address the current  evolving challenges facing the alliance  Trump is not scheduled to appear at the upcoming talks of NATO foreign ministers  but he is expected to attend a leaders  summit in London in mid December  I hope we will not see a repeat of President Trump s antics in Brussels last year  It s time for the world s democracies to show their unity   Rasmussen said    Deb Riechmann contributed from Washington  

ANKARA ISTANBUL   Tayyip Erdogan s ruling AK Party was on track on Monday to lose control of Turkey s two biggest cities  Istanbul and Ankara  in a stunning local election setback that could complicate the president s plans to combat recession While official vote tallies and Turkish broadcasters put the main opposition Republican People s Party  CHP  candidates ahead in both cities  the Islamist rooted AKP promised appeals that could delay the final results for days  Erdogan  who has dominated Turkish politics since sweeping to power 16 years ago and has ruled with an ever tighter grip  campaigned relentlessly for two months ahead of Sunday s vote  which he described as a  matter of survival  for Turkey But his daily rallies and overwhelmingly supportive media coverage failed to win over many urban voters  as last year s punishing currency crisis weighed heavily on Turks  The people have voted in favour of democracy  they have chosen democracy   said opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu  whose secularist CHP also held its Aegean coastal stronghold of Izmir  Turkey s third largest city  The AKP and its Islamist predecessor have controlled Istanbul and the capital Ankara for 25 years  The results  which were still being tallied on Monday evening  would likely bring personnel changes at the highest ranks of government  according to sources inside and close to the AKP  In Istanbul  the country s largest city and economic hub  the CHP mayoral candidate was more than 22 000 votes ahead of his AKP opponent as the last votes were being counted  according to the country s electoral board  Yet the AKP also claimed victory  saying it had  plenty of  evidence of voting irregularities In Ankara  Turkish broadcasters said the CHP candidate had won a clear victory  But the AKP said it would appeal and expected to shift the outcome in its favour  Erdogan s ruling alliance  including the nationalist MHP  captured 51 7 percent of the nationwide vote  according to state owned Anadolu news agency  Turnout was a very high 84 5 percent But the loss of Istanbul   if confirmed   would be especially significant as Erdogan served as as the city s mayor in the 1990s

Good Wednesday   Want this by email  Sign up here  How the Murdochs built the world s most influential media empireA lengthy investigation by the NYT Magazine reveals how much power the Murdoch media empire wields around the world   and the fissures that have grown within the family that controls it The Murdochs hold sway over right wing politicians worldwide  President Trump is famously an avid consumer of Fox News  And The Sun  a British tabloid  was one of the most influential voices in favor of Britain s withdrawal from the E U Their power is strongest in Australia  Murdoch properties in the country have both pushed to repeal a carbon tax and helped topple a series of prime ministers Seeing Fox News as an arm of Mr  Trump s White House misses a larger picture   It may be more accurate to say that the White House   just like the prime ministers  offices in Britain and Australia   is just one tool among many that this family use to exert influence over world events  The  clan is fracturing  Lachlan Murdoch  who is now C E O  of the Fox Corporation  which controls the family s remaining holdings  fought the effort to sell most of the company to Disney  He suspected his brother  James  of putting himself above the family  The two now barely speak to each other Several siblings wanted to get out altogether  James and two sisters  Elisabeth and Prudence  offered to sell their holdings in Fox to Lachlan  Rupert Murdoch is said to have encouraged the move  but Lachlan ultimately backed off   raising questions about his commitment to the company Goldman Sachs warms to Saudi

according to Bloomberg   It shows a change in attitude within American companies toward Saudi Arabia  Last fall  Mr  Solomon was one of several executives to spurn the kingdom s investment conference    Inside Goldman Sachs  senior executives have indicated Saudi Arabia offers a more promising environment for growing the investment bank s business than other parts of the Middle East  according to

slightly happier times CreditCarlos Barria Reuters I guess I m stuck with you  President Trump is still complaining about the Fed and its chairman  Jay Powell  to anyone who will listen  the WSJ reports   even to Mr  Powell himself   At three meetings this past week  Mr  Trump told Republican senators  supporters and staffers that if not for the central bank s rate increases   economic output and stocks would be higher and the U S  budget deficit would be rising less    On a March 8 phone call  an unnamed source said  Mr  Trump told Mr  Powell himself   I guess I m stuck with you    Mr

missteps could prove costly for the global economy  Officials have resolved most of the issues standing in the way of a deal to end their long running trade dispute   according to the FT  Later today  Liu He  China s vice premier  is to meet Robert Lighthizer  the U S  trade representative  and Steven Mnuchin  the Treasury secretary  to continue discussions Crucial details need to be hashed out   The two sides remain apart on two key issues   the fate of existing U S  levies on Chinese goods  which Beijing wants to see removed  and the terms of an enforcement mechanism demanded by Washington to ensure that China abides by the deal   the FT adds Striking an effective agreement is important  according to Christine Lagarde of the I M F   Nobody wins a trade war   she said in Washington yesterday   That is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system   And the W T O  said that a slowdown in global trade would continue through this year   It is increasingly urgent that we resolve tensions   said Roberto Azevêdo  the body s director general If there is a breakthrough  President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could sign a deal as soon as this month  Otherwise  the two countries could extend the negotiations until the G 20 meeting in Japan in late June  the FT says Theresa May will work with the opposition on BrexitPrime Minister Theresa May said yesterday that she planned to cooperate with the opposition Labour Party to avoid a disorderly Brexit  Stephen Castle and Ellen Barry of the NYT report With only 10 days left until Britain is set to leave the E U   Mrs  May is effectively turning her back on Brexit hard liners in her own party  She will instead try to develop a plan with cross party support  She added that she would ask European leaders for an extension Canceling Brexit is not an option   Closer economic ties with the bloc through a customs union or membership in its single market are up for discussion and even a referendum confirming any deal has not been excluded  Mrs  May s aides said   Mr  Castle and Ms  Barry write But the Labour Party s cooperation   and E U  approval for another delay   are not certain Brussels is expected to put strict conditions on an extension  They might include  the need to hold European Parliament elections and a possible  gentleman s agreement  over Britain s

television ads and contributed  700 000 to the advocacy group Fix Our Transit   more than the Real Estate Board of New York  which put in  500 000   the FT reported   Uber and its main competitor  Lyft  have been criticized for increasing congestion and undermining public transit   The companies have zeroed in on congestion pricing as their preferred solution rather than efforts to tax car booking or limit the number of cars on the road   the FT notes   Congestion charges have other benefits for Uber  They will make ride hailing services more efficient  and may encourage people to use

Who counts as a woman  Is there some set of core experiences distinctive of womanhood  some shared set of adventures and exploits that every woman will encounter on her journey from diapers to the grave  The recent debates over the experiences of trans women gives us new reason to return to a question feminists have been grappling with for decades Ever since Simone de Beauvoir quipped in 1949 that one is not born a woman  but becomes one  feminists have been discussing the implications of understanding gender as a cultural construct  But more recently  this approach to gender has come under scrutiny  After all  it s all well and good to say that gender is a cultural construct  but it s a mistake to then pretend that cultures construct gender the same way for all people  Let s just say that the sisterhood hasn t always been great about attending equally to the experiences of all sisters But thanks to the past 40 years of work from intersectionalist feminists  we re finally paying attention to what women of color have been saying since at least the days when Sojourner Truth had to ask if she  too  got to count as a woman  that what it s like to be a woman varies drastically across social lines of race  socioeconomic class  disability and so on  and that if we try to pretend otherwise  we usually just end up pretending that the experiences of the wealthy  white  straight  able bodied women who already have more than their fair share of social privilege are the experiences of all women You might think we just need to get over the thought that there s anything like the female experience  that the search for a shared female experience is dicey at best  fraught with way too many historical examples of feminists getting it wrong and making things worse for less privileged women along the way  At the limit  these concerns result in the view that the category of  womanhood  itself is fundamentally confused and thus better abandoned entirely  This is the route taken by feminists like Judith Butler in her iconic 1990 book  Gender Trouble  There s a reason that after describing gender as fundamentally a performance  Butler counsels people to revel in messing with its scripts  to treat gender as nothing more than an ironic parody  Gender categories need to be taken down a notch  she thinks  but not only because they harm people in all the ways feminism spends so much time criticizing  Butler charges that in their focus on spelling out the harms of gendered socialization  feminists unwittingly entrenched the very things they claimed to be criticizing  By demarcating feminism s subject matter   by articulating a concrete category of harms that deserved feminist attention   feminists inadvertently defined womanhood in a manner that implies that there are right and wrong ways to be a woman   Identity categories are never merely descriptive   she insists in  Gender Trouble    but always normative  and as such  exclusionary  Any attempt to catalog the commonalities among women  in other words  has the inescapable result that there is some correct way to be a woman  This will inevitably encourage and legitimize certain experiences of gender and discourage and delegitimize others  subtly reinforcing and entrenching precisely those forces of socialization of which feminists claim to be critical  And what s worse  it will inevitably leave some people out  It will mean that there are  real  women whom feminism should be concerned about and that there are impostors who do not qualify for feminist political representation The women who are accused of being impostors these days are often trans women  You might think that a shared suspicion of conventional understandings of sex and gender would make feminists and trans activists natural bedfellows  You d be wrong  It all started with Janice Raymond s controversial book   The Transsexual Empire  The Making of the She Male   published in 1979  Reissued in 1994  the book continues to inspire  gender critical  or  trans exclusionary  radical feminists   TERFs  for short   For the record  while some consider the acronym derogatory  it is a widely accepted shorthand for a literal description of the views these feminists hold  also for the record  many of us who are critics of TERFs consider Raymond s book to be hate speech   Feminists who deny  real woman  status to trans women seem to rely on a false assumption   that all trans women have lived in the world unproblematically as men at some point   and claim the importance of affirming the identity and experiences of those who ve spent entire lives in women s shoes  Even the feminist icon Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has echoed this  claiming in a 2017 interview   It s about the way the world treats us  and I think if you ve lived in the world as a man with the privileges that the world accords to men and then sort of change gender  it s difficult for me to accept that then we can equate your experience with the experience of a woman who has lived from the beginning as a woman and who has not been accorded those privileges that men are  TERFs also sometimes complain that the performances of femininity enacted by trans women are chiefly retrograde stereotypes  caricatures of a femininity designed primarily for the pleasure of men  When Caitlyn Jenner says that she has always felt like a woman  for example  what she seems to mean by this is that she wants to be an airheaded piece of arm candy all dolled up for delights of the male gaze   The hardest part of being a woman   she infamously quipped   is figuring out what to wear   It s nonsense like this that motivated Germaine Greer to call Glamour magazine  misogynist  for honoring Jenner at its Women of the Year ceremony  claiming that the move was tantamount to affirming that with enough plastic surgery someone who is assigned male at birth can  be a better woman  than someone  who is just born a woman   While the rhetoric used by those in the trans exclusionary camp is frequently inexcusable  you might think that some of their frustration is understandable  Feminists who ve spent the better part of their lives fighting against a status quo that uncritically affirms gender stereotypes might be forgiven for getting a little resentful when women like Jenner seem to suggest that these stereotypes tell us what it s  really like  to be a woman  On the other hand  it s worth asking why the full brunt of the most extreme TERFs  ire is so often directed at individual trans women who are just trying to get by like the rest of us  rather than on the fact that the media insists on focusing so single mindedly on trans performances of gender that endorse a regressive  man pleasing version of femininity to the exclusion of the many diverse others  For the most part  Greer and Raymond and others who share their view are outliers in contemporary feminism  particularly in North America  Adichie  for instance  could not accurately be called a TERF  She thinks trans women s oppression is not the same as the oppression experienced by women who are assigned female at birth  yet recognizes that trans women are undoubtedly oppressed and should be  part of feminism   Most feminists these days go even further  however  fully rejecting trans exclusionary rhetoric and agreeing that trans women are women  full stop RelatedOpinion   Sophie LewisHow British Feminism Became Anti TransFeb  7  2019Thankfully  feminists have finally started to realize that the varied experiences of trans women have a thing or two to teach us  if only we re willing to actually listen  All the way back in 1974  Andrea Dworkin launched an early salvo in what would become the  TERF wars   remarking   It is commonly and wrongly said that male transvestites through the use of makeup and costuming caricature the women they would become  but any real knowledge of the romantic ethos makes clear that these men have penetrated to the core experience of being a woman  a romanticized construct    There are some important objections that should be made about her terminology here    transvestite  is no longer the preferred nomenclature  and she doesn t distinguish between male drag queens and trans women   but it would be anachronistic to get too fussed about it  Instead of complaining that trans women like Jenner are cartoons of reality  Dworkin would have us be honest with ourselves about the absurd amount of time and energy cis women are expected to invest in our performances of femininity  If cis women were honest about this  we d admit that if some trans women occasionally camp up their femininity a little more than TERFs might like  they re not doing anything we re not just as guilty of  If we don t like what we see when trans women turn the mirror of femininity toward us  we have only ourselves to blame Further driving home the importance of not throwing stones when you live in glass houses  Lori Watson  a professor of philosophy at the University of San Diego  points out that when cis women live as cis  they too are affirming a world of binary gender identifications  a world of gender stereotypes  a world with a limited number of acceptable ways to be a woman  just as much as any trans woman does  When I  a cis woman  perform my not terribly original rendition of conventional femininity  I am in part saying that this is what women should be like   In fashioning myself  I fashion Man   Jean Paul Sartre said  I might not always like it  but when I present myself in ways that I know that others around me will read as female  I m not only going along with but actually affirming their conventional beliefs about what women are like   This  in part  is the power of Butler s advice to mess with our performances of gender  doing so unsettles people s unthinking preconceptions  But if I m as guilty of entrenching regressive gender stereotypes as anyone else  why do TERFs think it s trans women who are specially culpable for shoring up gender essentialism  Why aren t they going after cis women like me  too  We might all agree that the goal is to get to a world free of the shackles of conventional gender ascriptions  but that is not the world we currently live in   The criticism of trans women as failing to act in ways that are consistent with an ideal of liberation from sex and gender   Watson cracks   is a little like criticizing any of us for making a decent living under capitalism  or investing our retirement funds in the stock market  if the aim of liberation is the destruction of capitalism as a social  political  and economic system  Even Karl Marx had to eat in the here and now  Talia Mae Bettcher  a professor of philosophy at California State University  Los Angeles  demonstrates how trans people are caught in a double bind  If a trans person successfully passes as cis and is later discovered to be trans  they re seen as an  evil deceiver  who has lied about who they really are  Trans people who are open about being trans  on the other hand  are seen as  make believers    cheap counterfeits  pathetically attempting to be something they couldn t possibly actually be  The problem with this view of trans people as either deceptive or pathetic frauds is that it presupposes that there s a real thing that trans women are failing to be  And this sounds an awful lot like the biological essentialism that almost all feminists reject The current debates over trans women bring us back to the question of what set of core experiences supposedly make someone who was assigned female at birth a  real  woman  Is it menstruation or childbirth  Nope   lots of women don t experience those  either by fate or by choice  What about being subject to sexual violence and harassment  Trans women face as much if not more sexual violence than cis women  How about simply a lifetime of unwanted objectifying male sexual attention  There are plenty of women who don t meet the standards of superficial sexual attractiveness who do not get such attention  and some of them even long for it  And surely we don t want to go back to the days of defining women by their hormones or even their chromosomes   if for no other reason than we d leave out the estimated 1 7 percent of women who are intersex When a cis woman complains that trans women haven t had the same experiences as  real  women born women  then  what she s really saying is   Trans women haven t had the same experiences as women like me   If 30 plus years of intersectional feminism has taught us anything  it s that this is precisely the move that feminists need to stop making Carol Hay is an associate professor of

The Steve Jobs Theater on Apple s spendy new campus in Cupertino  Calif   is a majestic temple to pomp  An ethereal glass and marble cylinder set high on a serene hill  the venue feels like the architectural manifestation of the Apple co founder s famous  reality distortion field   It is an edifice meant to recall those moments when Mr  Jobs  smirking joyfully  would bound up to the stage  teasingly pull a black shroud off some new invention and instantly alter your picture of the future And so it was meant to go once more last week  when Apple invited journalists and celebrities to an event billed as  a Think Different production  Some different thinking did seem in order  Since becoming the first trillion dollar corporation last summer  Apple has battled a souring assessment on Wall Street  The iPhone is the most profitable product in the history of business  but more than a decade after its debut  pretty much everyone on the planet who can afford one already has one  and many customers see little reason to upgrade  Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter  So now  instead of selling better stuff to more people  Apple s new plan is to sell more stuff to the same people   Today is going to be a very different kind of event   said Tim Cook  Apple s chief executive  taking the stage It was not  From start to finish  Apple s affair was a brushed aluminum homage to sameness   a parade of services that start ups and big rivals had done earlier  polished with an Apple y sheen of design and marketing  Among other offerings  Apple showed off a service for subscribing to news on your phone and a credit card  and it offered vague details about a still in development TV service involving Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey  who are not exactly edgy or up and coming  None of these efforts look terrible  Some  like the news service  might be handy  Yet they are all so trifling and derivative  As the analyst Ben Thompson noted  Apple s crush of me too announcements falls far short of Mr  Jobs s goal of putting  a ding in the universe   As I watched Apple s event  I felt the future shrink a little  In its gilded middle age  Apple is turning into something like a digital athleisure brand  stamping out countless upscale accessories for customers who love its one big thing  a company that has lost sight of the universe and is content merely to put a ding in your pocketbook In an ordinary time  such an ordinary corporate vision might be fine  But these aren t ordinary times  and Apple is no ordinary company  Here is a corporation with the resources of an empire  the mass devotion of a religion and the operational capacity of a war machine  Under Mr  Cook  Apple has cannily avoided every minefield in tech and politics over the past couple of years  winning a windfall from President Trump s tax cut  avoiding getting burned in his trade war   all while enjoying the loyalty of every moneyed hipster and suburbanite on earth We want to hear from youOpinionLosing Your Privacy in the Digital Age  Share Your StoriesFeb  13  2019Yet  all around Apple  the digital world is burning up  Indirectly  Apple s devices are implicated in the rise of misinformation and distraction  the erosion of privacy and the breakdown of democracy  None of these grand problems is Apple s fault  but given its centrality to the business  Apple has the capacity and wherewithal to mitigate them  But instead of rising to the moment by pushing a fundamentally new and safer vision of the future  Apple is shrinking from it Consider privacy  Mr  Cook is one of the tech industry s strongest champions of the sanctity of our private information  and Apple has pushed for more stringent privacy regulations   which is just about the least Apple could do  But what if it thought a little bigger  For example  it could directly take on Google and Facebook   the demons who rule our era of surveillance capitalism   by placing far more stringent restrictions on their culture of rampant invasion  or at least removing them from preferential places in the iPhone   Google will pay Apple an estimated  12 billion in 2019 to act as the default search engine on the iPhone  More than restricting the present  Apple could deploy its billions to build a better digital future  In particular  I wonder why Apple isn t working feverishly to create new privacy minded versions of social media services the world needs Take messaging  for starters  There is a strong moral case for Apple to turn iMessage  its encrypted messaging app  into an open standard available to anyone  even Android users  who currently lack many privacy minded messaging apps that aren t run by an ad company or aren t friendly with the Chinese government There might be a business case  too  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s founder  recently reoriented his company toward messaging  As Will Oremus noted in Slate  the move brings Facebook into direct competition with Apple  This presents an opportunity for Apple to turn a cold war into a hot one  Apple could swiftly undercut Mr  Zuckerberg s ambition by freeing iMessage and bringing the gift of privacy to the non Apple world RelatedOpinion   Cal NewportSteve Jobs Never Wanted Us to Use Our iPhones Like ThisJan  25  2019Here are some other big ideas  Apple could embark on a long term project to create a privacy minded search engine to rival Google s  It could build an ad free Instagram  its founders just left Facebook in frustration   It could create a YouTube that isn t a haven for neo Nazis  Some  or many  of these may be dumb ideas   ideas that would ruin Apple  or at the very least kneecap its short run profits  But they are at least big ideas  they match in scope and daring what Apple was created to do  Let other companies handle streaming entertainment  To paraphrase a wise man  Does Mr  Cook want to sell prestige TV for the rest of his life  or does he want to

morning walks to the Capitol in his days as a young congressman  His research methods are always at the top of my mind as I go about my work   says Maraniss  the Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter whose books include biographies of Bill Clinton  Barack Obama and Vince Lombardi  One of my mantras is Go There  wherever there is  to infuse myself in the culture and geography of a place  I learned this mostly from his moving to the Texas Hill Country to start his majestic Johnson biography  When I decided to do Lombardi  I knew that I had to move to Green Bay  and for the winter  When I m at an archive  I can hear Caro saying to me  Turn every page   And the patience that requires has so often made the difference   Maraniss says Anne Marie Lipinski is curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University  where Caro was a fellow in the 1960s  So many professions want to claim him   historians and nonfiction writers and the rest  but I think of him as quintessentially a journalist   she says   He has this method I would call  extreme reporting   that is uncompromising  exhaustive journalism  Caro spoke recently to The Associated Press at his Manhattan office suite  itself a testament to tradition  and the endurance of ink and paper  Documents and transcripts fill file cabinets  a typed and annotated outline for that final Johnson book covers a wall  and Caro still uses index cards to write himself the occasional reminder  For much of his career as an author  he has had the same publisher  Alfred A  Knopf   editor  Robert Gottlieb   literary agent  Lynn Nesbit  and typewriter  Smith Corona  Caro s method is not just to document history but to  make it personal   For  The Power Broker   he wrote about the New York City neighborhoods destroyed by Moses  highways  and the people who had the misfortune to be in his way  To capture the hold of Southern segregationists while Johnson was in politics  he used the life of the longtime Senate leader and LBJ mentor  Georgia s Richard Russell  visiting Russell s old hometown to get a sense of his stature  You tell the story through Richard Russell and make it a narrative that ties in with the main narrative and will have the additional power of being rooted in reported facts   Caro says Caro s previous books included in depth sections   dozens of pages of more   on an isolated subject or time frame  whether rural electrification in Texas or Johnson s first days as president  after John F  Kennedy s assassination For his next book  which covers Johnson s presidency and continues through his death  in 1973  Caro has two such take outs in mind  what life was like for the elderly before the 1965 passage of Medicare  and the impact of American bombing on a Vietnamese village  He hopes to visit Vietnam and meet with people on the other end of the attacks Johnson personally directed   This will be a very long book   acknowledges Caro  whose shortest Johnson biography   Means of Ascent   was over 500 pages Even reconstructing a meeting can be an investigative project  Caro mentions a White House discussion about the Vietnam War  with Johnson at the head of the table and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Secretary of State Dean Rusk among others in the room  Research meant tracking down every related memo and speaking with the attendees  He would interview McNamara for his perspective  then Rusk for his  Many historians  Caro believes  would stop there  But then I would I go back to McNamara   You said so and so  and Rusk said so and so  How do you square that   And then you go back to Rusk and you say the same thing about McNamara   he explains   You keep going back and that way you keep getting closer to the truth  Caro pauses  smiling in amazement  It s all an outgrowth of his time as a journalist  he realizes  the old rule of asking questions until you have none left to ask  He reaches for an index card and picks up a pen  repeating to himself   I never thought of that  I never thought of that   

MALVERN  Iowa   The Black Hawk military helicopter flew over Iowa  giving a senior U S  agriculture official and U S  senator an eyeful of the flood damage below  where yellow corn from ruptured metal silos spilled out into the muddy water And there s nothing the U S  government can do about the millions of bushels of damaged crops here under current laws or disaster aid programs  U S  Agriculture Under Secretary Bill Northey told a Reuters reporter who joined the flight The USDA has no mechanism to compensate farmers for damaged crops in storage  Northey said  a problem never before seen on this scale  That s in part because U S  farmers have never stored so much of their harvests  after years of oversupplied markets  low prices and the latest blow of lost sales from the U S  trade war with China   previously their biggest buyer of soybean exports The USDA last year made  12 billion in aid available to farmers who suffered trade war losses  without needing Congressional approval  The agency has separate programs that partially cover losses from cattle killed in natural disasters  compensate farmers who cannot plant crops due to weather  and help them remove debris left in fields after floods But it has no program to cover the catastrophic and largely uninsured stored crop losses from the widespread flooding  triggered by the  bomb cyclone  that hit the region in mid March  Congress would have to pass legislation to address the harvests lost in the storm  according to Northey and a USDA statement to Reuters  It s not traditionally been covered   he said   But we ve not usually had as many losses  Indigo Ag  an agriculture technology company  identified 832 on farm storage bins within flooded Midwest areas  They hold an estimated 5 million to 10 million bushels of corn and soybeans   worth between  17 3 million to  34 6 million   that could have been damaged in the floods  the company told Reuters Across the United States  farmers held soybean stocks of 2 716 billion bushels as of March 1  the largest on record for the time period  the USDA said on Friday  Corn stocks were the third largest on record Some Congress members have expressed interest in pursuing legislation to provide aid for damaged crops in storage  Northey said  But passing legislation could require a lengthy political process in the face of an urgent disaster  U S  Sen  Charles Grassley told farmers at a meeting in Malvern  Iowa  If we have to pass a bill to do it  I hate to tell you how long that takes   said the senator from Iowa  who joined Northey on the helicopter tour With farm incomes declining for years before the flood  many farmers had planned to sell their grain in storage for money to live  pay their taxes or finance operations  including planting this spring THROWING AWAY CROPSFrom the helicopter  piloted by National Guard members  officials surveyed miles of flooded fields in Iowa  littered with lawn chairs  fuel tanks  furniture  tires and other flood debris Farmers will have to destroy any grains that were contaminated by floodwater  which could also prevent some growers from planting oversaturated fields Near Crescent  Iowa  farmer Don Rief said the flood damaged more than 60 000 bushels of his grain  worth hundreds of thousands of dollars  He tried to move the crops before the flood  but dirt roads were too soft from the storm to support trucks   We were just hurrying like hell   Rief said   Hopefully USDA will come in and minimize some of the damage  The USDA does not have a program that covers flood damaged grain because farmers have typically received more advance notice of rising waters  allowing them to move crops and limit losses  said Tom Vilsack  who ran the agency under former President Barack Obama In this case  floods inundated fields quickly after multiple levees failed when rain and melting snow filled the Missouri River and other waterways  The frozen ground was unable to soak up the water  Near Percival  Iowa  railroad tracks leading up to a grain facility were flooded and broken  A Deere   Co dealership  Wendy s restaurant  Motel 6 and gas station nearby were also underwater  along with homes  cars and farm equipment Some farmers moved machinery such as tractors on to highways to keep it out of the path of the floods  The equipment was still parked there during the flyover on Friday DISASTER RELIEF  GAP About 416 000 acres of cropland across six counties in Iowa were flooded  said Amanda De Jong  state executive director for the USDA Iowa Farm Service Agency Of that  about 309 000 acres will be eligible for the federal program that helps farmers and ranchers remove debris left by natural disasters on farmlands  De Jong said last week  She estimated the program would need about  34 million to clean up the fields Iowa s agriculture secretary Mike Naig said the U S  government also should help compensate farmers for some of the grain that was damaged   This is clearly a gap that we think needs to be addressed   said Naig  who accompanied Grassley and Northey in the chopper  Time is short for a solution  said Carol Vinton  supervisor of Mills County  Iowa  one of the state s two most heavily damaged counties  Vinton said she was getting calls from farmers whose grain was damaged and are worried about making good on previously signed contracts to deliver those crops to elevators The USDA wants to do everything it can to help farmers hurt by the disaster  Northey said  They spent all last year raising that crop  putting it in the bin and they maybe already have it marketed   he said   And now they re going to have to spend time just to get rid of it   just to clean the place up    Reporting by Tom Polansek in Malvern  Iowa  Additional reporting

LONDON   Britain s Parliament on Monday failed to reach a majority on any one of four new proposals for the country s exit from the European Union  worsening the disarray over Brexit less than two weeks before the deadline to depart The votes on Monday were part of a remarkable power grab by lawmakers  frustrated by Prime Minister Theresa May s failure to forge consensus around Brexit  as the process of extricating Britain from the European Union is known  and alarmed that the country could face a disorderly  economically damaging departure without any kind of deal by the deadline of April 12 In the votes  which were nonbinding  lawmakers considered four plans  The failure to agree on any of them means Britain is facing the deadline with nothing resolved and all the options remaining on the table It also underscores the stalemate in Parliament where different factions appear unable to compromise enough to swing behind any one vision for Brexit ImagePrime Minister Theresa May of Britain listening as the opposition leader  Jeremy Corbyn  spoke in the House of Commons in London on Monday CreditUK Parliamentary Recording Unit  via Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesSomething will have to give soon  however  By April 10  Mrs  May needs to get a Brexit agreement through Parliament or ask the leaders of the European Union for a longer delay if she wants to avoid leaving without a deal The plan that lost most narrowly was for a customs union that would keep Britain in the same tariff system as the rest of the European Union countries  tying the country closely to the bloc  It failed 276 273 Mrs  May s own plan would be a starker separation  It would keep Britain in the European Union customs and trading system until at least the end of 2020  but eventually would have the country leave the customs union and single market  and assert control over immigration from continental Europe Mrs  May will hold a cabinet meeting on Tuesday to discuss the next steps  She is likely to seek another vote to pass her plan later this week   possibly on Wednesday   if the Speaker of the House of Commons  John Bercow  permits it But Parliament has rejected her plan three times   resoundingly  And Mr  Bercow has already warned Mrs  May against bringing back a proposition that has been rejected What Is Brexit  A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit  the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union Parliament is expected to debate Brexit again on Wednesday  and it remained unclear whether lawmakers would continue to try to again wrest control from Mrs  May  and make another effort to garner support for any other alternative Jeremy Corbyn  leader of the opposition Labour Party said that  the margin of defeat for one of the options tonight was very narrow indeed and the prime minister s deal has been rejected by very large majorities on three occasions   If it is good enough for the prime minister to have three chances at her deal then I suggest that possibly the House should have a chance to consider again the options that we had before us today  in a debate on Wednesday  so that the House can succeed where the prime minister has failed  After Monday s votes  a lawmaker who tried to forge one of the compromise plans  Nick Boles  said he was resigning from the Conservative Party  because  he said  it  has shown itself to be incapable of compromise  Mr  Boles said he would remain in Parliament as an independent If Mrs  May s plan does not get another vote  she could try to pursue an exit without any agreement  But that would split her cabinet  and some members might resign  Also  Parliament has indicated that it does not support an exit without a deal ImageThe Conservative chief whip of the House of Commons  Julian Smith  arriving at the prime minister s residence last week CreditMatt Dunham Associated PressMrs  May could ask the European Union for another delay but then she would have to agree that Britain take part in European elections  which she has said would be wrong given the 2016 referendum vote by Britons to leave the bloc The other alternative would be to press for a general election  But that would raise the question of who would lead her Conservative Party  given that Mrs  May is widely unpopular and an ineffective campaigner  She promised last week to step aside as prime minister if pro Brexit Tory lawmakers supported her deal Mrs  May s cabinet is now at war  a fact conceded by Julian Smith  the chief whip and responsible for winning votes in Parliament  who told the BBC that Brexit had produced the  worst example of ill discipline in cabinet in British political history  Around 170 Conservative lawmakers have signed a letter to the prime minister insisting that Britain should leave the European Union on April 12  with or without an agreement Still  Mrs  May s thrice rejected deal is not dead yet Last week she managed to win over some pro Brexit supporters  like the former foreign secretary  Boris Johnson  who supported her plan on Friday despite having criticized it for months  calling it a straitjacket  among other things ImageMrs  May with her husband  Philip  attending church on Sunday in Maidenhead  Britain CreditEPA  via ShutterstockBut a group of pro Brexit hard liners  who call themselves the  Spartans   have not been reconciled and still hope to leave the European Union without an agreement One of their leaders  Steve Baker  on Monday said that the option of voting down his own government in a confidence motion was  coming onto the table   if all else fails on Brexit Mrs  May is still hoping to win over 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party  which normally supports the government but opposes Mrs  May s Brexit deal The D U P  worries that provisions to keep open the Irish border could mean that Northern Ireland has to obey more European Union rules than the rest of the United Kingdom  effectively changing its constitutional status On Monday one D U P  lawmaker  Sammy Wilson  said Mrs  May could bring her deal back to Parliament  a thousand times   and his party would still vote against it The other plans that Parliament considered on Monday were  one to keep Britain in both the customs union and Europe s single market  another to put any Brexit plan to a referendum  and the option of canceling Brexit altogether if nothing is agreed by April 12 The plan for the customs union and single market failed 282 261  the plan for a second referendum failed 292 280  the plan for canceling Brexit with no agreement failed 292 191  

SHAH ALAM  Malaysia   Two years after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un s half brother was killed  a Malaysian court on Monday dropped the murder charge against the only suspect still in custody  and she pleaded guilty to a lesser offense and is expected to be released soon The move to reduce the charge against the Vietnamese woman  Doan Thi Huong  came three weeks after an even more stunning development in the case  when prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the murder charge against Huong s Indonesian co defendant and immediately freed her The two women had been the only suspects in custody after four North Korean suspects fled Malaysia following the killing of Kim Jong Nam in a Kuala Lumpur airport terminal on the morning of Feb  13  2017 Oh Ei Sun  a senior fellow with the Singapore Institute of International Affairs  said the decision not to charge the two women with murder likely marked the end of the case  This is pretty much the end as the real culprits are apparently hiding behind the veil of diplomatic immunity and state sponsored sanctuary   Oh said Huong and the Indonesian woman  Siti Aisyah  have said they thought they were participating in a prank for a TV show and did not know they actually were taking part in a high profile murder  The two were arrested and accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Kim s face Kim was the eldest son in the current generation of North Korea s ruling family  He had been living abroad for years but could have been seen as a threat to Kim Jong Un s rule Lawyers for the women have previously said they were pawns in a political assassination with clear links to the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur  and that the prosecution failed to show the women had any intention to kill  Intent to kill is crucial to a murder charge under Malaysian law Malaysian officials have never officially accused North Korea and have made it clear they don t want the trial politicized The murder charge the women had faced carried the death penalty if they were convicted  Huong nodded Monday as a translator read the new charge to her  voluntarily causing injury with a dangerous weapon  VX nerve agent Oh said he believed it was a  friendly gesture to Vietnam while paying due respect to the judicial process   While Huong may not have had any premeditated intent to kill Kim  she did apply the VX on his face and has to account for it  he said High Court Judge Azmi Ariffin sentenced Huong to three years and four months in prison from the day she was arrested on Feb  15  2017  Huong s lawyer Hisyam Teh Poh Teik said his client is expected to be freed by the first week of May  after a one third reduction in her sentence for good behavior  I am happy   Huong  30  told reporters as she left the courtroom  adding that she thought it was a fair outcome While handing out a jail term short of the maximum 10 years the new charge carried  the judge told Huong she was  very  very lucky  and wished her  all the best   Vietnamese officials in the courtroom cheered when the decision was announced The move follows the Malaysian attorney general s decision to drop the murder case against Aisyah on March 11 following high level lobbying from Indonesia s government  Huong sought to be acquitted after Aisyah was freed  but prosecutors rejected her request Prosecutor Iskandar Ahmad told the court that the attorney general offered the reduced charge to Huong following pleas from the Vietnamese government and her lawyers The original charge had alleged that the two women colluded with four North Koreans to murder Kim with VX nerve agent as he passed through the airport A High Court judge last August found there was enough evidence to infer that Aisyah  Huong and the four North Koreans engaged in a  well planned conspiracy  to kill Kim and called on the two women to present their defense Huong s lawyer told the court Monday that her guilty plea to the lesser charge showed she  has taken responsibility  for her actions  In asking for a lenient sentence  he also told the court that her move saved judicial time Hisyam had urged the judge to take into account Huong s honesty  her acceptance of responsibility and the acquittal of her co defendant   She is neither a criminal nor has the propensity to commit a crime   the lawyer said Huong  the youngest of five children  has a promising future with a degree in accounting  but she is also  naive and gullible   he said Hisyam said the four North Korean suspects still at large were the  real assassins  They  exploited her weakness and manipulated her to carry out their evil designs under the camouflage of funny videos and pranks   he said The judge said he took into account the gravity of the offense and also the fact that Huong was remorseful and a first offender  He said the sentence  would serve the interest of justice  Before the sentencing  Vietnam s ambassador to Malaysia  Le Quy Quynh  said he expected Huong to be freed immediately  After the sentencing  he said   I am highly appreciative that she will be released very soon but I want to emphasize that she is a victim like the Indonesian  Hisyam told reporters later that Huong wasn t being fairly treated compared to Aisyah  but that she pleaded guilty because she wanted to walk free as soon as possible Huong s father  Doan Van Thanh  who attended the hearing  said he was delighted that she will be soon be free As Huong was being escorted out of the court building  she shouted to reporters   It s very good  I love you   She told reporters earlier that she wants to  sing and act  when she returns to Vietnam  

JERUSALEM   In a charged election campaign that has been heavy on insults and short on substance  Israel s conflict with the Palestinians has been notably absent from the discourse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s ruling Likud Party has offered no plan for what many believe is the country s most existential problem  His main challenger in the April 9 vote speaks vaguely of  separation   while Netanyahu s hard line partners speak openly of the once unthinkable idea of annexing all or parts of the West Bank  Talk of a Palestinian state  the international community s preferred solution for the past two decades  is non existent It is a far cry from past elections  when peace with the Palestinians was the central issue for voters  This apparent lack of interest reflects widespread disillusionment in Israel over years of failed peace efforts But it also is a testament to Netanyahu s success in sidelining the issue  Capitalizing on internal Palestinian divisions and promoting sometimes contradictory policies  Netanyahu has succeeded in managing the conflict without addressing the bigger issue of how two intertwined peoples will live together in the future  Strong backing from the Trump administration has given him an extra boost  The peace track is currently in a coma   said Shmuel Rosner  a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute   There s not much hope for a viable solution to be revived in the near future  so people can just keep pushing it aside until someday it comes back to haunt them  Netanyahu took office in early 2009 and under heavy pressure from then President Barack Obama reluctantly stated his support for an independent Palestinian state  albeit with many conditions  which were rejected Things quickly went downhill  and serious peace talks never took place during Obama s time in office Throughout his tenure  Netanyahu has repeatedly cast blame on the Palestinians  accusing President Mahmoud Abbas  who seeks a negotiated settlement with Israel  of incitement and promoting  terror   At the same time  he has maintained behind the scenes security cooperation with Abbas  forces in the West Bank in a joint struggle against the Hamas militant group In the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip  Netanyahu has engaged in frequent rounds of fighting  but is also conducting behind the scenes negotiations with his bitter enemy in hopes of maintaining calm The Trump administration has further sidelined the Palestinians by cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital  prompting the Palestinians to sever ties with the U S  A long promised peace plan  which the White House says will be released after the election  faces dim prospects  if it is even released With the peace process in a deep freeze  it is perhaps no surprise that none of the major Israeli parties are talking about the Palestinians  The Palestinian cause is totally absent in the Israeli elections  and when it comes  it comes only in a negative context   said Ahmed Majdalani  a senior Palestinian official   This is worrisome  because it tells us that we are going from bad to worse  The Palestinians seek the West Bank  east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip   areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war   for an independent state  The so called two state solution is widely backed internationally as the best way to end the conflict If Israel continues to rule over millions of Palestinians  the thinking goes  the Palestinians will eventually abandon their dream of statehood and instead demand Israeli citizenship and full equality  In such a scenario  Israel would no longer be able to be both Jewish and democratic Israelis accuse the Palestinians of rejecting generous peace offers  most recently in late 2008  a narrative the Palestinians reject  The Israelis also point to the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza  which cleared the way for Hamas to seize power from Abbas  forces two years later Ahead of the election  several religious and nationalist parties  along with individual members of Netanyahu s Likud party  have openly called for annexing parts or all of the West Bank  These plans include a range of proposals for the Palestinians  including nonvoting residency rights  possible citizenship or financial incentives to emigrate It remains unclear how hard these parties  all potential coalition partners for Netanyahu  will push  though Trump s recent recognition of Israel s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights has led to stepped up calls for annexing West Bank territory Likud spokesman Eli Hazan said he does not expect annexation to be on the agenda  He said the party  strongly believes  in the status quo   We are against the one state solution and two state solution  Both ways may lead to the end of Israel as a Jewish and democratic country   he said Yohanan Plesner  president of the Israeli Democracy Institute and a former lawmaker  said he did not think Netanyahu would give in to the annexation calls   At the end of the day  West Bank annexation is the prerogative of the prime minister   he said Netanyahu s main challenger  former military chief Benny Gantz  has given Israel s  peace camp  some dim hope His Blue and White party s platform devotes just a few sentences to the Palestinians  promising  an open horizon for political settlement  and pledging to work with Arab neighbors to find a way to  deepen the separation   It makes no mention of Palestinian statehood  and says Israel will continue to maintain control of parts of the West Bank and never divide Jerusalem Ghassan Khatib  a former Palestinian negotiator  said the lack of interest on the Israeli side is harmful to the Palestinians in the short term but much worse for Israel in the long term  It means the end of the two state solution   he said   The alternative will be an apartheid system  and this will cause huge damage to Israeli democracy and the image of Israel  Yossi Beilin  one of the chief architects of Israel s historic 1993 interim peace agreement with the Palestinians  said Netanyahu s policies have been  devastating  for peace prospects  Yet he remains confident the two state solution will one day be adopted due to a lack of alternatives  and even believes that Gantz  for sure  will pursue a peace deal if elected Ironically  Trump s peace plan  if released  may force Netanyahu s hand  Beilin said  If elected  Netanyahu will have a hard time resisting his close friend s proposal while his hard line coalition partners oppose any concessions to the Palestinians  The impact of the plan might be very interesting   Beilin said    Associated Press writers Isabel Debre in Jerusalem and Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah  West Bank  contributed  

 What you need to know to start the day  Get New York Today in your inbox  His slave s name was Betty  She is described in a receipt only by her price  35 gold coins The slave owner  Pierre Deyo  would distinguish himself as a member of one of the six families that founded New Paltz  N Y   a town about 80 miles north of New York City Deyo House  a student dormitory on the campus of the State University of New York at New Paltz  was named in honor of him and his father  The names of the other founders   all of whom were slave owners   have graced five other buildings at the college that was established in 1828 Until now  After months of debate and discussion  all six buildings will be renamed in time for the start of the fall semester The school s president  Donald P  Christian  said his decision to initiate the conversation that led to a recent vote grew out of the deadly 2017  Unite the Right  rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville  Va  The rally began on the campus of the University of Virginia as part of a protest over a plan to remove a statue of a Confederate general from a city park  The fact that these names were on residential buildings was one that we heard a lot from students   what it meant for them to be asked to live and eat and sleep in buildings that carried the names of slave owners   Dr  Christian said The decision by SUNY New Paltz follows a recent wave of colleges grappling with troubling histories  Some schools have started projects specifically to explore their ties to slavery  publishing the findings online  Yale University  less than two years ago  changed the name of a residential college that commemorated a 19th century white supremacist The chairman of SUNY s Board of Trustees  H  Carl McCall  a former state senator and comptroller who was New York s first black candidate to be elected to statewide office  applauded the decision by SUNY New Paltz to remove the slave owners  names  They did participate in this terrible attack on humanity that is a part of our American heritage  and we have to do everything we can to talk about it and to take steps now to show that we do not accept it   Mr  McCall said in an interview The bucolic SUNY New Paltz campus  where the 7 500 member student body is 6 percent black  is nestled in a town immensely proud to be founded by Huguenots   French protestants who fled Europe to escape persecution In 1677  six Huguenot families purchased the land that became New Paltz  according to the town s website  Their handiwork can still be seen on the stone houses that line historic Huguenot Street  A national landmark  the street and the surrounding area are run by a historical society that hosts tours and events  Many of the founders  descendants live in the area  and their last names still hold clout  Bevier  Crispell  DuBois  Hasbrouck  LeFevre and  of course  Deyo Those same surnames appear often in historic documents that reveal transactions for human life  In consideration of the sum of twenty five pounds to me in hand   a seller wrote in 1790  according to the bill of sale that is part of the historical society s collection   doth bargain and sell to the said Ann Bevier a Negroe girl named Gin about eleven years old  Three centuries later  Dr  Christian asked the community s opinion about the dining hall and five residence halls that were namesakes of slave owners The school established a diversity panel made up of students  faculty and staff members to explore the issue  The group held public forums  examined how other institutions have handled similar issues and researched local history  determining that the buildings were indeed named after the town s founders and not their descendants N della Seque  a 21 year old senior and the president of the student association  said she was moved by the tearful pleas to change the names during forums run by the diversity panel   That moment right there was what made me realize   No  this has to change    she said   I didn t see it as erasing history  It was realizing what this history means to certain individuals  The panel ultimately recommended the name change  a decision that deeply offended some descendants of the founders  It s unfair to project the moral standards of today onto those earlier generations   said Robert W  Hasbrouck  85  a ninth generation descendant of an original settler He is the president of the Hasbrouck Family Association  a nonprofit with about 400 members intent on preserving the region s history  Should we rename or tear down the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial  Where do we stop   Mr  Hasbrouck asked   We feel that it s unjustified  it s being done as an overeagerness to be politically correct  Jennifer LeFevre  whose surname is being removed from a residence hall  had urged the College Council to retain the original names  To bow to pressure to reject the town s heritage simply because some elements of that history are distasteful to some is a disservice to history   Ms  LeFevre wrote in a letter to the Council The College Council passed the resolution to remove the names in a 4 to 3 vote in late February  The buildings will soon feature Native American names that reflect regional geographic features  Shawangunk Hall  Awosting Hall  Minnewaska Hall  Mohonk Hall  Ashokan Hall and Peregrine Dining Hall  Ilyasah Shabazz  the daughter of Malcolm X and a SUNY New Paltz graduate  said on Twitter that she was proud of the decision  This is what community accountability and cultural intelligence working together looks like in real time application  Proud of  SUNY   Ms  Shabazz wrote The Huguenot names will not disappear altogether  The school is hoping to include them in a contemplative space where their contributions are recognized along with details about their slave ownership The town s Huguenot historical society has made its own attempts to implement programming that honors the region s authentic history  Although the town s 14 000 residents are predominantly white  the society recently began hosting a celebration of African culture  music and food in honor of Juneteenth  It has also welcomed a member of the Slave Dwelling Project  a preservation organization that conducts overnight stays at sites associated with slavery Some descendants of the six founding families had no objection to the school s decision  Enslaved Africans and Native Americans were marginalized for our success   said Catherine Harris  a LeFevre descendant  in a letter to the school s College Council  Let the renaming of these buildings be one small step in the restorative justice this nation is seeking   

GAZA CITY  Gaza Strip   Over the weekend  Gaza s Hamas rulers marked a year of bloody  weekly protests that have failed to break the Israeli blockade  Rocket attacks brought a wave of Israeli airstrikes and unprecedented protests broke out against the Islamic militants  increasingly unpopular rule And yet Hamas  control over Gaza is tighter than ever The militants  rule has been strengthened by an unlikely overlap of interests with Israel s right wing government  Neither wants to see an independent state established in all the West Bank  Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem  as the resolution of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  And Hamas  refusal to give up power   the asking price of its West Bank based Palestinian rival for reconciliation   aligns with Israel s long standing policy of maintaining a separation between the West Bank and Gaza So even though Israel and Hamas have fought three wars and dozens of skirmishes  and even though Hamas remains committed to Israel s eventual destruction  the two are once again meeting with Egyptian mediators and working to keep things quiet Under an emerging arrangement  Hamas would halt rocket fire and keep border protests peaceful in exchange for Israel easing its border blockade and allowing  30 million a month in Qatari aid into the territory  On Sunday  Israel reopened Gaza crossings to limited traffic Egypt has brokered short lived deals in the past  and it is not clear if the current arrangements will last beyond Israel s April 9 election  In a close race  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under fire for what his challengers say is a Gaza policy that exposes Israel to Hamas blackmail For Gaza residents  open ended Hamas rule is a bleak prospect  Gaza s 2 million people have endured rising poverty and unemployment  undrinkable ground water and frequent electricity outages since Israel and Egypt closed Gaza s borders after Hamas seized power in 2007 In recent weeks  hundreds dared to protest Hamas policies  such as new tax hikes  chanting  We want to live   Many were jailed and beaten  Protester Amer Balousha  a 27 year old unemployed law school graduate  said he and others were mistreated in Hamas detention but will not be deterred  If the situation does not improve  the protests will continue   he said    HAMAS OVER ABBASHamas has demonstrated that it prefers an understanding with Netanyahu over reconciling with its Palestinian rival  President Mahmoud Abbas A deal with Israel would help keep Hamas in power  By contrast  Abbas   who presides over autonomous enclaves in the Israeli occupied West Bank   wants Hamas to hand control of Gaza to him  a demand the group has repeatedly rejected Hamas and Netanyahu both oppose Abbas  goal of Palestinian statehood in the West Bank  Gaza and east Jerusalem  lands Israel captured in 1967  Hamas seeks to establish an Islamic state in the area encompassing Israel and the war won lands  while a majority in Netanyahu s Cabinet and Likud Party reject a two state solution along the 1967 lines Last month  Netanyahu was quoted as saying that those who oppose Palestinian statehood should back his policy of allowing Qatari aid into Gaza and maintaining the separation between the rival Palestinian governments  There is a great confluence of interests  between Israel and Hamas  said Tareq Baconi  an analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank   Netanyahu prefers to deal with Hamas because clear dynamics have been established and Hamas will not seek a final resolution  of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  from Israel     MANAGING THE CONFLICTIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars  most recently in 2014  In between  there have been repeated cross border skirmishes and periods of calm brokered by Egypt  which has close security ties with Israel and controls part of the Gaza border Israel s stated reason for the blockade is to contain Hamas and prevent it from rearming  while rights groups denounce the restrictions as collective punishment Last summer  amid weekly mass protests along the frontier in which scores of Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire and thousands wounded  Egypt started new cease fire talks  Hamas hoped they would lead to an easing of the blockade Early on  Israel consented to Qatari cash shipments and Hamas pledged to halt rocket fire  but then the talks stalled  In March  with Israel s election campaign heating up  Hamas sensed an opportunity to apply pressure on Netanyahu to resume negotiations  twice firing rockets into central Israel It worked  Two Hamas officials  speaking Sunday on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the renewed truce talks  relished in the group s apparent leverage  But they also expressed concern any new deal could quickly unravel    A NEW GAZA POLICY Netanyahu s main challenger  former army chief Benny Gantz  has said he would handle Gaza differently  His party s platform pledges a  powerful response to any provocation and violence   while improving the lives of Gaza civilians and driving a wedge between them and Hamas But the plan is short on specifics Gantz and two other ex military chiefs in his team held top command roles in the last three wars with Hamas  exacting a heavy price for rocket fire but coming up against the limits of military action  A consensus has emerged in Israel that Hamas cannot be brought down by force  short of a bloody reoccupation of Gaza Yet any easing of the blockade  meant to bring relief to Gaza s residents  would also prolong Hamas rule    ODD MAN OUTAbbas has given up on reconciliation with Hamas after years of failed efforts  He has stepped up financial pressure on Gaza  including cutting in half salaries for tens of thousands of ex civil servants who were replaced by Hamas in 2007 but remained on the Abbas government payroll Such cutbacks worsened Gaza s economic deterioration  But instead of stoking a popular uprising against Hamas  anger turned toward Abbas Abbas is also suspicious of multi million dollar Gaza development projects proposed by the U N  and Qatar  with U S  and Israeli backing  He fears it s a plot to turn the territory into a Palestinian mini state and undercut Palestinian political claims to the West Bank and east Jerusalem Baconi  the analyst  said that Abbas  policies are counterproductive  even if his concerns are understandable   Putting more sanctions on Gaza or trying to break the Hamas government will further entrench the division   he said    Laub reported from Ramallah  West Bank

JALALABAD  Afghanistan   During a lull in Afghanistan s never ending war  before the fighting season resumes once again in the spring  Taliban fighters recall laying down their Kalashnikovs and  for a brief moment  enjoying a game of cricket The sport is the only one most of the fighters enjoy  commanders say  with matches attracting hundreds of spectators from Taliban controlled villages when there is no fighting  They are also fans of the increasingly successful national team  I love cricket   said Mullah Badruddin  a Taliban commander in Khogyani district of Nangarhar  on the border with Pakistan  where a tournament organized by the militants at the start of last winter drew large crowds  When Afghanistan play against another team  we listen to the radio with great interest and we also check for scores in social media and follow those in Facebook who give live updates   he told Reuters by telephone First played in Afghanistan by British troops in the 19th Century  the game was adopted by Afghans in the refugee camps of cricket loving Pakistan  where more than 3 million fled a Soviet invasion and civil war in the 1980s and 1990s  and has since made huge strides in the country  particularly among ethnic Pashtuns in the eastern border provinces  Taj Malook Khan  who helped set up the Afghan Cricket Club in Kacha Gari refugee camp outside the Pakistani city of Peshawar in the 1980s  and a small group of players used to cross into Afghanistan during the 1990s Taliban era to play and promote cricket The Taliban had banned games such as cricket and football in the early years of their austere rule because they believed they kept men away from prayers  according to former national cricketer Hasti Gul  but later became more tolerant of cricket From there  despite at least two attacks in the past couple of years on cricket matches claimed by the ultra radical Islamic State group  the game now rivals football for popularity in a country that has long been cut off from international sport STAR NAMESAdmitted as a full member of the International Cricket Council in 2017  Afghanistan won its first five day Test match against Ireland last month after making steady progress in the lower levels of the international game However it is in the dynamic  shorter form of the sport that Afghans have had most impact Players such as spin bowler Rashid Khan or big hitting batsman Mohammad Nabi Esakhil have become undisputed stars of the Indian Premier League  IPL   the razzle dazzle showcase of so called T20 cricket  the 12th season of which has just got under way Despite the Taliban s former suspicion of organized sports and their opposition to much of the transformation in Afghanistan since their hardline Islamic regime was toppled in 2001  many of the mainly Pashtun movement s fighters are fans Unlike football  which offends the sensibilities of some very conservative Muslims because it is normally played in shorts  cricket is played in long sleeves and trousers  in line with traditional dress codes  It also bears some resemblance to traditional Afghan children s games involving throwing and using sticks to hit smaller sticks or balls Karim Sadiq  a former batsman in the national team and an early pioneer of the sport who visited some Taliban controlled areas in eastern Afghanistan this year  said he was mobbed by fighters asking about the game and their favorite players A video clip he shot on his mobile phone shows dozens of Taliban  many with Kalashnikov automatic rifles slung across their shoulders  dissecting the quality of the team  I like all the players but my favorite is Rashid Khan Arman   says one fighter  referring to the young spin bowler who stars for the Afghan national side and IPL s Sunrisers Hyderabad   His bowling is amazing  WORLD CUP DREAMWith the approach of the cricket World Cup in England and Wales from May to July  Afghanistan s hopes of making a dent in the tournament are higher than they have ever been  even if few give them a chance against giants of the game such as India  Australia or England  We have a very strong team and my dream is Afghanistan bring the World Cup home   said Hazrat Gul  a young cricketer in the eastern city of Jalalabad  as he prepared to play a friendly match against a team from neighboring Kunar province As peace talks between the U S  government and Taliban officials continue and Afghanistan looks for a way out of 40 years of conflict  excitement is building and officials and government ministers lavish praise on the players  whom President Ashraf Ghani has called national heroes From the other side of the war  the feeling is similar  Sadiq who has just returned to practice after a long injury  aiming to take part in the upcoming World Cup  said the Taliban usually send them congratulatory messages through social media and on his cellphone when Afghanistan win Such broad appeal has seen the sport widely hailed as a unifying force in Afghanistan  a patchwork of different languages and cultures  sometimes at peace with each other but increasingly in recent years in conflict ETHNIC DIVIDESNot everyone is on board the cricket bandwagon  however Look deeper  and the state of the game has much to say about a country where sport has repeatedly attracted violence  including suicide attacks on cricket and wrestling matches  and where politics is increasingly divided along ethnic lines that shade into all aspects of life For many Persian speaking Tajiks and Hazaras  cricket is a sport for Pashtuns  the dominant ethnic group from the south and east of the country that has provided almost all kings and presidents throughout Afghan history  I have no interest and don t know anything about cricket   said Ahmad Jawad  a shopkeeper in Parwan  a mainly Tajik province north of Kabul   It s a Pashtun game with Pashtun players  so let them enjoy their game  After the Taliban fell following the U S  led campaign of 2001  Sadiq and Gul   brothers who  like many teammates  learned their cricket in Pakistan   and other players struggled to convince Tajik commanders from the victorious Northern Alliance that swept into Kabul to allow them to continue playing the game  Palace officials told us to join Afghan guard units and forget about cricket   said Gul  who recalled having to cancel a provincial tournament in Kabul in 2005 after losing a fistfight with soccer players who wanted to use the pitch Now  with the IPL beamed into homes all over the country and the looming World Cup  he feels change is coming and the sport can give Afghanistan a platform no other can equal  one that offers hope for a more normal future after so many years of war  We literally had no support from the government for so many years before they have realized we could bring glory to our country   he said   Now everyone loves cricket and we are so proud to raise our national flag on the world stage    Additional reporting by

neighborhood where he grew up  Hussle  33  and his business partner purchased property in the Crenshaw neighborhood  intending to knock it down and erect a six story residential building atop a commercial plaza  with The Marathon as its anchor Hussle s philanthropic work went well beyond the usual celebrity  giving back  ethos  and political and community leaders were as quick and effusive in their praise as his fellow hip hop artists  Nipsey s activism  leadership and dedication to community was an inspiration for Californians and beyond   tweeted California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris   His senseless death leaves us worse off  By Monday  hundreds of people formed a circle in front of the closed store to pay their respects  A memorial of candles  flowers and paintings of Hussle took shape in front of the store and in the parking lot  Blaring loudly through several speakers  some of Hussle s popular songs were being played including  The Weather     Double Up  and  Hussle   Motivate  Some shed tears  Many mourners pulled out their phones to document the scene  Others yelled   Long live Nipsey  Dontae Coleman  28  who lives in the neighborhood  fell to his knees and cried and called Hussle  a legend   Someone changed history yesterday   he said  referring to the gunman Coleman commended the rapper for trying to uplift his own community first instead of simply going elsewhere  A lot of people who get rich don t come back here   he said   He s rare  A lot of people like him don t come around often  Denise Francis Woods  a neighborhood resident who is running for City Council  remembered when Hussle used to sell his demo tapes on street corners in the neighborhood for  5  People would tease him   she said   They didn t think that this would work out and look what happened  He persevered  he stayed in  he never gave up   The effort took him to a whole other level  where he ended up owning property on the same corner  An autopsy performed Monday found that Hussle s death was a homicide  caused by bullet wounds to the head and torso  Police did not reveal a motive or publicly identify any suspects  Two other men standing near Hussle were shot and wounded Los Angeles Police Commissioner Steve Soboroff tweeted that he and Police Chief Michel Moore had agreed to meet with Hussle on Monday to talk about ways to stop gang violence Hussle  whose real name was Ermias Asghedom  was an Eritrean American father of two who was engaged to actress Lauren London His hip hop friends and other stars  including Rihanna and Snoop Dogg  mourned on social media  with many pointing out his particular role in uplifting African Americans  I ll remember the beauty that he saw in our community  And the beauty that he was  He loved us   film director Ava Duvernay tweeted   He s left that love with us  And it cannot die  Rest in Power  King  You mattered  Born on Aug  15  1985  Hussle said his first passion was music but getting resources was tough after leaving his mother s house at 14 to live with his grandmother  He said he got involved in street life as he tried to support himself  and he joined the gang Rollin 60 s Neighborhood Crips as a teenager  I grew up in gang culture   Hussle told the Los Angeles Times in 2018   We dealt with death  with murder  It was like living in a war zone  where people die on these blocks and everybody is a little bit immune to it  Hussle said his stage name  a play on the 1960s and  70s rhyming standup comic Nipsey Russell  was given to him as a teen by an older friend because he was such a go getter   always hustling For a decade  he released much sought after mixtapes that he sold out of the trunk of his car  helping him create a buzz and gain respect from rap purists and his peers He charged  100 for his 2013 mixtape  Crenshaw   scoring a cash and publicity coup when Jay Z bought 100 copies for  10 000 Last year he hit new heights with  Victory Lap   his critically

in LA  where he was a regular on the sidelines  Players admired him for his community building  So so SAD man   DAMN man this hurt   LA Lakers star LeBron James said in one of many emoji laden tweets about Hussle At the LA Clippers game on Sunday night  players Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams had specially made replica jerseys with  Hussle  on the back hanging in their lockers just a couple of hours after his death  and Hussle s picture was shown on the arena s video screens before tipoff Hussle had  worked his tail off  to  establish the type of love and type of support that he had from the community   Harrell said  He was  a person who s built his own empire  his own type of platform by doing it his way     This story has been corrected to reflect that the shooting was Sunday

The Labor Department released a proposal on Monday that would limit claims against big companies for employment law violations by franchisees or contractors The proposal seeks to define when  for example  employees of a locally owned McDonald s restaurant could challenge the McDonald s Corporation over compliance with minimum wage and overtime laws The proposal  which will require a 60 day public comment period before it can be finalized  could affect the ability of millions of workers to pursue wage claims under a concept called joint employment Franchisees and contractors can be small  poorly capitalized operations  complicating efforts to recover wages that were illegally denied  Instead  those efforts are often directed at large companies with whom those employers have relationships  This proposal will reduce uncertainty over joint employer status and clarify for workers who is responsible for their employment protections   the labor secretary  Alexander Acosta  said in a statement  In an abrupt shift  McDonald s said last week that it would no longer lobby against minimum wage increases  The proposal is a sharp departure from the joint employer criteria that the Labor Department laid out in 2016 under the Obama administration  Under those guidelines  a company like McDonald s could be held liable for minimum wage violations committed by a franchisee even if it did not directly supervise workers or hire and fire them  Exerting some forms of indirect control   like providing software or developing policies on which a franchisee relies   could make the larger corporation liable The Obama Labor Department also argued that corporations could be joint employers even without exercising control over a franchisee or contractor  simply because the smaller companies were economically dependent on them   for example  because the  upstream  company at the top of the supply chain provided facilities and handled payroll for a contractor The new proposal substantially restricts the situations in which a franchiser like McDonald s would be considered liable  In an example laid out by the Labor Department  a global hotel brand would not be held liable for minimum wage and overtime violations that a local franchisee committed  even if the franchisee relied on a variety of material provided by the hotel chain  such as sample employment applications and sample employee handbooks  Through this proposal  the Department of Labor has the chance to undo one of the most harmful regulatory actions from the past administration and replace it with a rule that creates certainty for America s 733 000 franchise businesses   Matthew Haller  a senior vice president at the International Franchise Association  said in a statement  An expanded joint employer standard has held back tens of billions of dollars in economic output each year due to a proliferation of frivolous lawsuits  precipitating significant changes to the way franchise brands interact with their local owners   he said According to the new proposal  four factors are involved in establishing joint employment  whether the upstream company exercises the power to hire and fire employees  whether it supervises them and controls their schedules  whether it sets their pay and whether it keeps up their employment records If a company doesn t engage in most or all of these activities  it is unlikely that it would be deemed a joint employer Critics accused the department of laying out a step by step guide to employers seeking to get off the hook for violations even when they have substantial control over workers hired by their franchisees and contractors  It has provided such an obvious road map for employers to evade liability   said Sharon Block  a former top official in the Obama Labor Department who is executive director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School   But that s going to introduce tremendous uncertainty into the lives of American workers who are subject to these business models  Ms  Block said that the legality of the regulation was likely to be challenged once it was finalized  and that courts could refuse to be bound by it The proposal comes at a moment of political peril for Mr  Acosta  who has been dogged by allegations that his office negotiated an unduly lenient plea agreement in a sex trafficking case while he was the United States attorney in South Florida more than a decade ago  The defendant  the financier Jeffrey E  Epstein  was accused of sex offenses involving girls as young as 14 but pleaded guilty to more minor prostitution charges Some Democrats have called for Mr  Acosta s resignation  and some Republicans have called for investigations into the matter Mr  Acosta has been viewed as especially vulnerable partly because a constituency that can normally be rallied to support a Republican labor secretary   business groups and management lawyers   has complained that he has been slow to step back from important Obama era policies and offer alternatives that are friendlier to business A Labor Department spokeswoman defended the agency s record  citing data showing that it achieved the second largest cost savings of any department through its deregulatory efforts during the last fiscal year  behind the Department of Health and Human Services Some of those employer concerns have subsided after Labor Department efforts in recent weeks  first with a plan on overtime eligibility  which signals a partial retreat from an Obama era rule that a court had struck down  and now with the joint employer proposal The latest proposal is part of a broader debate  also playing out at the National Labor Relations Board  over when employers should be held liable for violations committed by franchisees and contractors Because the board oversees the right to unionize and take other types of collective action  its joint employer doctrine determines whether companies are liable when  say  a franchisee illegally fires a worker in retaliation for trying to organize a union Under the doctrine set by the board during the Obama administration  a company is considered a joint employer if it exercises direct or indirect control over workers hired by a franchisee or contractor But the board  now with a Republican majority  is considering a proposal to narrow the standard so that control would have to be  substantial  direct and immediate  Tammy McCutchen  a lawyer at the management side law firm Littler Mendelson who was a top labor official in the George W  Bush administration  said she believed that the two agencies were effectively synchronizing their joint employment rules so that companies would face comparable standards of liability regardless of the type of violation She also argued that the Labor Department was essentially returning to a pre Obama doctrine affirmed many times by federal courts  The Obama era Labor Department was  cherry picking  to find legal precedent for its position  Ms  McCutchen said But David Weil  the Obama administration official whose division produced the 2016 guidance on the topic  said whatever their rulings  courts had typically acknowledged that the law required the Labor Department to use a fairly broad standard  Such a standard  he said  considers on the ground realities rather than merely the kind of narrow and formal checklist in the department s new proposal  The idea that it s so simple defies logic   Mr  Weil said  

NASHVILLE   Like many girls of my generation in the rural South  I learned every form of handwork my grandmother or great grandmother could teach me  sewing  knitting  crocheting  quilting  I even learned to tat  a kind of handwork done with a tiny shuttle that turns thread into lace  Some of my happiest memories are of sitting on the edge of my great grandmother s bed  our heads bent together over a difficult project  as she pulled out my mangled stitches and patiently demonstrated the proper way to do them But by the time I d mastered those skills  I had also lost the heart for them  Why bother to knit when the stores were full of warm sweaters  Why take months to make a quilt when the house had central heat  Of what possible use is tatting  which my great grandmother sewed to the edges of handmade handkerchiefs  when Kleenex comes in those little purse size packages But my abandonment of the domestic arts wasn t just pragmatic  By the time I got to college  I had come to the conclusion that handwork was incompatible with my own budding feminism  Wasn t such work just a form of subjugation  A way to keep women too busy in the home to assert any influence in the larger world  Without even realizing it  I had internalized the message that work traditionally done by men is inherently more valuable than work traditionally done by women I came to this unconscious conclusion almost inevitably  When every history class I ever took featured an endless list of battles won and lost by men  of political contests won and lost by men  of technological advances achieved by men  it s not surprising that the measure of significance seemed to be the yardstick established by men   almost exclusively white men Public history has the power to affect our very understanding of reality  It tells us what we should value most about the past and how we should understand our own place within that context  Just as art museums today must wrestle with an earlier aesthetic that excluded women and artists of color  local history museums are working to recalibrate the way they present the past In Montgomery  Ala   the Legacy Museum and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice convey the history of systemic racism in this country  In Louisiana  the restored Whitney Plantation s new focus is the way the enslaved people on the plantation lived  In Atlanta  the Cyclorama   a 360 degree diorama the length of a football field that depicts the Battle of Atlanta   was restored and returned to public display  this time with new interpretive materials that defy the Lost Cause myth  And in Memphis  the Pink Palace Museum has just opened an elaborate new exhibition  two years in the making  that celebrates the city s 200 year history as a kind of web in which specific issues like race thread through seemingly unrelated categories like art and entertainment  commerce and entrepreneurialism  and heritage and identity Here in Nashville  the new Tennessee State Museum  which opened last October  addresses the history of the state in a new building whose very design reinforces the idea that history is the story of everyone  of all the people  Andrew Jackson has his space  of course  but so do the Native Americans whom Jackson sent on the Trail of Tears  a genocidal march out of their homeland  All the relevant wars are here  along with all the relevant weaponry  but so are the pottery shards and the bedsteads and the whiskey jugs and the children s toys  It s all arranged in a timeline that unfolds at a human pace and on a human scale  equally beautiful and inviting  equally informative and embracing  My people are from Alabama  not Tennessee  but this space feels as though it belongs as much to me as to any Tennessean because it tells the kinds of stories that could be the story of my people  the kinds of stories that earlier versions of public history had always deemed unworthy of celebration or scholarly attention As it happens  the museum s first temporary exhibition  which opened in February and runs through July 7  is a gallery full of gorgeous quilts  That was the exhibition I most wanted to see  and it did not disappoint  The quilts were made by familiar patterns   star and flower garden and log cabin and wedding ring   if not by familiar hands  Some of my own family quilts are gorgeously complex  but others are barely more than plain rectangles sewn in a row  I once asked my mother about those serviceable but hardly beautiful quilts  and she said impatiently   People were cold  Margaret  They were trying to stay warm  The quilts in the exhibition at the Tennessee State Museum would keep people warm  but they are also absolute showpieces  with carefully coordinated colors and tiny stitches so perfectly close together and so perfectly uniform that it seems impossible for them to have been made by human hands  These women were nothing less than artists  and the gallery s informational placards elevate them to that status and place them within that context  I studied the stitches and thought again and again of the women who had taught me to sit before a table frame and push a needle through all three quilt layers  taking stitches small enough to keep the batting from wadding up in the wash Image Between the Layers   an exhibition of quilts at the Tennessee State Museum CreditWilliam DeShazer for The New York TimesAt the foot of our bed is a cedar chest that holds my share of the family quilts  The maple leaf quilt was made for my childhood bedroom  but some of the squares were pieced together decades before I was born  The Sunbonnet Sue was my mother s baby blanket  The flower garden pattern with the yellow border was the last quilt my great grandmother pieced by hand  My grandmother made the fan quilt for my husband and me when we got married  Shot through that quilt are memories   patchwork remnants of the dresses my mother made for me as I was growing up  bits left over from the simple blouses and skirts I made for myself in middle school Most of the older quilts were pieced by my great grandmother and quilted by the women of her Lower Alabama farming community  including my mother and grandmother  but others were given to my great grandfather in payment for his services as a country doctor  If they couldn t afford his fee  they gave him what they could spare  a basket of eggs  a bag of pecans  a family quilt  In that way another family s history   salvaged parts of worn out clothes and bedsheets   have become a part of my own family s history  and of your history  too  if you re reading these words  And that s exactly as the thinking behind the new history museums would have it The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to

the High Court  They pleaded not guilty  Their lawyers said they were pawns in a political assassination orchestrated by four North Korean suspects who fled Malaysia on the day of Kim s killing  The four men were accused in the charge sheet of conspiring with the women to kill Kim Aug  18  2018  A High Court judge ordered the two women to enter their defense after ruling there was enough evidence

Soon after I first met Agnès Varda  I drove her to the Hollywood police station  It was 2009 and we were supposed to be at a dinner for the Los Angeles opening of her documentary  The Beaches of Agnès   a lyrical ramble through her life  At that point  Varda had been making movies for more than a half century  a milestone that then seemed to me as impossible as her death last month at 90 seems to me now Varda showed up late for the dinner  hurrying into the restaurant in a state of agitation  While at a Starbucks  her bag had been stolen   wallet  passport  tout  Her greatest concern was the digital video camera that had the images she d shot earlier that day of her friend Sharon Stone  Dazed that Stone and Varda occupied the same corner of the universe  I got it together and took her to the police station  where she filled out a report and murmured doubts about the young desk officer We returned to the restaurant for our dinner  the first of many encounters that we had over the next decade  sometimes for a leisurely meal or at a festival where invariably she was being honored  The last time I saw her was in May at her house on the Left Bank in Paris  an area that became part of her identity  Varda was routinely called the mother or grandmother or godmother of the French New Wave  and often grouped with its Left Bank flank  alongside her friends Chris Marker and Alain Resnais  She wasn t always comfortable with the maternal moniker though she later embraced it   and why not  She had shown the way ImageVarda on the set of the 1977 film  One Sings  the Other Doesn t  CreditRoger Viollet Getty Images A O  Scott on how Varda rewrote film history  A longtime feminist  she was acutely sensitive to oppression and many of her movies center on women  In a 1975 interview with a French magazine  she said she didn t have any more problems than her male cohort  making movies is difficult for everyone  At the same time  she was aware of her standing as the lone female director in the New Wave and how her presence could be used   as she put it   as an  alibi assuaging the consciences of the men   But there were also rules   As long as I was  little Varda    little Agnès   the exception   and she didn t get in anyone s way  she said  she was  helped out  supported and appreciated by my colleagues and companions  Varda was in her mid 20s when she shot  La Pointe Courte  in 1954 and a photographer for the Theatre National Populaire in Paris  It was some years before she made her second feature   Cléo From 5 to 7   1962   In between those two movies  she made short films  had her first child  a daughter   met her husband  the director Jacques Demy  a son followed much later   and traveled to China   Cléo  was a great success  and she continued to make excitingly adventurous  insistently political work  Among the most unsettling is  Le Bonheur   1965   a shocking  pitiless evisceration of the romantic vision of heterosexual marriage in which women are fundamentally disposable and replaceable  Le Bonheur  was criticized  including by those who wanted Varda to wag her finger at patriarchy and female oppression  doing the audience s work for it  But hers is not a cinema of the obvious  One sustaining pleasure of her films is that they don t neatly fit into boxes  including feminist ones  even while being unmistakably feminist  She wasn t creating ideals or role models  but specific women in specific places  villages  streets  beaches  who are navigating a world in which the very definitions of women  of the feminine and of femininity are in upheaval  She was after the contradictions  a word that appears in many of her interviews  between clichés and  the images of lived life  This wasn t necessarily what the industry was interested in  and sometimes Varda directed short movies  to keep alive in my own research  as she once put it  The latter life acclaim and honors were overdue and welcome   she clearly enjoyed being feted   but she didn t always have institutional and critical support  In the early 1980s  she spoke about being omitted from history books and from special issues of Cahiers du Cinéma dedicated to French cinema   I was just plain forgotten   she said  She kept going even if  as she admitted in 1986  with each film she had  to fight like a tiger  ImageThe filmmaker in  The Beaches of Agnès  CreditCinema GuildThat year  one of her most critically and commercially successful films   Vagabond   about a dangerously unsettled woman  was released in the United States  I distinctly remember being freaked out by  Vagabond   which opens on the corpse of Mona  a blazing Sandrine Bonnaire   a drifter who freezes to death in a country ditch  Raw  opaque yet also deeply moving  the film tracks her as she wanders from place to place  person to person  alone and finally unknowable  She s a startlingly uncommon cinematic creation  partly because she is a woman who says no  including to other people Varda said she didn t know why Mona repeatedly said no  a refusal that ends in death  I see  Vagabond   in part  as a tough  unsentimental exploration about the limits of radical independence for women  which is perhaps what gives it the autobiographical aspect that runs through her movies  Varda s life and work are filled with contrasts between interiority and exteriority  individuals and their worlds  which makes her house on Rue Daguerre  with its pink facade and striped doors  feel like another auteurist creation For the past few years  my friend Joan Dupont and I would have an annual lunch with Varda at her home  eating and talking while periodically visited by one of her cats  She was predictably funny and warm and brilliant  but also sharp and strong and willful  During our lunch last year  Varda said she was tired  But she was as voluble as ever and filled with plans  She reminisced about her mother  who loved art  and her father  who didn t  and spoke about growing old   Never complain  never explain   she said  She asked me about Ava DuVernay  The next week  Varda was off to the Cannes Film Festival  where she presented a restoration of her 1977 film  One Sings  the Other Doesn t  At Cannes  she joined DuVernay and Cate Blanchett on the festival s red carpet  this time to protest gender inequality at the festival  It was gratifying and deeply moving to see her among all these other women  though I wondered how many understood what Varda   through her example  her will and her art   had done to pave the way for them  In very concrete ways  in film after film  she helped show women that there was a place for them in movies beyond that of the inevitably beautiful  inevitably young star At the end of  The Beaches of Agnès   Varda asks   What is cinema   repeating André Bazin s essential question  She is standing in one of the witty structures   a house of cinema   that she had fabricated for her multimedia installations  Cinema is light  images  dark  color  she says  over shots of the edifice with its metal frame and walls of film strips  Soon  she is inside   In here  it feels like I live in cinema  cinema is my home   she says   I think I ve always lived in it   In the last shot  Varda is looking directly at the camera   at us   framed in an open door that feels like an invitation  

David Fechheimer  a budding flower child of the 1960s and aspiring English professor who was spurred overnight by the fictional gumshoe Sam Spade to switch careers and become one of the nation s leading private investigators  died on Tuesday in Redwood City  Calif  He was 76 His son Zachary  also a private investigator  said the cause was complications of open heart surgery By dint of personality and practice  Mr  Fechheimer was inconspicuous compared with many of his colleagues and most of his clients  He handled cases involving the Black Panthers  Kobe Bryant  Angela Davis  Robert Durst  John Gotti  Daniel Ellsberg  Patty Hearst  Timothy McVeigh  Roman Polanski and Martha Stewart  among others In 2000  he won  50 million for four children sired by Larry Hillblom  a founder of DHL  the shipping company  in a disputed estate case  He established paternity through DNA after sitting behind Mr  Hillblom s reclusive mother at church  placing  10 in the collection plate and  feigning Parkinson s disease  asking her to lick the envelope for him In 2002  Mr  Fechheimer  pronounced FETCH high mer   whose nickname was Fetch  went from cave to cave on the Afghanistan Pakistan border in search of witnesses to support John Walker Lindh s claim that he had provided only minor support to terrorists   By the time Mr  Fechheimer returned  the case had been settled  Mr  Lindh  an American citizen  was sentenced to 20 years in jail for providing his services as a soldier to the Taliban  He also investigated several cases without fee for the Innocence Project  leading to the exoneration of inmates facing the death penalty in Alabama and Mississippi His clients notwithstanding  Mr  Fechheimer was not an ideologue  Peter Neufeld  a founder of the Innocence Project  said in a telephone interview   He was political in that he cared so much about people and had progressive values about race and war and the human condition   Mr  Neufeld said

guiltless  victims or victors  Mr  Fechheimer said his goal was to ferret out the facts  It did not matter how secret or convoluted those facts were  Once asked whether a defendant was motivated by money   the journalist Seth Rosenfeld recalled in an email  Mr  Fechheimer replied   No  the reasons were more Shakespearean  He redefined the stereotype of a plainclothesman for hire  long painted as a cocksure New York ex cop sitting at a desk and calling a few former colleagues for the latest scuttlebutt Unlike some of his contemporaries and literary counterparts  he didn t own a trench coat  smoke  he gave up Raleighs for nicotine gum  or even pack a gun   I don t look mean enough   he once said   Besides  personally I m a pacifist  Replete with a beard  shaggy gray hair and rimless granny glasses  he looked more like Jerry Garcia than Humphrey Bogart  who played Sam Spade in John Huston s famous film version of Dashiell Hammett s  The Maltese Falcon   The mythical detective is a bad detective   Mr  Fechheimer told Esquire magazine in 1984   Any time you find yourself diving through a plate glass window  you know you ve made a serious error  He was more likely to listen earnestly to witnesses and suspects than to lunge at them  He could get anyone to talk because he intimidated no one   Mr  Neufeld recalled   He would say   If you really want to get someone to talk  talk to them about what matters to them most    David Fechheimer was born David Burgess Bissinger on April 30  1942  in Cincinnati to Karl Bissinger  who became a fashion and portrait photographer in New York and later a peace advocate  and Juliet  Esselborn  Bissinger  After his parents divorced  his mother married Paul R  Fechheimer  an engineer who ran a factory that made packing machinery  in

CreditMason TrincaAs a young man  Mr  Fechheimer traveled across Africa and lived in Europe  After returning to the United States  he hitchhiked to California  where he received a bachelor s degree in English from San Francisco State College  now University  in 1964 He began a master s thesis on Dashiell Hammett  but left school before he finished Hammett was jailed in the early 1950s for refusing to testify in federal court about the Civil Rights Congress  which investigators identified as a Communist front organization  Mr  Fechheimer later wrote that Hammett  squandered his talents and broke his own spirit long before the government intervened with its malicious prosecution  Living hand to mouth as a student  needing a job and with time on his hands because of a student strike  Mr  Fechheimer picked up  The Maltese Falcon  and became enthralled  he told The Dallas Morning News in 1994 The next morning  he applied to the Pinkerton detective agency  where Hammett had worked before embarking on his writing career  He was hired and began working there for  2 an hour  I called Pinkerton and asked if they needed someone who had no experience and a beard   Mr  Fechheimer said   To my surprise  they said they needed someone with a beard that day  I thought I would do it a couple of weeks as a goof  It looked like fun  being Sam Spade  Pinkerton put me under cover on the docks  and I was hooked  I never went back to school  His first marriage ended in divorce  In addition to his son Zachary  he is survived by his wife  Dianne Roxas  another son  Samuel  a professional chef  two granddaughters  and a sister  Ann Neff Mr  Fechheimer followed in Hammett s footsteps in other ways  Like Hammett  he began to learn the city around him right down to its bones   Nathan Ward wrote in  Lost Detective  Becoming Dashiell Hammett   2015    although  he added  Mr  Fechheimer s appearance today  might suggest a professor of American studies  perhaps  or constitutional law  He later

their lives in 2019He soon developed a reputation as a different breed of investigator  He would make suggestions of volumes of poetry I should read to better understand the human condition of clients I represented   Mr  Neufeld of the Innocence Project said Lowell Bergman  a journalism professor and an investigative reporter who has worked for The New York Times  characterized Mr  Fechheimer as a Zelig like figure distinguished by his humility  His biggest investigative technique was knocking on doors   Mr  Bergman said   because he didn t believe anything unless he could see it  Unlike Sam Spade  Mr  Fechheimer was licensed not only as a private eye but also as a wine wholesaler  He owned a tiny vineyard where he named his cabernet sauvignon Red Harvest  after an early Hammett novel He differentiated himself from his fictional predecessor in other ways   Sam Spade may be the best detective in literature  but he s still a lousy detective   he told Esquire   He never gets paid  He sleeps with his clients  and he winds up poor  Instead of working from a cheap office  Mr  Fechheimer operated from his four bedroom home in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco  where an oil painting over the couch depicted the scene from  The Maltese Falcon  in which Spade tells his client Brigid O Shaughnessy  portrayed by Mary Astor    I won t play the sap for you  The next scene   the final one in the screenplay and the novel  although it is not in the movie   takes place in Spade s office the next morning  His secretary  Effie  played onscreen by Lee Patrick   is agape at a newspaper headline that says Spade turned O Shaughnessy over to the police for the murder of his partner  You did that  Sam  to her   the secretary says incredulously  Your Sam s a detective   Spade

MUMBAI NEW DELHI   Two weeks after a suicide bombing in Kashmir in February killed 40 Indian policemen  a Facebook user called Avi Dandiya posted a live video in which he played a recording of a call purportedly involving India s home minister  the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  and an unidentified woman The trio could be heard talking about arousing nationalist sentiment ahead of India s general election  with the BJP president allegedly saying in Hindi   We agree that for election  we need a war  Within 24 hours  one of Facebook Inc s fact checking partners in India  BOOM  exposed Dandiya s video as fake  An analysis on BOOM s website said the video was created by splicing audio from older political interviews By the time Facebook took down the post  it had received more than 2 5 million views and 150 000 shares  There is no Indian law that specifically targets fake news  but police in New Delhi registered a case of forgery against Dandiya and an official said investigations were ongoing Still  Reuters last week found at least four edited copies of Dandiya s videos on Facebook with about 36 000 views  One on Google s YouTube has been seen 2 800 times while another on Twitter has 22 000 views Messages and e mails to Dandiya  an avid Facebook user who last appeared in a live video on March 23  went unanswered  The home ministry  the BJP president and party s information technology chief did not respond to requests for comment The videos underline how social media companies are struggling with fake news in India despite saying they ve taken steps to tackle the menace ahead of India s general election  which starts on April 11 With 900 million people eligible to vote and an estimated half a billion with access to the internet  fake news can have an enormous impact on the election  Dandiya s video  for example  could have seriously damaged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP if enough people thought it was true Policing content has become a massive global problem for social media giants which have no template for consistently preventing online fake news or eliminating it  Fierce internet disinformation battles gripped countries such as Brazil and Malaysia last year ahead of elections  Authorities in Indonesia and the EU  which are due to hold polls  have warned of the threat of fake news In India  Facebook has partnered with fact checkers and  like Twitter  ramped up efforts to block fake accounts  On Monday  Facebook said it had deleted 1 126 accounts  groups and pages in India and Pakistan for  inauthentic behaviour  and spamming  many linked to India s opposition Congress party  Google has partnered with fact checkers to train 10 000 journalists this year to better tackle fake news Facebook s popular messaging app WhatsApp has launched newspaper and radio campaigns to deter the spread of misinformation Social media companies say they don t outrightly remove all fake posts as that would jeopardise free speech  Facebook has said that circulation of posts which are debunked  or discovered to be fake  is reduced by more than 80 percent NO SILVER BULLETPosts that violate Facebook s community guidelines  including hate speech or content that could incite violence  are completely deleted  the company said  adding that Dandiya s video came under that category But even when content has been identified as fake and removed  slightly modified versions of the same images  video or text can escape detection and spread further  This is a highly adversarial space  so we still miss things and won t catch everything   but we re making progress   said a Facebook spokeswoman  who added that the overall volume of false news had been reduced on the platform   There s no silver bullet solution in fighting misinformation  Twitter said it deeply cares about the potentially harmful effects of misinformation and encourages users not to share unverified information  A YouTube spokesman said the company will continue to embrace the  democratization of access to information  while providing a reliable service to users Twitter and YouTube did not comment on Dandiya s video  SHOWN TO BE FALSE Another fake post that went viral recently was on popular Indian student leader Kanhaiya Kumar  who was arrested and charged with sedition after a 2016 rally to commemorate the execution of a Kashmiri separatist  Opposition parties said Kumar s arrest by federal police was an attempt by authorities to curb free speech Some Facebook posts in February described Kumar as anti India and showed his photo in front of a map that depicted some Indian states as part of Pakistan  Two Facebook fact checkers in India investigated the posts and said the image was doctored  Still  a month later  Reuters found at least two copies of those posts on Facebook with 375 comments and 1 500 shares Facebook in February announced an expansion of its fact checking company partners to seven  from two  Facebook says it also issues an alert to users who try to share a post which its fact checkers have debunked  but doesn t prohibit further sharing Reuters found that when debunked posts of Kumar were shared  an alert popped up with a link to the fact checkers  analysis  However  all four variants of Dandiya s videos could be shared without such fake news alerts from Facebook  There is no way you can solve this problem  quickly      the magnitude of the problem is really huge   said Kanchan Kaur  a Bengaluru based assessor at International Fact Checking Network at U S  based Poynter Institute FACT CHECKING BUSINESSWhen tensions rose between India and Pakistan in February following a suicide bombing in Kashmir and cross border air strikes  social media was flooded with fake news   old videos of captured pilots and photos of earthquake hit regions were spread as depicting current events  Since Pulwama we ve been working seven days a week   said Jency Jacob  managing editor at BOOM  referring to the site of the suicide attack  On a recent visit to BOOM s office in India s financial capital Mumbai  five people were seen monitoring and analysing online content  One of the rooms served as BOOM s studio where television style news videos are shot on debunked stories and published on its website As an industry  fact checking is fast spreading in India  British broadcaster BBC has in house fact checking operations and a dedicated WhatsApp number where anyone can flag suspected fake posts for further checks  A dedicated team of journalists is debunking fake news daily  and also writing detailed explainers on controversial issues and claims   BBC s India Digital Editor  Milind Khandekar  told Reuters Former software engineer Pratik Sinha and his mother are part of a 10 member fact checking initiative named  Alt News  which is run from a two bedroom flat in the western city of Ahmedabad Using online video verification and social media tracking tools  Sinha said his team debunks up to four posts each day Debunked posts appearing online has become a problem even for India s Election Commission In February  a WhatsApp message called for spreading the word that said Indians living overseas could  now vote online for 2019 elections  and should register on the Commission s website  The Commission called it  FAKE NEWS  on Twitter and filed a police complaint against  unknown persons  for public mischief A month later  the message continues to circulate on Facebook   a user who shared it on March 23 has so far received 42 likes and 19 shares  When someone questioned the post  the Facebook user responded   I think you can vote  Just check the web site and follow the steps    Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal and Aditya Kalra  Additional reporting by

LONDON   In the political realm  no one knows how Brexit s long running theater of the absurd will end  But for much of the business world  Britain s departure from the European Union has effectively happened Nearly three years of uncertainty since the June 2016 referendum has forced companies to plan for the worst   the prospect that Britain could crash out of the bloc without a deal governing future relations  The twisting road to Brexit has already slowed economic growth  discouraged investment and damaged the reputation of the nation as a haven for commerce Global banks and other financial services companies are steadily shifting thousands of jobs and more than  1 trillion in assets to European cities to ensure that they are able to serve customers across the English Channel regardless of the rules that national regulators impose after Brexit Japanese automakers have scrapped plans to expand in Britain  in part because Brexit undermines the country s virtues as a hub for European trade Whatever comes next   a deal with Europe  an unruly exit or another vote that could cancel the proceedings  making Brexit the mother of all mulligans   the jobs and the money are unlikely to return  The deadlock only deepened on Monday  as Britain s Parliament failed to reach consensus on the latest Brexit proposals  Multinational companies came here with a clear understanding that Britain would offer a stable place to do business in exchange for access to the European Union   said Peter Dixon  a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London   The Brits have reneged on that contract  It s destroyed  if you like  the sense that Britain is such a great place to do business  It s a credibility hit  It s a deep wound  Since the 1980s  Japanese automakers have invested in factories in Britain to exploit the country s duty free access to Europe  Before the 2016 vote  Nissan warned that leaving the European Union could force the company to reassess its plans for its plant in Sunderland  in the north of England Months after the vote  Prime Minister Theresa May offered Nissan a mysterious cocktail of promises that won  Nissan s confidence  But in February  the company said it would not build a new sport utility vehicle in Sunderland  At about the same time  Honda said it was closing a factory in southwest England  in the town of Swindon  eliminating 3 500 jobs Honda s decision was motivated partly by a trade agreement that Japan struck last year with the European Union  The deal eliminates the need for a factory in Britain  because Honda can now ship cars made in Japan directly into Europe without incurring duties ImageThe New Covent Garden Market in London  If Britain leaves the European market  it will lose not only free access to Europe but also the benefits of the bloc s trade deals with other countries CreditAndrew Urwin for The New York TimesIf Britain leaves the European market  it will lose the benefits of the bloc s trade deals  In short  just as Japan and Europe are liberalizing trade with each other  Britain is moving to impede trade with both  The big worry is investment   said Mike Hawes  chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  an industry trade group   Investors are just waiting to see  is it worth continuing to commit to the U K  automotive industry  The British economy is now 1 to 2 5 percent smaller than it would have been without the Brexit vote  economists estimate  Much of the damage has come via the drop in the British pound  which has shed more than 10 percent of its value against the dollar since the referendum The fall in the pound amounts to the market s expression that trade has been obstructed  Britain sells nearly half of its exports within the European Union Given that Britain imports more than it exports  the falling currency has pushed up prices on a broad range of goods  from fruits and vegetables to machinery  Inflation was the primary factor in median household income s remaining flat last year  according to an analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies  an independent research firm in London Across Britain  business investment is expected to decline by 1 percent this year  in what would be the weakest performance since the global financial crisis a decade ago  according to a recent forecast from the British Chambers of Commerce The impact will probably fall heavily on areas that need investment the most  manufacturing dependent communities in the north of England and Wales  where jobs and living standards have declined  Such areas mostly voted to leave Europe  as people blamed globalization and immigration for diminishing opportunities  Now  they stand to suffer even leaner times  There needs to be a cadre of new businesses being developed in the north of England that operate in high value added sectors like technology   said Robert Huggins  a professor of economic geography at Cardiff University in Wales   But with Brexit and the potential difficulties  these businesses are going to be stifled  They are not going to be able to develop their potential  It s unbelievable  If Brexit has produced anything  it is familiarity with events once deemed unbelievable The European Medicines Agency  the bloc s regulator for pharmaceuticals  recently abandoned its London headquarters for new offices in Amsterdam  a move prompted entirely by Brexit  Investment in the industry is almost sure to follow For more than three decades  London has attracted global banks  trading operations  hedge funds  asset managers and sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Asia  The city grew into a global center of finance second to none  while the industry has employed more than a million people in Britain ImageIn February  Nissan said it was scrapping plans to build a new sport utility vehicle at its enormous plant in Sunderland  England  The company cited  in part  the uncertainty over Brexit CreditFrank Augstein Associated PressBrexit has put that status in jeopardy by forcing companies that serve European clients from London to move jobs and trading activity to cities like Amsterdam  Dublin and Frankfurt More than 275 companies are in the process of moving or have already shifted business divisions  employees and legal entities from Britain to the Continent  according to a recent report from New Financial  an independent research institution in London Banks alone are transferring 800 billion pounds  more than  1 trillion   while asset management and insurance companies are collectively moving  100 billion  about  130 billion   Some 5 000 jobs have left because of Brexit  and the trend is expected to expand as trading volumes shift and local regulators demand people on the ground who can be held accountable when trouble inevitably emerges Britain s departure from the European market would end the so called passporting rights that have allowed financial services companies to conduct transactions across the bloc as if it were one sprawling country  Financiers recognized early that they could not merely wait and hope that the politicians would find a way to protect their industry By the end of 2017  the industry was warning the British government that  unless a deal was completed soon  many companies would proceed with plans to move parts of their operations to the Continent  By the middle of last year  with no deal in sight  those plans became reality Given the money and complexities involved in these moves  few expect jobs to return  regardless of how Brexit ends  Bank of America has spent nearly  400 million to prepare for Brexit  most of it on creating a hub in Dublin London will remain a dominant center of finance  But as banking and trading shift marginally toward the Continent  so will legal and accounting services The mere act of preparing for Brexit has forced companies to reassess the merits of concentrating so much business in Britain  Banks that have moved accountants to the English city of Birmingham to escape exorbitantly priced London offices may be tempted by greater savings through hiring professionals in Poland  Once you start looking at your business model in Europe  you can never unsee what you ve seen   said William Wright  founder and managing director of New Financial   Does it really make sense to have 95 percent of your European staff in the center of some of the most expensive real estate on earth  Even if the politicians strike a deal for a smooth divorce  or shock the world by calling the whole thing off  the harm done to Britain s aura as a haven for sensible governance is likely to endure  The whole Brexit process  from the referendum itself to the way in which the government has responded since  has very significantly damaged the reputation of the U K  as a pragmatic and sensible place to do business   Mr  Wright said   That s gone  It could take a very long time to come back   

It takes Carlos Rojas two and a half to three hours to drive from his home in Stockton  Calif   to a job spreading plaster on houses going up in Campbell  on the southern rim of Silicon Valley  The trip is worth it  though  The 30 year old immigrant from the Mexican state of Oaxaca says he makes roughly  25 an hour  depending on the job  That s more than twice as much as Stockton s farmworkers typically make in the fields  And his boss pays for gas   A lot of people returned to Mexico after the housing bust  and then came the deportations   he said   People got scarce  Now that the work came back they are short of people  Nationwide  the average wage of nonsupervisory workers in residential construction hit  25 34 an hour in January  That s over 6 percent more than a year earlier  close to the steepest annual increase since the government started keeping track almost 30 years ago  Pay is taking off even among those in less skilled construction trades  The gains are part of a broader trend  The tightest labor market in more than half a century is finally lifting the wages of the least skilled workers on the bottom rung of the labor force  bucking years of stagnation But to hear builders tell it  the rising cost of their crews reflects a demographic reality that could hamstring industries besides their own  Their labor force is shrinking  President Trump s threat to close the Mexican border  a move that would cause damage to both economies  only adds to the pressure  Immigration   often illegal   has long acted as a supply line for low skilled workers  Even before Mr  Trump ratcheted up border enforcement  economic growth in Mexico and the aging of the country s population were reducing the flow of Mexican workers into the United States  The number of undocumented immigrants in America declined to 10 7 million at the end of 2017 from a peak of over 12 million at the height of the housing bubble in 2008  according to the Center for Migration Studies   Sign up for Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  The problem for builders is that the recovery in home building has outpaced the growth of the construction labor force  Housing starts have picked up to a pace of 1 2 million a month  more than twice as many as at their trough in April 2009  The number of nonsupervisory workers in residential construction  by contrast  has increased by only 40 percent since hitting bottom in 2011  to about 530 000  ImageA crew in Dallas connecting a new home to the water supply  In some less skilled work  about half the jobs are held by immigrants CreditCooper Neill for The New York Times The recent shortage of immigrant workers is impacting housing and housing affordability   said Jerry Howard  chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders  Phil Crone  who runs the association s Dallas chapter  said the labor bottleneck was adding about  6 000 to the cost of every home built in the area and delaying completion by two months Were it not for immigrants  the labor crunch would be even more intense  In 2016  immigrants accounted for one in four construction workers  according to a study by Natalia Siniavskaia of the home builders  association  up from about one in five in 2004  In some of the least skilled jobs   like plastering  roofing and hanging drywall  for which workers rarely have more than a high school education   the share of immigrants hovers around half  The need for labor has set off a scramble for bodies that is spilling across industries and driving up wages   A lot of our landscape companies are upset because their guys are coming into construction because they can earn more   said Alan Hoffmann  who builds energy efficient homes in Dallas For all the fears of robots taking over jobs  some economists are worrying about the broader economic fallout from a lack of low skilled workers  And businesses across the economy are complaining that without immigration they will be left without a work force  It is good for wages to go up  but if labor is at a point where employers can t hire  it is reducing growth   said Pia Orrenius  an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas   There s also considerable wage pressure in small towns and cities that are depopulating  but that is a sign of distress  not of rising productivity  The labor crunch is likely to persist for some time  The Pew Research Center projects very little growth in the working age population over the next two decades  If the United States were to cut off the flow of new immigrants  Pew noted  its working population would shrink to 166 million in 2035 from 173 million in 2015 Immigration has been padding the labor force for years  Over the last two decades  immigrants and their children accounted for more than half the growth of the population of 25  to 64 year olds  according to Pew s analysis  Over the next 20 years  they will have to plug the hole left by the retirement of the baby boom generation Children of Immigrants Will Expand the Labor Force       g working age immigration box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g

of those arriving will be 25 to 64 years old  as is now the case Source  Pew Research CenterBy The New York TimesBut the share of immigrants over 25 with less than a bachelor s degree   the most likely to seek a job hanging drywall or spreading plaster   has steadily shrunk  to 70 percent in 2016 from 76 percent in 2000  according to the Pew Research Center Although the Trump administration has tried to shift immigration policy to limit the entry of less educated immigrants and draw more workers with advanced degrees  businesses are still hungry for immigrants with lesser skills Immigrants make up almost a third of workers in the hotel and lodging industry and over a fifth of workers in the food service industry  according to the Brookings Institution  There are over a million immigrant workers in the direct care industry   home health aides and personal care aides tending to the sick and the frail  That amounts to about one fourth of the total  said Robert Espinoza of PHI  a nonprofit group that does research and advocacy for direct care workers Few of these workers studied past high school  Many didn t get their diploma  Barring immigration  such workers would be hard to find  There are fewer working age Americans who studied no further than high school than there were 20 years ago  according to an analysis of census data by Ms  Orrenius and Madeline Zavodny of the University of North Florida Businesses scrambling for low skilled workers provide a glimpse into the kind of strains a future of low immigration might bring  Consider agriculture  where seven in 10 workers were born in Mexico  and only one in four was born in the United States  Last year  the United States issued nearly 200 000 H 2A visas for agricultural workers  three times as many as in 2012  as farmers tried to make up for the decline in the undocumented work force  Growers complain about the bureaucracy and costs associated with the visa program and worry that a government hostile toward immigrant work might decide to curtail it Some growers are resorting to other tactics  too   We re seeing a large transition of growing from California down to Mexico   said Larry Cox  who farms in California s Imperial Valley as well as in Sinaloa and Guanajuato in Mexico Builders would love to have some of those options  For now  the H 2B visa seems to be their only one  Though it wasn t really designed for them  but rather to fill seasonal jobs outside of agriculture  builders are now scrambling to file H 2B applications  and they are lobbying Congress and the administration to get the Department of Homeland Security to double the allocation  The cap for the 2019 fiscal year was exhausted in February ImageAlan Hoffmann  a Dallas builder  said employers in other industries were losing workers to construction  where wages were higher CreditCooper Neill for The New York TimesBut builders know the H 2B visa won t solve their problems  Many of the high school students who would replenish the pipeline of carpenters  plumbers and electricians are undocumented immigrants   Half of the kids in the high school carpentry programs are DACA kids   said Mr  Hoffmann  the Dallas builder  referring to a program that allows unauthorized minors to stay in the United States   They are not documented  so we can t work with them  Could the United States cope without low skilled workers from abroad  The Conference Board projects that the working age population with a high school certificate or less will continue to decline  But the economy will continue to create low skill jobs  Nearly 600 000 in food preparation and service alone will be added between 2016 and 2026  And nearly 800 000 in direct care For all the ingenuity in Silicon Valley  there is little evidence so far that those jobs can be fully automated  Even Mr  Trump  who has insistently demanded funding for a wall along the southwestern border to keep undocumented immigrants out  appears to have softened his stance on immigrant labor  pointing out that  we need more workers   

One prisoner had been dead for so long that when he was discovered lying face down  his face was flattened  Another was tied up and tortured for two days while no one noticed  Bloody inmates screamed for help from cells whose doors did not lock Those were some of the gruesome details in a 56 page report on the Alabama prison system that was issued by the Justice Department on Wednesday  The report  one of the first major civil rights investigations by the department to be released under President Trump  uncovered shocking conditions in the state s massively overcrowded and understaffed facilities Prisoners in the Alabama system endured some of the highest rates of homicide and rape in the country  the Justice Department found  and officials showed a  flagrant disregard  for their right to be free from excessive and cruel punishment  The investigation began in the waning days of the Obama administration and continued for more than two years after Mr  Trump took office  The department notified the prison system that it could sue in 49 days  if State officials have not satisfactorily addressed our concerns   The New York Times received more than 2 000 photos taken inside an Alabama prison  This is what they showed  Alabama is not alone in having troubled  violent prisons  But the state has one of the country s highest incarceration rates and its correctional system is notoriously antiquated  dangerous and short staffed  The major prisons are at 182 percent of their capacity  the report found  contraband is rampant and prisoners sleep in dorms they are not assigned to in order to escape violence  The violations are severe  systemic  and exacerbated by serious deficiencies in staffing and supervision   the report said  noting that some facilities had fewer than 20 percent of their allotted positions filled  It also cited the use of solitary confinement as a protective measure for vulnerable inmates  and  a high level of violence that is too common  cruel  of an unusual nature  and pervasive  State officials said the report addressed issues that Alabama was already aware of and working to fix  For more than two years  the D O J  pursued an investigation of issues that have been the subject of ongoing litigation and the target of significant reforms by the state   a statement from the office of Gov  Kay Ivey said   Over the coming months  my Administration will be working closely with D O J  to ensure that our mutual concerns are addressed and that we remain steadfast in our commitment to public safety  making certain that this Alabama problem has an Alabama solution  But the report called the state  deliberately indifferent  to the risks prisoners face  and said   It has failed to correct known systemic deficiencies that contribute to the violence   Legislative efforts to reduce overcrowding through measures such as reducing sentences were not made retroactive and have had  minimal effect   the report said Alabama s prisons have for years been the subject of civil rights litigation by the Equal Justice Initiative and the Southern Poverty Law Center  nonprofit legal advocacy groups based in Montgomery  Maria Morris  the lead lawyer for the center s lawsuit  also disputed the assertion that the problems were being fixed  They re not fixing them   Ms  Morris said   They re giving a lot of lip service to the need to fix them  but the lip service always comes back to we just need a billion dollars to build new prisons and  as the Department of Justice found  that s not going to solve the problem  Alabama inmates continue to die in high numbers  There have been 15 suicides in the past 15 months  and the homicide rate vastly exceeds the national average for prisons The Justice Department report focused on the failure to prevent prisoner on prisoner violence because of what it said was inadequate training  failure to properly classify and supervise inmates  and failure to stem the flow of contraband including weapons and drugs  among other problems The department is still investigating excessive force and sexual abuse by prison staff members  an investigation that former federal prosecutors say could lead to criminal indictments  Our reporter went inside St  Clair Correctional Facility in Springville  Ala  He found it was  virtually ungoverned  and the inmates were armed  Investigators visited four prisons and interviewed more than 270 prisoners  To  provide a window into a broken system   the report detailed a single week s worth of injuries and attacks  including days that saw multiple incidents including stabbings  a sleeping man attacked with socks filled with metal locks and another man being forced to perform oral sex on two men at knife point The department also concluded that the system does not provide  safe and sanitary  living conditions  Open sewage ran by the pathway that government lawyers used to access one facility  which the state closed soon after the visit  One investigator grew ill from the toxic fumes of cleaning fluids while inspecting the kitchen  the report said The report said the state failed to track violent deaths or adequately investigate sex abuse  At least three homicide victims   including one who was stabbed and another who was beaten   were classified as having died from natural causes  the report said  The report listed nine killings in which the victims had been previously attacked or officials had received other warnings that they were in danger Sexual assaults occur in  dormitories  cells  recreation areas  the infirmary  bathrooms  and showers at all hours of the day and night   the report said  Prisons must screen inmates and separate sexually abusive prisoners from those at risk of sexual abuse  particularly gay and transgender people  the report said Alabama does not do so Inmates are raped to pay off debts  and one mother told the Justice Department that a prisoner had texted her to say he would  chop her son into pieces and rape him if she did not send him  800   the report said Last month  Governor Ivey warned of  horrendous conditions  in the prisons and an impending federal intervention in her State of the State speech Ms  Ivey said the department had increased the prison budget in recent years  given raises to corrections officers and requested  31 million to hire 500 more correctional officers and increase pay in the coming fiscal year But Mac McArthur  the executive director of the Alabama State Employees Association  which includes state corrections workers  said attrition was still outpacing recruitment  in part because starting salaries were still below  30 000 a year for some officers  and in part because the job was so dangerous The federal investigation was opened during the Obama administration  after the lawsuits over prison abuses and published accounts of endemic brutality  violence and torture  The investigation continued under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions  who had also served as a longtime senator from Alabama The report included a series of measures necessary to remedy the constitutional and other violations that regularly occur in the Alabama prison system  including additional screening for those entering the prisons  moving low risk inmates  hiring 500 additional corrections officers and overhauling disciplinary processes around violence and sexual assault Similar federal civil rights investigations have resulted in consent decrees   court approved deals that include a road map of changes that institutions such as police departments and state correction departments must adhere to in order to avoid being sued But in a break with past practice  Mr  Sessions placed three key restrictions on consent decrees  He said that a top political appointee must sign off on any deal  Department lawyers must show proof of violations that go beyond unconstitutional behavior  And the deals must have a sunset date  meaning they can expire before violations have been remedied  The current attorney general  William P  Barr  has not changed Mr  Sessions s policy Mr  Sessions said that the consent decrees interfered with states  rights  a position echoed by Ms  Ivey in her statement insisting on an  Alabama solution  But Vanita Gupta  a head of the civil rights division in the Obama administration and one of the officials who opened the investigation  said that given the pervasive problems and the history of inaction   nothing short of a comprehensive consent decree will adequately address these constitutional violations  The Justice Department declined to comment on whether it would seek a consent decree Ms  Ivey is hardly the first governor to reckon with the prison system and its decrepit conditions  Her immediate predecessor  Robert Bentley  pushed a plan for  800 million in bonds to build four new prisons and to close some existing facilities But governors have only so much influence in Alabama  and the Legislature balked  especially as a scandal left Mr  Bentley weakened  This year  Ms  Ivey proposed a similar plan for new prisons that state officials hoped would be ready by 2022  

On an unseasonably warm March afternoon in Brooklyn  the artist Paul Anthony Smith  wearing his usual denim workwear  stands in his studio in front of  Untitled  Duppy Dream in Color too    a nearly finished  closely cropped  black and white photo portrait of a woman wearing a bejeweled crown  Her eyes  emotional and direct  are staring through a geometric pattern that recalls a midcentury breeze block fence of the kind found in his native Jamaica  Smith  31  made the barrier by picking for hours at the image with a retrofitted wooden needle tool that he often uses to puncture the surface of his pictures  a technique which evokes both the coming of age ritual of scarification once common in West Africa and the luminous pointillism of Georges Seurat   It sometimes takes a week for me to finish one   Smith says of his images  as he walks toward the sole window in the work space  located on the fourth floor of an unassuming former factory in Bedford Stuyvesant  Smith has rented the smallish boxlike space since he moved to New York in 2014 from Kansas City  Missouri  where he studied ceramics at the Kansas City Art Institute  Pinned to the white walls  and still in progress  are four of his signature  picotages    his word for inkjet pigment prints layered with ornate architectural elements and mounted on museum board   which will go on display on April 4 as part of  Junction

people meet   he says    Junction  is about an amazing celebration of people  culture  histories and hardships   His work  which often depicts joyful everyday scenes from across the African diaspora  abounds with questions of historical memory  the dislocation of colonialism and the tension and ecstasy of making a home in a foreign land  And although the artist is not physically seen in the images  the new layered picotages speak directly to Smith s own biography  as an immigrant who left his hometown  St  Ann s Bay in Jamaica  when he was nine years old and moved with his family to Miami  The Smiths  in search of opportunity in a new country  are reflected in the mostly Caribbean subjects  hustling and hanging out  who populate the artist s collages Tacked to the wall near the studio s entrance is  Slightly Pivoted to the Sun s Rhythm   a work that depicts a beautifully costumed black woman wearing a traditional Carnival outfit  Behind a breeze block enclosure  she is peacocking her heritage in a procession along Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn during the borough s annual West Indian Day Parade  The fencing suggests a sly sense of displacement   Walls are meant to exclude but also protect  and in this case they are used as veils and disguises   Smith says  examining the image   It s like when you come to a new country  do you become a hybrid of your surroundings  Or do you stay who you are within your culture  When I use these images from the West Indian Day Parade  they re more so about the rhythm  the vibe  the culture and retaining those spirits   Sitting at a makeshift wooden drafting table in his studio  Smith answered T s Artist s Questionnaire What is your day like  How much do you sleep and what s your work schedule Recently I became this person that can t leave the studio  I m here all different hours of the day  I just try to sleep while the sun is down  I usually come here at ten and leave anywhere from nine at night to one or two in the morning  I ll be in here  and sometimes I get frustrated  like I need to go and get a shot of whisky real quick and come back  or I try to keep liquor in here How many hours of creative work do you think you do in a day It takes a while to get into a rhythm  because I m doing this repetitive motion and my mind changes so frequently  I wear a watch because I count how much I work on each section  And if I m here from like 10 a m  to 10 p m   I probably get six hours of consecutive work done  Some of these works take a week of working on them straight  because I work on one at a time ImageSmith s work often

sketchbooks in a box over there from second and third grade  But I think the first piece of art that I ever made was when I found a clay deposit in the river in the third grade in Jamaica and I made some ceramic figures  Those stuck with me for a long time  and it kind of continues to propel this creative process in me  I think that s also probably why I studied ceramics What s the first work you ever sold  For how much The first work I sold was from when I was 14 or 15  I made this painting that I accidentally left on the bus in Miami when I was in high school and I never recovered the painting  but I recreated it and it was sort of reminiscent of an Edward Hopper painting  I sold it at the Coconut Grove Art Festival for  100 and I got  50 When you start a new piece  where do you begin  What s the first step I start with a buffet of images that I print and mount  and then I usually naturally gravitate toward one  and look at it for a while before I begin to work  I don t really plan ahead How do you know when you re done It s like eating  Once you finish  you re like  that s it  You don t need to overwork it How many assistants do you have Ten fingers ImageThe artist

 I still love Nas   Illmatic   J  Cole s  Forest Hills Drive  and  Born Sinner  are such great albums  Lately  I find myself listening to  The Pizza Show  on YouTube  or just various things about food Is there a meal you eat on repeat when you re working Fried chicken  Or jerk chicken When did you first feel comfortable saying you were a professional artist After undergrad  where I majored in ceramics  I felt like there was hope  and I knew it s a journey that can only continue to get stronger  and so I felt comfortable in that moment to say  I m a professional artist What s the weirdest object in your studio I think the plaster cast chicken foot wall elements that I made a couple years ago  and then there s a cast cake  I was crazy   I went to Costco  bought a cake  went to the butcher in Bushwick where I was living at the time  bought a chicken foot  pig feet  cow tongue and fish head and chopped them all up  I wanted to make this cake that celebrated the fucked up nature of the British Empire  the structures  And so I made that cake  chopped it up  froze it  then cast it in alginate and epoxy plastic in my living room  And it s strange  Even though I eat those things  I still think it s strange How often do you talk to other artists I speak to a few artists on a regular basis  Yashua Klos  Kambui Olujimi  Cheryl Pope and Roberto Visani ImageSmith s new exhibition

CIUDAD JUÁREZ  Mexico   From her home in Honduras  Maria Magdalena Ferrufino Nuñez learned that Mexico s new president was helping the migrants who were heading north in search of a better life  I heard that he was welcoming the caravans   said Ms  Ferrufino Nuñez  55  who traveled with her son toward Ciudad Juárez  where she is waiting in a shelter for a chance to apply for asylum in the United States The spring months usually see an upswell in migration in the region as Central Americans   fleeing poverty and violence or seeking to reunite with family members in the United States   take advantage of the temperate weather to travel north  But this year  a record number of migrant families is overwhelming officials and facilities on not only on the American side of the Mexico United States border  infuriating Trump administration officials  but also on the Mexican side The backup of migrants in Mexico has been commonly blamed on restrictions the Trump administration  has imposed on the American asylum process  But this crisis appears to be also  in part  of the Mexican president s making According to migrants  local officials and migration scholars  this increase in northward migration has been partly spurred by the policies of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico  who had campaigned as a defender of the poor and the downtrodden  and took office in December  Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border  a limited run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet  Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox  During his tenure  he has sought to strike a contrast with his predecessors by presenting a kinder  gentler face toward migrants  Deportations have plummeted under his watch  and his administration has sought to incorporate more migrants into Mexican society by being more generous with humanitarian visas and work permits ImageBorder Patrol officers checking travel documents on the Paso Del Norte Bridge  which connects El Paso and Ciudad Juárez  Mexico  at the border CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesAt the same time  he has also helped the Trump administration s efforts to impede people seeking asylum in the United States With more migrants moving north  and greater restrictions on entry into the United States  the number of migrants waiting along the Mexican side of the border has swelled  From Tijuana  on the western end of the border  to Matamoros on the eastern end  thousands of migrants have overflowed shelters  drawn down the emergency resources of local governments and civil

city s two longtime shelters quickly overflowed  Churches pushed aside pews to make room for mattresses  and a public school gymnasium was converted to a dormitory  There are now nine shelters   still not enough to house newly arriving migrants  who are pouring in at a rate of more than 100 a day  local and state officials said  Nobody knows where this is going to go  how many people are going to come  how many more people we re going to help   said Rogelio Pinal Castellanos  the director of human rights in Ciudad Juárez And the situation would only get worse should Mr  Trump follow through on his threat to close the border in retaliation for what he says has been an inadequate effort by the Mexican government to stem unauthorized migration The surge of migrants winding up in Ciudad Juárez and other border cities corresponds to a rise in the number of undocumented migrants trying to enter the United States American officials say about 76 000 migrants without authorization were intercepted  or surrendered  along the southwest border in February   a 31 percent increase over January s number  Interdictions of undocumented immigrants  most of them from Central America  were on pace to surpass 100 000 last month  the Trump administration claims  and could reach one million by the end of September  These are levels not seen since the early 2000s ImagePresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico  left  at a news conference in January  He has spoken repeatedly about incorporating more migrants into the Mexican work force CreditMeridith Kohut for The New York TimesThe surge in undocumented migrants has come despite a series of aggressive policies by the Trump administration designed to discourage migration  including the constricting of the asylum process For years  migrants seeking asylum only needed to present themselves at a port of entry into the United States to begin the process  But the Trump administration has begun to use a system known as  metering   which limits the daily number of asylum seekers allowed to present their cases at certain ports of entry The practice has given rise to informal waiting lists managed by the Mexican authorities  or even by the migrants themselves  There are currently more than 3 300 asylum seekers on the list in Ciudad Juárez  The number that can formally cross each day ranges from several dozen to none  and the wait can stretch for months  On Sunday only 10 were allowed to cross  The day before  zero In a trend that began during the Obama administration  an increasing percentage of migrants are traveling in family units with children  Some say they bring their children in part because they know they will have a better chance of being released from American detention more quickly  We heard in Guatemala that if you were traveling with children  it was much easier to cross   said a woman  30  who has been staying with her 5 year old son at a Juárez shelter waiting for her turn to apply for asylum in neighboring El Paso  She gave her surname as Ramirez  but asked that her full name not be published because she did not want to imperil her case  She said she was fleeing a violent gang in Guatemala While President López Obrador has chosen  in some ways  to help the United States carry out its immigration agenda  he has also sent a message to potential migrants that they are now more welcome than ever in Mexico In the first three months of the López Obrador administration  there were 44 percent fewer deportations than during the last three months of President Enrique Peña Nieto s administration ImageCuban asylum seekers waiting in Ciudad Juárez  Mexico  listening to an update on the number of asylum claims being accepted by the United States CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesMr  López Obrador has also talked repeatedly about  incorporating more migrants into the Mexican work force In January  the Mexican immigration agency set up a special task force on the southern border to expedite the issuing of yearlong  renewable humanitarian visas for Central Americans approaching as part of a large migrant caravan But after more than 13 000 migrants applied for the visa in two weeks  the government abruptly ended the program Many migrants who had applied for the visa said they intended to use it to ease their passage to the northern border  and then cross into the United States  either legally or illegally  I heard that they were giving an excellent entry permit  and because of that we came with the idea of making it to the United States   said Donald Tejada  28  a coffee plantation worker from Honduras who applied for the special visa in late January And though the migrant caravans account for only a small  albeit high profile  fraction of the total number of migrants who traverse Mexico  the López Obrador administration has largely allowed them to move unimpeded across Mexican territory At least two large migrant caravans   one numbering about 2 000 people and the other about 800   are currently traveling through southern Mexico toward the United States  according to local news reports  Yet another left San Salvador  the capital of El Salvador  on Saturday  also heading north ImageAsylum seekers walking along the United States border in El Paso  Texas  before turning themselves in to the Border Patrol to make their case on Sunday CreditBrett Gundlock for The New York TimesOn Sunday  the Mexican migration agency said it would resume issuing humanitarian visas on Monday to migrants  in a limited manner  in the southern state of Chiapas  giving priority to women  children and people older than 65  The agency also said it would start issuing the visas through Mexican Consulates in Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras beginning in May But the López Obrador administration has been under considerable pressure from President Trump to help curb illegal migration into the United States  And following a meeting last week with Trump administration officials  Mexico s interior minister  Olga Sánchez Cordero  said security forces would be deployed to form a containment cordon across southern Mexico to help control migration The López Obrador administration is also under pressure from the northern border cities and states that have been shouldering the burden of care for the thousands of migrants Officials in the state of Chihuahua  which includes Ciudad Juárez  said they have repeatedly lobbied their federal counterparts for money to help support the migrants waiting to cross into the United States  arguing that their presence is partly a result of inconsistent national migration policy But they have received little assistance  We don t have the capacity to receive so many people for so much time   said Enrique Valenzuela  the coordinator of the Chihuahua government s population council  which oversees migrant issues for the state   Facing a situation that we didn t cause  the costs have been high and are increasing  Part of Mr  Valenzuela s work is to urge patience among the migrants waiting to apply for asylum  But  he cautions  the longer they have to wait  the more likely they will be to try to cross illegally And the more that people cross illegally  the more that the Trump administration will reassign personnel from the legal border crossings  causing slowdowns at ports of entry  further limiting the procession of asylum seekers and fueling a vicious cycle Andrew Selee  the president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington  said that both the Trump and López Obrador administrations are learning the limits of their own political rhetoric  The great irony here is that you have one administration north of the border that rhetorically thinks only in terms of enforcement and one south of the border that rhetorically thinks in terms of getting rid of enforcement   he said   And neither one is possible   

A harsh new criminal law in Brunei   which includes death by stoning for sex between men or for adultery  and amputation of limbs for theft   went into effect on Wednesday  despite an international outcry from other countries  rights groups  celebrities and students Brunei  a tiny monarchy on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia  based its new penal code on Shariah  Islamic law based on the Quran and other writings  though interpretations of Shariah can vary widely  Brunei s new penal code is barbaric to the core  imposing archaic punishments for acts that shouldn t even be crimes   Phil Robertson  the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch  a nongovernmental organization  said in a statement on Wednesday He called on the nation s ruler  Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah  to  immediately suspend amputations  stoning  and all other rights abusing provisions and punishments  Brunei has a population of just 430 000 but tremendous oil wealth  which has made the sultan  ruler since 1967  one of the wealthiest people on earth  said to own the world s largest home and the biggest collection of rare cars The sultan  72  is also the prime minister and holds several other titles  He first introduced the draconian version of Shariah in 2013  as part of a long term project to impose a restrictive form of Islam on his country  which is majority Muslim ImageA mosque in Bandar Seri Begawan  Brunei  The country s new penal code is  barbaric to the core  imposing archaic punishments for acts that shouldn t even be crimes   the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch said CreditAgence France Presse   Getty ImagesInternational protest delayed its implementation at the time  but in deciding recently to put the law into effect  with some revisions  Brunei has stood defiant Brunei  is a sovereign Islamic and fully independent country and  like all other independent countries  enforces its own rule of laws   the prime minister s office said in a statement on Saturday Shariah   apart from criminalizing and deterring acts that are against the teachings of Islam   the statement added   also aims to educate  respect and protect the legitimate rights of all individuals  society or nationality of any faiths and race  Rachel Chhoa Howard  a Brunei researcher at Amnesty International  said in a statement that the country  must immediately halt its plans to implement these vicious punishments  and revise its penal code in compliance with its human rights obligations  Beginning on Wednesday  extramarital sex  anal sex  and abortion are to be punished by death by stoning  The death penalty will also be required for some other offenses  including rape and some forms of blasphemy or heresy  like ridiculing the Quran or insulting the Prophet Muhammad The law requires amputation of a hand or foot for some crimes  and whipping for others  The punishment for lesbian sex  previously imprisonment and a fine  is now to be 40 lashes In some cases  the harshest penalties apply only to Muslims  in other cases  they apply regardless of faith ImageHotel Bel Air in Los Angeles  which is owned by the Brunei government  Celebrities including George Clooney  Ellen DeGeneres  and Elton John have called for a boycott of the country s interests CreditFrederic J  Brown Agence France Presse   Getty ImagesThe punishments apply to many people who would be considered minors in the West  Anyone who has reached puberty is treated as an adult   while younger children who are old enough to understand right and wrong may be flogged Human Rights Watch suggested on Wednesday that Brunei s new penal code violated global prohibitions against torture and other mistreatment  adding that adultery and homosexuality were protected against the death penalty by international law Michelle Bachelet  the high commissioner for human rights for the United Nations  also weighed in  In reality  no judiciary in the world can claim to be mistake free  and evidence shows that the death penalty is disproportionately applied against people who are already vulnerable  with a high risk of miscarriages of justice   she said in a statement on Monday  She urged Brunei to  maintain its de facto moratorium on the use of capital punishment  The death penalty is a legal form of punishment in Brunei  but the last execution was carried out in 1957  However  a defendant was sentenced to death in 2017  according to Amnesty International On Tuesday  the United States joined other countries including Britain  France and Germany in condemning the new penalties  The United States strongly opposes violence  criminalization  and discrimination targeting vulnerable groups  including women at risk of violence  religious and ethnic minorities  and lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender and intersex persons   Robert Palladino  deputy spokesman for the State Department  said in a statement High profile celebrities such as George Clooney  Ellen DeGeneres  and Elton John have called for a boycott of luxury hotels owned by Brunei  including the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles  and the Dorchester in London  On this particular April 3rd  the nation of Brunei will begin stoning and whipping to death any of its citizens that are proved to be gay   Mr  Clooney wrote in an opinion piece published by Deadline last week   Let that sink in   

JAKARTA  Indonesia   When a new Boeing 737 Max 8 plunged into the waters off Indonesia last October  a terrifying mystery confronted the aviation industry  What could have caused Lion Air Flight 610  flown by experienced pilots in good weather  to fall out of the sky just 12 minutes after takeoff But it took the second  equally terrifying crash of an identical aircraft under similar conditions five months later  in Ethiopia  to reveal the climate of mistrust that has plagued inquiries into what caused the first disaster Interviews with government officials  aviation experts and company executives portray an environment in which Lion Air  Boeing  subcontractors  investigators and regulators erected walls to sharing information that seemed designed more for self preservation than finding the truth about a crash that claimed 189 lives As each party involved in the crash focused on passing the blame  rather than trading information about the Max s new anti stall system or disseminating important details about the investigation  airlines  passengers and even Indonesian regulators were left in the dark Indonesia s top aviation regulatory official said both Boeing and the United States Federal Aviation Administration  which certified the Max 8  were slow in responding to requests for help in determining the safety of other Max planes flown by Indonesian carriers Reached for comment  the F A A  said   We are supporting the investigation and in constant contact with Indonesian civil aviation authorities   Boeing declined to comment Executives from Lion Air  a low cost carrier with powerful political backers  have essentially gone into hiding  Lion Air s safety director told The New York Times he could not accept an interview because of an agreement with Boeing ImageStudents paying tribute to the victims at the scene where an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 jet crashed in March CreditMulugeta Ayene Associated PressIt is not yet clear whether the Ethiopian Airlines crash  in which all 157 people onboard died on March 10  could have been prevented if information had been shared more transparently and quickly after the Lion Air accident  Nor is it certain whether the two new Max jets suffered from the exact same problems  although officials believe that the pilots of both planes struggled with an automated stall prevention system that was introduced in the Max  Here s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes  and what Boeing has been doing since  But the lack of trust and recriminations that have afflicted the inquiry into Flight 610 almost certainly slowed the setting of safety standards for the Max  which remains grounded across the world since last month  Lifesaving lessons are only life saving if we learn from them   said Charles Herrmann  a lawyer representing some families of Lion Air victims in a suit against Boeing   It s absolutely inexcusable that it takes another crash for people to kick this investigation into high gear  The Max is the fastest selling plane in Boeing s history  and thousands of these jetliners are still on order  Carriers worldwide will have to decide whether Boeing s proposed fixes will satisfy their safety requirements and placate worried consumers  Our passengers  psychologically  they don t trust flying with the Max anymore   said Ikhsan Rosan  the spokesman for Garuda Indonesia  the national carrier  after it became the first airline to announce that it wanted to cancel its order of Max 8 jets Pilots and airlines have complained that they were not informed about the existence of the anti stall system  called MCAS  Investigators suspect that in the case of Lion Air Flight 610  and later in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302  errant data mistakenly triggered MCAS  sending the plane into a fatal nose dive In 12 Minutes  Everything Went WrongHow the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control In November  Haryo Satmiko  the deputy chief of Indonesia s National Transportation Safety Committee  known as KNKT  recounted confusing conversations he was having with Boeing employees who had arrived in Jakarta  Mr  Haryo said he brought up whether inaccurate data readings could have prompted Flight 610 s sudden descent What Mr  Haryo was describing  though he did not know it at the time  was a malfunction of MCAS  which automatically forces the plane s nose down if data indicates that the jet is angled too sharply upward and might stall Nurcahyo Utomo  the head of the safety group s air accident subcommittee  said he first learned of the term MCAS from news reports  People immediately assumed this was a Lion Air problem  an issue with a terrible Indonesian airline   said Gerry Soejatman  an Indonesian aviation analyst   But when a brand new plane crashes  you have to look at all the factors  including the possibility of a manufacturer problem or defect  And you have to look really carefully when that manufacturer isn t providing all the answers  Days after Flight 610 crashed  Polana Pramesti  the head of Indonesia s civil aviation authority  waited for visiting Boeing and F A A  officials to talk to her  As head of Indonesia s version of the F A A   she wanted advice on whether to ground Max 8 jets in Indonesia  But the Americans  who did spend time with transportation safety committee officials  never came to her  she said The official in her office in charge of airworthiness and aircraft operation  Avirianto  who like many Indonesians goes by one name  fired off messages to the F A A  asking for an explanation of MCAS  which at the time was only vaguely understood  even by aviation experts  because Boeing had failed to put information about it in the plane s manual Although he conducted four teleconferences with F A A  officials  Mr  Avirianto said he was never given a clear explanation of how MCAS worked or whether it was safe   They kept saying they were still analyzing  evaluating   he said   We never received any guidance because there were never any clear answers for us  ImageBoeing 737 Max 8 planes at the Boeing plant in Renton  Wash  Boeing and the F A A  have come under scrutiny since the crash of two Max jets CreditRuth Fremson The New York TimesThe F A A  disagrees  saying that it had briefed the Indonesians  on several of the advisories and airworthiness directives on the Boeing 737 Max accidents issued to civilian aviation authorities and operators globally  But Ms  Polana said   I think they are protecting Boeing   The F A A  was the one that certified the aircraft safe to fly   she said   And then they found  no  the aircraft is dangerous  Ms  Polana also sent a letter to Boeing in November  asking for guarantees about the Max  But Boeing was not forthcoming  either  she said   Of course  we were worried   Ms  Polana said   We wanted reassurance that the Boeing 737 Max 8s in Indonesia are airworthy  Boeing and the F A A  have come under scrutiny since the Lion Air crash  The United States Department of Transportation is examining the F A A  s certification of the Max model  amid revelations that Boeing employees may have facilitated that process Only after the Ethiopian Airlines crash  Ms  Polana said  did the F A A  and Boeing become more responsive  On March 22  she had her inaugural teleconference with F A A  officials   the first time Indonesian officials received a precise explanation of how MCAS worked and how Boeing was planning to fix it  they said For days before the Oct  29 Lion Air crash  the airplane had experienced faulty data readings  But no one understood that these problems could force the plane into a sudden and bewildering plunge  The plane s handbook had no clear fix  and Mr  Avirianto was alarmed to find that a new Max flight simulator in Singapore did not simulate MCAS In the days after the crash  American aviation officials visiting Jakarta cast aspersions on their Indonesian counterparts  even as they refused to speak on the record  Which was more reliable  An airplane manufacturer that was one of the most respected companies in the United States  or a low cost carrier with a long history of shocking safety lapses operating in a country troubled by corruption and weak regulation ImageFamilies of victims of the Lion Air crash at a meeting with government and airline officials in Jakarta  Indonesia  last year CreditUlet Ifansasti Getty ImagesAnd as the spotlight intensified after the crash of Flight 610  Lion Air s executives retreated from view Last month  Daniel Putut  Lion Air s director of safety and security  told The New York Times that he could not accept an interview because of a nondisclosure agreement with Boeing   Such agreements are not unusual  but they do raise questions about transparency in an ongoing investigation  Indonesian investigators came under criticism  as well  Their preliminary report  released in late November  was marred by inconsistencies and incomplete information  aviation analysts said In one example  the report listed the various data problems that the plane had on its final flight  including a 20 degree differential in a pair of readings that are used to measure the possibility of a stall  Those readings come from angle of attack sensors on the plane s nose A faulty input of angle of attack data may have mistakenly triggered MCAS  Yet the preliminary report did not mention that on the second to last flight  the plane also recorded a 20 degree disparity between the two angle of attack readings   crucial context for determining what may have led to the crash Mr  Nurcahyo  the KNKT head of air accident investigations  said that before the second to last flight  engineers replaced the left angle of attack vane because the plane had suffered problems with data readings on three previous flights  Cold temperatures  he said  appeared to have caused the sensor to malfunction After the crash  the replaced angle of attack sensor was shipped to Minnesota  home of Rosemount Aerospace  the Boeing subcontractor that made it  Mr  Nurcahyo said  He and other Indonesian investigators went to Minneapolis in December  The sensor  he said  was deemed defective ImageRelatives of those who died in the October crash looked to identify personal items recovered from the site CreditUlet Ifansasti Getty ImagesUnited Technologies  the parent company of Rosemount  confirmed that it supplies Boeing with angle of attack sensors  But it declined to comment on the details of the Lion Air investigation  including whether its vanes had been found defective or whether the company had met with Indonesian investigators  Instead  it referred all questions to Boeing  They all say   My product is good     Mr  Nurcahyo said   That s what Boeing does  For Lion Air Flight 610  even after the vane was changed  the Max 8 continued to malfunction  producing an array of errant data  Some aviation experts believe the variety of airspeed problems points not to a defective sensor but a more fundamental problem with the processor that collects the data displayed in the cockpit  I don t think it s a vane failure  It makes no sense   said Bjorn Fehrm  an aeronautical engineer   It s more like a computer failure or a component failure  a system failure  The air data inertial reference unit is the processor that helps collect data from the probes and vanes on the plane  A malfunction in that system could be consistent with data inaccuracies that triggered MCAS  aviation experts said Mr  Nurcahyo acknowledged that Indonesian investigators were looking into the possibility of an issue with the air data inertial reference unit But if a processor glitch could have fatally triggered MCAS in Lion Air  then the attention thus far solely on the angle of attack sensors may have been a distraction for airlines desperate to gauge the safety of their Max planes In the days after the Ethiopian Airlines crash  the carrier s chief executive brought up both angle of attack sensors and MCAS in the context of the crash  He did not mention the air data inertial reference unit  Airplanes are very complex machines   said Mr  Soejatman  the Indonesian aviation consultant   If you don t have all the information that should be out there  how are you supposed to know how to fix them

Kenya and Tanzania In fact  hundreds of new to science species of plants and animals have been discovered in Vietnam during the last three decades  and more are recorded each year  The antelope like saola  for example  Its gentle  streaked face looks as if it has just escaped from a jungle dream painting by Henri Rousseau  Heralded as  the last unicorn  for its rarity  the saola is the largest land dwelling animal discovered anywhere since 1937  A small herd of long lost rhinos  a barking deer and a striped rabbit have also turned up  So has a giant  21 inch long walking stick insect  and many kinds of birds   laughing thrushes    fish  snakes and frogs hitherto unknown or thought to be extinct Vietnam s forests shelter two dozen species of primates   gibbons  macaques  lorises and langurs  often in colors that make the human tribe look banal by contrast  A promotional email I received from Cuc Phuong National Park was tantalizing   The ancient forest contains almost 2 000 species of trees and among them live some amazing and rare animals including the clouded leopard  Delacour s langur  Owston s civet  otters and Asian black bears    owls  flying squirrels  lorises  bats and cats  But in trying to make arrangements to visit  the travel fixers my wife and I contacted were oddly hesitant about natural areas and wildlife  and they kept nudging us back toward mere scenery  or to cities  And then this email   Have you been to Vietnam before  or know of the situation there  It s pretty dire if you are not aware   Dire for wildlife  Very much so  In Vietnam  national parks are primarily in name only  and poaching  often practiced by park rangers  and worse has decimated wildlife  Calls to conservation personnel who live and work in Vietnam reconciled the seeming contradictions  Yes  the country is an epicenter for wild species diversity  No  wildlife travel is not much pursued  and Vietnam has also become a world center for criminal wildlife trafficking Its wild populations  already hemmed in by habitat destruction because of an exploding human population  are also being shot  snared and live captured so efficiently that national parks and other natural areas are now mostly afflicted with  empty forest syndrome   suitable forest habitat from which even small animals and birds have been hunted into local extinction  Other Asian countries are in various stages of the same convulsion  It s frequently said that many new species vanish before science can even discover them  ImageHatinh langurs at the Endangered Primate Rescue

at risk CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesVietnam s decline is especially intense  For example  in a single remote national preserve set aside for the saola and other rare animals  23 000 cheap but fatally efficient wire snares were found in 2015  the most recent year tallied  Tens of thousands more of these snares are placed each year  as fast as they can be confiscated  Despite intensive surveys  no verifiable sighting of a saola has occurred since a photo was taken of one  six years ago  The last rhino was shot by poachers in the Cat Tien National Park in 2010  Tigers have been effectively hunted out of existence  Only tiny populations of bears and elephants hang on in small  vulnerable pockets  Nearly all of the many primate species are at risk of extinction          g 0407 tra webVIETNAMmap box     max width 600px       g 0407 tra webVIETNAMmap box  g artboard     margin 0 auto       g 0407 tra webVIETNAMmap box  g artboard p     margin 0

traditional medicine in Vietnam and neighboring China  Examples from a lengthy catalog of purported remedies include  tiger penises for impotence  bear bile for cancer  rhino horn for a hangover  loris bile to ease the serious airway infections that arise from Vietnam s air pollution Even more of the motivation  surveys have found   is to supply the rampant demand for wildlife meat in urban restaurants  which is very much a status issue   said Barney Long  director of species conservation for the nonprofit group Global Wildlife Conservation   This is not bush meat where poor people are hunting for food   he said   It s a status symbol to take your business or government colleagues out for a wildlife meal  And honestly it s on a scale that is mind boggling  We re talking not about one or two species  but whole communities of wildlife disappearing  After further scouting  my wife and I decided to go anyway  arranging to fly into Hanoi  in the north  and move quickly to Vietnam s green outback  Then we would head south to Ho Chi Minh City  the former Saigon  for a circuit of the parks and natural areas there Over the course of our two week trip  we found that some exquisite wild species hold out  though in threatened circumstances  And we were fortunate  if half willing  witnesses to the struggle by native Vietnamese  and their international conservation allies  to halt what amounts to animal genocide Cuc Phuong  the nation s first national park  is a couple of hours south of Hanoi  It was created in 1962 by Ho Chi Minh  who prophesied that  the current destruction of our forests will lead to serious effects on climate  productivity and life  The forest is gold  If we know how to conserve and manage it well  it will be very valuable   But despite the blandishments in that government issued invitation to the park we d received  there are no more Delacour s langurs in these forests  nor any other kind  No bears  leopards or smaller cats either  unless they are so well hidden that even scientists cannot find them  Adam Davies  director of the Endangered Primate Rescue Center  told me  Instead  the richest collection of rare animals can be found along a quiet narrow park road lined by animal rescue centers that amounts to a kind of conservation superhighway  At the Primate Rescue Center  visitors can see four species of nearly extinct langurs  also called leaf eating monkeys   gibbons and lorises  many of which were rescued from wildlife traffickers  They are doctored back to health  bred when possible  and in especially fortunate circumstances  are returned to the wild  Poachers make the rest of this national park too hostile a landscape to risk releasing most kinds of animals  Mr  Davies said ImageThe Bich Dong Pagoda in Tam Coc  The surrounding area is rich in birdlife  but development is a threat CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesA few steps away are two other rescue centers  One protects dozens of species of turtles  many of striking beauty  all of them endangered  The other is for confiscated leopard cats  civets  the binturong or bearcat   which has been compared to a dust mop that smells like fresh popcorn   and the pangolin  an armadillo like animal whose meat and scales can command  500 a pound on the menus or in the folk cure apothecaries of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City   Pangolin is currently the world s most trafficked mammal  which is a very unwanted title   Mr  Davies said His center reintroduced some critically endangered Delacour s langurs to the wild in the Van Long Wetland Nature Reserve  about 90 minutes down the road  There we boarded a small rowboat at a landing  plied by one of a cluster of local guides  for a half day float within a protected gorge We veered off  along a route no one else in the pack of boats had taken  The langurs  now breeding successfully somewhere out there  stayed hidden  That s the nature of such quests  of course  Enjoy the pretty sojourn  even if your quarry eludes you  Maybe all those other little boats had gone in a better direction Then heading back we heard shouts from a farmer  off in the brush  He was pointing excitedly at some shaking trees on the opposite shore  A rowdy group of 10 langurs ultimately emerged   this species is black with what look like mutton chop side whiskers and white pants   and we spent most of a transfixed hour watching them groom and chase and bask in the intense subtropical sun  With luck  they ll continue to be protected here and not become fodder for the meat or pet trades To see bears  we drove to Tam Dao National Park  high on a long ridge north of Hanoi  A resort town within the park bristles with construction cranes and heavy backhoes  part of the national building boom In the valley below is a bear sanctuary operated by Animals Asia and sometimes open to visitors  We watched two species   moon bears and the smaller sun bears   romp  swim and climb within a specially constructed recreation habitat  Both look like wild haired  punk rock versions of North American black bears and have vivid white chevron collars  They have arrived here from bear bile farms where they live in cruelly close confinement  as their bile is repeatedly extracted until they expire ImageThe future of the birds and wildlife in Thung Nham Bird Park  above  may depend on a construction project in the area CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesThe practice is now illegal  though loopholes make the law difficult to enforce  said Tuan Bendixsen  the director of the center   Bear bile extraction is still going on   he said   You can still buy it down in Hanoi if you want to  Many of the bears he gets  are missing limbs  or are damaged in other ways   he said  which makes their chances for return to the wild slender  And suitable wild land for such releases is increasingly rare  he said  as the human population and the national economy grow The corruption that afflicts Vietnam s one party government  along with the growing economy  are major factors in the disappearance of natural habitat and endangered species  Corruption was given as a major reason for weak protections and slack enforcement by the conservation groups we spoke with  More on animal conservationWar s Other Victims  AnimalsOver decades  armed conflict has reduced animal populations in Africa more than any other factor  according to new research Jan  12  2018 There are issues with corruption in all segments of Vietnamese society  and forest protection is no different   said Andrew Tilker  an American field researcher who tracks the saola and other rare species Some courageous officials push back  and both homegrown and international conservation groups can cite successes  But the consensus view is that the wider prospect for Vietnam s wild species is quickly deteriorating  The country s government has earned a corruption ranking from the group Transparency International that could be charitably summarized as  dismal  We witnessed that clash of aspirations during a stay near Ninh Binh  a couple of hours south of Hanoi  There we had found the loveliest lodging of our trip   and the competition was keen   at a place called Tam Coc Gardens  It s a few stone bungalows hidden within a lush landscape  ringed by colossal limestone rock formations and plateaus we had only seen in watercolor paintings  We had picked the place because it is a half hour bike ride from the Thung Nham Bird Park  We rolled into the park one late afternoon and wondered if we had somehow lost the way  Though touted as an  ecological  destination  the park has been taken over by a tourism corporation with big plans  We walked past broad lawns and wide lakes fringed with forest  all heavily manicured and completely bereft of bird life  On the near shore  jackhammers  chain saws and grinding trucks battered the air in the ambitious expansion of a lakeside resort   not well calculated for maintaining bird habitat ImageA red eared slider turtle at the Turtle Conservation Center in Cuc Phuong National Park CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesImageMuch of the wildlife in Cuc Phuong National Park has disappeared CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesAt length  we located a boat shed and found a woman with a traditional conical hat and a big oar  For a small fee she rowed us and three other passengers out onto the barren looking lake and toward a wall of bamboo  Stow the binoculars  No birds to see  or hear  Maybe it was just the weather Ten minutes in  we began to hear what sounded like an agitated conversation among members of the world s biggest book group  somewhere out of view  Then our boat glided into a rookery with hundreds of herons and storks  each one as big as a 2 year old child  perched  preening or at times filling the sky overhead  It was a delight  but its future may depend on that construction project  and whether the solemn  barren seeming lakes next door are symptomatic of how this landscape will be managed Vietnam is not alone in failing to protect its wild species  of course  In the United States  many of our own  protected  animals are being pushed nearer the edge  Initiatives from the Trump administration have rolled back the designation of some national monuments and would weaken the Endangered Species Act 52 Places to Go in 2019A starter kit for escaping into the world Jan  8  2019If there s hope for Vietnam s natural heritage  we learned  some of it resides with creative  sometimes courageous conservation groups like Education for Nature Vietnam  They push research  criminal investigations  political fights and legal maneuvers forward  Those bring risk  Another source of hope for Vietnam lies in engaging local communities in wildlife protection with economic incentives  The World Wildlife Fund  for example  sponsors sustainable rattan and acacia farming as buffer zones for beleaguered natural preserves along the western border with Laos  In other places  environmental groups pay local people a living wage to patrol the rain forest and collect those thousands of deadly snares Tourism  growing quickly in Vietnam  can also sustain wild areas  though only if it is carefully managed  International tourism arrivals neared 15 5 million in 2018   a startling 64 percent jump above the 2016 figure  which explains the forest of construction cranes we saw ringing the shoreline at the far end of Halong Bay  as high rise hotels surge into Cat Ba National Park s environs  They  in turn  explain the habitat fragmentation and near extinction of the Cat Ba langur and other species that used to inhabit this landscape  About 60 of the animals remain in isolated populations  where feeding and breeding options are nearly foreclosed  In the 1960s  there were some 3 000 We headed south toward Ho Chi Minh City and from there I took a solo trip  riding three or four hours north to spend a couple of days in Cat Tien National Park  On a sweltering afternoon  a dapper young park ranger led a couple of us on a two hour  wildlife trek   This time we really were in a silent forest The only thing we encountered were squadrons of dry ground leeches  They found us very quickly  Blood blossoms appeared on my socks as I stooped to pick the creatures off my ankles   The ranger was wearing high boots   ImageMurphy  a male sun bear at the Bear Rescue Center in Tam Dao National Park  The bile of sun bears is considered a remedy for cancer  such remedies are decimating certain animal populations CreditDavid Rama Terrazas Morales for The New York TimesThe Dao Tien Endangered Primate Species Centre  on an island a few minutes downriver  can show visitors several species  including gloriously exuberant gibbons that careen through the high tree canopy  At times they commence a sudden  nearly deafening concert  It sounds like a symphony of demented slide whistles  sirens and the world s loudest theremins  Gibbon song betrays the locations of these  our kindred species  to hunters in the national park across the river  They are sometimes shot out of the trees over there  and sold to be eaten in the cities Park rangers and others I spoke with at Cat Tien affirmed that its animal populations are declining  that some rangers have been caught colluding with hunters to bring down high value animals  though they are said to be severely dealt with   and that the rangers earn something like  200 a month to start  which makes this a less lucrative career option   and poaching an attractive one I stayed at the edge of the park in the well appointed Cat Tien Jungle Lodge  Its proprietors  Duong Thi Ngoc Phuong and Gary Leong  work to help protect Cat Tien from mass tourism and to build economic ties with impoverished local communities to dissuade them from poaching   Without the animals  there is little reason for the park s existence   Mr  Leong said   We have to give everyone a stake in protecting them  That means  at least in part  creating economic incentives for local people to preserve native species in their natural habitats  And it needs to start soon  wildlife advocates say   Every day we all wake up and say   do we have time  Do any of these species have time  Are we just fighting a war that we ve already lost    said Quyen Vu  the executive director of Education for Nature Vietnam   But if we don t fight  then we definitely have lost  Stephen Nash is the author of  Grand Canyon for Sale
